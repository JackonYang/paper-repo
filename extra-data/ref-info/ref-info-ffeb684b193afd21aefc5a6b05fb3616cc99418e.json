We use the semantics of image labels to integrate prior knowledge about inter-class relationships into the visual appearance learning. We show how to build and train a semantic hierarchy of discriminative classifiers and how to use it to perform object detection. We evaluate how our approach influences the classification accuracy and speed on the Pascal VOC challenge 2006 dataset, a set of challenging real-world images. We also demonstrate additional features that become available to object recognition due to the extension with semantic inference tools- we can classify high-level categories, such as animals, and we can train part detectors, for example a window detector, by pure inference in the semantic network."

Such data is useful for supervised learning and quantitative evaluation. To achieve this, we developed a web-based tool that allows easy image annotation and instant sharing of such annotations. Using this annotation tool, we have collected a large dataset that spans many object categories, often containing multiple instances over a wide variety of images. We quantify the contents of the dataset and compare against existing state of the art datasets used for object recognition and detection. Also, we show how to extend the dataset to automatically enhance object labels with WordNet, discover object parts, recover a depth ordering of objects in a scene, and increase the number of labels using minimal user supervision and images from the web.\n"

Our approach can handle the high intra-class variability and large proportion of unrelated images returned by search engines. We evaluate tire models on standard test sets, showing performance competitive with existing methods trained on hand prepared datasets"

We develop a new method for transfer learning which exploits available unlabeled data and an arbitrary kernel function; we form a representation based on kernel distances to a large set of unlabeled data points. To transfer knowledge from previous related problems we observe that a category might be learnable using only a small subset of reference prototypes. Related problems may share a significant number of relevant prototypes; we find such a concise representation by performing a joint loss minimization over the training sets of related problems with a shared regularization penalty that minimizes the total number of prototypes involved in the approximation. This optimization problem can be formulated as a linear program that can be solved efficiently. We conduct experiments on a news-topic prediction task where the goal is to predict whether an image belongs to a particular news topic. Our results show that when only few examples are available for training a target topic, leveraging knowledge learnt from other topics can significantly improve performance."

We show that it is possible to learn much information about a category from just one, or a handful, of images. The key insight is that, rather than learning from scratch, one can take advantage of knowledge coming from previously learned categories, no matter how different these categories might be. We explore a Bayesian implementation of this idea. Object categories are represented by probabilistic models. Prior knowledge is represented as a probability density function on the parameters of these models. The posterior model for an object category is obtained by updating the prior in the light of one or more observations. We test a simple implementation of our algorithm on a database of 101 diverse object categories. We compare category models learned by an implementation of our Bayesian approach to models learned from by maximum likelihood (ML) and maximum a posteriori (MAP) methods. We find that on a database of more than 100 categories, the Bayesian approach produces informative models when the number of training examples is too small for other methods to operate successfully."

Our aims are to enable models for new categories to benefit from the detectors built previously for other categories, and for the complexity of the multiclass system to grow sublinearly with the number of categories. To this end we introduce a visual alphabet representation which can be learnt incrementally, and explicitly shares boundary fragments (contours) and spatial configurations (relation to centroid) across object categories. We develop a learning algorithm with the following novel contributions: (i) AdaBoost is adapted to learn jointly, based on shape features; (ii) a new learning schedule enables incremental additions of new categories; and (iii) the algorithm learns to detect objects (instead of categorizing images). Furthermore, we show that category similarities can be predicted from the alphabet. We obtain excellent experimental results on a variety of complex categories over several visual aspects. We show that the sharing of shape features not only reduces the number of features required per category, but also often improves recognition performance, as compared to individual detectors which are trained on a per-class basis."

ImageNet aims to populate the majority of the 80,000 synsets of WordNet with an average of 500-1000 clean and full resolution images. This will result in tens of millions of annotated images organized by the semantic hierarchy of WordNet. This paper offers a detailed analysis of ImageNet in its current state: 12 subtrees with 5247 synsets and 3.2 million images in total. We show that ImageNet is much larger in scale and diversity and much more accurate than the current image datasets. Constructing such a large-scale database is a challenging task. We describe the data collection scheme with Amazon Mechanical Turk. Lastly, we illustrate the usefulness of ImageNet through three simple applications in object recognition, image classification and automatic object clustering. We hope that the scale, accuracy, diversity and hierarchical structure of ImageNet can offer unparalleled opportunities to researchers in the computer vision community and beyond."

Traditional approaches require applying a battery of different classifiers to the image, which can be slow and require much training data. We present a multi-class boosting procedure (joint boosting) that reduces both the computational and sample complexity, by finding common features that can be shared across the classes. The detectors for each class are trained jointly, rather than independently. For a given performance level, the total number of features required is observed to scale approximately logarithmically with the number of classes. In addition, we find that the features selected by independently trained classifiers are often specific to the class, whereas the features selected by the jointly trained classifiers are more generic features, such as lines and edges."

Using a variety of non-parametric methods, we explore this world with the aid of a large dataset of 79,302,017 images collected from the Internet. Motivated by psychophysical results showing the remarkable tolerance of the human visual system to degradations in image resolution, the images in the dataset are stored as 32 x 32 color images. Each image is loosely labeled with one of the 75,062 non-abstract nouns in English, as listed in the Wordnet lexical database. Hence the image database gives a comprehensive coverage of all object categories and scenes. The semantic information from Wordnet can be used in conjunction with nearest-neighbor methods to perform object classification over a range of semantic levels minimizing the effects of labeling noise.

These images come with varying degrees of label information. \"Clean labels\" can be manually obtained on a small fraction, \"noisy labels\" may be extracted automatically from surrounding text, while for most images there are no labels at all. Semi-supervised learning is a principled framework for combining these different label sources. However, it scales polynomially with the number of images, making it impractical for use on gigantic collections with hundreds of millions of images and thousands of classes. In this paper we show how to utilize recent results in machine learning to obtain highly efficient approximations for semi-supervised learning that are linear in the number of images. Specifically, we use the convergence of the eigenvectors of the normalized graph Laplacian to eigenfunctions of weighted Laplace-Beltrami operators. Our algorithm enables us to apply semi-supervised learning to a database of 80 million images gathered from the Internet."

The model is based on a set of parts which describe the expected appearance and position, in an object centered coordinate frame, of features detected by a low-level interest operator. Each object category then has its own distribution over these parts, which are shared between objects. We learn the parameters of this model via a Gibbs sampler which uses the graphical model's structure to analytically average over many parameters. Applied to a database of images of isolated objects, the sharing of parts among objects improves detection accuracy when few training examples are available. We also extend this hierarchical framework to scenes containing multiple objects"

It is, in principle, an excellent dataset for unsupervised training of deep generative models, but previous researchers who have tried this have found it dicult to learn a good set of lters from the images. We show how to train a multi-layer generative model that learns to extract meaningful features which resemble those found in the human visual cortex. Using a novel parallelization algorithm to distribute the work among multiple machines connected on a network, we show how training such a model can be done in reasonable time. A second problematic aspect of the tiny images dataset is that there are no reliable class labels which makes it hard to use for object recognition experiments. We created two sets of reliable labels. The CIFAR-10 set has 6000 examples of each of 10 classes and the CIFAR-100 set has 600 examples of each of 100 non-overlapping classes. Using these labels, we show that object recognition is signicantly improved by pre-training a layer of features on a large set of unlabeled tiny images."

One of the biproducts of this minimization is a set of transform, one associated with each original training sample.

The images we classify depict animals in a wide range of aspects, configurations and appearances. In addition, the images typically portray multiple species that differ in appearance (e.g. ukari\u2019s, vervet monkeys, spider monkeys, rhesus monkeys, etc.). Our method is accurate despite this variation and relies on four simple cues: text, color, shape and texture. Visual cues are evaluated by a voting method that compares local image phenomena with a number of visual exemplars for the category. The visual exemplars are obtained using a clustering method applied to text on web pages. The only supervision required involves identifying which clusters of exemplars refer to which sense of a term (for example, \"monkey\" can refer to an animal or a bandmember). Because our method is applied to web pages with free text, the word cue is extremely noisy. We show unequivocal evidence that visual information improves performance for our task. Our method allows us to produce large, accurate and challenging visual datasets mostly automatically."

Interest in SSL has increased in recent years, particularly because of application domains in which unlabeled data are plentiful, such as images, text, and bioinformatics. This first comprehensive overview of SSL presents state-of-the-art algorithms, a taxonomy of the field, selected applications, benchmark experiments, and perspectives on ongoing and future research. Semi-Supervised Learning first presents the key assumptions and ideas underlying the field: smoothness, cluster or low-density separation, manifold structure, and transduction. The core of the book is the presentation of SSL methods, organized according to algorithmic strategies. After an examination of generative models, the book describes algorithms that implement the low-density separation assumption, graph-based methods, and algorithms that perform two-step learning. The book then discusses SSL applications and offers guidelines for SSL practitioners by analyzing the results of extensive benchmark experiments. Finally, the book looks at interesting directions for SSL research. The book closes with a discussion of the relationship between semi-supervised learning and transduction.

In this method, experience with already learned classes is used to facilitate the learning of novel classes. Our classification scheme employs features that discriminate between class and non-class images. For a novel class, new features are derived by selecting features that proved useful for already learned classification tasks, and adapting these features to the new classification task. This adaptation is performed by replacing the features from already learned classes with similar features taken from the novel class. A single example of a novel class is sufficient to perform feature adaptation and achieve useful classification performance. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can learn a novel class from a single training example, using 10 additional familiar classes. The performance is significantly improved compared to using no feature adaptation. The robustness of the proposed feature adaptation concept is demonstrated by similar performance gains across 107 widely varying object categories."

Labeled and unlabeled data are represented as vertices in a weighted graph, with edge weights encoding the similarity between instances. The learning problem is then formulated in terms of a Gaussian random field on this graph, where the mean of the field is characterized in terms of harmonic functions, and is efficiently obtained using matrix methods or belief propagation. The resulting learning algorithms have intimate connections with random walks, electric networks, and spectral graph theory. We discuss methods to incorporate class priors and the predictions of classifiers obtained by supervised learning. We also propose a method of parameter learning by entropy minimization, and show the algorithm's ability to perform feature selection. Promising experimental results are presented for synthetic data, digit classification, and text classification tasks."

It does this by learning tasks in parallel while using a shared representation; what is learned for each task can help other tasks be learned better. This paper reviews prior work on MTL, presents new evidence that MTL in backprop nets discovers task relatedness without the need of supervisory signals, and presents new results for MTL with k-nearest neighbor and kernel regression. In this paper we demonstrate multitask learning in three domains. We explain how multitask learning works, and show that there are many opportunities for multitask learning in real domains. We present an algorithm and results for multitask learning with case-based methods like k-nearest neighbor and kernel regression, and sketch an algorithm for multitask learning in decision trees. Because multitask learning works, can be applied to many different kinds of domains, and can be used with different learning algorithms, we conjecture there will be many opportunities for its use on real-world problems."

Existing factor models (Mardia, Kent, & Bibby, 1979; Hinton & Zemel, 1994; Ghahramani, 1995; Bell & Sejnowski, 1995; Hinton, Dayan, Frey, & Neal, 1995; Dayan, Hinton, Neal, & Zemel, 1995; Hinton & Ghahramani, 1997) are either insufficiently rich to capture the complex interactions of perceptually meaningful factors such as phoneme and speaker accent or letter and font, or do not allow efficient learning algorithms. We present a general framework for learning to solve two-factor tasks using bilinear models, which provide sufficiently expressive representations of factor interactions but can nonetheless be fit to data using efficient algorithms based on the singular value decomposition and expectation-maximization. We report promising results on three different tasks in three different perceptual domains: spoken vowel classification with a benchmark multi-speaker database, extrapolation of fonts to unseen letters, and translation of faces to novel illuminants."

                "text": "Multiclass learning problems involve finding a definition for an unknown function f(x) whose range is a discrete set containing k > 2 values (i.e., k \"classes\"). The definition is acquired by studying collections of training examples of the form (xi, f(xi)). Existing approaches to multiclass learning problems include direct application of multiclass algorithms such as the decision-tree algorithms C4.5 and CART, application of binary concept learning algorithms to learn individual binary functions for each of the k classes, and application of binary concept learning algorithms with distributed output representations. This paper compares these three approaches to a new technique in which error-correcting codes are employed as a distributed output representation. We show that these output representations improve the generalization performance of both C4.5 and backpropagation on a wide range of multiclass learning tasks. We also demonstrate that this approach is robust with respect to changes in the size of the training sample, the assignment of distributed representations to particular classes, and the application of overfitting avoidance techniques such as decision-tree pruning. Finally, we show that--like the other methods--the error-correcting code technique can provide reliable class probability estimates. Taken together, these results demonstrate that error-correcting output codes provide a general-purpose method for improving the performance of inductive learning programs on multiclass problems."

This gave rise to a new class of theoretically elegant learning machines that use a central concept of SVMs\u0097-kernels--for a number of learning tasks. Kernel machines provide a modular framework that can be adapted to different tasks and domains by the choice of the kernel function and the base algorithm. They are replacing neural networks in a variety of fields, including engineering, information retrieval, and bioinformatics. \nLearning with Kernels provides an introduction to SVMs and related kernel methods. Although the book begins with the basics, it also includes the latest research. It provides all of the concepts necessary to enable a reader equipped with some basic mathematical knowledge to enter the world of machine learning using theoretically well-founded yet easy-to-use kernel algorithms and to understand and apply the powerful algorithms that have been developed over the last few years."

The fundamental assumption of the proposed theory, recognition-by-components (RBC), is that a modest set of generalized-cone components, called geons (N \u00a3 36), can be derived from contrasts of five readily detectable properties of edges in a two-dimensiona l image: curvature, collinearity, symmetry, parallelism, and cotermination. The detection of these properties is generally invariant over viewing position an$ image quality and consequently allows robust object perception when the image is projected from a novel viewpoint or is degraded. RBC thus provides a principled account of the heretofore undecided relation between the classic principles of perceptual organization and pattern recognition: The constraints toward regularization (Pragnanz) characterize not the complete object but the object's components. Representational power derives from an allowance of free combinations of the geons. A Principle of Componential Recovery can account for the major phenomena of object recognition: If an arrangement of two or three geons can be recovered from the input, objects can be quickly recognized even when they are occluded, novel, rotated in depth, or extensively degraded. The results from experiments on the perception of briefly presented pictures by human observers provide empirical support for the theory. Any single object can project an infinity of image configurations to the retina. The orientation of the object to the viewer can vary continuously, each giving rise to a different two-dimensional projection. The object can be occluded by other objects or texture fields, as when viewed behind foliage. The object need not be presented as a full-colored textured image but instead can be a simplified line drawing. Moreover, the object can even be missing some of its parts or be a novel exemplar of its particular category. But it is only with rare exceptions that an image fails to be rapidly and readily classified, either as an instance of a familiar object category or as an instance that cannot be so classified (itself a form of classification)."

Given an appropriate network architecture, gradient-based learning algorithms can be used to synthesize a complex decision surface that can classify high-dimensional patterns, such as handwritten characters, with minimal preprocessing. This paper reviews various methods applied to handwritten character recognition and compares them on a standard handwritten digit recognition task. Convolutional neural networks, which are specifically designed to deal with the variability of 2D shapes, are shown to outperform all other techniques. Real-life document recognition systems are composed of multiple modules including field extraction, segmentation recognition, and language modeling. A new learning paradigm, called graph transformer networks (GTN), allows such multimodule systems to be trained globally using gradient-based methods so as to minimize an overall performance measure. Two systems for online handwriting recognition are described. Experiments demonstrate the advantage of global training, and the flexibility of graph transformer networks. A graph transformer network for reading a bank cheque is also described. It uses convolutional neural network character recognizers combined with global training techniques to provide record accuracy on business and personal cheques. It is deployed commercially and reads several million cheques per day."

After introducing the basic concepts of neurons and artificial neuron learning rules in Chapter 2, Chapter 3 describes a particular formalism, based on signal-plus-noise, for the learning problem in general. After presenting the basic neural network types this chapter reviews the principal algorithms for error function minimization/optimization and shows how these learning issues are addressed in various supervised models. Chapter 4 deals with issues in unsupervised learning networks, such as the Hebbian learning rule, principal component learning, and learning vector quantization. Various techniques and learning paradigms are covered in Chapters 3\u20136, and especially the properties and relative merits of the multilayer perceptron networks, radial basis function networks, self-organizing feature maps and reinforcement learning are discussed in the respective four chapters. Chapter 7 presents an in-depth examination of performance issues in supervised learning, such as accuracy, complexity, convergence, weight initialization, architecture selection, and active learning. Par III (Chapters 8\u201315) offers an extensive presentation of techniques and issues in evolutionary computing. Besides the introduction to the basic concepts in evolutionary computing, it elaborates on the more important and most frequently used techniques on evolutionary computing paradigm, such as genetic algorithms, genetic programming, evolutionary programming, evolutionary strategies, differential evolution, cultural evolution, and co-evolution, including design aspects, representation, operators and performance issues of each paradigm. The differences between evolutionary computing and classical optimization are also explained. Part IV (Chapters 16 and 17) introduces swarm intelligence. It provides a representative selection of recent literature on swarm intelligence in a coherent and readable form. It illustrates the similarities and differences between swarm optimization and evolutionary computing. Both particle swarm optimization and ant colonies optimization are discussed in the two chapters, which serve as a guide to bringing together existing work to enlighten the readers, and to lay a foundation for any further studies. Part V (Chapters 18\u201321) presents fuzzy systems, with topics ranging from fuzzy sets, fuzzy inference systems, fuzzy controllers, to rough sets. The basic terminology, underlying motivation and key mathematical models used in the field are covered to illustrate how these mathematical tools can be used to handle vagueness and uncertainty. This book is clearly written and it brings together the latest concepts in computational intelligence in a friendly and complete format for undergraduate/postgraduate students as well as professionals new to the field. With about 250 pages covering such a wide variety of topics, it would be impossible to handle everything at a great length. Nonetheless, this book is an excellent choice for readers who wish to familiarize themselves with computational intelligence techniques or for an overview/introductory course in the field of computational intelligence.
