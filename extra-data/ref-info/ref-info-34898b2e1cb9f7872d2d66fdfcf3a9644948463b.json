                "text": "In the central nervous system the visual pathway from retina to striate cortex provides an opportunity to observe and compare single unit responses at several distinct levels. Patterns of light stimuli most effective in influencing units at one level may no longer be the most effective at the next. From differences in responses at successive stages in the pathway one may hope to gain some understanding of the part each stage plays in visual perception. By shining small spots of light on the light-adapted cat retina Kuffler (1953) showed that ganglion cells have concentric receptive fields, with an 'on' centre and an 'off ' periphery, or vice versa. The 'on' and 'off' areas within a receptive field were found to be mutually antagonistic, and a spot restricted to the centre of the field was more effective than one covering the whole receptive field (Barlow, FitzHugh & Kuffler, 1957). In the freely moving lightadapted cat it was found that the great majority of cortical cells studied gave little or no response to light stimuli covering most of the animal's visual field, whereas small spots shone in a restricted retinal region often evoked brisk responses (Hubel, 1959). A moving spot of light often produced stronger responses than a stationary one, and sometimes a moving spot gave more activation for one direction than for the opposite. The present investigation, made in acute preparations, includes a study of receptive fields of cells in the cat's striate cortex. Receptive fields of the cells considered in this paper were divided into separate excitatory and inhibitory ('on' and 'off') areas. In this respect they resembled retinal ganglion-cell receptive fields. However, the shape and arrangement of excitatory and inhibitory areas differed strikingly from the concentric pattern found in retinal ganglion cells. An attempt was made to correlate responses to moving stimuli"

Most units responded either feebly or not at all to stimulation of the retina with diffuse light, but gave brisk responses to stationary or moving restricted spots of light. Responses to moving spots often varied with the direction of movement. It was clear that such responses must be the result of complex integrative mechanisms. The present study was undertaken to find out whether similar responses occur in retinal ganglion cells or cells of the dorsal lateral geniculate body. Lateral geniculate units have not previously been studied with restricted light stimulation, and although the cat's retinal ganglion cell has been extensively investigated by Kuffler and his co-workers (Kuffler, 1953; iKuffler, FitzHugh & Barlow, 1957), responses to moving spots were not examined. Thus it has not been possible to say whether the complex activity of cortical units originates in the cortex itself, or at lower levels. Methods for stereotaxic depth recordings in the unanaesthetized unrestrained animal were developed in order to make cortical and depth studies under similar conditions. These techniques make it possible to record from single units from virtually any part of the brain of the freely moving animal."

Both its complex anatomical structure (O'Leary, 1940; Clark, 1942; Walls, 1953) and the functional properties of its synapses, as revealed by electrical stimulation of the optic nerve (Bishop & Evans, 1956; Bishop, Burke & Davis, 1958, 1959; Bishop & Davis, 1960), suggest that this nucleus provides a site for integrative mechanisms. Brindley (1960) and Crescitelli (1960) have recently discussed the role of the lateral geniculate body. Hubel (1960), recording the responses of single geniculate units in conscious, unrestrained cats, found that the activity of the lateral geniculate body is modified by arousal; the organization of the receptive field, however, as seen in the retina, undergoes no change until the impulses reach the cortex. In the present study, of which preliminary communications have appeared (Erulkar & Fillenz, 1956, 1958), the responses of single units in the lateral geniculate body of cats anaesthetized with sodium pentobarbitone to diffuse light stimuli were studied. Variation in the light intensity and different combinations of binocular stimulation revealed the occurrence of some integration at the level of the lateral geniculate body."

All fields mapped with white light had a concentric arrangement sililar to that of the cat retinal ganglion cells, with a sharply demarcated 'on' centre surrounded by an antagonistic 'off' periphery, or the reverse. The smallest receptive field centres were found near the fovea, and the size of centres tended to increase with increasing distance from the fovea. The smallest centre had a diameter of 4 minutes of arc (corresponding to about 20 microns on the retina) and was located 4 degrees from the fovea; the largest centre had a diameter of 2 degrees. Three ganglion cells out of about 100 responded in a specific way to coloured stimuli. In these cells light of short wave-length produced an 'on' response and light of long wave-length evoked inhibition followed by an 'off' response. Transition between the two types of response occurred at about 500 millimicrons, light of this wave-length evoked only feebel 'off' responses. Very weak responses were obtained to white light, presumably owing to the antagonism between light of short and long wavelengths. (Author)"

Following orthodromic stimulation, the potentials recorded by the extracellular electrodes registered the net flow of current across the soma-dendritic membrane of the principal cell bodies. The current has three phases of flow away from the soma-dendritic membrane followed by a flow of current toward this membrane. The first component is ascribed to synaptic activity. Subsequent components are ascribed to the activity of the initial segment of the axon and a limited area of high threshold membrane on the soma. The evidence is interpreted as suggesting that most of the soma-dendritic membrane is excited synaptically to produce a postsynaptic potential, but is not excited electrically and does not produce a propagating spike."

                "text": "THE DISCHARGES carried in the optic nerve fibers contain all the information which the central nervous system receives from the retina. A correct interpretation of discharge patterns therefore constitutes an important step in the analysis of visual events. Further, investigations of nervous activity arising in the eye reveal many aspects of the functional organization of the neural elements within the retina itself. Following studies of discharges in the optic nerve of the eel\u2019s eye by Adrian and Matthews (2,3), Hartline and his colleagues described the discharge pattern in the eye of the Limulus in a series of important and lucid papers (for a summary see 20). In the Limulus the relationship between the stimulus to the primary receptor cell and the nerve discharges proved relatively simple, apparently because the connection between sense cell and nerve fiber was a direct one. Thus, when stimulation is confined to one receptor the discharge in a single Limulus nerve fiber will provide a good indication of excitatory events which take place as a result of photochemical processes. Discharges last for the duration of illumination and their frequency is a measure of stimulus strength. Lately, however, it was shown by Hartline et al. (22) that inhibitory interactions may be revealed when several receptors are excited. On the whole, the Limulus preparation shows many features which are similar to other simple sense organs, for instance, stretch receptors. In the latter, however, instead of photochemical events, stretch-deformation acts as the adequate stimulus on sensory terminals and is translated into a characteristic discharge pattern. The discharge from the cold-blooded vertebrate retina (mainly frogs) proved much more complex. Hartline found three main types when recording from single optic nerve fibers: (i) \u201con\u201d discharges, similar to those in the Limulus, firing for the duration of the light stimulus, (ii) \u201coff\u201d discharges appearing when a light stimulus was withdrawn, and (iii) \u2018con-off\u201d discharges, a combination of the former two, with activity confined mainly to onset and cessation of illumination. The mammalian discharge patterns were studied in a number of species by Granit and his co-workers in the course of their extensive work on the physiology of the visual system (summaries in 13, 15). On the whole, they did not observe any fundamental differences between frog and mammalian discharge types (see later)."

Talbot & Kuffler (1952) developed methods for using wire electrodes in an intact mammalian eye. The normal optics made it possible to stimulate the retina with small, well-focused spots of light, and to view the retina directly for positioning the electrode and stimulus. With this technique Kuffler (1953) investigated receptive field organization of single ganglion cells. Since wire electrodes record only from the retinal surface, intraretinal electrodes extend the problems which may be studied. Micropipette electrodes have now been used in the opened cat eye by Motokawa, Oikawa & Tasaki (1957) and Griisser (1957). The present authors have given a preliminary report on intraretinal recording with micropipette electrodes in the intact cat eye (Brown & Wiesel, 1958), and the techniques will be described fully in this paper. The main problems undertaken were as follows: (1) Determination of the sequence of electrical events during a retinal penetration, and development of physiological methods for locating the electrode tip. (2) Detection of a membrane with characteristics similar to the 'R membrane' described by Brindley (1956), and anatomical identification of that membrane. (3) Identification of single cells in the ganglionic and inner nuclear layers, and study of the discharge patterns and receptive field organization of these cells."
