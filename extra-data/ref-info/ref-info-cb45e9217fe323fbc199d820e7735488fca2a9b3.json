In contrast to the well known back-off n-gram language models, the neural network approach attempts to overcome the data sparseness problem by performing the estimation in a continuous space. This type of language model was mostly used for tasks for which only a very limited amount of in-domain training data is available.In this paper we present new algorithms to train a neural network language model on very large text corpora. This makes possible the use of the approach in domains where several hundreds of millions words of texts are available. The neural network language model is evaluated in a state-of-the-art real-time continuous speech recognizer for French Broadcast News. Word error reductions of 0.5% absolute are reported using only a very limited amount of additional processing time."

The advantage of the proposed method comes from a more robust and efficient subsampling technique. The original multi-class language modeling problem is transformed into a set of binary problems where each binary classifier predicts whether or not a particular word will occur. We show that the binarized model is as powerful as the standard model and allows us to aggressively subsample negative training examples without sacrificing predictive performance. Empirical results show that we can train MELM and NNLM at 1% ~ 5% of the standard complexity with no loss in performance."

Results indicate that it is possible to obtain around 50% reduction of perplexity by using mixture of several RNN LMs, compared to a state of the art backoff language model. Speech recognition experiments show around 18% reduction of word error rate on the Wall Street Journal task when comparing models trained on the same amount of data, and around 5% on the much harder NIST RT05 task, even when the backoff model is trained on much more data than the RNN LM. We provide ample empirical evidence to suggest that connectionist language models are superior to standard n-gram techniques, except their high computational (training) complexity.

The main advantage of these architectures is that they learn an embedding for words (or other symbols) in a continuous space that helps to smooth the language model and provide good generalization even when the number of training examples is insufficient. However, these models are extremely slow in comparison to the more commonly used n-gram models, both for training and recognition. As an alternative to an importance sampling method proposed to speed-up training, we introduce a hierarchical decomposition of the conditional probabilities that yields a speed-up of about 200 both during training and recognition. The hierarchical decomposition is a binary hierarchical clustering constrained by the prior knowledge extracted from the WordNet semantic hierarchy."

This model is able to handle vocabularies of arbitrary size, hence dispensing with the design of short-lists that are commonly used in NNLMs. Several softmax layers replace the standard output layer in this model. The output structure depends on the word clustering which uses the continuous word representation induced by a NNLM. The GALE Mandarin data was used to carry out the speech-to-text experiments and evaluate the NNLMs. On this data the well tuned baseline system has a character error rate under 10%. Our model achieves consistent improvements over the combination of an n-gram model and classical short-list NNLMs both in terms of perplexity and recognition accuracy."

In this work, we show how this relationship can be used to motivate two heuristics for \"shrinking\" the size of a language model to improve its performance. We use the first heuristic to develop a novel class-based language model that outperforms a baseline word trigram model by 28% in perplexity and 1.9% absolute in speech recognition word-error rate on Wall Street Journal data. We use the second heuristic to motivate a regularized version of minimum discrimination information models and show that this method outperforms other techniques for domain adaptation."

This is intrinsically difficult because of the curse of dimensionality: a word sequence on which the model will be tested is likely to be different from all the word sequences seen during training. Traditional but very successful approaches based on n-grams obtain generalization by concatenating very short overlapping sequences seen in the training set. We propose to fight the curse of dimensionality by learning a distributed representation for words which allows each training sentence to inform the model about an exponential number of semantically neighboring sentences. The model learns simultaneously (1) a distributed representation for each word along with (2) the probability function for word sequences, expressed in terms of these representations. Generalization is obtained because a sequence of words that has never been seen before gets high probability if it is made of words that are similar (in the sense of having a nearby representation) to words forming an already seen sentence. Training such large models (with millions of parameters) within a reasonable time is itself a significant challenge. We report on experiments using neural networks for the probability function, showing on two text corpora that the proposed approach significantly improves on state-of-the-art n-gram models, and that the proposed approach allows to take advantage of longer contexts."

An empirical comparison with feedforward networks is also provided. In the end, we discuss possibilities how to reduce the amount of parameters in the model. The resulting RNN model can thus be smaller, faster both during training and testing, and more accurate than the basic one."

Both of these methods are motivated by the observation that shrinking the sum of parameter magnitudes in an exponential language model tends to improve performance [2]. In this paper, we investigate whether these shrinkage-based techniques also perform well on larger training sets and on other domains. First, we explain why good performance on large data sets is uncertain, by showing that gains relative to a baseline n-gram model tend to decrease as training set size increases. Next, we evaluate several methods for data/model combination with Model M and rMDI models on limited-scale domains, to uncover which techniques should work best on large domains. Finally, we apply these methods on a variety of medium-to-large-scale domains covering several languages, and show that Model M consistently provides significant gains over existing language models for state-of-the-art systems in both speech recognition and machine translation."

Unfortunately, long training times make maximum entropy research difficult. We present a speedup technique: we change the form of the model to use classes. Our speedup works by creating two maximum entropy models, the first of which predicts the class of each word, and the second of which predicts the word itself. This factoring of the model leads to fewer nonzero indicator functions, and faster normalization, achieving speedups of up to a factor of 35 over one of the best previous techniques. It also results in typically slightly lower perplexities. The same trick can be used to speed training of other machine learning techniques, e.g. neural networks, applied to any problem with a large number of outputs, such as language modeling."

Two pass strategies have become popular in a number of recognition tasks such as ASR (automatic speech recognition), MT (machine translation) and OCR (optical character recognition). The first pass typically applies a weak language model (n-grams) to a lattice and the second pass applies a stronger language model to N best lists. The stronger language model is intended to capture more long-distance dependencies. The proposed method uses RNN-LM (recurrent neural network language model), which is a long span LM, to re-score word lattices in the second pass. A hill climbing method (iterative decoding) is proposed to search over islands of confusability in the word lattice. An evaluation based on Broadcast News shows speedups of 20 over basic N best re-scoring, and word error rate reduction of 8% (relative) on a highly competitive setup."

This approach uses a state-of-the-art baseline as a springboard from which to add a suite of novel features including ones derived from acoustic templates, deep neural net phoneme detections, duration models, modulation features, and whole word point-process models. The SCRF framework is able to appropriately weight these different information sources to produce significant gains on both the Broadcast News and Wall Street Journal tasks."

Most existing statistical language models exploit only the immediate history of a text. To extract information from further back in the document's history, we propose and usetrigger pairsas the basic information bearing elements. This allows the model to adapt its expectations to the topic of discourse. Next, statistical evidence from multiple sources must be combined. Traditionally, linear interpolation and its variants have been used, but these are shown here to be seriously deficient. Instead, we apply the principle of Maximum Entropy (ME). Each information source gives rise to a set of constraints, to be imposed on the combined estimate. The intersection of these constraints is the set of probability functions which are consistent with all the information sources. The function with the highest entropy within that set is the ME solution. Given consistent statistical evidence, a unique ME solution is guaranteed to exist, and an iterative algorithm exists which is guaranteed to converge to it. The ME framework is extremely general: any phenomenon that can be described in terms of statistics of the text can be readily incorporated. An adaptive language model based on the ME approach was trained on theWall Street Journalcorpus, and showed a 32\u201339% perplexity reduction over the baseline. When interfaced to SPHINX-II, Carnegie Mellon's speech recognizer, it reduced its error rate by 10\u201314%. This thus illustrates the feasibility of incorporating many diverse knowledge sources in a single, unified statistical framework."

Here, we formalize such training strategies in the context of machine learning, and call them \"curriculum learning\". In the context of recent research studying the difficulty of training in the presence of non-convex training criteria (for deep deterministic and stochastic neural networks), we explore curriculum learning in various set-ups. The experiments show that significant improvements in generalization can be achieved. We hypothesize that curriculum learning has both an effect on the speed of convergence of the training process to a minimum and, in the case of non-convex criteria, on the quality of the local minima obtained: curriculum learning can be seen as a particular form of continuation method (a general strategy for global optimization of non-convex functions)."
