One method of representing such scenes is a space oriented representation where information about a region of space is accessed by its coordinates. Another approach is to access the information by object, where, by giving the object name, its description and position are returned. As the description of an object is lengthy, it is desirable to group similar objects. Groups of similar objects can be represented in terms of a common part and a number of individual parts. If it is necessary to simulate moving an object then only the individual information need be saved. (Author)"

The goal is to study algorithms which find the real straight edges in the scenes, taking into account smooth variations in intensity over the faces of the solids, blurring of edges and noise. A general mathematical analysis is made of optimal methods of identifying the edge lines in figures, given a raster of intensities covering the entire field of view. There is given in addition a suboptimal statistical decision procedure, based on the model, for the identification of a line within a narrow band on the field of view given an array of intensities from within the band. A computer program has been written and extensively tested which implements this procedure and extracts lines from real scenes. Other programs were written which judge the completeness of extracted sets of lines, and propose and text for additional lines which had escaped initial detection. The performance of these programs is discussed in relation to the theory derived from the model, and with regard to their use of global information in detecting and proposing lines."

A scene, as seen for instance from a TV camera or a picture, can be transformed into a symbolic description of points and lines or surfaces. This thesis describes several programs, written in the language CONVERT , for the analysis of such descriptions in order to recognize, differentiate and identify desired objects or classes or objects in the scene. Examples are given in each case. Although the recognition might be in terms of projections of 2-dim and 3-dim objects, we do not deal with stereoscopic information. One of our programs (Polybrick) identifies parallelepipeds in a scene which may contain hidden bodies and non-parallelepipedic objects. The program TD works mainly with 2-dimensional figures, although under certain conditions successfully identifies 3-dim objects. Overlapping objects are identified when they are transparent. A third program, DT, works with 3-dim and 2-dim objects, and does not identify objects which are not completely seen. Important restrictions and suppositions are: (a) the input is assumed perfect (noiseless), and in a symbolic format; (b) no perspective deformation is considered. A portion of this thesis is devoted to the study of models (symbolic representation) of the objects we want to identify; different schemes, some of them already in use, are discussed. Focusing our attention on the more general problem of identification of general objects when they substantially overlap, we propose some schemes for their recognition, and also analyze some problems that are met."

The model expresses the transform relating object space to image space as a function of the control variables of the camera. We constructed a calibration system for measuring the model parameters which has a demonstrated accuracy more than adequate for our present needs. We have also identified the major source of error in model measurement to be undesired image motion and have developed means of measuring and compensating for some of it and eliminating other parts of it. The system can measure systematic image distortions if they become the major accuracy limitation. It has been shown how to generalize the model to handle small systematic errors due to aspects of pan-tilt head geometry not presently accounted for. The report demonstrates the model's application in stereo vision and have shown how it can be applied as a predictive device in locating objects of interest and centering them in an image. (Author)"

The experimental facility consists of an SDS-940 computer and associated programs controlling a wheeled vehicle that carries a TV camera and other sensors. The primary emphasis is on the development of a system of programs for processing sensory data from the vehicle, for storing relevant information about the environment, and for planning the sequence of motor actions necessary to accomplish tasks in the environment. A typical task performed by our present system requires the robot vehicle to rearrange (by pushing) simple objects in its environment \n \nA novel feature of our approach is the use of a formal theorem-proving system to plan the execution of high-level functions as a sequence of other, perhaps lower-level, functions. The execution of these, in turn, requires additional planning at lower levels. The main theme of the research is the integration of the necessary planning systems, models of the world, and sensory processing systems into an efficient whole capable of performing a wide range of tasks in a real environment."
