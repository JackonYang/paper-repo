We consider a setting in which the learner responds to each example according to a current hypothesis. Then the learner updates the hypothesis, if necessary, based on the correct classification of the example. One natural measure of the quality of learning in this setting is the number of mistakes the learner makes. For suitable classes of functions, learning algorithms are available that make a bounded number of mistakes, with the bound independent of the number of examples seen by the learner. We present one such algorithm that learns disjunctive Boolean functions, along with variants for learning other classes of Boolean functions. The basic method can be expressed as a linear-threshold algorithm. A primary advantage of this algorithm is that the number of mistakes grows only logarithmically with the number of irrelevant attributes in the examples. At the same time, the algorithm is computationally efficient in both time and space."

Our goals are to prove results and develop general techniques that shed light on the boundary between the classes of expressions that are learnable in polynomial time and those that are apparently not. The elucidation of this boundary, for boolean expressions and possibly other knowledge representations, is an example of the potential contribution of complexity theory to artificial intelligence. We employ the distribution-free model of learning introduced in /lo]. A more complete discussion and justification of this model can be found in [4,10,11,12]. [4] includes some discussion that is relevant more particularly to infinite representations, such as geometric ones, rather than the finite case of boolean functions. For other recent related work see [1,2,7,&g]. The results of this paper fall into three categories: closure properties of learnable classes, negative results, and distribution-specific positive results. The closure properties are of two kinds. In section 3 we discuss closure under boolean operations on the members of the learnable classes. The assumption that the classes are learnable from positive or negative ex-"

Our methods lead to a unified treatment of some of Valiant's results, along with previous results of Pearl and Devroye and Wagner on distribution-free convergence of certain pattern recognition algorithms. We show that the essential condition for distribution-free learnability is finiteness of the Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension, a simple combinatorial parameter of the class of concepts to be learned. Using this parameter, we analyze the complexity and closure properties of learnable classes. Authors A. Blumer and D. Haussler gratefully acknowledge the support of NSF grant IST-8317918, author A.

In this paper we study the problem of calculating and storing arrangementsimplicitly, using subquadratic space and preprocessing, so that, given any query pointp, we can calculate efficiently the face containingp. First, we consider the case of lines and show that with \u039b(n) space1 and \u039b(n3/2) preprocessing time, we can answer face queries in \u039b(\u221an)+O(K) time, whereK is the output size. (The query time is achieved with high probability.) In the process, we solve three interesting subproblems: (1) given a set ofn points, find a straight-edge spanning tree of these points such that any line intersects only a few edges of the tree, (2) given a simple polygonal path \u0393, form a data structure from which we can find the convex hull of any subpath of \u0393 quickly, and (3) given a set of points, organize them so that the convex hull of their subset lying above a query line can be found quickly. Second, using random sampling, we give a tradeoff between increasing space and decreasing query time. Third, we extend our structure to report faces in an arrangement of line segments in \u039b(n1/3)+O(K) time, given\u039b(n4/3) space and \u039b(n5/3) preprocessing time. Lastly, we note that our techniques allow us to computem faces in an arrangement ofn lines in time \u039b(m2/3n2/3+n), which is nearly optimal."

The running-time of this algorithm is better than the ellipsoid algorithm by a factor ofO(n2.5). We prove that given a polytopeP and a strictly interior point a \u03b5P, there is a projective transformation of the space that mapsP, a toP\u2032, a\u2032 having the following property. The ratio of the radius of the smallest sphere with center a\u2032, containingP\u2032 to the radius of the largest sphere with center a\u2032 contained inP\u2032 isO(n). The algorithm consists of repeated application of such projective transformations each followed by optimization over an inscribed sphere to create a sequence of points which converges to the optimal solution in polynomial time."

A notion of prediction-preserving reducibility is developed, and it is shown that if DFAs are predictable, then so are all languages in logspace. In particular, the predictability of DFAs implies the predictability of all Booleman formulas. Similar results hold for NFAs and PDAs (or CFGs). Relationships between the complexity of the membership problem for a class of automata and the complexity of the prediction problem are obtained. Examples are given of prediction problems in which predictability implies the predictability of all languages in P. Assuming the existence of one-way functions, it follows that these problems are not predictable, even in an extremely weak sense.<<ETX>>"

Based on ideas due to Vapnik and Chervonenkis, we introduce the concept of an \u025b-net of a set of points for an abstract set of ranges and give sufficient conditions that a random sample is an \u025b-net with any desired probability. Using these results, we demonstrate how random samples can be used to build a partition-tree structure that achieves the above query time."
