Markov Chain theory is used to define the model of a random walker that converges to a score distribution which depends both on the graph connectivity and on the node labels. A supervised learning task is defined on the given graph by assigning a target score for some nodes and a training algorithm based on error backpropagation through the graph is devised to learn the model parameters. The trained model can assign scores to the graph nodes generalizing the criteria provided by the supervisor in the examples. The proposed algorithm has been applied to learn a ranking function for Web pages. The experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed technique in reorganizing the rank accordingly to the examples provided in the training set."

                "text": "The definition of efficient page ranking algorithms is becoming an important issue in the design of the query interface of Web search engines. Information flooding is a common experience especially when broad topic queries are issued. Queries containing only one or two keywords usually match a huge number of documents, while users can only afford to visit the first positions of the returned list, which do not necessarily refer to the most appropriate answers. Some successful approaches to page ranking in a hyperlinked environment, like the Web, are based on link analysis. We propose a general probabilistic framework for Web page scoring systems (WPSS), which incorporates and extends many of the relevant models proposed in the literature. In particular, we introduce scoring systems for both generic (horizontal) and focused (vertical) search engines. Whereas horizontal scoring algorithms are only based on the topology of the Web graph, vertical ranking also takes the page contents into account and are the base for focused and user adapted search interfaces. Experimental results are reported to show the properties of some of the proposed scoring systems with special emphasis on vertical search."

                "text": "A structured organization of information is typically required by symbolic processing. On the other hand, most connectionist models assume that data are organized according to relatively poor structures, like arrays or sequences. The framework described in this paper is an attempt to unify adaptive models like artificial neural nets and belief nets for the problem of processing structured information. In particular, relations between data variables are expressed by directed acyclic graphs, where both numerical and categorical values coexist. The general framework proposed in this paper can be regarded as an extension of both recurrent neural networks and hidden Markov models to the case of acyclic graphs. In particular we study the supervised learning problem as the problem of learning transductions from an input structured space to an output structured space, where transductions are assumed to admit a recursive hidden statespace representation. We introduce a graphical formalism for representing this class of adaptive transductions by means of recursive networks, i.e., cyclic graphs where nodes are labeled by variables and edges are labeled by generalized delay elements. This representation makes it possible to incorporate the symbolic and subsymbolic nature of data. Structures are processed by unfolding the recursive network into an acyclic graph called encoding network. In so doing, inference and learning algorithms can be easily inherited from the corresponding algorithms for artificial neural networks or probabilistic graphical model."

PageRank assigns to a page a score proportional to the number of times a random surfer would visit that page, if it surfed indefinitely from page to page, following all outlinks from a page with equal probability. We propose to improve PageRank by using a more intelligent surfer, one that is guided by a probabilistic model of the relevance of a page to a query. Efficient execution of our algorithm at query time is made possible by precomputing at crawl time (and thus once for all queries) the necessary terms.

For more refined searches, this global notion of importance can be specialized to create personalized views of importance--for example, importance scores can be biased according to a user-specified set of initially-interesting pages. Computing and storing all possible personalized views in advance is impractical, as is computing personalized views at query time, since the computation of each view requires an iterative computation over the web graph. We present new graph-theoretical results, and a new technique based on these results, that encode personalized views as partial vectors. Partial vectors are shared across multiple personalized views, and their computation and storage costs scale well with the number of views. Our approach enables incremental computation, so that the construction of personalized views from partial vectors is practical at query time. We present efficient dynamic programming algorithms for computing partial vectors, an algorithm for constructing personalized views from partial vectors, and experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness and scalability of our techniques."

The graph focused approach considers the mapping from a graph structure to a real vector, in which the mapping is independent of the particular node involved; while the node focused approach considers the mapping from a graph structure to a real vector, in which the mapping depends on the properties of the node involved. It is shown that the graph neural network model maintains some of the characteristics of the graph focused models and the node focused models respectively. A supervised learning algorithm is derived to estimate the parameters of the graph neural network model. Some experimental results are shown to validate the proposed learning algorithm, and demonstrate the generalization capability of the proposed model."

Here, we propose the first fully unsupervised model, namely an extension of traditional self-organizing maps (SOMs), for the processing of labeled directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). The extension is obtained by using the unfolding procedure adopted in recurrent and recursive neural networks, with the replicated neurons in the unfolded network comprising of a full SOM. This approach enables the discovery of similarities among objects including vectors consisting of numerical data. The capabilities of the model are analyzed in detail by utilizing a relatively large data set taken from an artificial benchmark problem involving visual patterns encoded as labeled DAGs. The experimental results demonstrate clearly that the proposed model is capable of exploiting both information conveyed in the labels attached to each node of the input DAGs and information encoded in the DAG topology."

To yield more accurate search results, we propose computing a set of PageRank vectors, biased using a set of representative topics, to capture more accurately the notion of importance with respect to a particular topic. By using these (precomputed) biased PageRank vectors to generate query-specific importance scores for pages at query time, we show that we can generate more accurate rankings than with a single, generic PageRank vector. For ordinary keyword search queries, we compute the topic-sensitive PageRank scores for pages satisfying the query using the topic of the query keywords. For searches done in context (e.g., when the search query is performed by highlighting words in a Web page), we compute the topic-sensitive PageRank scores using the topic of the context in which the query appeared."

In fact, feature-based approaches usually fail to give satisfactory solutions because of the sensitivity of the approach to the a priori selection of the features, and the incapacity to represent any specific information on the relationships among the components of the structures. However, we show that neural networks can, in fact, represent and classify structured patterns. The key idea underpinning our approach is the use of the so called \"generalized recursive neuron\", which is essentially a generalization to structures of a recurrent neuron. By using generalized recursive neurons, all the supervised networks developed for the classification of sequences, such as backpropagation through time networks, real-time recurrent networks, simple recurrent networks, recurrent cascade correlation networks, and neural trees can, on the whole, be generalized to structures. The results obtained by some of the above networks (with generalized recursive neurons) on the classification of logic terms are presented."

Our analysis assumes a monotone conjunctive target concept, and independent, noise-free Boolean attributes. We calculate the probability that the algorithm will induce an arbitrary pair of concept descriptions and then use this to compute the probability of correct classification over the instance space. The analysis takes into account the number of training instances, the number of attributes, the distribution of these attributes, and the level of class noise. We also explore the behavioral implications of the analysis by presenting predicted learning curves for artificial domains, and give experimental results on these domains as a check on our reasoning."
