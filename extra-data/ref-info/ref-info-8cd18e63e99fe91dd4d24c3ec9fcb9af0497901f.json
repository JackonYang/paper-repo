According to current practice, systems are tested using some propriety data. This raises some important questions: how should we interpret the results? how should we compare different systems objectively? how do we know that the high recall and precision rates do not come at the expense of making mistakes in other parts of the table-processing task. In this paper, we would like to address these problems by proposing a multi-level table evaluation method."

We start by defining table. Then we describe the steps involved in extracting information from tables and analyse table-related research to place the contribution of different authors, find the paths research is following, and identify issues that are still unsolved. We then analyse current approaches to evaluating table processing algorithms and propose two new metrics for the task of segmenting cells/columns/rows. We proceed to design our own end-to-end method, where there is a higher interaction between different steps; we indicate how back loops in the usual order of the steps can reduce the possibility of errors and contribute to solving previously unsolved problems. Finally, we explore how the actual interpretation of the table not only allows inferring the accuracy of the overall extraction process but also contributes to actually improving its quality. In order to do so, we believe interpretation has to consider context-specific knowledge; we explore how the addition of this knowledge can be made in a plug-in/out manner, such that the overall method will maintain its operability in different contexts."

We illustrate the transition by some actual examples of web table conversion. We then suggest that the appropriate target format for table analysis, whether performed by conventional customized programs or by off-the-shelf software, is a representation based on the abstract table introduced by X. Wang in 1996. We show that the Wang model is adequate for some useful tasks that prove elusive for less explicit representations, and outline our plans to develop a semi-automated table processing system to demonstrate this approach. Screen-snaphots of a prototype tool to allow table mark-up in the style of Wang are also presented."

The thesis offers a formal description of the table and the description and evaluation of a system which provides instances of that model for table examples. There are three parts to the thesis. The first looks at tables in general terms, suggests where their complexities are to be found, and reviews the literature dealing with research into tables in other fields. The second part introduces a layered model of the table and provides some notational equipment for encoding tables in these component layers. The final part discusses the design, implementation and evaluation of a system which produces an instance of the model for the tables found in a document. It also discusses the design and collection of a corpus of tables used for the training and evaluation of the system. The thesis catalogues a laxge number of phenomena discovered in the corpus collected during the research and provides appropriate terminology."

A precise definition of \"tabularity\" remains elusive because some bureaucratic forms, multicolumn text layouts, and schematic drawings share many characteristics of tables. There are significant differences between typeset tables, electronic files designed for display of tables, and tables in symbolic form intended for information retrieval. Although most research to date has addressed the extraction of low-level geometric information from scanned raster images of paper tables, the recent trend toward the analysis of tables in electronic form may pave the way to a higherl evel of table understanding. \n \nRecent research on table composition and table analysis has improved ourunde rstanding of the distinction between the logical and physical structures of tables, and has led to improved formalisms for modeling tables. The present study indicates that progress on half-a-dozen specific research issues would open the door to using existing paper and electronic tables for database update, tabular browsing, structured information retrieval through graphical and audio interfaces, multimedia table editing, and platform-independent display. \n \nAlthough tables are not a conventional format for conveying the primary content of technical papers, here we attempt to subdue our natural garrulity by adopting this genre to communicate what we have to say about tables entirely in tabular form."

T-Recs works on the output of commercial OCR systems that provide the word bounding box geometry together with the text itself (e.g. Xerox ScanWorX). While T-Recs performs well on a number of document categories, business letters still remained a challenging domain because the T-Recs location heuristics are mislead by their header or footer resulting in a low recognition precision. Business letters such as invoices are a very interesting domain for industrial applications due to the large amount of documents to be analyzed and the importance of the data carried within their tables. Hence, we developed a more restrictive approach which is implemented in the T-Recs++ prototype. This paper describes the ideas of the T-Recs++ location and also proposes a quality evaluation measure that reflects the bottom-up strategy of either T-Recs or T-Recs++. Finally, some results comparing both systems on a collection of business letters are given."

Today, quite a large number of different approaches facing these tasks have been described in literature or are available as part of commercial OCR systems that claim to deal with tables on the scanned documents and to treat them accordingly.\n However, the problem of detecting tables is not yet solved at all. Different approaches have different strengths and weak points. Some fail in certain situations or layouts where others perform better. How shall one know, which approach or system is the best for his specific job? The answer to this question raises the demand for an objective comparison of different approaches which address the same task of spotting tables and recognizing their structure.\n This paper describes our approach towards establishing a complete and publicly available, hence open environment for the benchmarking of table spotting and structural analysis. We provide free access to the ground truthing tool and evaluation mechanism described in this paper, describe the ideas behind and we also provide ground truth for the 547 documents of the UNLV and UW-3 datasets that contain tables.\n In addition, we applied the quality measures to the results that were generated by the T-Recs system which we developed some years ago and which we started to further advance since a few months."

In this paper, we propose a novel and effective table detection method via visual separators and geometric content layout information, targeting at PDF documents. The visual separators refer to not only the graphic ruling lines but also the white spaces to handle tables with or without ruling lines. Furthermore, we detect page columns in order to assist table region delimitation in complex layout pages. Evaluations of our algorithm on an e-Book dataset and a scientific document dataset show competitive performance. It is noteworthy that the proposed method has been successfully incorporated into a commercial software package for large-scale Chinese e-Book production."

Despite the abundance of these techniques, an objective comparison of their performance is still missing. The Table Competition held in the context of ICDAR 2013 is our first attempt at objectively evaluating these techniques against each other in a standardized way, across several input formats. The competition independently addresses three problems: (i) table location, (ii) table structure recognition, and (iii) these two tasks combined. We received results from seven academic systems, which we have also compared against four commercial products. This paper presents our findings."

We propose a new pair of evaluation metrics that better suit document analysis\u2019 needs and show their application to several table tasks.

Much of the relevant information in such documents is contained in tables and is currently mainly extracted by hand. We propose a method that accomplishes a prior step of the task of automatically extracting information from tables in documents: selecting the lines that are likely to belong to tables. Our method has been developed by empirically analyzing a set of Portuguese companies\u2019 financial statements using statistical and data mining techniques. Empirical evaluation indicates that more than 99% of table lines are selected after discarding at least 50% of all lines. The method can cope with the complexity of styles used in assembling information on paper and adapt its performance accordingly, thus maximizing its results."

In this survey, the table recognition literature is presented as an interaction of table models, observations, transformations, and inferences. A table model defines the physical and logical structure of tables; the model is used to detect tables and to analyze and decompose the detected tables. Observations perform feature measurements and data lookup, transformations alter or restructure data, and inferences generate and test hypotheses. This presentation clarifies both the decisions made by a table recognizer and the assumptions and inferencing techniques that underlie these decisions."

Table understanding on the web has many potential applications including web mining, knowledge management, and web content summarization and delivery to narrow-bandwidth devices. Although in HTML documents tables are generally marked as ?table? elements, a ?table? element does not necessarily indicate the presence of a genuine relational table. Thus the important first step in table understanding in the web domain is the detection of the genuine tables. In our earlier work we designed a basic rule-based algorithm to detect genuine tables in major news and corporate home pages as part of a web content filtering system. In this paper we investigate a machine learning based approach that is trainable and thus can be automatically generalized to including any domain. Various features reflecting the layout as well as content characteristics of tables are explored. The system is tested on a large database which consists of 1, 393 HTML files collected from hundreds of different web sites from various domains and contains over 10,000 leaf ?table? elements. Experiments were conducted using the cross validation method. The machine learning based approach outperformed the rule-based system and achieved an F-measure of 95.88%."

Augmentations like aggregates, footnotes, table titles, captions, units and notes were also extracted in an average time of 93 seconds. Every user intervention was logged and audited. The logged interactions were analyzed to determine the relative influence of factors like table size, number of categories and various types of augmentations on the processing time.

A generic model is designed to support the different stages of tabular composition, including the editing of logical structure, the specification of layout structure, and the formatting of concrete tables. The model separates table's logical structure from its layout structure, which consists of tabular topology and typographic style. The notion of an abstract table, which describes the logical relationships among tabular items, is formally defined and a set of logical operations is proposed to manipulate tables based on these logical relationships. An abstract table can be visualized through a layout structure specified by a set of topological rules, which determine the relative placement of tabular items in two dimensions, and a set of style rules, which determine the final appearance of different items. The absolute placement of a concrete table can be automatically generated by applying a layout specification to an abstract line. An NP-complete problem arises in the formatting process that uses automatic line breaking and determines the physical dimension of a table to satisfy user-specified size constraints. An algorithm has been designed to solve the formatting problem in polynomial time for typical tables. Based on the tabular model, a prototype tabular composition system has been implemented in a UNIX, X Windows environment. This prototype provides an interactive interface to edit the logical structure, the topology and the styles of tables. It allows us to manipulate tables based on the logical relationships tabular items, regardless of where the items are placed in the layout structure, and capable of presenting a table in different topologies and styles so that we can select a high-quality layout structure."

This component automates extraction of the Wang Notation for the column header of a table. Using column-header specific rules for XY cutting we convert the geometric structure of the column header to a linear string denoting cell attributes and directions of cuts. The string representation is parsed by a context-free grammar and the parse tree is further processed to produce an abstract data-type representation (the Wang notation tree) of each column category. Experiments were carried out to evaluate this scheme on the original and edited column headers of Excel tables drawn from a collection of 200 used in our earlier work. The transformed headers were obtained by editing the original column headers to conform to the format targeted by our grammar. Forty-four original headers and their reformatted versions were submitted as input to our software system. Our grammar was able to parse and the extract Wang notation tree for all the edited headers, but for only four of the original headers. We suggest extensions to our table grammar that would enable processing a larger fraction of headers without manual editing."

Although several sophisticated and indeed complex approaches were proposed, they are still limited in many aspects. In this paper the novel ontology-based system named XONTO, that allows the semantic extraction of information from PDF unstructured documents, is presented. The XONTO system is founded on the idea of self-describing ontologies in which objects and classes can be equipped by a set of rules named descriptors. These rules represent patterns that allow to automatically recognize and extract ontology objects contained in PDF documents also when information is arranged in tabular form. This way a self-describing ontology expresses the semantic of the information to extract and the rules that, in turn, populate itself. In the paper XONTO system behaviors and structure are sketched by means of a running example."

However, often, the most important information being reported in an article is presented in tabular form in a digital document. If the data reported in tables can be extracted and stored in a database, the data can be queried and joined with other data using database management systems. In order to prepare the data source for table search, accurately detecting the table boundary plays a crucial role for the later table structure decomposition. Table boundary detection and content extraction is a challenging problem because tabular formats are not standardized across all documents. In this paper, we propose a simple but effective preprocessing method to improve the table boundary detection performance by considering the sparse-line property of table rows. Our method easily simplifies the table boundary detection problem into the sparse line analysis problem with much less noise. We design eight line label types and apply two machine learning techniques, Conditional Random Field (CRF) and Support Vector Machines (SVM), on the table boundary detection field. The experimental results not only compare the performances between the machine learning methods and the heuristics-based method, but also demonstrate the effectiveness of the sparse line analysis in the table boundary detection."

Table, a ubiquitous document component, becomes an important information source. Accurately detecting the table boundary plays a crucial role for many applications, e.g., the increasing demand on the table data search. Rather than converting PDFs to image or HTML and then processing with other techniques (e.g., OCR), extracting and analyzing texts from PDFs directly is easy and accurate. However, text extraction tools face a common problem: text sequence error. In this paper, we propose two algorithms to recover the sequence of extracted sparse lines, which improve the table content collection. The experimental results show the comparison of the performance of both algorithms, and demonstrate the effectiveness of text sequence recovering for the table boundary detection."

                "text": "Web tables are commonly used to convey information on the Internet. A good understanding of web tables\u2019 syntactic structures will not only improve the efficiency of information retrieval, but also provide a variety of angles to view the information. The web tables we study are well-formed and structured in accordance with the common human understanding. A well-formed table is comprised of a column header, a row header, a grid region to store meaningful data, and an empty stub region. The underlying layout and relational structures of a web table are revealed in its headers. Each column/row can be defined uniquely by a header-path that passes through the initial headers. Within the corpus of web tables we studied, most tables have very simple header structures, such as a linear array of symbols. Each symbol defines a particular column or row. However, some header structures are more complex. They consist of multiple layers of symbols and often have a hierarchical relation between each layer. According to a commonly used layout convention, symbols are repeated at lower layers to convey hierarchical relationship with higher layers. These observations motivate us to further explore the structures of web tables. Our goal is to discover more generic and fundamental ways of representing web table headers and improve the performance of information retrieval from web tables. We use an algebraic approach to analyze table headers. The starting point of our analysis is to represent headers using Sum of Product (SOP) equations, where \u2018+\u2019 and \u2018*\u2019 are redefined to correspond to spatial relationship between the header cells. Inspired by Boolean algebraic expression simplification techniques, we decomposed headers using a logic synthesis tool. As a result, header symbols are gathered into groups, which can be thought of as basic building blocks. We extract each group from the equation and call it a category . Utilizing the Shunting-Yard Algorithm and the Reverse Polish Notation , we build a parse tree representation of each category according to a specific grammar. A simple tree traversal on category parse trees produces all the header-paths. If we traverse in another order, we generate a different set of header-paths. This allows us not only to retrieve information more efficiently, but also view table information in a variety of ways. We processed 200 well-formed web tables through our system and generated production rules, SOP equations, RPNs and parse trees for all 200 tables."

Past experience with standard datasets providing ground-truth for character recognition and page segmentation tasks supports this belief. In the process of attempting to evaluate several table recognition algorithms we have been developing, however, we have uncovered a number of serious hurdles connected with the ground-truthing of tables. This problem may, in fact, be much more difficult than it appears. We present a detailed analysis of why table ground-truthing is so hard, including the notions that there may exist more than one acceptable \"truth\" and/or incomplete or partial \"truths\"."

Various kinds of document mediums are involved, from scanned images to web pages, from plain texts to PDF files. Numerous algorithms published bring up a challenging issue: how to evaluate algorithms in different context. Currently, most work on table detection conducts experiments on their in-house dataset. Even the few sources of online datasets are targeted at image documents only. Moreover, Precision and recall measurement are usual practice in order to account performance based on human evaluation. In this paper, we provide a dataset that is representative, large and most importantly, publicly available. The compatible format of the ground truth makes evaluation independent of document medium. We also propose a set of new measures, implement them, and open the source code. Finally, three existing table detection algorithms are evaluated to demonstrate the reliability of the dataset and metrics."

Such \u201cdocuments born digital\u201d range from plain text documents such as emails to more sophisticated forms such as PDF documents and Web documents. On the one hand, the existence of the digital encoding of documents eliminates the need for scanning, image processing, and character recognition in most situations (a notable exception being the prevalent use of text embedded in images for Web documents, as elaborated upon in section \u201cAnalysis of Text in Web Images\u201d). On the other hand, many higher-level processing tasks remain due to the fact that the design purpose of almost existing digital document encoding systems (i.e., HTML, PDF) is for display or printing for human consumption, not for machine-level information exchange and extraction. As such, significant amount of processing is still required for automatic information extraction, indexing, and content repurposing from such documents, and many challenges exist in this process. This chapter describes in detail the key technologies for processing documents born digital, with a focus on PDF and Web document processing."

This paper shows how dataflow properties can be analyzed at compile-time to make buffering more efficient. Since the target code corresponding to each node of an SDF graph is normally obtained from a hand-optimized library of predefined blocks, the efficiency of data transfer between blocks is often the limiting factor in how closely an SDF compiler can approximate meticulous manual coding. Furthermore, in the presence of large sample-rate changes, straightforward buffering techniques can quickly exhaust limited on-chip data memory, necessitating the use of slower external memory. The techniques presented in this paper address both of these problems in a unified manner."
