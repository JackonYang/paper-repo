Further all these models can be given an interpretation in terms of conditional independence and the interpretation can be read directly off the graph in the form of a Markov property. The class of graphical models contains that of decomposable models and we give a simple criterion for decomposability of a given graphical model. To some extent we discuss estimation problems and give suggestions for further work."

The techniques proposed here yield 'path diagrams' that are somewhat analogous to those used in path analysis. Earlier path analysis models are not suited to the case where the variables are polytomous, or dichotomous, but the models proposed herein are. For each of our models, methods are presented for (a) testing whether the model fits the data, (b) partitioning the test statistic into components that can be used to test submodels within the overall model, and (c) estimating the parameters in the model. An illustrative application is also included."

We show that a reducible zero pattern is the condition under which parameters as well as least squares estimates in recursive equations are one-to-one transformations of parameters and of maximum likelihood estimates, respectively, in a decomposable covariance selection model. As a consequence, (a) we can give a closed-form expression for the maximum likelihood estimate of a decomposable covariance matrix, (b) we can derive Wright's rule for computing implied correlations in path analysis, and (c) we can describe a search procedure for fitting recursive equations."

The main subjects of the present book are based on three developments: (1) the theory of exponential families, (2) the theory of log-linear models, and (3) the theory of logistic models in psychometrics. More specifically, some of the models dealt with are loglinear models for contingency tables, latent trait models, Markov chains, and the Bradley-Terry model for paired comparisons. Each chapter contains a large number of examples and exercises. Solutions to the exercises are, however, not given. Before presenting general conclusion about the book, each chapter will be reviewed separately. Overview The first chapter (Statistical Models; 8 pages) gives an introduction to the use of statistical models in the social sciences. Examples from a variety of social disciplines, including medicine, are given. The intention of chapter 2 (Preliminary Theory; 44 pages) is to refresh the reader\u2019s knowledge of probability theory and statistics, which are applied in the rest of the book. The given survey of subjects serves this goal well, except for the treatment of statistical optimality theory. Optimality concepts are introduced; but they are hardly, if ever, used in the rest of the book. A more serious drawback of the"

It seems desirable now to make a restatement of the theory and to review the types of application, especially as there has been a certain amount of misunderstanding both of purpose and of procedure."
