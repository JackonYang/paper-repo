In this paper we regard learning as the phenomenon of knowledge acquisition in the absence of explicit programming. We give a precise methodology for studying this phenomenon from a computational viewpoint. It consists of choosing an appropriate information gathering mechanism, the learning protocol, and exploring the class of concepts that can be learnt using it in a reasonable (polynomial) number of steps. We find that inherent algorithmic complexity appears to set serious limits to the range of concepts that can be so learnt. The methodology and results suggest concrete principles for designing realistic learning systems."

Our methods lead to a unified treatment of some of Valiant's results, along with previous results of Pearl and Devroye and Wagner on distribution-free convergence of certain pattern recognition algorithms. We show that the essential condition for distribution-free learnability is finiteness of the Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension, a simple combinatorial parameter of the class of concepts to be learned. Using this parameter, we analyze the complexity and closure properties of learnable classes. Authors A. Blumer and D. Haussler gratefully acknowledge the support of NSF grant IST-8317918, author A.

This makes it very unlikely that any algorithm like backpropagation which varies weights on a network of fixed size and topology will be able to learn in polynomial time. However, Valiant has recently proposed a learning protocol (Valiant 1984), which allows one to sensibly consider generalization by learning algorithms with the freedom to add neurons and synapses, as well as simply adjusting weights. Within this context, standard circuit complexity arguments show that learning algorithms with such freedom can solve in polynomial time any learning problem that can be solved in polynomial time by any algorithm whatever. In this sense, neural nets are universal learners, capable of learning any learnable class of concepts."

Among our results are the following bounds on appropriate sample vs. network size. Assume 0 < \u220a 1/8. We show that if m O(W/\u220a log N/\u220a) random examples can be loaded on a feedforward network of linear threshold functions with N nodes and W weights, so that at least a fraction 1 \u220a/2 of the examples are correctly classified, then one has confidence approaching certainty that the network will correctly classify a fraction 1 \u220a of future test examples drawn from the same distribution. Conversely, for fully-connected feedforward nets with one hidden layer, any learning algorithm using fewer than (W/\u220a) random training examples will, for some distributions of examples consistent with an appropriate weight choice, fail at least some fixed fraction of the time to find a weight choice that will correctly classify more than a 1 \u220a fraction of the future test examples."

It is shown that a family of surfaces having d degrees of freedom has a natural separating capacity of 2d pattern vectors, thus extending and unifying results of Winder and others on the pattern-separating capacity of hyperplanes. Applying these ideas to the vertices of a binary n-cube yields bounds on the number of spherically, quadratically, and, in general, nonlinearly separable Boolean functions of n variables. It is shown that the set of all surfaces which separate a dichotomy of an infinite, random, separable set of pattern vectors can be characterized, on the average, by a subset of only 2d extreme pattern vectors. In addition, the problem of generalizing the classifications on a labeled set of pattern points to the classification of a new point is defined, and it is found that the probability of ambiguous generalization is large unless the number of training patterns exceeds the capacity of the set of separating surfaces."

Alternative symbolic strategies such as direct categorization of the visual signals into vowels are also presented.
