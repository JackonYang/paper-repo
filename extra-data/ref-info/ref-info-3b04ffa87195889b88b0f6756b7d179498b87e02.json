Since the possible strings may be acoustically similar, a language model is required; given a word string, the model returns its linguistic probability. Several Markov language models are discussed. A novel kind of language model which reflects short-term patterns of word use by means of a cache component (analogous to cache memory in hardware terminology) is presented. The model also contains a 3g-gram component of the traditional type. The combined model and a pure 3g-gram model were tested on samples drawn from the Lancaster-Oslo/Bergen (LOB) corpus of English text. The relative performance of the two models is examined, and suggestions for the future improvements are made. >"

A general problem of this approach is that there is only a loose relation to the final translation quality on unseen text. In this paper, we analyze various training criteria which directly optimize translation quality. These training criteria make use of recently proposed automatic evaluation metrics. We describe a new algorithm for efficient training an unsmoothed error count. We show that significantly better results can often be obtained if the final evaluation criterion is taken directly into account as part of the training procedure."

                "text": "Despite ubiquitous claims that optical character recognition (OCR) is a \"solved problem,'' many categories of documents continue to break modern OCR software such as documents with moderate degradation or unusual fonts. Many approaches rely on pre-computed or stored character models, but these are vulnerable to cases when the font of a particular document was not part of the training set, or when there is so much noise in a document that the font model becomes weak. To address these difficult cases, we present a form of iterative contextual modeling that learns character models directly from the document it is trying to recognize. We use these learned models both to segment the characters and to recognize them in an incremental, iterative process. We present results comparable to those of a commercial OCR system on a subset of characters from a difficult test document."

A major change in the system is the use of continuous-density HMMs, which allow us to take advantage of a large amount of training data and to use unsupervised adaptation methods to improve accuracy in many cases, e.g., on degraded data. Another advance is the substantial increase in recognition speed. With this increased speed, the system is fast enough for practical use on Arabic and English data. The extension of the system to Chinese further demonstrated the language independence of this system and showed that this system can be used on languages with large character sets and complicated character structures. The Chinese OCR system yielded high accuracy on newspaper data."

Specifically, the problem is to estimate the probability that a given word will be the next word uttered. Algorithms are presented for automatically constructing a binary decision tree designed to estimate these probabilities. At each node of the tree there is a yes/no question relating to the words already spoken, and at each leaf there is a probability distribution over the allowable vocabulary. Ideally, these nodal questions can take the form of arbitrarily complex Boolean expressions, but computationally cheaper alternatives are also discussed. Some results obtained on a 5000-word vocabulary with a tree designed to predict the next word spoken from the preceding 20 words are included. The tree is compared to an equivalent trigram model and shown to be superior. >"

Unsupervised classification of the segmented character bitmaps on each page, using a \"clump\" metric, typically yields several hundred clusters with highly skewed populations. Letter identities are assigned to each cluster by maximizing matches with a lexicon of English words. We found that for 2/3 of the pages, we can identify almost 80% of the words included in the lexicon, without any shape training. Residual errors are caused by mis-segmentation including missed lines and punctuation. This research differs from earlier attempts to apply cipher decoding to OCR in: (1) using real data; (2) a more appropriate clustering algorithm; and (3) decoding a many-to-many instead of a one-to-one mapping between clusters and letters."

The weakest link is its handling of characters which are difficult to segment. The engine is divided into four phases: segmentation, image recognition, ambiguity resolution, and document analysis. The features are zonal and reduce the image to a blurred, gray-level representation. The classifier is data-driven, trained offline, and model-free. Handcrafted features and decision trees tend to be brittle in the presence of noise. To satisfy the needs of full-text applications, the system captures the structure of the document so that, when viewed in a word processor or spreadsheet program, the formatting of the optically recognized document reflects that of the original document. To satisfy the needs of the forms market, a proofing and correction tool displays 'pop-up' images of uncertain characters. >"

We constructed a corpus of digitized texts containing about 4% of all books ever printed. Analysis of this corpus enables us to investigate cultural trends quantitatively. We survey the vast terrain of \u2018culturomics,\u2019 focusing on linguistic and cultural phenomena that were reflected in the English language between 1800 and 2000. We show how this approach can provide insights about fields as diverse as lexicography, the evolution of grammar, collective memory, the adoption of technology, the pursuit of fame, censorship, and historical epidemiology. Culturomics extends the boundaries of rigorous quantitative inquiry to a wide array of new phenomena spanning the social sciences and the humanities."
