The outline of this method is described as follows. Ruled lines are extracted from the input image of a form. These lines are used for understanding the form, taking into account their feature attributes and the relationships between them. Each line in the input image of a form as expected to correspond to a line in one of the model forms, which are described as structured features. This correspondence is represented by a node in an association graph where an arc represents compatible correspondences established on the basis of feature relationships. The best match is found as the largest maximal clique in the association graph. Experimental results show the method is robust and effective for poor quality document images and also for various styles of forms."

The aim of this module is to create a base of information structures (models) defining their forms and their content so as to be able to deal with them automatically. The module deals with the various stages of form treatment, from acquisition to modelisation. It is composed of three different stages. The first corresponds to low-level processing-i.e., binarisation, skew correction. The second extracts the informative features contained in the forms. The last one organises the different features to obtain form modelisation thanks to a hierarchical structure. The creation of this base of information structures will be used for a second module for type form identification based on the comparison of these information structures."

This document treatment system will be applied on forms received by the CAF-Caisse d'Allocations Familiales-the French national family allowance Department. The form description module is composed by 3 main stages, from acquisition to structuration. The first one corresponds to the acquisition and the correction of the potential skew detected on the scanned image. The second extracts the informative features contained in forms. The last one organises the different features to obtain a hierarchical structuration of forms."

This rule is independent of the underlying joint distribution on the sample points and their classifications, and hence the probability of error R of such a rule must be at least as great as the Bayes probability of error R^{\\ast} --the minimum probability of error over all decision rules taking underlying probability structure into account. However, in a large sample analysis, we will show in the M -category case that R^{\\ast} \\leq R \\leq R^{\\ast}(2 --MR^{\\ast}/(M-1)) , where these bounds are the tightest possible, for all suitably smooth underlying distributions. Thus for any number of categories, the probability of error of the nearest neighbor rule is bounded above by twice the Bayes probability of error. In this sense, it may be said that half the classification information in an infinite sample set is contained in the nearest neighbor."

The basic approach consists of applying error transformations to the productions of context-free grammars in order to generate new grammars (also context-free) capable of describing not only the original error-free patterns, but also patterns containing specific types of errors such as deleted, added, and interchanged symbols which arise often in the pattern-scanning process. Theoretical developments are illustrated in the framework of a syntactic recognition system for chromosome structures."
