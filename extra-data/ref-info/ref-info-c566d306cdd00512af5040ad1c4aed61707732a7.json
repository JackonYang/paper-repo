An analytic camera model is used to predict the location and appearance of landmarks in the image, generating a projection for an assumed viewpoint. Correspondence is achieved by adjusting the parameters of the camera model until the appearances of the landmarks optimally match a symbolic description extracted from the image. \n \nThe matching of image and map features is performed rapidly by a new technique, called \"chamfer matching\", that compares the shapes of two collections of shape fragments, at a cost proportional to linear dimension, rather than area. These two techniques permit the matching of spatially extensive features on the basis of shape, which reduces the risk of ambiguous matches and the dependence on viewing conditions inherent in conventional image based correlation matching."

The resultant planar subdivision is called the Dirichlet tessellation; it is one of the most useful constructs associated with such a point configuration. The regions, which we call tiles, are also known as Voronoi or Thiessen polygons. We describe a recursive algorithm for computing the tessellation in a highly efficient way, and discuss the problems which arise in its implementation. Samples of graphical output demonstrate the application of the program on a modest scale; its efficiency allows its application to large sets of data, and detailed discussion of space and time considerations is given, based in part on theoretical predictions and in part on test runs on up to 10,000 points."
