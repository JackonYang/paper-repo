This is challenging because faces in a feature-length film are relatively uncontrolled with a wide variability of scale, pose, illumination, and expressions, and also may be partially occluded. We develop a recognition method based on a cascade of processing steps that normalize for the effects of the changing imaging environment. In particular there are three areas of novelty: (i) we suppress the background surrounding the face, enabling the maximum area of the face to be retained for recognition rather than a subset; (ii) we include a pose refinement step to optimize the registration between the test image and face exemplar; and (iii) we use robust distance to a sub-space to allow for partial occlusion and expression change. The method is applied and evaluated on several feature length films. It is demonstrated that high recall rates (over 92%) can be achieved whilst maintaining good precision (over 93%)."

Whilst much work has been done on (mainly frontal) face detection and recognition, current methods are not sufficiently robust to deal with the wide variations in pose and appearance found in such video. These include variations in scale, illumination, expression, partial occlusion, motion blur, etc. We describe two areas of innovation: the first is to capture the 3-D appearance of the entire head, rather than just the face region, so that visual features such as the hairline can be exploited. The second is to combine discriminative and 'generative' approaches for detection and recognition. Images rendered using the head model are used to train a discriminative tree-structured classifier giving efficient detection and pose estimates over a very wide pose range with three degrees of freedom. Subsequent verification of the identity is obtained using the head model in a 'generative' framework. We demonstrate excellent performance in detecting and identifying three characters and their poses in a TV situation comedy"

Indeed these variations can exceed those due to identity. Fortunately, videos of people have the happy benefit of containing multiple exemplars of each person in a form that can easily be associated automatically using straightforward visual tracking. We describe progress in harnessing these multiple exemplars in order to retrieve humans automatically in videos, given a query face in a shot. There are three areas of interest: (i) the matching of sets of exemplars provided by \u201ctubes\u201d of the spatial-temporal volume; (ii) the description of the face using a spatial orientation field; and, (iii) the structuring of the problem so that retrieval is immediate at run time. \n \nThe result is a person retrieval system, able to retrieve a ranked list of shots containing a particular person in the manner of Google. The method has been implemented and tested on two feature length movies."

In this paper, we present a learning framework to automate the face annotation in family photograph albums. Firstly, methodologies of content-based image retrieval and face recognition are seamlessly integrated to achieve automated annotation. Secondly, face annotation is formulated in a Bayesian framework, in which the face similarity measure is defined as maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation. Thirdly, to deal with the missing features, marginal probability is used so that samples which have missing features are compared with those having the full feature set to ensure a non-biased decision. The experimental evaluation has been conducted within a family album of few thousands of photographs and the results show that the proposed approach is effective and efficient in automated face annotation in family albums."

Extending the retrieved region to a window around the matching keyword provides better recall, but low precision. We improve on text retrieval using the following approach: First we segment the visual stream into coherent story-like units, using a set of visual news story delimiters. After filtering out clearly irrelevant classes of shots, we are still left with an ambiguity of how words in the transcript relate to the visual content in the remaining shots of the story. Using a limited set of visual features at different semantic levels ranging from color histograms, to faces, cars, and outdoors, an association matrix captures the correlation of these visual features to specific transcript words. This matrix is then refined using an EM approach. Preliminary results show that this approach has the potential to significantly improve retrieval performance from text queries."

We present in this paper an application of person recognition using costumes, in order to show the relevance of costume for indexation. The recognition is carried out by extracting the costume of all the persons who appear in the video. Then, their reappearance in subsequent frames is performed by searching the reappearance of their costume. The human presence is detected by searching faces, and then a feature for costume is extracted according to the scale and the location of each face. The Bhattacharyya coefficient, which is a coefficient derived from the Bayes error, is used to compare the color distribution of the various costumes. Finally, some results of people recognition are presented, as well as different axes for further research."

Such clustering requirements are generic to a number of problems in computer vision.We extend existing techniques for affine-invariant clustering, and show that the new distance metric outperforms existing approximations to affine invariant distance computation, particularly under large transformations. In addition, we incorporate prior probabilities on the transformation parameters. This further regularizes the solution, mitigating a rare but serious tendency of the existing solutions to diverge. For the particular special case of corresponding point sets we demonstrate that the affine invariant measure we introduced may be obtained in closed form.As an application of these ideas we demonstrate that the faces of the principal cast of a feature film can be generated automatically using clustering with appropriate invariance. This is a very demanding test as it involves detecting and clustering over tens of thousands of images with the variances including changes in viewpoint, lighting, scale and expression."

Humans are modeled as flexible assemblies of parts, and robust part detection is the key to the approach. The parts are represented by co-occurrences of local features which captures the spatial layout of the partrsquos appearance. Feature selection and the part detectors are learnt from training images using AdaBoost. The detection algorithm is very efficient as (i) all part detectors use the same initial features, (ii) a coarse-to-fine cascade approach is used for part detection, (iii) a part assembly strategy reduces the number of spurious detections and the search space. The results outperform existing human detectors."

We adopt an architecture that first employs discriminative detection of visual speech and articulate features, and then performs recognition using a model that accounts for the loose synchronization of the feature streams. Discriminative classifiers detect the subclass of lip appearance corresponding to the presence of speech, and further decompose it into features corresponding to the physical components of articulate production. These components often evolve in a semi-independent fashion, and conventional viseme-based approaches to recognition fail to capture the resulting co-articulation effects. We present a novel dynamic Bayesian network with a multi-stream structure and observations consisting of articulate feature classifier scores, which can model varying degrees of co-articulation in a principled way. We evaluate our visual-only recognition system on a command utterance task. We show comparative results on lip detection and speech/non-speech classification, as well as recognition performance against several baseline systems"

Our work is motivated by the pictorial structure models introduced by Fischler and Elschlager. The basic idea is to represent an object by a collection of parts arranged in a deformable configuration. The appearance of each part is modeled separately, and the deformable configuration is represented by spring-like connections between pairs of parts. These models allow for qualitative descriptions of visual appearance, and are suitable for generic recognition problems. We address the problem of using pictorial structure models to find instances of an object in an image as well as the problem of learning an object model from training examples, presenting efficient algorithms in both cases. We demonstrate the techniques by learning models that represent faces and human bodies and using the resulting models to locate the corresponding objects in novel images."

This work is distinguished by three key contributions. The first is the introduction of a new image representation called the \"integral image\" which allows the features used by our detector to be computed very quickly. The second is a learning algorithm, based on AdaBoost, which selects a small number of critical visual features from a larger set and yields extremely efficient classifiers. The third contribution is a method for combining increasingly more complex classifiers in a \"cascade\" which allows background regions of the image to be quickly discarded while spending more computation on promising object-like regions. The cascade can be viewed as an object specific focus-of-attention mechanism which unlike previous approaches provides statistical guarantees that discarded regions are unlikely to contain the object of interest. In the domain of face detection the system yields detection rates comparable to the best previous systems. Used in real-time applications, the detector runs at 15 frames per second without resorting to image differencing or skin color detection."

The features are invariant to image scaling, translation, and rotation, and partially invariant to illumination changes and affine or 3D projection. These features share similar properties with neurons in inferior temporal cortex that are used for object recognition in primate vision. Features are efficiently detected through a staged filtering approach that identifies stable points in scale space. Image keys are created that allow for local geometric deformations by representing blurred image gradients in multiple orientation planes and at multiple scales. The keys are used as input to a nearest neighbor indexing method that identifies candidate object matches. Final verification of each match is achieved by finding a low residual least squares solution for the unknown model parameters. Experimental results show that robust object recognition can be achieved in cluttered partially occluded images with a computation time of under 2 seconds."

After reviewing existing edge and gradient based descriptors, we show experimentally that grids of histograms of oriented gradient (HOG) descriptors significantly outperform existing feature sets for human detection. We study the influence of each stage of the computation on performance, concluding that fine-scale gradients, fine orientation binning, relatively coarse spatial binning, and high-quality local contrast normalization in overlapping descriptor blocks are all important for good results. The new approach gives near-perfect separation on the original MIT pedestrian database, so we introduce a more challenging dataset containing over 1800 annotated human images with a large range of pose variations and backgrounds."

FloatBoost learning uses a backtrack mechanism after each iteration of AdaBoost learning to minimize the error rate directly, rather than minimizing an exponential function of the margin as in the traditional AdaBoost algorithms. A second contribution of the paper is a novel statistical model for learning best weak classifiers using a stagewise approximation of the posterior probability. These novel techniques lead to a classifier which requires fewer weak classifiers than AdaBoost yet achieves lower error rates in both training and testing, as demonstrated by extensive experiments. Applied to face detection, the FloatBoost learning method, together with a proposed detector pyramid architecture, leads to the first real-time multiview face detection system reported."
