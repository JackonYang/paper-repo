Given the ubiquity of oxides in natural and synthetic materials, the technique may find applications in many areas of science.\n\n [1]: http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/299/5608/839\n [2]: http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/299/5608/870"

The resulting cellular morphology can be viewed as a high\u2013internal phase polymeric emulsion. Compared with traditional blending procedures, this process reduces the percolation threshold for electrical conductivity by a factor of 10, increases the conductivity by several orders of magnitude, and simultaneously improves thermal stability. Following this route, new applications can be envisaged for semiconducting polymer blends that require only minimal concentrations of doped pi-conjugated polymer."

We used solid-state embossing to produce polymer field-effect transistors with submicrometer critical features in planar and vertical configurations. Embossing is used for the controlled microcutting of vertical sidewalls into polymer multilayer structures without smearing. Vertical-channel polymer field-effect transistors on flexible poly(ethylene terephthalate) substrates were fabricated, in which the critical channel length of 0.7 to 0.9 micrometers was defined by the thickness of a spin-coated insulator layer. Gate electrodes were self-aligned to minimize overlap capacitance by inkjet printing that used the embossed grooves to define a surface-energy pattern."

Vibrational features were observed in the light-emission spectra that depended sensitively on the different molecular conformations and corresponding electronic states obtained by scanning tunneling spectroscopy. The high spatial resolution of the STM enabled the demonstration of variations in light-emission spectra from different parts of the molecule. These experiments realize the feasibility of fluorescence spectroscopy with the STM and enable the integration of optical spectroscopy with a nanoprobe for the investigation of single molecules."

However, many biologically relevant processes occur at micromolar ligand concentrations, necessitating a reduction in the conventional observation volume by three orders of magnitude. We show that arrays of zero-mode waveguides consisting of subwavelength holes in a metal film provide a simple and highly parallel means for studying single-molecule dynamics at micromolar concentrations with microsecond temporal resolution. We present observations of DNA polymerase activity as an example of the effectiveness of zero-mode waveguides for performing single-molecule experiments at high concentrations."

                "text": "Enhancement of polarization and related properties in heteroepitaxially constrained thin films of the ferroelectromagnet, BiFeO3 is reported. Structure analysis indicates that the crystal structure is monoclinic in contrast to bulk, which is rhombohedral. The films display a room-temperature spontaneous polarization (5060\u03bcC/cm) almost an order of magnitude higher than that of the bulk (6.1\u03bcC/cm). The observed enhancement is corroborated by first-principles calculations and found to originate from large relative displacements of the Bi, Fe, and O sublattices. The films also exhibit enhanced thickness-dependent magnetism compared with the bulk. These enhanced and combined functional responses in thin film form present an exciting opportunity to create and implement novel thin film devices that actively couple the magnetic and ferroelectric order parameters. Materials that have strong coupling between the electric, magnetic and structural order parameters, resulting in simultaneous ferroelectricity, ferromagnetism, and ferroelasticity, are known as multiferroics (1, 2). These compounds present exciting opportunities for potential applications in information storage, the emerging field of spintronics and sensors. There has been recent research interest in a number of prototypical magnetic ferroelectrics, including YMnO3, a hexagonal perovskite that is antiferromagnetic (Ne\u00e9l temperature, TN=70-130K) and ferroelectric (Curie temperature, TC=570-990K) in the ground state (3, 4), and BiMnO3, a monoclinic perovskite which is both ferromagnetic (TN~100K) and ferroelectric (TC~450K) (5, 6, 7). The perovskite BiFeO3 is ferroelectric (TC~1103K) and antiferromagnetic (TN~643K), exhibiting weak magnetism at room temperature due to a residual moment from a canted spin structure (2). The structure and properties of the bulk single crystal form have been extensively studied (8-12, 23), where it has been shown to possess a rhombohedrally distorted perovskite structure (a=b=c=5.63\u00c5, \u03b1=\u03b2=\u03b3=59.4 \u030a) at room temperature. In single crystals, the spontaneous polarization (Ps) is 3.5\u03bcC/cm 2 along the (001) direction, indicating a value of 6.1\u03bcC/cm along the (111) direction at 77K (10). Transport measurements in the bulk have been hampered by leakage problems, likely due to defects and non-stoichiometry, which have limited applications of this material. To overcome this, recent work has focused on solid solutions of BiFeO3 with other ABO3 (A is the cation at the vertices of the cube, B is the cation at the body center.) materials, such as BaTiO3, which can prevent second phase formation and increase sample resistivity. For example, K. Ueda et al reported a remanent polarization of 2.5\u03bcC/cm from (Bi0.7Ba0.3)(Fe0.7Ti0.3)O3 film (13). An important aspect that emerges upon examination of the properties of bulk BiFeO3 (single crystal or ceramic) is that the parent compound has a spontaneous polarization value that is significantly smaller than what would normally be expected for a ferroelectric with such a high Curie temperature (for example, lead titanate, with a Tc of ~763K has a spontaneous polarization of 80-100\uf06dC/cm.) Indeed, this anomalous behavior has been noted in an earlier report (10). It is not clear whether this is due to intrinsic material properties or due to limitations imposed by leakage and imperfect material quality in bulk. The resolution of this issue was the initial motivation of this study, which focuses on creating a model thin film BiFeO3 system via oxide heteroepitaxy. In our experiments, we grew phase-pure BiFeO3 (BFO) thin films in the thickness range of 50-500nm by pulsed laser deposition (PLD) onto single crystal SrTiO3(100) (STO) substrates. To ensure heteroepitaxial growth, we chose the conducting perovskite oxide electrode, SrRuO3 (SRO) (14). (Details of growth and characterization can be found in SOM.) Large angle x-ray scans (20-80 degrees) showed only diffraction peaks from the substrate and (00l) pseudo-cubic reflections from the heterostructure. We did not observe any reflections that would be indicative of second phases. Fig.1A shows a small section of the x-ray diffraction spectra from films of varying thickness, demonstrating the dependence of the BFO out-of-plane lattice parameter on film thickness (cf. Fig. 2D). Selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns (Fig.1B), as well as low magnification bright field images, obtained from a (100) cross-section confirm the single crystalline quality of the BFO layer. Analysis of the SAED pattern reveals that the (010) and (001) reflections have different spacings, yielding a ratio of 1.016. Indexing of this SAED pattern with pseudo-cubic indices yields an in-plane parameter of 3.935\u00c5 and an out-ofplane parameter of 4.0 \u00c5. Careful analyses of the crystal structure using four-circle x-ray diffraction suggests a tetragonal-like crystal structure with the c-axis normal to the substrate surface, with a small monoclinic distortion of about 0.5o. These experimental observations can be interpreted as a consequence of a compressive stress imposed by the SRO electrode, which has an in-plane lattice parameter smaller than that of BFO. These results lead to two key observations: (i) heteroepitaxial, in-plane compressive stress imposed by the epitaxial bottom electrode allows growth of a monoclinic crystal structure in BFO and, (ii) the degree of compressive stress progressively decreases with increasing BFO thickness (as expected). We probed the impact of this constrained crystallographic state in the BFO layer on its physical properties. Ferroelectric properties were characterized using both polarization hysteresis as well as pulsed polarization measurements. In the hysteresis loop measured at a frequency of 15kHz for the 200nm thick film (Fig.2A), the observed remanent polarization (Pr, 50-60\u03bcC/cm) is an order of magnitude higher than the highest reported value of 6.1\u03bcC/cm from bulk BFO. To confirm this result, we measured the polarization characteristics under pulsed probe condition, which is less likely to be convoluted by leakage and nonlinear dielectric effects. The pulsed remanent polarization, (defined as \uf044P=P*-P^\u22482Pr where P* is the switched polarization and P^ is the nonswitched polarization) vs. applied electric field, measured using 10\uf06dsec wide pulses (Fig.2B) shows a sharp increase of \uf044P around 15MV/m reaching a value of about 100\u03bcC/cm at 55MV/m. The films display resistivity values of ~10\uf057\uf02ecm, which is comparable with values obtained for epitaxial Ti-rich lead zirconate titanate (PZT) films. This polar state was found to be stable, as evidenced by polarization retention experiments conducted over several days. Additional support for the spontaneous polar state comes from piezoelectric measurements. The piezoelectric hysteresis loop (Fig.2C), measured using a scanning force microscope (Details of technique can be found in SOM), shows a remanent out-of-plane piezoelectric coefficient (d33) value of 70pm/V, representing the piezoresponse of the film in the fully clamped state and is comparable to that obtained from Ti-rich PZT films (Zr/Ti ratio of 20/80) (15). Fig.2D summarizes the thickness dependence of the polarization and piezoelectric coefficient. While the polarization increases with reducing film thickness, the d33 value decreases. The small signal out-of-plane dielectric constant (\uf06533), follows the same trend as the d33 measurements. In the case of epitaxial PbTiO3 and BaTiO3 films, in-plane compressive stresses lead to a decrease of \uf06533, along with an enhancement of the spontaneous polarization (16). The thickness dependence observed in Fig.2D can be similarly understood as a direct consequence of the induced compressive stress imposed by heteroepitaxy. To understand the experimental data at the atomic level, we turned to first principles calculations of total energy and polarization. These calculations were carried out within a local spin-density approximation (LSDA) with a plane wave basis set and projector augmented wave pseudopotentials using the Vienna Ab-initio Simulation Package (VASP) (17, 18). (All calculations have been verified with another plane wavepseudopotential package, ABINIT (19).) For a number of ferroelectric oxides, the spontaneous polarization has been accurately computed from first principles (20) using the Berry-phase formalism (21, 22). Specifically, this determines a discrete set of allowed values for the electronic contribution to the polarization Pel+2eR/\uf057, where R is a lattice vector, \uf057 is the unit cell volume, and e is the charge of the electron. The possible values for the change in polarization with switching (equal to twice the spontaneous polarization) are then 2P0+2eR/\uf057\uf02e Bellow, we report as the spontaneous polarization a single choice for P0 parallel to a given direction. We first investigated the bulk rhombohedral phase by optimizing the structural parameters of BiFeO3 in a 10-atom unit cell with space group R3c (Fig.3C). The structure can be described as a distorted perovskite. The ground state is found to be an antiferromagnetic insulator with a lattice constant of 5.459 \u00c5 and a rhombohedral angle of 60.36, to be compared with the experimental values 5.6343 \u00c5 and 59.348 (23), deviations typical of the LSDA. The absence of centrosymmetry in R3c permits the relative displacements of the atomic sublattices along (111), most notably those of Bi with respect to the distorted FeO6 cages, and the minimum energy structure has values of these displacements in excellent agreement with experimental structural determinations. The Berry-phase calculation yields a spontaneous polarization P0 = +6.61\uf06dC/cm 2 along (111), in excellent agreement with the reported bulk value of 6.1\uf06dC/cm. For the thin-film phase, we considered a tetragonal structure based on the cubic perovskite structure with symmetry lowered to P4mm (i.e., we ignored the small monoclinic distortion). The lattice parameters were fixed to the pseudo-tetragonal"

The voltage that was produced fit a logarithmic velocity dependence over nearly six decades of velocity. The magnitude of the voltage depended sensitively on the ionic conductivity and on the polar nature of the liquid. Our measurements suggest that the dominant mechanism responsible for this highly nonlinear response involves a direct forcing of the free charge carriers in the nanotubes by the fluctuating Coulombic field of the liquid flowing past the nanotubes. We propose an explanation based on pulsating asymmetric ratchets. Our work highlights the device potential for nanotubes as sensitive flow sensors and for energy conversion."

Barriers are magnesium dependent and correspond to known intra- and interdomain interactions. Several barrier structures are \u201cbrittle,\u201d breakage requiring high forces but small (1 to 3 nanometers) deformations. Barrier crossing is stochastic, leading to variable unfolding paths. The response of complex RNA structures to locally applied mechanical forces may be analogous to the responses of RNA during translation, messenger RNA export from the nucleus, and viral replication."

The measured rate constants were 4.0 \u00d7 10\u22126 per second in nitrogen and 4 \u00d7 10\u22125 per second in argon. Calculations indicated that at this temperature the reaction proceeds from a single quantum state of the reactant so that the computed rate constant has achieved a temperature-independent limit. According to calculations, the tunneling contribution to the rate is 152 orders of magnitude greater than the contribution from passage over the barrier. We discuss environmental effects of the solid-state inert-gas matrix on the reaction rate."

Right-handed double helices of the oligonucleotides,nCu2+\u00b7d(5\u2032-GH nC-3\u2032)2(n = 1 to 5), were quantitatively formed through copper ion (Cu2+)\u2013mediated alternative base pairing (H-Cu2+-H), where the Cu2+ ions incorporated into each complex were aligned along the helix axes inside the duplexes with the Cu2+-Cu2+ distance of 3.7 \u00b1 0.1 angstroms. The Cu2+ ions were coupled ferromagnetically with one another through unpaired d electrons to form magnetic chains."

The subsequent nitriding kinetics of the treated iron with the nanostructured surface layer were greatly enhanced, so that the nitriding temperature could be as low as 300\u00b0C, which is much lower than conventional nitriding temperatures (above 500\u00b0C). This enhanced processing method demonstrates the technological significance of nanomaterials in improving traditional processing techniques and provides a new approach for selective surface reactions in solids."

Therefore, there has long been an urgent need for a robust and accurate predictive model for this spectrum. In our work on the high-resolution spectrum of water, we report first-principles calculations that approach experimental accuracy. To achieve this, we performed exceptionally large electronic structure calculations and considered a variety of effects, including quantum electrodynamics, which have routinely been neglected in studies of small many-electron molecules. The high accuracy of the resulting ab initio procedure is demonstrated for the main isotopomers of water."

However, for nanoscopic particles, thermal fluctuations compete with interfacial energy and give rise to a particle-size\u2013dependent self-assembly. Ligand-stabilized nanoparticles assembled into three-dimensional constructs at fluid-fluid interfaces, where the properties unique to the nanoparticles were preserved. The small size of the nanoparticles led to a weak confinement of the nanoparticles at the fluid interface that opens avenues to size-selective particle assembly, two-dimensional phase behavior, and functionalization. Fluid interfaces afford a rapid approach to equilibrium and easy access to nanoparticles for subsequent modification. A photoinduced transformation is described in which nanoparticles, initially soluble only in toluene, were transported across an interface into water and were dispersed in the water phase. The characteristic fluorescence emission of the nanoparticles provided a direct probe of their spatial distribution."

We found that H c2decreased steeply as doping increased, in both single and bilayer cuprates. This relationship implies that the Cooper pairing potential displays a trend opposite to that of the superfluid density versus doping. The coherence length of the pairs \u03be0 closely tracks the gap measured by photoemission. We discuss implications for understanding the doping dependence of the critical temperatureT c0."

We identified a specific inhibitor of nonmuscle myosin II, blebbistatin, that inhibited contraction of the cleavage furrow without disrupting mitosis or contractile ring assembly. Using blebbistatin and other drugs, we showed that exit from the cytokinetic phase of the cell cycle depends on ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis. Continuous signals from microtubules are required to maintain the position of the cleavage furrow, and these signals control the localization of myosin II independently of other furrow components."

To investigate the mechanism of spontaneous cell polarization, we used an assay in yeast where expression of an activated form of Cdc42, a Rho-type guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) required for cell polarization, could generate cell polarity without any recourse to a preestablished physical cue. The polar distribution of Cdc42 in this assay required targeted secretion directed by the actin cytoskeleton. A mathematical simulation showed that a stable polarity axis could be generated through a positive feedback loop in which a stochastic increase in the local concentration of activated Cdc42 on the plasma membrane enhanced the probability of actin polymerization and increased the probability of further Cdc42 accumulation to that site."

Synthesis of the CN ligands requires the activity of two hydrogenase maturation proteins: HypF and HypE. HypF is a carbamoyltransferase that transfers the carbamoyl moiety of carbamoyladenylate to the COOH-terminal cysteine of HypE and thus forms an enzyme-thiocarbamate. HypE dehydrates theS-carbamoyl moiety in an adenosine triphosphate\u2013dependent process to yield the enzyme thiocyanate. Chemical model reactions corroborate the feasibility of this unprecedented biosynthetic route and show that thiocyanates can donate CN to iron. This finding underscores a striking parallel between biochemistry and organometallic chemistry in the formation of an iron-cyano complex."

                "text": "In his News Focus \u201cTapping DNA for structures produces a trickle\u201d (1 Nov., p. 948), Robert Service presents an informative viewpoint about the progress of the structural genomics consortia. He describes how a number of consortia have targeted a vast number of proteins but only solved a small fraction of them. Although this is true, it is important to realize that structural genomics projects have been organized to evaluate large numbers of candidate targets, often of the same protein in different organisms, and simultaneously work on them in parallel. The aim is to determine the structure of representatives of particular protein families; thus, the representatives that do not come to fruition are not necessarily failures but are often simply the consequence of success elsewhere. For example, according to the International Structural Genomics Target Tracking Database ([1][1]), over 360 new three-dimensional protein structures have been completed by the various consortia and many more are nearly done. These proteins, which were selected because of their unique position in sequence space, have actually shed light on further thousands of homologous proteins whose structures can now be modeled for the first time. Thus, the output of structural genomics is highly leveraged, being much greater than the absolute number of new experimental structures.\n\nMoreover, the number of targets selected does not represent a final end-point for the current structural genomics consortia in the way that the entire human genome represented an end-point for genome sequencing. The current consortia, in fact, represent pilot projects with a primary mandate of testing multiple technologies in order to identify the best procedures for scaling up. Accordingly, the \u201csuccess rates\u201d reported by Service represent snapshots of an ongoing iterative process. For many of the protein targets reported as being \u201cselected,\u201d no effort has even been made yet to clone or express them. Consequently, comparing outcome versus number of \u201cselected\u201d targets can result in a somewhat misleading picture of the current progress of the nascent structural genomics efforts.\n\n1.

Nature points the way in this endeavor: different enantiomers of a given biomolecule can exhibit dramatically different biological activities, and enzymes have therefore evolved to catalyze reactions with exquisite selectivity for the formation of one enantiomeric form over the other. Drawing inspiration from these natural catalysts, chemists have developed a variety of synthetic small-molecule catalysts that can achieve levels of selectivity approaching, and in some cases matching, those observed in enzymatic reactions."

Known amyloid inhibitors appear to function by shifting the aggregation equilibrium away from the amyloid state. Here, we describe a series of transthyretin amyloidosis inhibitors that functioned by increasing the kinetic barrier associated with misfolding, preventing amyloidogenesis by stabilizing the native state. The trans-suppressor mutation, threonine 119 \u2192 methionine 119, which is known to ameliorate familial amyloid disease, also functioned through kinetic stabilization, implying that this small-molecule strategy should be effective in treating amyloid diseases."

Here the \u03b1-mannosidase I\u2013like protein EDEM was shown to extract misfolded glycoproteins, but not glycoproteins undergoing productive folding, from the calnexin cycle. EDEM overexpression resulted in faster release of folding-incompetent proteins from the calnexin cycle and earlier onset of degradation, whereas EDEM down-regulation prolonged folding attempts and delayed ERAD. Up-regulation of EDEM during ER stress may promote cell recovery by clearing the calnexin cycle and by accelerating ERAD of terminally misfolded polypeptides."

Current models suggest that substrates access the internal catalytic sites by processively threading their termini through the gated substrate channel. Here, we found that latent (closed) and activated (open) proteasomes degraded two natively disordered substrates at internal peptide bonds even when they lacked accessible termini, suggesting that these substrates themselves promoted gating of the proteasome. This endoproteolysis provides a molecular mechanism for regulated release of transcription factors from inactive precursors as well as a means of accessing internal folding defects of misfolded multidomain proteins."

In apparent violation of this law, [ Scully et al ][1]. propose a heat engine that uses quantum coherence to extract work from a single, warm gas. In his Perspective, [Linke][2] explains that the Second Law is not violated, because the power extracted from the bath is smaller than that required to achieve coherence. By combining quantum mechanics with traditional heat engines, the efficiencies of various kinds of motors could be enhanced.\n\n [1]: http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/299/5608/862\n [2]: http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/299/5608/841"

We report the vibrational spectra of the OH\u2212\u00b7(H2O)n and F\u2212\u00b7(H2O)n clusters and interpret the pattern of OH stretching fundamentals with ab initio calculations. The spectra of the cold complexes are obtained by first attaching weakly bound argon atoms to the clusters and then monitoring the photoinduced evaporation of these atoms when an infrared laser is tuned to a vibrational resonance. The small clusters (n \u2264 3) display an isolated, sharp feature near the free OH stretching vibration, the signature of open solvation morphologies where each water molecule binds independently to the ion. Pronounced changes in the spectra are observed at n = 4 in the hydroxide ion and at n = 5 in the fluoride ion. In both cases, new features appear in the region typically associated with interwater hydrogen bonding. This behavior establishes that the primary hydration shells occur at n = 3 and 4 in hydroxide and fluoride, respectively."

Results demonstrate that the 65\u00b0C fluids from 3.5-million-year-old ocean crust support microbial growth. Ribosomal RNA gene sequence data indicate the presence of diverse Bacteria and Archaea, including gene clones of varying degrees of relatedness to known nitrate reducers (with ammonia production), thermophilic sulfate reducers, and thermophilic fermentative heterotrophs, all consistent with fluid chemistry."

We exchanged neural crest cells destined to participate in beak morphogenesis between two anatomically distinct species. Quail neural crest cells produced quail beaks in duck hosts and duck neural crest produced duck bills in quail hosts. These transformations involved morphological changes to non\u2013neural crest host beak tissues. To achieve these changes, donor neural crest cells executed autonomous molecular programs and regulated gene expression in adjacent host tissues. Thus, neural crest cells are a source of molecular information that generates interspecific variation in beak morphology."

In such a state, the work output-or, crudely, the product of the heat flux and the temperature gradient driving it-is maximized. But, as [Lorenz][1] explains in his Perspective, no reason for why systems should choose this state has been known.

EDEM, a postulated Man8B-binding protein, accelerates the degradation of misfolded proteins in the ER. Here, EDEM was shown to interact with calnexin, but not with calreticulin, through its transmembrane region. Both binding of substrates to calnexin and their release from calnexin were required for ERAD to occur. Overexpression of EDEM accelerated ERAD by promoting the release of terminally misfolded proteins from calnexin. Thus, EDEM appeared to function in the ERAD pathway by accepting substrates from calnexin."

Seismicity and ground deformation show that since 1994, a huge volume of magma intruded beneath the volcano, producing from 1998 onward a series of eruptions at the summit and on the flank of the volcano. The last of these, started on 27 October 2002, is still in progress and can be considered one of the most explosive eruptions of the volcano in recent times. Here we show how geodetic data and seismic deformation, between 1994 and 2001, indicate a radial compression around an axial intrusion, consistent with a repressurization of Mount Etna's plumbing system at a depth of 6 to 15 kilometers, which triggered most of the seismicity and provoked the dilatation of the volcano and the recent explosive eruptive activity."

In a genetic selection for budding yeast mutants that were defective in induction of the phosphate-responsive PHO5 gene, we identified mutations inARG82/IPK2, which encodes a nuclear inositol polyphosphate kinase. In arg82 mutant strains, remodeling ofPHO5 promoter chromatin is impaired, and the adenosine triphosphate\u2013dependent chromatin-remodeling complexes SWI/SNF and INO80 are not efficiently recruited to phosphate-responsive promoters. These results suggest a role for the small molecule inositol polyphosphate in the regulation of chromatin remodeling and transcription."

However, the number and diversity of the applications are modest, perhaps in part because of perceived or real limitations of biocatalysts, such as limited enzyme availability, substrate scope, and operational stability. Recent scientific breakthroughs in genomics, directed enzyme evolution, and the exploitation of biodiversity should help to overcome these limitations. As a result, we expect many new industrial applications of biocatalysis to be realized, from single-step enzymatic conversions to customized multistep microbial synthesis by means of metabolic pathway engineering."

We purified the protein insertion complex (TIM22 complex), a twin-pore translocase that mediated the insertion of precursor proteins in a three-step process. After the precursor is tethered to the translocase without losing energy from the \u0394\u03c8, two energy-requiring steps were needed. First, \u0394\u03c8 acted on the precursor protein and promoted its docking in the translocase complex. Then, \u0394\u03c8 and an internal signal peptide together induced rapid gating transitions in one pore and closing of the other pore and drove membrane insertion to completion. Thus, protein insertion was driven by the coordinated action of a twin-pore complex in two voltage-dependent steps."

By doubling the copy number of each gene, diploidy may increase the rate at which adaptive mutations are produced. However, models suggest that this does not necessarily accelerate adaptation by diploid populations. We tested model predictions regarding rates of adaptation using asexual yeast populations. Adaptive mutations were on average partially recessive. As predicted, diploidy slowed adaptation by large populations but not by small populations."

Its 4779-member proteome includes an elaborate apparatus for acquiring and hydrolyzing otherwise indigestible dietary polysaccharides and an associated environment-sensing system consisting of a large repertoire of extracytoplasmic function sigma factors and one- and two-component signal transduction systems. These and other expanded paralogous groups shed light on the molecular mechanisms underlying symbiotic host-bacterial relationships in our intestine."

These fates are chiefly determined by signals that originate from the T cell receptor (TCR), a single receptor complex with a remarkable capacity to decide between distinct cell fates. This review explores TCR signaling in thymocytes and focuses on the kinetic aspects of ligand binding, coreceptor involvement, protein phosphorylation, and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation. Understanding the logic of TCR signaling may eventually explain how thymocytes and T cells distinguish self from nonself, a phenomenon that has fascinated immunologists for 50 years."

A component in this pathway, Nicotiana tabacumNON-CELL-AUTONOMOUS PATHWAY PROTEIN1 (NtNCAPP1), was affinity purified and cloned. Protein overlay assays and in vivo studies showed that NtNCAPP1 is located on the endoplasmic reticulum at the cell periphery and displays specificity in its interaction with NCAPs. Deletion of the NtNCAPP1 amino-terminal transmembrane domain produced a dominant-negative mutant that blocked the trafficking of specific NCAPs. Transgenic tobacco plants expressing this mutant form of NtNCAPP1 and plants in which the NtNCAPP1 gene was silenced were compromised in their ability to regulate leaf and floral development. These results support a model in which NCAP delivery to plasmodesmata is both selective and regulated."

During maturation, the DCs acquire an enhanced capacity to form and accumulate peptide\u2013MHC (major histocompatibility complex) class II complexes. Here we show that a key mechanism responsible for this alteration was the generalized activation of lysosomal function. In immature DCs, internalized antigens were slowly degraded and inefficiently used for peptide loading. Maturation induced activation of the vacuolar proton pump that enhanced lysosomal acidification and antigen proteolysis, facilitating efficient formation of peptide\u2013MHC class II complexes. Lysosomal function in DCs thus appears to be specialized for the developmentally regulated processing of internalized antigens."

We show that each epipubic bone is part of a kinetic linkage extending from the femur, by way of the pectineus muscle, to the epipubic bone, through the pyramidalis and rectus abdominis muscles on one side of the abdomen, and through the contralateral external and internal oblique muscles to the vertebrae and ribs of the opposite side. This muscle series is activated synchronously as the femur and contralateral forelimb are retracted during the stance phase in locomotion. The epipubic bone acts as a lever that is retracted (depressed) to stiffen the trunk between the diagonal limbs that support the body during each step. This cross-couplet kinetic linkage and the stiffening function of the epipubic bone appear to be the primitive conditions for mammals."

There is a large star-to-star bulk scatter in the concentrations of heavy elements with respect to the lighter metals, which suggests an early chemically unmixed and inhomogeneous Galaxy. The relative abundance patterns among the heavy elements are often very different from the solar system mix, revealing the characteristics of the first element donors in the Galaxy. Abundance comparisons among several halo stars show that the heaviest neutron-capture elements (including barium and heavier) are consistent with a scaled solar system rapid neutron-capture abundance distribution, whereas the lighter such elements do not conform to the solar pattern. The stellar abundances indicate an increasing contribution from the slow neutron-capture process (s-process) at higher metallicities in the Galaxy. The detection of thorium in halo and globular cluster stars offers a promising, independent age-dating technique that can put lower limits on the age of the Galaxy."

We propose that chromosomal PARP molecules become activated by developmental or environmental cues and strip nearby chromatin proteins off DNA to generate a puff.

Concurrent with mwp-1A was the onset of the B\u00f8lling-Aller\u00f8d interstadial event (14,600 years before the present), which marked the termination of the last glacial period. Previous studies have been unable to reconcile a warm Northern Hemisphere with mwp-1A originating from the Laurentide or Fennoscandian ice sheets. With the use of a climate model of intermediate complexity, we demonstrate that with mwp-1A originating from the Antarctic Ice Sheet, consistent with recent sea-level fingerprinting inferences, the strength of North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) formation increases, thereby warming the North Atlantic region and providing an explanation for the onset of the B\u00f8lling-Aller\u00f8d warm interval. The established mode of active NADW formation is then able to respond to subsequent freshwater forcing from the Laurentide and Fennoscandian ice sheets, setting the stage for the Younger Dryas cold period."

The alternative \u201cgreenbeard\u201d mechanism, in which an allele directly recognizes and aids copies of itself in others, is generally thought to be too complex for a single gene to carry out. The csA gene inDictyostelium discoideum acts as a single-gene greenbeard. When wild-type cells are mixed with csA-knockout cells, the wild type is more altruistic, but is also able preferentially to direct the benefits to other wild-type cells. Both properties derive directly from homophilic cell adhesion of the protein encoded by csA."

A seasonally resolved record of titanium shows that the collapse of Maya civilization in the Terminal Classic Period occurred during an extended regional dry period, punctuated by more intense multiyear droughts centered at approximately 810, 860, and 910 A.D. These new data suggest that a century-scale decline in rainfall put a general strain on resources in the region, which was then exacerbated by abrupt drought events, contributing to the social stresses that led to the Maya demise."

We report that in mice with the melanopsin gene ablated, RGCs retrograde-labeled from the suprachiasmatic nuclei were no longer intrinsically photosensitive, although their number, morphology, and projections were unchanged. These animals showed a pupillary light reflex indistinguishable from that of the wild type at low irradiances, but at high irradiances the reflex was incomplete, a pattern that suggests that the melanopsin-associated system and the classical rod/cone system are complementary in function."

An immobilized library of partially degenerate phosphopeptides biased toward a particular protein kinase phosphorylation motif is used to isolate phospho-binding domains that bind to proteins phosphorylated by that kinase. Applying this approach to cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks), we identified the polo-box domain (PBD) of the mitotic kinase polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) as a specific phosphoserine (pSer) or phosphothreonine (pThr) binding domain and determined its optimal binding motif. This motif is present in known Plk1 substrates such as Cdc25, and an optimal phosphopeptide containing the motif disrupted PBD-substrate binding and localization of the PBD to centrosomes. This finding reveals how Plk1 can localize to specific sites within cells in response to Cdk phosphorylation at those sites and provides a structural mechanism for targeting the Plk1 kinase domain to its substrates."

Moreover, by engineering a scaffold that tethers a unique kinase set, we could create a synthetic MAP kinase pathway with non-natural input-output properties.

Here, we show that inositol polyphosphates can modulate the activities of several chromatin-remodeling complexes in vitro. Inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6) inhibits nucleosome mobilization by NURF, ISW2, and INO80 complexes. In contrast, nucleosome mobilization by the yeast SWI/SNF complex is stimulated by inositol tetrakisphosphate (IP4) and inositol pentakisphosphate (IP5). We demonstrate that mutations in genes encoding inositol polyphosphate kinases that produce IP4, IP5, and IP6 impair transcription in vivo. These results provide a link between inositol polyphosphates, chromatin remodeling, and gene expression."

Such consequences should be most evident in phylogenetic histories of groups that are ancient, widespread, and diverse. The squirrel family (Sciuridae) is one of very few mammalian families endemic to Eurasia, Africa, and North and South America and is ideal for examining these issues. Through phylogenetic and molecular-clock analyses, we infer that arrival and diversification of squirrels in Africa, on Sunda Shelf islands, across Beringea, and across the Panamanian isthmus coincide in timing and location with multiple well-documented sea-level, tectonic, and paleontological events. These precise correspondences point to an important role for global change in the diversification of a major group of mammals."

Here, we demonstrate that AON in soybean is controlled by the receptor-like protein kinase GmNARK (Glycine maxnodule autoregulation receptor kinase), similar toArabidopsis CLAVATA1 (CLV1). Whereas CLV1 functions in a protein complex controlling stem cell proliferation by short-distance signaling in shoot apices, GmNARK expression in the leaf has a major role in long-distance communication with nodule and lateral root primordia."

Elf \u2212/\u2212 mice exhibit a phenotype similar tosmad2 +/\u2212/smad3 +/\u2212mutant mice of midgestational death due to gastrointestinal, liver, neural, and heart defects. We show that TGF-\u03b2 triggers phosphorylation and association of ELF with Smad3 and Smad4, followed by nuclear translocation. ELF deficiency results in mislocalization of Smad3 and Smad4 and loss of the TGF-\u03b2\u2013dependent transcriptional response, which could be rescued by overexpression of the COOH-terminal region of ELF. This study reveals an unexpected molecular link between a major dynamic scaffolding protein and a key signaling pathway."

Here, we identified, cloned, and functionally expressed a previously undescribed human testicular OR, hOR17-4. With the use of ratiofluorometric imaging, Ca2+ signals were induced by a small subset of applied chemical stimuli, establishing the molecular receptive fields for the recombinantly expressed receptor in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells and the native receptor in human spermatozoa. Bourgeonal was a powerful agonist for both recombinant and native receptor types, as well as a strong chemoattractant in subsequent behavioral bioassays. In contrast, undecanal was a potent OR antagonist to bourgeonal and related compounds. Taken together, these results indicate that hOR17-4 functions in human sperm chemotaxis and may be a critical component of the fertilization process."

Genetic polymorphism analyses indicate that these clonal lineages emerged within the last 10,000 years after a single genetic cross. Comparison with ancient strains (\u223c1 million years) suggests that the success of the clonal lineages resulted from the concurrent acquisition of direct oral infectivity. This key adaptation circumvented sexual recombination, simultaneously promoting transmission through successive hosts, hence leading to clonal expansion. Thus, changes in complex life cycles can occur rapidly and can profoundly influence pathogenicity."

At the maternal-fetal interface, we investigated the expression of selectin adhesion systems that enable leukocyte capture from the bloodstream. On the maternal side, human uterine epithelial cells up-regulated selectin oligosaccharide-based ligands during the window of receptivity. On the fetal side, human trophoblasts expressed L-selectin. This ligand-receptor system was functional, because beads coated with the selectin ligand 6-sulfo sLex bound to trophoblasts, and trophoblasts bound to ligand-expressing uterine luminal epithelium in tissue sections. These results suggest that trophoblast L-selectin mediates interactions with the uterus and that this adhesion mechanism may be critical to establishing human pregnancy."

                "text": "euroscientists have long disputed whether activated neurons in the brain significantly increase their consumption of oxygen, or whether they exploit anaerobic metabolism for energy production. An elegant contribution from Thompson et al. on page 1070 of this issue (1) answers this question directly. In doing so, these authors make an important contribution to our understanding of a sophisticated brain imaging technique that pinpoints regions of neural activity by detecting changes in tissue oxygenation and blood volume. After neural activation (particularly in the cerebral cortex), an increase in blood flow produces an influx of oxygenated he-moglobin. This influx reduces the local concentration of deoxygenated hemoglo-bin (deoxyhemoglobin). This reduction can be measured by a sophisticated imaging technique called BOLD fMRI (blood oxygen level\u2013dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging). BOLD fMRI is used to pinpoint specific brain areas that are activated when certain tasks are performed (2). However, a paradox of the BOLD response is that the amount of oxygen supplied to activated neural tissue by the increase in blood flow seems far greater than would be required simply to meet the metabolic needs of the tissue. Optical imaging spectroscopy exploits the fact that oxygenated and deoxy-genated hemoglobin have different light absorption spectra (3\u20135). By measuring changes in remitted illumination at different wavelengths, it is possible to determine changes in tissue oxygenation and blood volume. Many experiments have investigated the hemodynamic response (that is, changes in blood volume and oxygenation resulting from increased blood flow) after neural activation. These experiments involved viewing the exposed brain through a small hole in the skull (cranial window) illuminated with light at visible wavelengths. Light of longer (near infrared) wavelengths can be used to \" see \" through the skull enabling noninvasive measurements to be made. Optical imaging spec-troscopy has revealed an early rise in the deoxyhemoglobin concentration of the rat and cat cortex after exposure to various stimuli (3\u20135). This finding suggested that the metabolic demands of activated neu-rons were being met by an increase in aer-obic metabolism. Similarly, subsequent BOLD fMRI studies showed a transient increase in the concentration of deoxyhemo-globin (often referred to as the \" initial dip \" in the BOLD signal) after stimulation of the visual cortex in humans (6, 7). The \" initial dip \" component of the BOLD response has been exploited to de-lineate areas of the cat visual cortex called ocular dominance columns. (Ocular dominance columns are regions of the \u2026"

However, form and motion typically interact in specific ways when natural objects move through the environment. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to measure cortical activation to long-range AM, compared to short-range AM and flicker, while we varied stability of structural differences between forms. Long-range AM activated the anterior-temporal lobe in the visual ventral pathway, and the response varied according to the form stability.

These chromosomes are thought to arise via the divergence of an ancestral autosome pair and are almost certainly influenced by differing selection in males and females. Exploring how sex chromosomes differ from autosomes is highly amenable to genomic analysis. We examined global gene expression inDrosophila melanogaster and report a dramatic underrepresentation of X-chromosome genes showing high relative expression in males. Using comparative genomics, we find that these same X-chromosome genes are exceptionally poorly conserved in the mosquito Anopheles gambiae. These data indicate that the X chromosome is a disfavored location for genes selectively expressed in males."

Are these hemodynamic changes regulated at a spatial scale capable of resolving functional columns within the cerebral cortex? To address this question, we made simultaneous measurements of tissue oxygenation and single-cell neural activity within the visual cortex. Results showed that increases in neuronal spike rate were accompanied by immediate decreases in tissue oxygenation. We used this decrease in tissue oxygenation to predict the orientation selectivity and ocular dominance of neighboring neurons. Our results establish a coupling between neural activity and oxidative metabolism and suggest that high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging may be used to localize neural activity at a columnar level."

Here we report that an inherited human dilated cardiomyopathy with refractory congestive heart failure is caused by a dominant Arg \u2192 Cys missense mutation at residue 9 (R9C) in phospholamban (PLN), a transmembrane phosphoprotein that inhibits the cardiac sarcoplasmic reticular Ca2+\u2013adenosine triphosphatase (SERCA2a) pump. Transgenic PLNR9C mice recapitulated human heart failure with premature death. Cellular and biochemical studies revealed that, unlike wild-type PLN, PLNR9C did not directly inhibit SERCA2a. Rather, PLNR9C trapped protein kinase A (PKA), which blocked PKA-mediated phosphorylation of wild-type PLN and in turn delayed decay of calcium transients in myocytes. These results indicate that myocellular calcium dysregulation can initiate human heart failure\u2014a finding that may lead to therapeutic opportunities."

It is generally thought that teeth are absent in placoderms and that the phylogenetic origin of teeth occurred after the evolution of jaws. However, we now report the presence of tooth rows in more derived placoderms, the arthrodires. New teeth are composed of gnathostome-type dentine and develop at specific locations. Hence, it appears that these placoderm teeth develop and are regulated as in other jawed vertebrates. Because tooth development occurs only in derived forms of placoderms, we suggest that teeth evolved at least twice, through a mechanism of convergent evolution."

Our analysis suggests that the ocean stored 14.8 petagrams of anthropogenic carbon from mid-1980 to mid-1989 and 17.9 petagrams of carbon from mid-1990 to mid-1999, indicating an oceanwide net uptake of 1.6 and 2.0 \u00b1 0.4 petagrams of carbon per year, respectively. Our results provide an upper limit on the solubility-driven anthropogenic CO2 flux into the ocean, and they suggest that most ocean general circulation models are overestimating oceanic anthropogenic CO2 uptake over the past two decades."

                "text": "Multiple sclerosis is a demyelinating disease, characterized by inflammation in the brain and spinal cord, possibly due to autoimmunity. Large-scale sequencing of cDNA libraries, derived from plaques dissected from brains of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), indicated an abundance of transcripts for osteopontin (OPN). Microarray analysis of spinal cords from rats paralyzed by experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model of MS, also revealed increased OPN transcripts. Osteopontin-deficient mice were resistant to progressive EAE and had frequent remissions, and myelin-reactive T cells in OPN-/- mice produced more interleukin 10 and less interferon-gamma than in OPN+/+ mice. Osteopontin thus appears to regulate T helper cell-1 (TH1)-mediated demyelinating disease, and it may offer a potential target in blocking development of progressive MS."

We examined the trafficking of AMPA-Rs into synapses in the developing rat barrel cortex. In vivo gene delivery was combined with in vitro recordings to show that experience drives recombinant GluR1, an AMPA-R subunit, into synapses formed between layer 4 and layer 2/3 neurons. Moreover, expression of the GluR1 cytoplasmic tail, a construct that inhibits synaptic delivery of endogenous AMPA-Rs during long-term potentiation, blocked experience-driven synaptic potentiation. In general, synaptic incorporation of AMPA-Rs in vivo conforms to rules identified in vitro and contributes to plasticity driven by natural stimuli in the mammalian brain."

                "text": "Wild yet cosmopolitan, squirrels are a diverse bunch. Ranging in size from just 15 grams to 7.5 kilograms, they and their relatives are adapted to many settings. Some are ground based and some live in trees; a few even soar through the air. Evolutionary biologists now have good evidence that shifting continents and global climate changes have helped create the diversity of the 273 species in this family.\n\nJohn Mercer and V. Louise Roth of Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, after studying how these species are related, constructed an evolutionary tree or phylogeny and dated major events. They found that key branches of the tree sprouted in parallel with geologic and climate changes, they report online this week in Science ( ).\n\nIn addition to offering a long-awaited phylogeny on squirrels, the results are exciting because they \u201cprovide a plausible and provocative scenario for the diversification of squirrels,\u201d says Richard Thorington, a mammalogist at the Smithsonian Institution National Museum of Natural History in Washington, D.C. For example, the data show that squirrels became common in South America only after the continent became connected to North America.\n\nMercer and Roth began with a modest goal. For their research on morphological features in different-sized species, they needed to know how the species were related. That question turned up an unexpected result: The pygmy squirrel they were studying had branched off earlier than expected from the main tree. The researchers expanded their analysis, spending the next decade gathering tissue from museum and live specimens representing 50 of the 51 genera. \u201cThis is an excellent species sampling, encompassing the whole biodiversity of living squirrels,\u201d says Emmanuel Douzery of the University of Montpellier in France. In an analysis Douzery praises, Mercer and Roth compared DNA sequences from three genes to determine which genera were close kin to others.\n\n![Figure][1] \n\nGlobal influences. \nFlying squirrels and their relatives trace their heritage to past habitat changes.\n\nCREDIT: LLOYD GLENN INGLES/CALIFORNIA ACADEMY OF SCIENCES\n\nThe work confirmed the researchers' initial view that the pygmy squirrel had branched off early. It also revealed surprises \u2014for instance, that flying squirrels all evolved more recently from a single ancestor than some had thought.\n\nMercer and Roth then calculated when various genera evolved, based on the number of changes in the DNA bases. Next, they looked for correlations among certain global changes\u2014such as shifting continents\u2014and these landmarks in squirrel evolution. In addition to the insights into squirrel life in Africa and South America, the study indicates that in Southeast Asia, a rising sea level broke widespread ancestral genera of tree squirrels into isolated populations, which quickly evolved into separate entities.\n\nThe work is part of \u201ca clear trend [to investigate] how speciation events may be explained by geological and environmental changes,\u201d says Douzery. And that, adds Harvard University paleobiologist Lawrence Flynn, is leading to \u201ca brave new world in which the data allow us to [envision] extraordinary scenarios.\u201d\n\n [1]: pending:yes"

The cornu ammonis (CA) fields 2 and 3 and the dentate gyrus were active relative to baseline only during encoding, and this activity decreased as associations were learned. Activity in the subiculum showed the same temporal decline, but primarily during retrieval.

Duke University ([1][1]) \u201c(Universities ask Supreme Court to reverse patent ruling,\u201d News of the Week, 3 Jan., p. [26][2]). Although I have a great deal of sympathy for the academic institutions that would like to avoid having to worry about patent infringement, the court probably delivered the correct legal opinion. The research (or experimental use) exemption to patent law has always been a very narrow exemption reserved for cases in which the use of the patented invention was for solely noncommercial purposes ([2][3]). Although the U.S. patent statute (35 U.S.C. 1\u201337) does not contain a research exemption, judges have created this narrow exemption in a line of cases interpreting the statute. Universities have for many years maintained that they and their employees are entitled to a research exemption because research conducted at the university is for noncommercial, i.e., academic, purposes. In an earlier era, this claim may have been substantially true, but it is no longer: The modern university serves academic and commercial purposes ([3][4]). Universities and university-based researchers now frequently conduct research for commercial purposes, hold patents and other intellectual properties, and also form start-up companies from new technologies. Universities also have their own technology transfer offices, which are designed to help researchers obtain patents, to encourage the development of useful inventions, and to protect the intellectual property interests of the university. It is probably the case that many (or even most) researchers at universities still conduct research for purely academic reasons, but a court would need to evaluate every case involving a researcher or a university on its own merits. Blanket assertions by universities like \u201call research conducted at universities qualifies for the research exemption\u201d are false and self-serving.\n\nHow should society respond to the Madey v. Duke University ruling? If the narrow research exemption found in case law no longer applies uniformly to the university setting, universities and university-based researchers will face two choices: (i) infringe patents and take a chance on litigation or (ii) negotiate licenses with patent holders. Both of these options would probably increase the administrative costs of conducting research because they would involve more work for attorneys and technology transfer offices. To reduce these costs and allow universities to continue business as usual, the patent statute could be amended to develop an explicit research exemption. Some commentators favor strengthening the research exemption in precisely this way ([4][5]). Although this sounds good in theory, it will probably meet stiff resistance in Congress, because private companies will certainly oppose any changes in current patent law that would undermine their intellectual property interests and create an uncertain legal environment. Furthermore, it may be very difficult to develop a clear and unambiguous definition in the statute that distinguishes between commercial and noncommercial research. One good thing that has come of this dispute is that the courts are now finally holding universities accountable for their own commercial activities. If universities want to receive the benefits of the patent system, i.e., financial gain, then they should also be prepared to bear the burdens, i.e., potential patent infringement. Justice and fair play demand that all of those who participate in the patent system play by its rules.\n\n1. [\u21b5][6] Madeyv. Duke University , 307 F.3d 1351 (2002).\n \n\n2. [\u21b5][7]1. J.

Here we show thatCyp1b1 \u2013/\u2013 mice have ocular drainage structure abnormalities resembling those reported in human PCG patients. UsingCyp1b1 \u2013/\u2013 mice, we identified the tyrosinase gene (Tyr) as a modifier of the drainage structure phenotype, with Tyr deficiency increasing the magnitude of dysgenesis. The severe dysgenesis in eyes lacking both CYP1B1 and TYR was alleviated by administration of the tyrosinase product dihydroxyphenylalanine (l-dopa). Tyr also modified the drainage structure dysgenesis in mice with a mutantFoxc1 gene, which is also involved in PCG. These experiments raise the possibility that a tyrosinase/l-dopa pathway modifies human PCG, which could open new therapeutic avenues."

Here, we concurrently examine larval duration and genetic population differentiation in a cleaner goby, Elacatinus evelynae, a member of the most species-rich genus of Caribbean reef fishes. Despite evidence for extended pelagic duration (21 days), populations ofE. evelynae show strong genetic differentiation: among color forms (1.36 to 3.04% divergent at mitochondrial cytochrome b) and among island populations within color forms (\u03a6ST up to 70%). These results suggest that marine populations can remain demographically closed for thousands of generations despite extended larval duration, and that recognition cues such as color may promote speciation when geographic barriers are transient or weak."

We identified a class of GABAergic interneurons, the neurogliaform cells, that, in contrast to other GABA-releasing cells, elicited combined GABAA and GABAB receptor\u2013mediated responses with single action potentials and that predominantly targeted the dendritic spines of pyramidal neurons.

The auditory system defined in this way occupied large portions of cerebral tissue, an extent probably second only to that of the visual system. Cortically, the activated areas included the entire superior temporal gyrus and large portions of the parietal, prefrontal, and limbic lobes. Several auditory areas overlapped with previously identified visual areas, suggesting that the auditory system, like the visual system, contains separate pathways for processing stimulus quality, location, and motion."

[1679][1]) is wise to advocate new means of encouraging science and technology training for future policy-makers in the United States. The National Defense Education Act is an informative model, not least for its expansive view of the critical skills the United States would require. By focusing on educating the next generation of public servants, however, Kennedy addresses only a part of the United States' intellectual deficit and only part of our opportunity.\n\nIn an era of dazzling opportunities across many scientific disciplines, our country has been disinvesting ([1][2]). Federally supported R&D shrank in 2000 to less than 0.7% of the gross domestic product\u2014a level last seen before the Soviets launched Sputnik. A laudable bipartisan effort to double the NIH budget has nourished biomedical research and training, but a steady attrition of investment has weakened the physical sciences and engineering. The Department of Energy's funding for the physical sciences has decreased by 20% since 1993. The number of graduate students has dropped proportionately, with U.S. students minorities in many departments.\n\nWhile continuing to welcome foreign students and sustaining our enormously beneficial position as graduate school to the world, we must take new steps to encourage and support the advanced graduate studies of U.S. citizens in science and engineering. An ambitious new program of graduate fellowships\u2014let us call them Benjamin Franklin fellowships\u2014would show students that our country values science and technology and would spur them toward creative public service. Graduate students we attract during this decade will help shape the world for half a century, so it would be shortsighted to target a few specialties. It would be better by far to attract more of our best students to the most interesting sciences and to inspire them, like Benjamin Franklin, to range over pure and applied science, engineering, and even statecraft!\n\n1.

We cloned ARGONAUTE4 (AGO4) from a screen for mutants that suppress silencing of the Arabidopsis SUPERMAN(SUP) gene. The ago4-1 mutant reactivated silentSUP alleles and decreased CpNpG and asymmetric DNA methylation as well as histone H3 lysine-9 methylation. In addition,ago4-1 blocked histone and DNA methylation and the accumulation of 25-nucleotide small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) that correspond to the retroelement AtSN1. These results suggest that AGO4 and long siRNAs direct chromatin modifications, including histone methylation and non-CpG DNA methylation."

Broadly virulent pathogens occurred more frequently in highly resistant host populations, whereas avirulent pathogens dominated susceptible populations. Experimental inoculations indicated a negative trade-off between spore production and virulence. The nonrandom spatial distribution of pathogens, maintained through time despite high pathogen mobility, implies that selection favors virulent strains ofMelampsora lini in resistant Linum marginalepopulations and avirulent strains in susceptible populations. These results are consistent with gene-for-gene models of host-pathogen coevolution that require trade-offs to prevent pathogen virulence increasing until host resistance becomes selectively neutral."

The DKC1 protein binds to the box H + ACA small nucleolar RNAs and the RNA component of telomerase. Here we show that hypomorphic Dkc1 mutant (Dkc1m ) mice recapitulate in the first and second generations (G1 and G2) the clinical features of DC.Dkc1m cells from G1 and G2 mice were impaired in ribosomal RNA pseudouridylation before the onset of disease. Reductions of telomere length in Dkc1m mice became evident only in later generations. These results suggest that deregulated ribosome function is important in the initiation of DC, whereas telomere shortening may modify and/or exacerbate DC."

The main hypotheses are that species composition is either (i) uniform over large areas, (ii) random but spatially autocorrelated because of dispersal limitation, or (iii) patchy and environmentally determined. Here we test these hypotheses, using a large data set from western Amazonia. The uniformity hypothesis gains no support, but the other hypotheses do. Environmental determinism explains a larger proportion of the variation in floristic differences between sites than does dispersal limitation; together, these processes explain 70 to 75% of the variation. Consequently, it is important that management planning for conservation and resource use take into account both habitat heterogeneity and biogeographic differences."

The increase in spring cloud amount radiatively balances changes in surface temperature and albedo, but during summer, fall, and winter, cloud forcing has tended toward increased cooling. This implies that, if seasonal cloud amounts were not changing, surface warming would be even greater than that observed.

                "text": "T he theme of this year's American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) annual meeting\u2014\u201cScience As a Way of Life\u201d\u2014speaks to both the science and engineering communities and to the broader public. The AAAS meeting draws hundreds of speakers whose work emphasizes the multidisciplinary nature of modern science and the role of science in society.\n\nFew scientists (or their spouses) would contest the view that being a scientist pervades all aspects of their lives, professional and personal. But science is really a way of life not only for scientists but for all people, whether they choose it or not. Virtually every major issue facing global society today has science and technology components at its core: terrorism and other forms of violence, economic productivity, health status, global warming, and the need for sustainable development. History has shown that when individuals and nations lack infrastructure and access to science and technology, they are doomed to lag behind their better-equipped counterparts.\n\nSome people are not so happy about how central science and technology are to their lives. Although in the United States the relationship between science and society is basically positive, science and technology often encounter skepticism and wariness in other parts of the world. In a recent address at the AAAS, Sir David King, science advisor to the British prime minister, reported the results of attitude surveys that showed substantial differences in the way people in the United States and the United Kingdom view science in general and certain issues in particular. For example, whereas Americans are basically positive about genetically modified foods, people in Britain are extremely wary. The British are supportive of therapeutic cloning, whereas Americans are mixed at best in their views. Differences also exist in attitudes to global climate change and policies to combat it.\n\nOne traditional response of the scientific community to what it views as a lack of appreciation or misinterpretations by the public has been to mount so-called public understanding or education campaigns designed to \u201cenlighten\u201d the populace, either about science in general or specific issues in particular. Some initiatives have been quite successful. Examples include campaigns about the dangers of air pollution and high blood pressure, and the negative health effects of smoking and lack of exercise.\n\nBut simply trying to educate the public about specific science-based issues is not working. Many science skeptics are already quite well educated, but they relate more to the risks of science and technology advances than to their benefits. Moreover, given the uncertainties in science, the best science-based strategy is not always as clear as we would like and as many in our community might claim. And widely publicized examples of scientific dishonesty, like the Schon case, or unacceptable scientific practice, like the Lomborg affair or repeated unverified claims of human cloning, are not only misleading but seriously erode the public's trust in science.\n\nThe centrality of science to modern life bestows an obligation on the scientific community to develop different and closer links with the general population. That convergence will help evolve the compact between science and society so that it will better reflect society's current needs and values. We need to move beyond what too often has been seen as a paternalistic stance. We need to engage the public in a more open and honest bidirectional dialogue about science and technology and their products, including not only their benefits but also their limits, perils, and pitfalls. We need to respect the public's perspective and concerns even when we do not fully share them, and we need to develop a partnership that can respond to them.\n\nWhen tried, that kind of engagement approach has been highly beneficial to all parties. The National Institutes of Health's (NIH's) efforts to increase meaningful public participation in both its advisory and grant review processes has been hailed as a great success by both the public and the NIH leadership. The U.S. Army's research programs have had similar successes in bringing public representation into the peer review of their clinical research programs. Science-based regulatory agencies have learned that stakeholder consultation makes all the work go better.\n\nTo help forge this new relationship between science and society, the AAAS is now putting together a new Center for Public Engagement with Science and Technology. This center will include our expanding educational programs about science and technology but will also provide a new forum through which the critical dialogue with the public can more easily occur. By more fully engaging the public with science, its priorities, and its portrayal, we hope to make more meaningful the fact that, like it or not, science is an ever-more pervasive way of life for all people."

To explore the role of sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) in the adult liver, we studied the effects of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor activation on mouse hepatocyte growth. Delivery of VEGF-A increased liver mass in mice but did not stimulate growth of hepatocytes in vitro, unless LSECs were also present in the culture. Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) was identified as one of the LSEC-derived paracrine mediators promoting hepatocyte growth. Selective activation of VEGF receptor\u20131 (VEGFR-1) stimulated hepatocyte but not endothelial proliferation in vivo and reduced liver damage in mice exposed to a hepatotoxin. Thus, VEGFR-1 agonists may have therapeutic potential for preservation of organ function in certain liver disorders."

                "text": "In their Policy Forum \u201cDirect payments to conserve biodiversity\u201d (29 Nov., p. [1718][1]), P. J. Ferraro and A. Kiss argue for more direct payments to conserve biodiversity instead of indirect interventions that are coupled to social-economic projects at the level of the rural community, because \u201csuch initiatives rarely work.\u201d The authors admit that there are many disadvantages to direct payments, e.g., inequitable land tenure, poor legislation, and possible misuse; however, such obstacles would also apply to indirect methods. They state, \u201cthe cheapest way to get something you want is to pay for what you want\u201d (p. 1719).\n\nIndeed, indirect social-economic interventions are not cheap and may not lead to clearly quantifiable conservation results. However, cost-efficiency is not the only consideration in conserving biodiversity. Duration is another important criterion. Direct payments are probably very effective in the short term; the authors present many examples. But, when the payment stops, continuation of conservation is uncertain because the external motivation has been taken away, or to put it more simply, \u201cno pay, no care.\u201d The loss of biodiversity is an irreversible process; direct payments may therefore only be successful if they pave the way for durable conservation practices. Otherwise, direct payments may be a waste of money because a long-lasting continuation of costly measures for the protection of collective goods as biodiversity or nature is not guaranteed in a world that is primarily driven by economic rules.\n\nIn addition, direct payments stress a vision of nature where countable, measurable, and monetary aspects dominate. There is nothing wrong with such a quantification of nature if we realize its shortcoming: Monetarization of nature may imply that nonnature alternatives that deliver the same service can be substituted for nature. In contrast, ethical, aesthetic, and spiritual motives for nature conservation ([1][2]) often imply the irreplaceability of nature. It is important to base valuation and conservation of nature on such robust motives that resist temporary, threatening trends. Debate and education are therefore important indirect tools ([2][3]).\n\nWe may conclude that conservation should be rooted in the life and mind of involved people to be successful in the long run. The view of Ferraro and Kiss matters, but we should look at direct payments as part of a wider perspective. For example, direct payment can function as a start-up method for more sustainable, locally embedded approaches or should be applied when direct, short-term intervention is needed because of a threatening catastrophe. Unfortunately, this latter situation seems often to be the case.\n\n1. [\u21b5][4]1. J. A. A. Swart, 2. H. J. van der Windt, 3. J. Keulartz\n , Restor. Ecol. 9, 230 (2001).\n [OpenUrl][5][CrossRef][6][Web of Science][7]\n\n2. [\u21b5][8]1. D. W. Orr\n , Conserv. Biol. 16, 1457 (2002).\n [OpenUrl][9][CrossRef][10]\n\n# Response {#article-title-2}\n\nSwart suggests that direct payments are useful as a stop-gap measure when there is a need to change peoples' behavior radically and urgently but that, on the whole, we should rely on \u201csustainable, locally embedded approaches\u201d to achieve conservation on a long-term basis. The appeal of self-financing conservation activities, which require outside investment only for a short time and then continue on their own steam to yield conservation and development benefits indefinitely, is obvious. Unfortunately, evidence of their existence is difficult to find. In some cases, the expected demand for the outputs fails to materialize; in other cases, demand becomes so great that it triggers nonsustainable exploitation or attracts competitors who can produce at lower cost by ignoring the conservation objectives. If the enterprises fail, the conservation link disappears (if there was one to begin with). In short, the \u201cno pay, no care\u201d dilemma is very real, but it applies to any conservation intervention. Biodiversity conservation is a public good, and, thus, one way or another, it must be subsidized because individuals will not voluntarily bear its cost on behalf of society at large. We believe that it makes practical and economic sense to subsidize conservation directly rather than indirectly.\n\nSwart argues that direct payments emphasize a vision of nature in which countable, measurable, and monetary aspects of nature dominate and that one should instead choose an approach that emphasizes the ethical, aesthetic, and spiritual motives for conservation. On the contrary, although direct payments may be in cash (or in kind), the motivations of those who provide payments are usually ethical, aesthetic, or spiritual. These motivations have certainly been strengthened by debate and education. We do not doubt that people who deplete biodiversity also have ethical, aesthetic, and spiritual values for nature. Biodiversity continues to be destroyed, however, because these noneconomic values have not been sufficiently robust to overcome economic forces. Debate and education cannot make these forces disappear. It is essential to counterbalance them by making it economically attractive (and feasible) for people to protect biodiversity instead of destroying it.\n\nSwart's argument that the use of payments would make nature a commodity like any other traded good or service misses the point that biodiversity is already a heavily traded commodity. It is an essential input into a variety of production activities such as fishing, logging, hunting, and agriculture. Unfortunately, local users can reap far greater economic rewards from depleting biodiversity than from conserving it. Biodiversity is being depleted for want of a better offer; payments will help rectify this problem.\n\nWe wholeheartedly agree with Swart that \u201cconservation should be rooted in the life and mind of involved people to be successful in the long run.\u201d However, we believe that such rooting is established through tangible incentives, not through wishful thinking that poor people in low-income nations will make substantial sacrifices in the short term for uncertain future rewards or for the benefit of the global community. Although direct payments are no \u201csilver bullet,\u201d they provide tangible incentives that can be flexibly and cost-efficiently linked to the protection of biodiversity in low-income nations. Given the lack of alternatives, we believe that direct payments for biodiversity conservation offer the best and most effective use of limited global conservation funds.\n\n [1]: /lookup/doi/10.1126/science.1078104\n [2]: #ref-1\n [3]: #ref-2\n [4]: #xref-ref-1-1 \"View reference 1 in text\"\n [5]: {openurl}?query=rft.jtitle%253DRestor.%2BEcol.%26rft.volume%253D9%26rft.spage%253D230%26rft.atitle%253DRESTOR%2BECOL%26rft_id%253Dinfo%253Adoi%252F10.1046%252Fj.1526-100x.2001.009002230.x%26rft.genre%253Darticle%26rft_val_fmt%253Dinfo%253Aofi%252Ffmt%253Akev%253Amtx%253Ajournal%26ctx_ver%253DZ39.88-2004%26url_ver%253DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%253Dinfo%253Aofi%252Ffmt%253Akev%253Amtx%253Actx\n [6]: /lookup/external-ref?access_num=10.1046/j.1526-100x.2001.009002230.x&link_type=DOI\n [7]: /lookup/external-ref?access_num=000169227600013&link_type=ISI\n [8]: #xref-ref-2-1 \"View reference 2 in text\"\n [9]: {openurl}?query=rft.jtitle%253DConserv.%2BBiol.%26rft.volume%253D16%26rft.spage%253D1457%26rft.atitle%253DCONSERV%2BBIOL%26rft_id%253Dinfo%253Adoi%252F10.1046%252Fj.1523-1739.2002.01668.x%26rft.genre%253Darticle%26rft_val_fmt%253Dinfo%253Aofi%252Ffmt%253Akev%253Amtx%253Ajournal%26ctx_ver%253DZ39.88-2004%26url_ver%253DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%253Dinfo%253Aofi%252Ffmt%253Akev%253Amtx%253Actx\n [10]: /lookup/external-ref?access_num=10.1046/j.1523-1739.2002.01668.x&link_type=DOI"

We show that the production of neuronal progenitors is stimulated in the forebrain subventricular zone of female mice during pregnancy and that this effect is mediated by the hormone prolactin. The progenitors then migrate to produce new olfactory interneurons, a process likely to be important for maternal behavior, because olfactory discrimination is critical for recognition and rearing of offspring. Neurogenesis occurs even in females that mate with sterile males. These findings imply that forebrain olfactory neurogenesis may contribute to adaptive behaviors in mating and pregnancy."

                "text": "There is a story about a smart crow, which has been told and retold to children in Indian households for many generations. A thirsty crow comes across a flask half filled with water. As it tries to drink the water through the narrow opening of the flask, the crow realizes that it cannot do so because the water level is lower than its beak can reach. Because the crow is smart, it comes up with a solution. It collects pebbles, one by one, and drops them into the flask. Gradually, the flask is filled with pebbles and the water level rises enough for the crow to be able to comfortably drink. The crow drinks the water and, satisfied, flies away. The moral of the story: be smart like this crow. I was wondering if the authors of the recent Brevia \u201cShaping of hooks in New Caledonian crows\u201d (A. A. S. Weir et al. , 9 Aug., p. 981) could try out this experiment with a host of New Caledonian and perhaps some Indian crows. In my view, this experiment represents an even more complex problem- solving task. If successful, not only will it solidify their theory, it could also tell something about the origins of folklore."

                "text": "C omics, poets, and sages have all expounded on what it means to age. But only now can we begin to converse about the biology of aging. Why and how do we age? Researchers have asked these questions, and some answers are finally emerging. To speed up this process, in 2001 Science , with the aid of a major gift from the Ellison Medical Foundation, launched the [Science of Aging Knowledge Environment (SAGE KE)][1]. This Web site provides \u201cone-stop shopping\u201d for researchers in the field of aging and related disciplines. For a start, SAGE KE helps researchers keep up with the literature. We offer scientist-authored commentaries and journalist-written news stories on current research findings. Visitors to our site can find authoritative reviews written by prominent scientists and can access a storehouse of community information: case studies, discussions, a calendar of meetings on aging, a database of genes/interventions and mouse models related to aging, and a directory of people working in the field. In addition, SAGEKE houses a virtual journal whose search engine is trained to find new papers on aging no matter where they are published. Access to SAGE KE is free until 26 March 2003.\n\nIn this joint special issue, Science and SAGE KE have teamed up to showcase highlights from what might be called the \u201cend of the beginning\u201d of research on aging. We have focused on physiological mechanisms underlying processes of aging, rather than on the large array of debilitating and costly disorders that so commonly emerge during the latter half of the life-spans of human beings. The reason for this decision is illustrated in the figure on page 1341. The \u201cone disorder at a time\u201d approach has limited power to delay death; rather, it is through deciphering the biological underpinnings of processes of aging that scientists will likely discover ways to extend the human life-span. This problem is being attacked from several angles, and we are seeing some emerging themes.\n\nFeeding fewer calories to rodents\u2014and likely primates too\u2014makes them more stress-resistant and, perhaps because they are more stress-resistant, they live considerably longer. Several other animal model systems have mutation-induced metabolic states that are similar to those produced by calorie restriction and are also designed for withstanding adverse conditions\u2014the dauer phase in the worm Caenorhabditis elegans , for example. These mechanisms are probably related to ancient and adaptive types of diapauses: time-outs from the business of reproduction while awaiting more favorable conditions. In their Review, Longo and Finch (p. [1342][2]) compare these long-lived creatures, ranging from yeast to mice, and point out the commonalties, such as defects in the insulin/insulin-like growth factor 1 signaling pathway. In SAGE KE, Masoro surveys the history of research on calorie restriction, and Hopkin explores the downside of eating less. It turns out to be more than just hunger pangs.\n\n![Figure][3] \n\nSOURCE: R. A. MILLER/UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN\n\nGenetic approaches in model systems have been a gold mine in divulging which processes can tune life-span up or down. And, when interpreted in the context of more traditional endocrinological approaches, genetic results point to endocrine regulation of critical life-span-controlling functions as a possible common pathway, as summarized in Tatar et al. 's Review (p. [1346][4]). In SAGE KE, Davenport explores new research that probes how well phenomena observed in the lab relate to those that occur in natural environments.\n\n![Figure][3] \n\nWhat are the critical downstream functions that are important for aging? Several answers are on the table, and they may well all be right. Some lines of evidence point to silencing of the expression of certain genes as a key regulator, argue Hekimi and Guarente in their Review (p. 1351), although the cumulative damage inflicted by reactive oxygen species is also a likely culprit. Indeed, in their Review, Hasty and co-workers (p. 1355) summarize how damage to DNA, perhaps by such oxygen radicals, can be better understood as a cause of aging through the comparison of clinical syndromes and mouse models. In SAGE KE, Shcherbakova and colleagues zero in on the DNA polymerases, which repair DNA damage, at least when they are working optimally; and Walter et al. examine the special case of germline genome stability.\n\nBut the topic of aging is far broader than genes and hormones and ultimately affects all of our daily lives in one way or another. For researchers in the field, their pursuits in the lab can also have a personal component, as seen firsthand in Guarente's book Ageless Quest , reviewed by Promislow in this issue (p. [1319][5]). And for many, aging can be painful, as is poignantly clear in Bush's review of DeBaggio's recent book recounting his own experiences with Alzheimer's disease (p. [1318][6]). But there is some good news. Two News stories by Helmuth, one in Science (p. [1300][7]) and one on SAGE KE, give us some reasons for looking forward to the latter half of our lives. Scores on vocabulary tests appear to improve with age, and older people often outperform younger ones in interpersonal tasks.\n\nResearch on aging is increasingly important in the public policy arena as well. The Policy Forum by Juengst (p. 1323) argues that we need to start thinking about the practical and ethical ramifications of research on aging now, before the decisions are made for us by circumstance. We at Science also believe that public debate on issues surrounding aging is essential. Consequently we will be launching, in March 2003, a new portal of SAGE KE to catalyze public discourse about issues surrounding aging. Built in partnership with the Alliance for Aging Research, this new site\u2014called SAGE Crossroads\u2014will feature a series of Webcast debates and interviews in which prominent figures discuss controversies in research and policies on aging. The first Webcast\u2014a discussion between Francis Fukuyama and Ronald Bailey entitled \u201cThe Future of Aging: Pitfalls and Possibilities\u201d\u2014occurred on 12 February and focused on the ethics of prolonging life. This debate, plus related news stories, discussions, and other resources, can be seen at SAGECrossroads. net. Scientific research on biological mechanisms of aging may be at the end of the beginning, but the larger discussions of why we study aging and the proper use for this knowledge are yet in their infancy.\n\nActor Charlie Chaplin once remarked that \u201cwe are all amateurs; we don't live long enough to become anything else.\u201d If aging processes could be attenuated, humans would have additional healthy years to bring their personal goals to fruition. The challenge to society will be to ensure that those goals are compatible with the needs of humanity.\n\n [1]: http://sageke.sciencemag.org/\n [2]: /lookup/doi/10.1126/science.1077991\n [3]: pending:yes\n [4]: /lookup/doi/10.1126/science.1081447\n [5]: /lookup/doi/10.1126/science.1081622\n [6]: /lookup/doi/10.1126/science.1079480\n [7]: /lookup/doi/10.1126/science.299.5611.1300"

The flavanol (\u2013)-epicatechin is a component of many CTs and contributes to flavor and astringency in tea and wine. We show that the BANYULS(BAN) genes from Arabidopsis thaliana andMedicago truncatula encode anthocyanidin reductase, which converts anthocyanidins to their corresponding 2,3-cis-flavan-3-ols. Ectopic expression of BAN in tobacco flower petals and Arabidopsis leaves results in loss of anthocyanins and accumulation of CTs."

                "text": "To preserve humanity's patrimony and diversity and avoid misappropriation by outsiders, laws should protect indigenous knowledge. Firms producing pharmaceutical, agricultural, and cosmetic goods have used ethnobotanical knowledge of indigenous people to develop commercial goods ([1][1], [2][2]). The commercial use of ethnobotanical knowledge raises concerns about payments owed to indigenous peoples who supply the knowledge ([3][3]). Indigenous peoples and their advocates say that ethnobotanical knowledge is held communally ([4][4]) and that firms should share the benefits from commercial uses of indigenous knowledge. Despite these claims, we do not know how much indigenous peoples share ethnobotanical knowledge. Here we use a cultural consensus model ([5][5]) to show that Tsimane' Amerindians share much ethnobotanical knowledge.\n\nThe Tsimane' number \u223c7000 people and live in \u223c100 villages in the Bolivian lowlands ([6][6]). Habitats range from savannas to wet, moist, and gallery forests. Tsimane' show large variation in socioeconomic attributes. Some live in small villages without schools, speak only Tsimane', and forage and practice shifting cultivation. Others speak Spanish, live in large, accessible, permanent villages with schools, and sell crops and labor. Because Tsimane' contain much variation, they are ideal to estimate the amount of shared ethnobotanical knowledge in an indigenous group.\n\nWe collected socioeconomic and ethnobotanical knowledge data during 18 months (May 1999 to November 2000) in two villages with different habitats and market exposure, Yaranda (which is a 3-day canoe trip from the nearest market town) and San Antonio (which is a 3-hour walk to the nearest town). Panel data served to develop a survey applied to 511 Tsimane' in 59 villages. In villages with \u226412 households, we surveyed all households. In villages with 13+ households, we randomly selected 12 households for interviews. For the interview, we randomly selected one household head. The average distance of the 59 villages to the closest town was 35 km (SD = 24.16, max = 100.5, min = 0.0).\n\nTo construct the knowledge test, we used published literature and data from free listings of useful plants ( n = 50) used by the Tsimane'. From the list, we randomly selected 21 plants to construct a multiple-choice questionnaire. We asked all subjects whether each plant could be used for medicine, firewood, tools, construction, and/or food. We collected responses in a matrix with plant names on the x axis and their uses on the y axis.\n\nWe define knowledge as agreement between informants and use cultural consensus and cultural competence to measure this parameter. Cultural competence is the proportion of questions each person answered correctly; we equate correct with the most frequent response in the population or group. Cultural consensus refers to the group average similarity in responses. Data are consensual if the first eigenvalue is at least three times larger than the second, provided no estimate of knowledge is <0. To estimate whether agreement was larger among people in the same village than among all subjects, we first estimated the agreement of each informant with people in the same village and then with the entire sample.\n\nWhen comparing subjects with people in the same village, we found that on a 0 to 1 scale, the average individual cultural competence was 0.83 (SD = 0.10) ([Table 1][7]). The average cultural consensus of the 59 villages was 90.60 (SD = 6.18). All villages but one fitted the consensus model, all informants had positive competence scores, and the ratio between the first and second eigenvalue was >3. Results suggest that people in the same village share more ethnobotanical knowledge than between villages.\n\nView this table:\n\nTable 1 \nSummary of cultural competence and consensus in 59 villages and 511 subjects.\n\n\n\nWe pooled people in the sample to compare individual agreement for all Tsimane'. When people were compared with the whole group, the average cultural competence was 0.62 (SD = 0.11), 20% lower than when compared with people in the same village. Cultural consensus of ethnobotanical knowledge among the Tsimane' was 66.3, lower than the average within villages. All informants had positive answers; the ratio between the first and second eigenvalues was 3.38. Results confirm the idea that ethnobotanical knowledge is a consensual domain among Tsimane' of different villages.\n\nThere is growing international and national agreement about the need for prior consent and benefit sharing with indigenous peoples when outsiders use ethnobotanical knowledge. As indigenous peoples have advocated and as this research shows, the collective nature of traditional knowledge should be considered when outsiders use indigenous knowledge commercially. Laws to protect indigenous knowledge must also acknowledge the communal endowment of indigenous knowledge and the traditional rights and responsibilities over such knowledge.\n\n1. [\u21b5][8]S. A.

We examined the influence of a common functional genetic polymorphism affecting the metabolism of catecholamines on the modulation of responses to sustained pain in humans. Individuals homozygous for themet158 allele of the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) polymorphism (val158met) showed diminished regional \u03bc-opioid system responses to pain compared with heterozygotes. These effects were accompanied by higher sensory and affective ratings of pain and a more negative internal affective state. Opposite effects were observed in val158 homozygotes. The COMTval158met polymorphism thus influences the human experience of pain and may underlie interindividual differences in the adaptation and responses to pain and other stressful stimuli."

The yield gains are much higher than what has been reported for other countries where genetically modified crops were used mostly to replace and enhance chemical pest control. In many developing countries, small-scale farmers especially suffer big pest-related yield losses because of technical and economic constraints. Pest-resistant genetically modified crops can contribute to increased yields and agricultural growth in those situations, as the case of Bt cotton in India demonstrates."

The application of IFRS thus represented a transition to a new accounting philosophy based mainly on the communication of relevant, useful and quality information for decision making. These standards that aims to increase the comparability of financial statements were adopted in 2005 in Morocco. The purpose of this paper is to present the previous research on the impact of the adoption of these standards on the quality of accounting figures. To do so a reminder of the international accounting framework and the application of these standards in the Moroccan context at first is essential."
