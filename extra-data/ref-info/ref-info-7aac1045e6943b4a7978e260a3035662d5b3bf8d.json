However, in situations where the images include background clutter and transformations such as translation, rotation, shearing and warping, these methods extract data centers that include clutter and represent different transformations of essentially the same data. Taking face images as an example, it would be more useful for the different clusters to represent different poses and expressions, instead of cluttered versions of different translations, scales and rotations. By including clutter and transformation as unobserved, latent variables in a mixture model, we obtain a new \"transformed mixture of Gaussians\", which is invariant to a specified set of transformations. We show how a linear-time EM algorithm can be used to fit this model by jointly estimating a mixture model for the data and inferring the transformation for each image. We show that this algorithm can jointly align images of a human head and learn different poses. We also find that the algorithm performs better than k-nearest neighbors and mixtures of Gaussians on handwritten digit recognition."

The set of all possible true images is assumed to be formed by a composition of that function with continuous mappings of the domain into itself. A prior Gaussian distribution is given on the set of continuous mappings. The observed image is assumed to be a degradation of the true image with additive noise. Given the observed image, a posterior distribution is then obtained and has the form of a nonlinear perturbation of the Gaussian measure on the space of mappings. We present simulations of the posterior distribution that lead to structural reconstructions of the true image in the sense that it enables us to determine landmarks and other characteristic features of the image, as well as to spot pathologies in it. Moreover, we show that the reconstruction algorithm is relatively robust when the images are degraded by noise that is not necessarily additive."

The key problem in creating a specific flexible model is the computation of pixelwise correspondence between the prototypes, a task done until now in a semiautomatic way. In this paper we describe an algorithm that automatically bootstraps the correspondence between the prototypes. The algorithm -which can be used for 2D images as well as for 3D models-is shown to synthesize successfully a flexible model of frontal face images and a flexible model of handwritten digits."

The splines are adjusted using a novel elastic matching procedure based on the expectation maximization algorithm that maximizes the likelihood of the model generating the data. This approach has many advantages: 1) the system not only produces a classification of the digit but also a rich description of the instantiation parameters which can yield information such as the writing style; 2) the generative models can perform recognition driven segmentation; 3) the method involves a relatively small number of parameters and hence training is relatively easy and fast; and 4) unlike many other recognition schemes, it does not rely on some form of pre-normalization of input images, but can handle arbitrary scalings, translations and a limited degree of image rotation. We have demonstrated that our method of fitting models to images does not get trapped in poor local minima. The main disadvantage of the method is that it requires much more computation than more standard OCR techniques."

This inconsistency is a result of the matching criteria's inability to uniquely describe the correspondences between two images. This paper seeks to overcome this limitation by jointly estimating the transformation from A to B and from B to A while enforcing the consistency constraint that these transforms are inverses of one another. The transformations are further restricted to preserve topology by constraining them to obey the laws of continuum mechanics. A new parameterization of the transformation based on a Fourier series in the context of linear elasticity is presented. Results are presented using both Magnetic Resonance and X-ray Computed Tomography Imagery. It is shown that joint estimation of a consistent set of forward and reverse transformations constrained by linear-elasticity gives better registration results than using either constraint alone or none at all."

Thus, this distance can be used to determine the degree of resemblance between two objects that are superimposed on one another. Efficient algorithms for computing the Hausdorff distance between all possible relative positions of a binary image and a model are presented. The focus is primarily on the case in which the model is only allowed to translate with respect to the image. The techniques are extended to rigid motion. The Hausdorff distance computation differs from many other shape comparison methods in that no correspondence between the model and the image is derived. The method is quite tolerant of small position errors such as those that occur with edge detectors and other feature extraction methods. It is shown that the method extends naturally to the problem of comparing a portion of a model against an image. >"

More complex, better suited distance measures are often expensive and rather ad-hoc (elastic matching, deformable templates). We propose a new distance measure which (a) can be made locally invariant to any set of transformations of the input and (b) can be computed efficiently. We tested the method on large handwritten character databases provided by the Post Office and the NIST. Using invariances with respect to translation, rotation, scaling, shearing and line thickness, the method consistently outperformed all other systems tested on the same databases."

In this paper, we study the construction of minimum mean squared error estimators on the special orthogonal group, SO(n), for pose estimation. Due to the nonflat geometry of SO(n), the standard Bayesian formulation of optimal estimators and their characteristics requires modifications. By utilizing Hilbert-Schmidt metric defined on GL(n), a larger group containing SO(n), a mean squared criterion is defined on SO(n). The Hilbert-Schmidt estimate (HSE) is defined to be a minimum mean squared error estimator, restricted to SO(n). The expected error associated with the HSE is shown to be a lower bound, called the Hilbert-Schmidt bound (HSB), on the error incurred by any other estimator. Analysis and algorithms are presented for evaluating the HSE and the HSB in cases of both ground-based and airborne targets."

The dynamical behavior of natural gradient online learning is analyzed and is proved to be Fisher efficient, implying that it has asymptotically the same performance as the optimal batch estimation of parameters. This suggests that the plateau phenomenon, which appears in the backpropagation learning algorithm of multilayer perceptrons, might disappear or might not be so serious when the natural gradient is used.
