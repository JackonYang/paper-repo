Their ability to automatically induce features results in multilingual parsing which is robust enough to achieve accuracy well above the average for each individual language in the multilingual track of the CoNLL-2007 shared task. This robustness led to the third best overall average labeled attachment score in the task, despite using no discriminative methods. We also demonstrate that the parser is quite fast, and can provide even faster parsing times without much loss of accuracy."

For example, in the case of English unlabeled second-order parsing, we improve from a baseline accuracy of 92.02% to 93.16%, and in the case of Czech unlabeled second-order parsing, we improve from a baseline accuracy of 86.13% to 87.13%.

To determine why, we analyzed the time usage of a dependency parser. We illustrate that the mapping of the features onto their weights in the support vector machine is the major factor in time complexity. To resolve this problem, we implemented the passive-aggressive perceptron algorithm as a Hash Kernel. The Hash Kernel substantially improves the parsing times and takes into account the features of negative examples built during the training. This has lead to a higher accuracy. We could further increase the parsing and training speed with a parallel feature extraction and a parallel parsing algorithm. We are convinced that the Hash Kernel and the parallelization can be applied successful to other NLP applications as well such as transition based dependency parsers, phrase structrue parsers, and machine translation."

We introduce the concept of a Transition Directed Acyclic Graph that allows us to apply Recursive Neural Networks for parsing with existing transition-based algorithms. Our framework captures semantic relatedness between phrases similarly to a constituency-based counterpart from the literature, for example predicting that \u201ca financial crisis\u201d, \u201ca cash crunch\u201d and \u201ca bear market\u201d are semantically similar.

Instead, we introduce a Compositional Vector Grammar (CVG), which combines PCFGs with a syntactically untied recursive neural network that learns syntactico-semantic, compositional vector representations. The CVG improves the PCFG of the Stanford Parser by 3.8% to obtain an F1 score of 90.4%. It is fast to train and implemented approximately as an efficient reranker it is about 20% faster than the current Stanford factored parser. The CVG learns a soft notion of head words and improves performance on the types of ambiguities that require semantic information such as PP attachments."

Such parsers are appealing because they allow revising the interpretation as words are incrementally processed. Yet, it has been very hard to scale them up to realistic language due to training time, limited memory, and the difficulty of representing linguistic structure. In this study, we show that it is possible to keep track of long-distance dependencies and to parse into deeper structures than before based on two techniques: a localist encoding of the input sequence and a dynamic unrolling of the network according to the parse tree. With these techniques, the system can nonmonotonically parse a corpus of realistic sentences into parse trees labelled with grammatical tags from a broad-coverage Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar of English."

The use of dependency parsing has mostly been limited to free word order languages, however the usefulness of dependency structures may yield improvements in many of the word\u2019s 6,000+ languages. I will give an overview of the field of dependency parsing while giving my aims for future research. Many NLP applications rely heavily on the quality of dependency parsing. For this reason, I will examine how different parsers and annotation schemes influence the overall NLP pipeline in regards to machine translation as well as the the baseline parsing accuracy."

One problem is that much of the work on discriminative methods conflates changes to the learning method with changes to the parameterization of the problem. We show how a parser can be trained with a discriminative learning method while still parameterizing the problem according to a generative probability model. We present three methods for training a neural network to estimate the probabilities for a statistical parser, one generative, one discriminative, and one where the probability model is generative but the training criteria is discriminative. The latter model outperforms the previous two, achieving state-of-the-art levels of performance (90.1% F-measure on constituents)."

The new format was inspired by annotation practices used in other dependency treebanks with the intention to produce a better interface to further semantic processing than existing methods. In particular, we used a richer set of edge labels and introduced links to handle long-distance phenomena such as wh-movement and topicalization. The resulting trees generally have a more complex dependency structure. For example, 6% of the trees contain at least one nonprojective link, which is difficult for many parsing algorithms. As can be expected, the more complex structure and the enriched set of edge labels make the trees more difficult to predict, and we observed a decrease in parsing accuracy when applying two dependency parsers to the new corpus. However, the richer information contained in the new trees resulted in a 23% error reduction in a baseline FrameNet semantic role labeler that relied on dependency arc labels only. (Less)"

Instead of exploiting man-made input features carefully optimized for each task, our system learns internal representations on the basis of vast amounts of mostly unlabeled training data. This work is then used as a basis for building a freely available tagging system with good performance and minimal computational requirements."

However, its search space is much bigger than the monolingual case, forcing existing approaches to employ complicated modeling and crude approximations. Here we propose a much simpler alternative, bilingually-constrained monolingual parsing, where a source-language parser learns to exploit reorderings as additional observation, but not bothering to build the target-side tree as well. We show specifically how to enhance a shift-reduce dependency parser with alignment features to resolve shift-reduce conflicts. Experiments on the bilingual portion of Chinese Treebank show that, with just 3 bilingual features, we can improve parsing accuracies by 0.6% (absolute) for both English and Chinese over a state-of-the-art baseline, with negligible (~6%) efficiency overhead, thus much faster than biparsing."

However, the sentence vectors of previous models cannot accurately represent visually grounded meaning. We introduce the DT-RNN model which uses dependency trees to embed sentences into a vector space in order to retrieve images that are described by those sentences. Unlike previous RNN-based models which use constituency trees, DT-RNNs naturally focus on the action and agents in a sentence. They are better able to abstract from the details of word order and syntactic expression. DT-RNNs outperform other recursive and recurrent neural networks, kernelized CCA and a bag-of-words baseline on the tasks of finding an image that fits a sentence description and vice versa. They also give more similar representations to sentences that describe the same image."

In this paper we present several extensions that improve both the quality of the vectors and the training speed. By subsampling of the frequent words we obtain significant speedup and also learn more regular word representations. We also describe a simple alternative to the hierarchical softmax called negative sampling. \n \nAn inherent limitation of word representations is their indifference to word order and their inability to represent idiomatic phrases. For example, the meanings of \"Canada\" and \"Air\" cannot be easily combined to obtain \"Air Canada\". Motivated by this example, we present a simple method for finding phrases in text, and show that learning good vector representations for millions of phrases is possible."

This \"overfitting\" is greatly reduced by randomly omitting half of the feature detectors on each training case. This prevents complex co-adaptations in which a feature detector is only helpful in the context of several other specific feature detectors. Instead, each neuron learns to detect a feature that is generally helpful for producing the correct answer given the combinatorially large variety of internal contexts in which it must operate. Random \"dropout\" gives big improvements on many benchmark tasks and sets new records for speech and object recognition."

The technique is a variation of Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (Hinton and Roweis, 2002) that is much easier to optimize, and produces significantly better visualizations by reducing the tendency to crowd points together in the center of the map. t-SNE is better than existing techniques at creating a single map that reveals structure at many different scales. This is particularly important for high-dimensional data that lie on several different, but related, low-dimensional manifolds, such as images of objects from multiple classes seen from multiple viewpoints. For visualizing the structure of very large datasets, we show how t-SNE can use random walks on neighborhood graphs to allow the implicit structure of all of the data to influence the way in which a subset of the data is displayed. We illustrate the performance of t-SNE on a wide variety of datasets and compare it with many other non-parametric visualization techniques, including Sammon mapping, Isomap, and Locally Linear Embedding. The visualizations produced by t-SNE are significantly better than those produced by the other techniques on almost all of the datasets."

Metaphorically, the adaptation allows us to find needles in haystacks in the form of very predictive but rarely seen features. Our paradigm stems from recent advances in stochastic optimization and online learning which employ proximal functions to control the gradient steps of the algorithm. We describe and analyze an apparatus for adaptively modifying the proximal function, which significantly simplifies setting a learning rate and results in regret guarantees that are provably as good as the best proximal function that can be chosen in hindsight. We give several efficient algorithms for empirical risk minimization problems with common and important regularization functions and domain constraints. We experimentally study our theoretical analysis and show that adaptive subgradient methods outperform state-of-the-art, yet non-adaptive, subgradient algorithms."

In light of the evolving definition of the Stanford dependencies and developments in statistical dependency parsing algorithms, this paper revisits the question of Cer et al. (2010): what is the tradeoff between accuracy and speed in obtaining Stanford dependencies in particular? We also explore the effects of input representations on this tradeoff: part-of-speech tags, the novel use of an alternative dependency representation as input, and distributional representaions of words. We find that direct dependency parsing is a more viable solution than it was found to be in the past. An accompanying software release can be found at: this http URL"
