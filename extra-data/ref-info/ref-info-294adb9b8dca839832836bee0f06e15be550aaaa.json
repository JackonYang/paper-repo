This paper illustrates how these hybrid models can be used to extract facial bands and automatically segment a face image into meaningful regions, showing the benefits of simultaneous use of statistical and structural information. It is shown how the segmented data can be used to identify different subjects. Successful segmentation and identification of face images was obtained, even when facial details (with/without glasses, smiling/non-smiling, open/closed eyes) were varied. Some experiments with a simple left-to-right model are presented to support the plausibility of this approach. Finally, present and future directions of research work using these models are indicated."

It is a feature-based bottom-up approach that is characterized by its learning capability and time-scale invariability. To apply HMMs, one set of time-sequential images is transformed into an image feature vector sequence, and the sequence is converted into a symbol sequence by vector quantization. In learning human action categories, the parameters of the HMMs, one per category, are optimized so as to best describe the training sequences from the category. To recognize an observed sequence, the HMM which best matches the sequence is chosen. Experimental results for real time-sequential images of sports scenes show recognition rates higher than 90%. The recognition rate is improved by increasing the number of people used to generate the training data, indicating the possibility of establishing a person-independent action recognizer.<<ETX>>"

For each keyword, two statistical models, called pseudo-2D hidden Markov models (P2-DHMMs), are created for representing the actual keyword and all the other extraneous words, respectively. Dynamic programming is then used for matching an unknown input word with the two models and making a maximum likelihood decision. Although the models are pseudo 2-D in the sense that they are not fully connected 2-D networks, they are shown to be general enough to characterize printed words efficiently. These models facilitate a nice 'elastic matching' property in both horizontal and vertical directions, which makes the recognizer not only independent of size and slant but also tolerant of highly deformed and noisy words. The system is evaluated on a synthetically created database which contains about 26000 words. A recognition accuracy of 99% is achieved when words in testing and training sets are in the same font size. An accuracy of 96% is achieved when they are in different sizes. In the latter case, the conventional 1-D HMM approach achieves only 70% accuracy rate.<<ETX>>"
