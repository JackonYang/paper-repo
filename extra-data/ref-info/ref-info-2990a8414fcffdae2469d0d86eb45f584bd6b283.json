                "text": "We studied the responses to visual stimuli of neurons in area TE of the inferior temporal (IT) cortex in four awake monkeys (Macaca mulatta) trained to perform behavioral tasks. While the monkey looked at a fixation point in order to detect its dimming, another stimulus, such as a spot of light or a sine- or square-wave grating, usually produced only slight responses in inferior temporal neurons. However, the response to the stimulus was more vigorous if the task was changed so the fixation point blinked off before the stimulus came on while the monkey maintained its gaze. Responses to visual stimuli during this blink task were seen in 199 of 288 cells studied, and nearly all responded to a visual stimulus better during the blink task than during the task in which the fixation point remained on. Small spots of light usually produced consistent responses; we did not explore the response to complex stimuli or to objects. Latency of the visual response ranged from 70 to 220 ms. While the response of cells to a stimulus in the presence of the fixation point was limited to areas near the fovea, this apparently constricted visual receptive field expanded during the blink of the fixation point. In order to determine whether the increased response of the cell in the absence of the fixation point was due to a shift of attention from the fixation point to the visual stimulus, we required the monkey to respond to the dimming of this stimulus rather than to the dimming of the fixation point. We found that attention to the visual stimulus decreased the response of the cell during both the fixation and blink tasks. That is, the best response to the stimulus occurred in the blink task when attention to the stimulus was not required, while the poorest response occurred in the fixation task when attention to the stimulus was required. The reappearance of the fixation point during stimulus presentation in the blink task caused a transient time-locked suppression of response to the stimulus. This suggests that the reduction of response to the stimulus in the presence of the fixation point is caused by an interaction between the responses to the fixation point and the visual stimulus. To insure that we were recording from the same population of cells that had first been characterized by Gross, Rocha-Miranda, and Bender (14) in anesthetized, paralyzed monkeys, we recorded under those same conditions in two of our four monkeys.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

We recorded from single neurons in the dorsal bank and fundus of the anterior portion of the superior temporal sulcus, an area we term the superior temporal polysensory area (STP). Five macaques were studied under anesthesia ( N20) and immobilization in repeated recording sessions. 2. Almost all of the neurons were visually responsive, and over half responded to more than one sensory modality; 21% responded to visual and auditory stimuli, 17% responded to visual and somesthetic stimuli, 17% were trimodal, and 41% were exclusively visual. 3. Almost all the visual receptive fields extended into both visual half-fields, and the majority approached the size of the visual field of the monkey, including both monocular crescents. Somesthetic receptive fields were also bilateral and usually included most of the body surface. 4. Virtually all neurons responded better to moving visual stimuli than to stationary visual stimuli, and almost half were sensitive to the direction of movement. Several classes of directional neurons were found, including a) neurons selective for a single direction of movement throughout their receptive field, b) neurons selective for directions of movement radially symmetric about the center of gaze, and c) neurons selective for movement in depth. 5. The majority of neurons (70%) had little or no preference for stimulus size, shape, orientation, or contrast. The minority (30%) responded best to particular stimuli. Some of these appeared to be selective for faces. 6. The properties of most STP neurons, such as large receptive fields, sensitivity to movement, insensitivity to form, and polymodal responsiveness, suggest that STP is more involved in orientation and spatial functions than in pattern recognition."

Single unit activity was recorded with microelectrodes in monkeys performing a visual delayed matching-to-sample task. On each trial, the animal was exposed briefly to a color - the sample - and, after a period of delay, had to select the same color among two or four colors simultaneously presented. Thus, correct performance of the task required perception, retention, and recognition of the sample color for every trial. A large number of inferotemporal units were seen to react to the stimuli with changes of firing frequency. Many units showed color-dependent reactions, suggesting their involvement in perception and discrimination of colors. A substantial contingent of cells showed increased, sustained, and in some cases, color-dependent discharge during the delay which was not necessarily preceded or succeeded by firing changes in sample or match periods. It is proposed that those cells were engaged in temporary retention of the sample stimulus. Since most of the inferotemporal units examined showed firing changes in more than one period of a trial, they appeared to be involved in more than one of the operations required by the task. Thus, the data do not support a clear-cut topographic separation of visual functions within the inferotmeporal cortex. However, neurons that appear to participate in visual memory, either exclusively or in addition to other functions, are concentrated in the cortex of the lower banks of the superior temporal sulcus."

It is now clear that the retina and visual pathways do not simply transmit a mosaic of Iight and dark to some central sensorium. Rather, even at the retinal level, specific features of visual stimuli are detected and their presence communicated to the next level. In cats and monkeys, the geniculostriate visual system consists of a series of converging and diverging connections such that at each successive tier of processing mechanism, single neurons respond to increasingly more specific visual stimuli falling on an increasingly wider area of the retina (19-Z). How far does this analytical-synthetic process continue whereby individual cells have more and more specific trigger features? Are there regions of the brain beyond striate and prestriatel cortex where this processing of visual information is carrie,d further? If so, how far and in what way? Are there cells that are concerned with the storage of visual information as well as its analysis? There are several lines of evidence suggesting that a possible site for further processing of visual information and perhaps even for storage of such information might, in the monkey, be inferotemporal cortexthe cortex on the inferior convexity of the temporal lobe. First, this area receives afferents from prestriate cortex which itself processes visual information received from"

It would be astonishing if such a structure did not profoundly modify the response patterns of fibres coming into it. In the cat's visual cortex, the receptive field arrangements of single cells suggest that there is indeed a degree of complexity far exceeding anything yet seen at lower levels in the visual system. In a previous paper we described receptive fields of single cortical cells, observing responses to spots of light shone on one or both retinas (Hubel & Wiesel, 1959). In the present work this method is used to examine receptive fields of a more complex type (Part I) and to make additional observations on binocular interaction (Part II). This approach is necessary in order to understand the behaviour of individual cells, but it fails to deal with the problem of the relationship of one cell to its neighbours. In the past, the technique of recording evoked slow waves has been used with great success in studies of functional anatomy. It was employed by Talbot & Marshall (1941) and by Thompson, Woolsey & Talbot (1950) for mapping out the visual cortex in the rabbit, cat, and monkey. Daniel & Whitteiidge (1959) have recently extended this work in the primate. Most of our present knowledge of retinotopic projections, binocular overlap, and the second visual area is based on these investigations. Yet the method of evoked potentials is valuable mainly for detecting behaviour common to large populations of neighbouring cells; it cannot differentiate functionally between areas of cortex smaller than about 1 mm2. To overcome this difficulty a method has in recent years been developed for studying cells separately or in small groups during long micro-electrode penetrations through nervous tissue. Responses are correlated with cell location by reconstructing the electrode tracks from histological material. These techniques have been applied to"

We demonstrate directly the role of HVc in vocalization by presenting neuronal recordings taken from HVc of singing birds. Intracellular recordings from anesthetized birds have shown that many neurons in HVc respond to auditory stimuli. We confirm this result in the extracellular recordings from awake-behaving birds and further demonstrate responses of HVc neurons to playback of the bird's own song. The functional significance of these responses is not yet clear, but behavioral studies show that auditory feedback plays a crucial role in the development of normal song. We show that the song-correlated temporal pattern of neural activity persists even in the deaf bird. Furthermore, we show that in the normal bird, the activity pattern correlated with production of certain song elements can be clearly distinguished from the pattern of auditory responses to the same song elements. This result implies that an interaction occurs in HVc of the singing bird between motor and auditory activity. Through experiments involving playback of sound while the bird is singing, we show that the interaction consists of motor inhibition of auditory activity in HVc and that this inhibition decays slowly over a period of seconds after the song terminates."

This experience provided a major part of the background and stimulus for the program of surgical treatment of medically refractory focal epilepsy initiated by Dr. PENFIELD when he returned to North America and took up his new post at McGill University in Montreal (4, 6). This program and the associated studies of cerebral localization of function were steadily expanded through the years by Dr. PENFIELD, his associates and his successors (5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14). It is therefore particularly appropriate and with much pleasure that we submit this report in honor and in memory of OTFRID FOERSTER."

This brings to 16 the number of anatomically studied cases of prosopagnosia (8 by necropsy, 8 by CT).
