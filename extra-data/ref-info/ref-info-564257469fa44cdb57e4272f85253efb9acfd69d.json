Open-domain textual question answering presupposes that questions are natural and unrestricted with respect to topic. The question answering (Q/A) techniques, as embodied in today's systems, can be roughly divided into two types: (1) techniques for Information Seeking (IS), which localize the answer in vast document collections; and (2) techniques for Reading Comprehension (RC) that answer a series of questions related to a given document. Although these two types of techniques and systems are different, it is desirable to combine them for enabling more advanced forms of Q/A. This paper discusses an approach that successfully enhanced an existing IS system with RC capabilities. This enhancement is important because advanced Q/A, as exemplified by the ARDA AQUAINT program, is moving towards Q/A systems that incorporate semantic and pragmatic knowledge enabling dialogue-based Q/A. Because today's RC systems involve a short series of questions in context, they represent a rudimentary form of interactive Q/A which constitutes a possible foundation for more advanced forms of dialogue-based Q/A."

We present a methodology for evaluation of the application of modern natural language technologies to the task of responding to RC tests. Our work is based on ABCs (Abduction Based Comprehension system), an automated system for taking tests requiring short answer phrases as responses. A central goal of ABCs is to serve as a testbed for understanding the role that various linguistic components play in responding to reading comprehension questions. The heart of ABCs is an abductive inference engine that provides three key capabilities: (1) first-order logical representation of relations between entities and events in the text and rules to perform inference over such relations, (2) graceful degradation due to the inclusion of abduction in the reasoning engine, which avoids the brittleness that can be problematic in knowledge representation and reasoning systems and (3) system transparency such that the types of abductive inferences made over an entire corpus provide cues as to where the system is performing poorly and indications as to where existing knowledge is inaccurate or new knowledge is required. ABCs, with certain sub-components not yet automated, finds the correct answer phrase nearly 35 percent of the time using a strict evaluation metric and 45 percent of the time using a looser inexact metric on held out evaluation data. Performance varied for the different question types, ranging from over 50 percent on who questions to over 10 percent on what questions. We present analysis of the roles of individual components and analysis of the impact of various characteristics of the abductive proof procedure on overall system performance."

                "text": "This paper describes our entry to the 2012 QA4MRE Main Task (English dataset). The QA4MRE task poses a significant challenge as the expression of knowledge in the question and answer (in the document) typically substantially differs. Ultimately, one would need a system that can perform full machine reading \u2013 creating an internal model of the document\u2019s meaning \u2013 to achieve high performance. Our approach is a preliminary step toward this, based on estimating the likelihood of textual entailment between sentences in the text, and the question Q and each candidate answer Ai. We first treat the question Q and each answer Ai independently, and find sets of sentences SQ, SA that each plausibly entail (the target of) Q or one of the Ai respectively. We then search for the closest (in the document) pair of sentences in these sets, and conclude that the answer Ai entailed by SAi in the closest pair is the answer. This approach assumes coherent discourse, i.e., that sentences close together are usually \u201ctalking about the same thing\u201d, and thus conveying a single idea (namely an expression of the Q+Ai pair). In QA4MRE it is hard to \"prove\" entailment, as a candidate answer A may be expressed using a substantially different wording in the document, over multiple sentences, and only partially (as some aspects of A may be left implicit in the document, to be filled in by the reader). As a result, we instead estimate the likelihood of entailment (that a sentence S entails A) by look for evidence, namely entailment relationships between components of S and A such as words, bigrams, trigrams, and parse fragments. To identify these possible entailment relationships we use three knowledge resources, namely WordNet, ParaPara (a large paraphrase database from Johns Hopkins University), and the DIRT paraphrase database. Our best run scored 40% in the evaluation, and around 42% in additional (unsubmitted) runs afterwards. In ablation studies, we found that the majority of our score (approximately 38%) could be attributed to the basic algorithm, with the knowledge resources adding approximately 4% to this baseline score. Finally we critique our approach with respect to the broader goal of machine reading, and discuss what is needed to move closer to that goal."

The task uses the Scholastic Aptitude Test's sentence completion format. The test set consists of 1040 sentences, each of which is missing a content word. The goal is to select the correct replacement from amongst five alternates. In general, all of the options are syntactically valid, and reasonable with respect to local N-gram statistics. The set was generated by using an N-gram language model to generate a long list of likely words, given the immediate context. These options were then hand-groomed, to identify four decoys which are globally incoherent, yet syntactically correct. To ensure the right to public distribution, all the data is derived from out-of-copyright materials from Project Gutenberg. The test sentences were derived from five of Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes novels, and we provide a large set of Nineteenth and early Twentieth Century texts as training material."

Next, we analyze common approaches to two subproblems: term overlap for answer sentence identification, and answer typing for short answer extraction. We present general tools for analyzing the strengths and limitations of techniques for these sub-problems. Our results quantify the limitations of both term overlap and answer typing to distinguish between competing answer candidates."

Our approaches depart from previous question answering (QA) work in several ways. For unstructured content, we used a web-based system with novel features such as web snippet pattern matching and generic answer type matching using web counts. We also experimented with a new, complementary question answering approach that uses information from the millions of tables and lists that abound on the web. This system attempts to answer factoid questions by guessing relevant rows and fields in matching web tables and integrating the results. We believe a combination of the two approaches holds promise."

Two primary tasks in SLU are intent determination (ID) and slot filling (SF). Recent studies reported error rates below 5% for both of these tasks employing discriminative machine learning techniques with the ATIS test set. While these low error rates may suggest that this task is close to being solved, further analysis reveals the continued utility of ATIS as a research corpus. In this paper, our goal is not experimenting with domain specific techniques or features which can help with the remaining SLU errors, but instead exploring methods to realize this utility via extensive error analysis. We conclude that even with such low error rates, ATIS test set still includes many unseen example categories and sequences, hence requires more data. Better yet, new annotated larger data sets from more complex tasks with realistic utterances can avoid over-tuning in terms of modeling and feature design. We believe that advancements in SLU can be achieved by having more naturally spoken data sets and employing more linguistically motivated features while preserving robustness due to speech recognition noise and variance due to natural language."

As a rst evaluation, it is important to examine the evaluation methodology itself to understand any limits on the conclusions that can be drawn from the evaluation and possibly to nd ways to improve subsequent evaluations. This paper has two main goals: to describe in detail how the evaluation was implemented, and to examine the consequences of the methodology on the comparative performance of the systems participating in the evaluation. The examination uncovered no serious aws in the methodology, supporting its continued use for question answering evaluation. Nonetheless, redeening the speciic task to be performed so that it more closely matches an actual user task does appear warranted."

Additionally, a pool of resources was offered so that the participants could share common tools. A pilot task was also set up, aimed at differentiating unknown entailments from identified contradictions and providing justifications for overall system decisions. 26 participants submitted 44 runs, using different approaches and generally presenting new entailment models and achieving higher scores than in the previous challenges."

The training examples are sequences of sentences annotated with lambda-calculus meaning representations. We develop an algorithm that maintains explicit, lambda-calculus representations of salient discourse entities and uses a context-dependent analysis pipeline to recover logical forms. The method uses a hidden-variable variant of the perception algorithm to learn a linear model used to select the best analysis. Experiments on context-dependent utterances from the ATIS corpus show that the method recovers fully correct logical forms with 83.7% accuracy."

CHILL treats parser acquisition as the learning of search-control rules within a logic program representing a shift-reduce parser and uses techniques from Inductive Logic Programming to learn relational control knowledge. Starting with a general framework for constructing a suitable logical form, CHILL is able to train on a corpus comprising sentences paired with database queries and induce parsers that map subsequent sentences directly into executable queries. Experimental results with a complete database-query application for U.S. geography show that CHILL is able to learn parsers that outperform a preexisting, hand-crafted counterpart. These results demonstrate the ability of a corpus-based system to produce more than purely syntactic representations. They also provide direct evidence of the utility of an empirical approach at the level of a complete natural language application."

For data collection, this megastudy used the Web-based crowdsourcing technology offered by the Amazon Mechanical Turk. Our data indicate that the ratings collected in this way are as valid and reliable as those collected in laboratory conditions (the correlation between our ratings and those collected in the lab from U.S. students reached .93 for a subsample of 2,500 monosyllabic words). We also show that our AoA ratings explain a substantial percentage of the variance in the lexical-decision data of the English Lexicon Project, over and above the effects of log frequency, word length, and similarity to other words. This is true not only for the lemmas used in our rating study, but also for their inflected forms. We further discuss the relationships of AoA with other predictors of word recognition and illustrate the utility of AoA ratings for research on vocabulary growth."

The plethora of available electronic texts (e.g., e-mail messages, online forum messages, blogs, source code, etc.) indicates a wide variety of applications of this technology, provided it is able to handle short and noisy text from multiple candidate authors. In this article, a survey of recent advances of the automated approaches to attributing authorship is presented, examining their characteristics for both text representation and text classification. The focus of this survey is on computational requirements and settings rather than on linguistic or literary issues.

We address these potential concerns by presenting new demographic data about the Mechanical Turk subject population, reviewing the strengths of Mechanical Turk relative to other online and offline methods of recruiting subjects, and comparing the magnitude of effects obtained using Mechanical Turk and traditional subject pools. We further discuss some additional benefits such as the possibility of longitudinal, cross cultural and prescreening designs, and offer some advice on how to best manage a common subject pool."

We also introduce a novel method for estimating a worker's reservation wage - the key parameter in our labor supply model. We tested our model by presenting experimental subjects with real-effort work scenarios that varied in the offered payment and difficulty. As predicted, subjects worked less when the pay was lower. However, they did not work less when the task was more time-consuming. Interestingly, at least some subjects appear to be \"target earners,\" contrary to the assumptions of the rational model. The strongest evidence for target earning is an observed preference for earning total amounts evenly divisible by 5, presumably because these amounts make good targets. Despite its predictive failures, we calibrate our model with data pooled from both experiments. We find that the reservation wages of our sample are approximately log normally distributed, with a median wage of $1.38/hour. We discuss how to use our calibrated model in applications."
