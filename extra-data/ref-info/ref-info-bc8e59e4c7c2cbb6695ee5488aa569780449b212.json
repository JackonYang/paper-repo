We use a training set of manually categorized documents to learn word-category associations, and use these associations to predict the categories of arbitrary documents. Similarly, we use a training set of queries and their related documents to obtain empirical associations between query words and indexing terms of documents, and use these associations to predict the related documents of arbitrary queries. A Linear Least Squares Fit (LLSF) technique is employed to estimate the likelihood of these associations. Document collections from the MEDLINE database and Mayo patient records are used for studies on the effectiveness of our approach, and on how much the effectiveness depends on the choices of training data, indexing language, word-weighting scheme, and morphological canonicalization. Alternative methods are also tested on these data collections for comparison. It is evident that the LLSF approach uses the relevance information effectively within human decisions of categorization and retrieval, and achieves a semantic mapping of free texts to their representations in an indexing language. Such a semantic mapping lead to a significant improvement in categorization and retrieval, compared to alternative approaches."

We discovered that the knowledge about relevance among queries and documents can be used to obtain empirical connections between query terms and the canonical concepts which are used for indexing the content of documents. These connections do not depend on whether there are shared terms among the queries and documents; therefore, they are especially effective for a mapping from queries to the documents where the concepts are relevant but the terms used by article authors happen to be different from the terms of database users. We employ a Linear Least Squares Fit (LLSF) technique to compute such connections from a collection of queries and documents where the relevance is assigned by humans, and then use these connections in the retrieval of documents where the relevance is unknown. We tested this method on both retrieval and indexing with a set of MEDLINE documents which has been used by other information retrieval systems for evaluations. The effectiveness of the LLSF mapping and the significant improvement over alternative approaches was evident in the tests."

This method learns empirical associations between free-form texts and canonical terms from human-assigned matches and determines a Linear Least Squares Fit (LLSF) mapping function which represents weighted connections between words in the texts and the canonical terms. The mapping function enables us to project an arbitrary text to the canonical term space where the \"transformed\" text is compared with the terms, and similarity scores are obtained which quantify the relevance between the the text and the terms. This approach has superior power to discover synonyms or related terms and to preserve the context sensitivity of the mapping. We achieved a rate of 84% in both the recall and the precision with a testing set of 6,913 texts, outperforming other techniques including string matching (15%), morphological parsing (17%) and statistical weighting (21%)."

The goal of the conference was to bring research groups together to discuss their work on a new large test collection. There was a large variety of retrieval techniques reported on, including methods using automatic thesaurii, sophisticated term weighting, natural language techniques, relevance feedback, and advanced pattern matching. As results had been run through a common evaluation package, groups were able to compare the effectiveness of different techniques, and discuss how differences among the sytems affected performance."

For this task, an indexing dictionary with rules for mapping terms from the text onto descriptors is required, which can be derived automatically from a set of manually indexed documents. Based on the Darmstadt Indexing Approach, the indexing task is divided into a description step and a decision step. First, terms (single words or phrases) are identiied in the document text. With term-descriptor rules from the dictionary, descriptor indications are formed. The set of all indications from a document leading to the same descriptor is called a relevance description. A probabilistic classiication procedure computes indexing weights for each relevance description. Since the whole system is rule-based, it can be adapted to diierent subject elds by appropriate modiications of the rule bases. A major application of AIR/X is the AIR/PHYS system developed for a large physics database. This application is described in more detail along with experimental results."

Such a model can be implemented by using a three-layer feedforward neural network. Term associations are modeled by weighted links connecting different neurons, and are derived by the perception learning algorithm without the need for introducing any ad hoc parameters. The preliminary results indicate the usefulness of neural networks in the design of adaptive information retrieval systems."

Participants were offered a 2-hour introduction to online searching and 2 hours of free search time.\n\n\nMEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS\nFor each search, a computer program requested identification of the user and the question to be addressed. Search transactions were recorded automatically. Interviews were conducted after a random sample of searches, and search questions were given to more expert searchers to run for comparison with the original. Eighty-one percent of participants did searches on study computers, at a mean rate of 2.7 searches per month. On comparison searches, participants retrieved 55% of the number of relevant articles retrieved by reference librarians (P = 0.024) and 50% more irrelevant articles (P less than 0.001). Forty-seven percent of searches on patient problems affected clinical decisions, but often on scanty information.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nMEDLINE searching from clinical settings is feasible with brief training and affects clinical decisions. However, inexperienced searchers miss many relevant citations and search inefficiently. Further studies are needed to assess the impact of searching on physician performance and patient care."
