Although Y. Nakano et al. (1986) looked upon the recognition of multi-kinds of table-form documents as an important subject from a practical point of view, they could not report any successful approach because their knowledge was based only on the physical coordinate data. In the approach presented, this recognition issue was solved, using both the classification tree based on the physical characteristics and the structure description tree based on the logical characteristics. At least, it is not so difficult to classify various kinds of documents into appropriate document classes since table-form documents are well designed on the basis of vertical and horizontal line segments. However, it is not easy in the case of the other documents because the geometric and spatial characteristics of documents are not well specified. It is necessary to investigate the application techniques for the other documents from the viewpoint of the knowledge representation.<<ETX>>"

This paper proposes a more advanced method based on the spatial relationships among neighboring segments of compositive items, in addition to the geometric aspects. The knowledge about documents is not a single layer, but organized as multi-level layers: knowledge about layout structures, knowledge about item sequences and knowledge about item properties. Three kinds of knowledge are not only specified hierarchically, but also interrelated mutually between the layout recognition, item recognition and character recognition procedures.<<ETX>>"
