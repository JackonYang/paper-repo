These decisions are typically made by considering only the user's keyword query, neglecting the larger information need. Users with specific needs, such as \u201cresearch papers\u201d or \u201chomepages,\u201d are not able to express these needs in a way that affects the decisions made by the metasearch engine. In this paper, we describe a metasearch engine architecture that considers the user's information need for each decision. Users with different needs, but the same keyword query, may search different sub-search engines, have different modifications made to their query, and have results ordered differently. Our architecture combines several powerful approaches together in a single general purpose metasearch engine."

These techniques can be categorized as either global or local. While global techniques rely on analysis of a whole collection to discover word relationships, local techniques emphasize analysis of the top-ranked documents retrieved for a query. While local techniques have shown to be more effective that global techniques in general, existing local techniques are not robust and can seriously hurt retrieved when few of the retrieval documents are relevant. We propose a new technique, called local context analysis, which selects expansion terms based on cooccurrence with the query terms within the top-ranked documents. Experiments on a number of collections, both English and non-English, show that local context analysis offers more effective and consistent retrieval results."

As evidence for our claim, we present Watson, a system which gathers contextual information in the form of the text of the document the user is manipulating in order to proactively retrieve documents from distributed information repositories. We close by describing the results of several experiments with Watson, which show it consistently provides useful information to its users."

The underlying idea is that the aggregate of all the word contexts in which a given word does and does not appear provides a set of mutual constraints that largely determines the similarity of meaning of words and sets of words to each other. The adequacy of LSA's reflection of human knowledge has been established in a variety of ways. For example, its scores overlap those of humans on standard vocabulary and subject matter tests; it mimics human word sorting and category judgments; it simulates word\u2010word and passage\u2010word lexical priming data; and, as reported in 3 following articles in this issue, it accurately estimates passage coherence, learnability of passages by individual students, and the quality and quantity of knowledge contained in an essay."

Semantic similarity is estimated by subjective ratings; contextual similarity is estimated by the method of sorting sentential contexts. The results show an inverse linear relationship between similarity of meaning and the discriminability of contexts. This relation, is obtained for two separate corpora of sentence contexts. It is concluded that, on average, for words in the same language drawn from the same syntactic and semantic categories, the more often two words can be substituted into the same contexts the more similar in meaning they are judged to be."

                "text": "In supernova (SN) spectroscopy relatively little attention has been given to the properties of optically thick spectral lines in epochs following the photosphere\u2019s recession. Most treatments and analyses of post-photospheric optical spectra of SNe assume that forbidden-line emission comprises most if not all spectral features. However, evidence exists that suggests that some spectra exhibit line profiles formed via optically thick resonance-scattering even months or years after the SN explosion. To explore this possibility, we present a geometrical approach to SN spectrum formation based on the \u201cElementary Supernova\u201d model, wherein we investigate the characteristics of resonance-scattering in optically thick lines while replacing the photosphere with a transparent central core emitting non-blackbody continuum radiation, akin to the optical continuum provided by decaying 56Co formed during the explosion. We develop the mathematical framework necessary for solving the radiative transfer equation under these conditions and calculate spectra for both isolated and blended lines. Our comparisons with analogous results from the Elementary Supernova code SYNOW reveal several marked differences in line formation. Most notably, resonance lines in these conditions form P Cygni-like profiles, but the emission peaks and absorption troughs shift redward and blueward, respectively, from the line\u2019s rest wavelength by a significant amount, despite the spherically symmetric distribution of the line optical depth in the ejecta. These properties and others that we find in this work could lead to misidentification of lines or misattribution of properties of line-forming material at post-photospheric times in SN optical spectra."

Each point is associated with a neuron, and the distances are used to determine the synaptic weights between those neurons. The dynamical development of this system leads to synchronous firing of neurons that belong to the same cluster, while different clusters fire at different times. Such dynamic behavior is called temporal segmentation. It is achieved via two mechanisms-intra cluster synchrony, induced by excitatory connections within each cluster, and desynchronization between clusters induced by inhibitory competition. We test our clustering method on the iris data set. For problems that do not have a unique clustering solution, we construct a pair-correlation matrix on the basis of multiple clustering solutions. By performing a second clustering algorithm, this time on the pair-correlation matrix, we are able to define second order clusters of the original distance matrix. This method is demonstrated on a biological data set."

Although such systems seem deceptively simple, a considerable amount of skill is required in order to satisfy non-trivial information needs. This paper presents a new conceptual paradigm for performing search in context, that largely automates the search process, providing even non-professional users with highly relevant results. This paradigm is implemented in practice in the IntelliZap system, where search is initiated from a text query marked by the user in a document she views, and is guided by the text surrounding the marked query in that document (\u201cthe context\u201d). The context-driven information retrieval process involves semantic keyword extraction and clustering to automatically generate new, augmented queries. The latter are submitted to a host of general and domain-specific search engines. Search results are then semantically reranked, using context. Experimental results testify that using context to guide search, effectively offers even inexperienced users an advanced search tool on the Web."
