The theory is formulated in the language of information theory and hypothesizes that the goal of this processing is to recode in order to reduce a generalized redundancy subject to a constraint that specifies the amount of average information preserved. In the limit of no noise, this theory becomes equivalent to Barlow's redundancy reduction hypothesis, but it leads to very different computational strategies when noise is present. A tractable approach for finding the optimal encoding is to solve the problem in successive stages where at each stage the optimization is performed within a restricted class of transfer functions. We explicitly find the solution for the class of encodings to which the parvocellular retinal processing belongs, namely linear and nondivergent transformations. The solution shows agreement with the experimentally observed transfer functions at all levels of signal to noise."

This suggestion was founded on the observation that, in computational simulation, competitive adaptation to stimuli which have the character of natural images can give rise to receptive fields that are primarily sensitive to simple oriented features. In the paper it is argued that the winner-take-all paradigm of competitive learning is not adequate to account for the distribution of responses in the domain of spatial frequency that is necessary to form a complete representation of the information contained in images. The competitive mechanism gives rise to a gross imbalance in the distribution of spatial frequency responses in favour of the lowest spatial frequencies, as a consequence of the form of the spatial frequency spectra of na..."

We argue that the retinal goal is to transform the visual input as much as possible into a statistically independent basis as the first step in creating a redundancy reduced representation in the cortex, as suggested by Barlow. The extent of this whitening of the input is limited, however, by the need to suppress input noise. Our explicit theoretical solutions for the retinal filters also show a simple dependence on mean stimulus luminance: they predict an approximate Weber law at low spatial frequencies and a De Vries-Rose law at high frequencies. Assuming that the dominant source of noise is quantum, we generate a family of contrast sensitivity curves as a function of mean luminance. This family is compared to psychophysical data."

If we assume that visual systems have evolved to cope with the natural environment then we might expect the coding properties of the visual system to be related to the statistical structure of our environment. Indeed, images of the natural environment do not have random statistics. The first-order statistics (e.g., distribution of pixel values) and second-order statistics (e.g., power spectra) of natural images have been discussed previously and they bear important relations to visual coding. Statistics higher than second-order are difficult to measure but provide crucial information about the image. For example, it can be shown that the lines and edges found in natural images are a function of these higher-order statistics. In this paper, these higher-order statistics will be discussed in relation to the coding properties of the mammalian visual system. It is suggested that the spatial parameters of the cortical 'filters' (e.g., bandwidths of simple and complex cells) are closely related to these higher-order statistics. In particular, it will be shown that the spatial non-linearities shown by cortical complex cells provide the early visual system with the information required to learn about these statistics."

To understand the representation of images by the mammalian visual system, it might therefore be useful to consider the statistics of images from the natural environment (i.e., images with trees, rocks, bushes, etc). In this study, various coding schemes are compared in relation to how they represent the information in such natural images. The coefficients of such codes are represented by arrays of mechanisms that respond to local regions of space, spatial frequency, and orientation (Gabor-like transforms). For many classes of image, such codes will not be an efficient means of representing information. However, the results obtained with six natural images suggest that the orientation and the spatial-frequency tuning of mammalian simple cells are well suited for coding the information in such images if the goal of the code is to convert higher-order redundancy (e.g., correlation between the intensities of neighboring pixels) into first-order redundancy (i.e., the response distribution of the coefficients). Such coding produces a relatively high signal-to-noise ratio and permits information to be transmitted with only a subset of the total number of cells. These results support Barlow's theory that the goal of natural vision is to represent the information in the natural environment with minimal redundancy."

Out of this work have emerged new concepts of how the brain analyzes and recognizes visual images. The aim of this paper is to explain why \"spatial frequency analysis\" is useful, and to review the insights into visual function that have resulted from its application. It is important to note at the outset that while spatial frequency analysis can provide a comprehensive description of the behavior of neurons in which signals are summed linearly (see below), it has much more limited application to the behavior of neurons that combine signals nonlinearly. Because of this, the greatest insights into visual information processing have come and probably will continue to come from a combined use of space, time, spatial frequency, and temporal frequency measurements. The earliest applications of spatial frequency analysis were motivated by the idea that visual physiology and psychophysics could be more closely related by a uniform approach to the problems of spatial vision. This approach has continued to bind together the psychophysics and physiology of spatial vision, and the interested reader will find relevant psychophysical work discussed in reviews by Braddick et al (1978), De Valois & De Valois (1980), Robson (1980), Westheimer (1984), and Kelly & Burbeck (1984)."

The principle states that the input-output mapping implemented by a processing stage should be chosen so as to maximize the average mutual information between input and output patterns, subject to constraints and in the presence of processing noise. In the present work I show how infomax, when applied to a class of nonlinear input-output mappings, can under certain conditions generate optimal filters that have additional useful properties: (1) Output activity (for each input pattern) tends to be concentrated among a relatively small number of nodes. (2) The filters are sensitive to higher-order statistical structure (beyond pairwise correlations). If the input features are localized, the filters' receptive fields tend to be localized as well. (3) Multiresolution sets of filters with subsampling at low spatial frequencies - related to pyramid coding and wavelet representations - emerge as favored solutions for certain types of input ensembles."

A number of investigators have suggested that the line-weighting functions, as measured orthogonal to the preferred orientation, may be best described as the product of a Gaussian envelope and a sinusoid (i.e. a Gabor function). Following Gabor\u2019s theory of \u2018basis\u2019 functions, it has also been suggested that simple cells can be categorized into even-and odd-symmetric categories. Based on the receptive field profiles of 46 simple cells recorded from cat visual cortex, our analysis provides a quantitative description of both the receptive-field envelope and the receptive-field \u2018symmetry\u2019 of each of the 46 cells. The results support the notion that, to a first approximation, Gabor functions with three free parameters (envelope width, carrier frequency and carrier phase) provide a good description of the receptive-field profiles. However, our analysis does not support the notion that simple cells generally fit into even- and odd-symmetric categories."

It is shown that even a single developing cell of a layered network exhibits a remarkable set of optimization properties that are closely related to issues in statistics, theoretical physics, adaptive signal processing, the formation of knowledge representation in artificial intelligence, and information theory. The network studied is based on the visual system. These results are used to infer an information-theoretic principle that can be applied to the network as a whole, rather than a single cell. The organizing principle proposed is that the network connections develop in such a way as to maximize the amount of information that is preserved when signals are transformed at each processing stage, subject to certain constraints. The operation of this principle is illustrated for some simple cases.<<ETX>>"

Optimization of information capacity is constrained by the noise levels of the individual channels and by a penalty for the construction of long-range interconnections in the array. At low signal-to-noise ratios the optimal filter characteristics correspond to bound states of a Schrodinger equation in which the signal spectrum plays the role of the potential. The resulting optimal filters are remarkably similar to those observed in the mammalian visual cortex and the retinal ganglion cells of lower vertebrates. The observed scale invariance of natural images plays an essential role in this construction."

We suggest that the points in a waveform that have unique perceptual significance as \u2018lines\u2019 and \u2018edges\u2019 are the points where the Fourier components of the waveform come into phase with each other. At these points \u2018local energy\u2019 is maximal. Local energy is defined as the square root of the sum of the squared response of sets of matched filters, of identical amplitude spectrum but differing in phase spectrum by 90\u00b0: one filter type has an even-symmetric line-spread function, the other an odd-symmetric line-spread function. For a line the main contribution to the local energy peak is in the output of the even-symmetric filters, whereas for edges it is in the output of the odd-symmetric filters. If both filter types respond at the peak of local energy, both edges and lines are seen, either simultaneously or alternating in time. The model was tested with a series of images, and shown to predict well the position of perceived features and the organization of the images."

Using the two-dimensional (2D) spatial and spectral response profiles described in the previous two reports, we test Daugman's generalization of Marcelja's hypothesis that simple receptive fields belong to a class of linear spatial filters analogous to those described by Gabor and referred to here as 2D Gabor filters. 2. In the space domain, we found 2D Gabor filters that fit the 2D spatial response profile of each simple cell in the least-squared error sense (with a simplex algorithm), and we show that the residual error is devoid of spatial structure and statistically indistinguishable from random error. 3. Although a rigorous statistical approach was not possible with our spectral data, we also found a Gabor function that fit the 2D spectral response profile of each simple cell and observed that the residual errors are everywhere small and unstructured. 4. As an assay of spatial linearity in two dimensions, on which the applicability of Gabor theory is dependent, we compare the filter parameters estimated from the independent 2D spatial and spectral measurements described above. Estimates of most parameters from the two domains are highly correlated, indicating that assumptions about spatial linearity are valid. 5. Finally, we show that the functional form of the 2D Gabor filter provides a concise mathematical expression, which incorporates the important spatial characteristics of simple receptive fields demonstrated in the previous two reports. Prominent here are 1) Cartesian separable spatial response profiles, 2) spatial receptive fields with staggered subregion placement, 3) Cartesian separable spectral response profiles, 4) spectral response profiles with axes of symmetry not including the origin, and 5) the uniform distribution of spatial phase angles. 6. We conclude that the Gabor function provides a useful and reasonably accurate description of most spatial aspects of simple receptive fields. Thus it seems that an optimal strategy has evolved for sampling images simultaneously in the 2D spatial and spatial frequency domains."

To investigate this question3,4, we used a learning algorithm to construct a neural network model which determines surface curvatures from images of simple geometrical surfaces. The receptive fields developed by units in the network were surprisingly similar to the actual receptive fields of neurons observed in the visual cortex5,6 which are commonly believed to be 'edge' or 'bar' detectors, but have never previously been associated with shading. Thus, our study illustrates the difficulty of trying to deduce neuronal function solely from determination of their receptive fields.

Our computations take place hierarchically, leading to a pyramid representation in which all of the basis functions have the same basic shape, and appear at many scales. By placing the high-pass and low-pass kernels on staggered grids, we can derived odd-tap QMF kernels that are quite compact. We have developed pyramids using separable, quincunx, and hexagonal kernels. Image data compression with the pyramids gives excellent results, both in terms of MSE and visual appearance. A non-orthogonal variant allows good performance with 3-tap basis kernels and the appropriate inverse sampling kernels."

This ability depends on the redundancy of the representation used to describe the class of images. In 1951, Shannon [Bell. Syst. Tech. J. 30, 50 (1951)] showed how to estimate bounds on the entropy and redundancy of an information source from predictability data. The entropy, in turn, gives a measure of the limits to error-free information compaction. An experiment was devised in which human observers interactively restored missing gray levels from 128 X 128 pixel pictures with 16 gray levels. For eight images, the redundancy ranged from 46%, for a complicated picture of foliage, to 74%, for a picture of a face. For almost-complete pictures, but not for noisy pictures, this performance can be matched by a nearest-neighbor predictor."

The representation differs from established techniques in that the code elements are localized in spatial frequency as well as in space. Pixel-to-pixel correlations are first removed by subtracting a lowpass filtered copy of the image from the image itself. The result is a net data compression since the difference, or error, image has low variance and entropy, and the low-pass filtered image may represented at reduced sample density. Further data compression is achieved by quantizing the difference image. These steps are then repeated to compress the low-pass image. Iteration of the process at appropriately expanded scales generates a pyramid data structure. The encoding process is equivalent to sampling the image with Laplacian operators of many scales. Thus, the code tends to enhance salient image features. A further advantage of the present code is that it is well suited for many image analysis tasks as well as for image compression. Fast algorithms are described for coding and decoding."

A representation for the time varying image is formulated which consists of two spatiotemporal components, a velocity field component and a stationary component. We show, using digitized sequences of natural images, that the spatiotemporal spectrum and other attributes of the image markedly differ before and after tracking. The temporal frequency bandwidth and velocity distribution of the velocity field component are diminished in the region of tracking and broaden with increasing eccentricity from this region. On the other hand, the spectrum of the stationary component is unaffected by tracking. Comparison of the properties of the tracked image to those of the M and P pathways suggests that each pathway transmits different attributes of the tracked image. A retinal architecture which varies with eccentricity also matches the properties of the tracked image."

These observations suggest that linear spatial summation tends to occur over a relatively constant area of visual field despite marked differences in each neuron\u2019s optimal spatial frequency, a prediction of one model of visual analysis. There was little difference in either the optimal spatial frequencies or the bandwidths of tuning for different functional classes of neuron. Neurons with broad tuning curves tended to be restricted to lamina IV and its environs, being concentrated in the deep part of lamina II\u2013III and the upper part of lamina IV ab. Neurons with very low optimal spatial frequencies were uncommon and tended to be found either at the border of laminae II\u2013III and IV or in lamina V.

For separations of less than 1.5 min, the addition of flanking lines facilitates bisection so that thresholds of less than 1 sec for discriminating the direction of offset could be reliably obtained. For larger separations an interval could be bisected to an accuracy of 1 part in 60. Experiments varying the length, luminance, and overlap of the lines suggest that different cues are used in these two regimes. A dual space-size analysis is presented that can account for these bisection thresholds over a wide range of experimental conditions. This quantitative analysis produces viewprints of the stimuli (analogous to the voiceprint of audition). Each viewprint shows the output of many spatial filters of different positions and sizes. A new filter shape is introduced that has advantages for modeling the visual system. The sensitivity of each filter is fixed by the contrast-response function. The analysis further shows that the limiting factors in spatial hyperacuity are both the contrast-response function and the spatial grain."

It is shown that efficient information transmission is achieved by a transformation of the initial three colour mechanisms into an achromatic and two opponent chromatic channels. The derivation of the transformation is dependent solely on criteria from information theory. Thus it provides a logical rationale reconciling opponent type processing as an optimal necessary step after the initial three colour mechanisms, unifying respectively the Hering and Young-Helmholtz approaches to colour vision. The effects of chromatic adaptation on the spectral response of the achromatic and two chromatic channels are discussed from the point of view of information theory. It is argued that adaptation serves as a dynamic readjustment of these responses, necessary to meet criteria of efficient colour information transmission. The results are confronted with empirical observations to test the principles of the theory and the relation to other theories is discussed. Within the same framework the issue of trichromacy is discussed. It is argued that a broad class of typical colour spectra can effectively be represented by three significant degrees of freedom that make up a trichromatic system."

                "text": "We have exploited a technique for making small injections of horseradish peroxidase into single cortical laminae in order to study axonal projections in macaque striate cortex. In the preceding paper (Fitzpatrick, D., J. S. Lund, and G. G. Blasdel (1985) J. Neurosci. 5: 3329\u20133349) we examined the projections of cells in lamina 4C--cells that receive most of their input from the lateral geniculate nucleus. The present paper deals with the projections of neurons that lie outside of lamina 4C. Among our findings are several projections that previously had not been described in the monkey. These include: a strong and precise (point-to-point) projection from lamina 4B to lamina 2/3A, a reciprocal projection from 2/3A back to 4B, a definite projection from lamina 4B to 5B, as well as a prominent input to lamina 6 from 5B. In many cases, we find it possible to trace the flow of visual information through several \u201ccircuits\u201d in striate cortex that have, as their output, projections to extrastriate cortex or to the brainstem. Our results offer additional insights in this regard since we are able, in many cases, to compare the lateral spreads of particular projections. These vary and can be separated into at least three categories: those that terminate in a precise, point-to-point, fashion, those that spread widely, and those that terminate in a laterally periodic fashion. In several cases we find evidence for a correlation between specific patterns of projection and known physiological differences between the topographies of laminae that are connected. In cases where two laminae possess similar topographies (for example, where both contain orderly maps for orientation) their interconnections appear precise, with little diffuse spread. In cases where two laminae are characterized by strikingly different topographies (where, for example, one contains an orderly map for orientation and the other a precise map for retinotopic position, but no specificity for orientation), the connections appear more diffuse."

                "text": "I propose a novel general principle for unsupervised learning of distributed non-redundant internal representations of input patterns. The principle is based on two opposing forces. For each represen-tational unit there is an adaptive predictor which tries to predict the unit from the remaining units. In turn, each unit tries to react to the environment such that it minimizes its predictability. This encourages each unit to lter\u00e0bstract concepts' out of the environmental input such that these concepts are statistically independent of those upon which the other units focus. I discuss various simple yet potentially powerful implementations of the principle which aim at nding binary factorial codes (Bar-low et al., 1989), i.e. codes where the probability of the occurrence of a particular input is simply the product of the probabilities of the corresponding code symbols. Such codes are potentially relevant for (1) segmentation tasks, (2) speeding up supervised learning, (3) novelty detection. Methods for nding factorial codes automatically implement Occam's razor for nding codes using a minimal number of units. Unlike previous methods the novel principle has a potential for removing not only linear but also non-linear output redundancy. Illustrative experiments show that algorithms based on the principle of predictability minimization are practically feasible. The nal part of this paper describes an entirely local algorithm that has a potential for learning unique representations of extended input sequences."

Our approach integrates constraints from these two sources and suggests that there are two different stages to curve detection, the first resulting in a local description, and the second in a global one. Each stage involves a different style of computation: in the first stage, hypotheses are represented explicitly and coarsely in a fixed, preconfigured architecture; in the second stage, hypotheses are represented implicitly and more finely in a dynamically constructed architecture. We also show how these stages could be related to physiology, specifying the earlier parts in a relatively fine-grained fashion and the later ones more coarsely."

Other models of RF shape would predict a greater independence between orientation and spatial-frequency tuning. We have examined this by recording the responses of cat striate-cortex cells to a wide range of different spatial-frequency and orientation combinations. In almost all cells studied, peak orientation did not consistently vary with spatial frequency, but the majority of cells showed some change in peak spatial-frequency tuning with orientation. The amount of change in peak spatial frequency tended to be greater for cells that were narrowly tuned for orientation. However, cells narrowly (and also very broadly) tuned for spatial frequency tended to show considerable independence of spatial-frequency and orientation tuning, and in all but a few cells the degree of change was less than predicted by the classic RF model. Such cells were found to fire only to patterns whose local spatial spectra fell within a compact, restricted, roughly circular two-dimensional spatial-frequency region. We conclude that the two-dimensional RF shape of striate cells more closely approximates that predicted by a two-dimensional Gabor model or by a Gaussian-derivative model than it does the classic shape based on the output of geniculate cells with aligned RF's."

The theoretical lower limit for the joint entropy, or uncertainty, of these variables is achieved by an optimal 2D filter family whose spatial weighting functions are generated by exponentiated bivariate second-order polynomials with complex coefficients, the elliptic generalization of the one-dimensional elementary functions proposed in Gabor's famous theory of communication [J. Inst. Electr. Eng. 93, 429 (1946)]. The set includes filters with various orientation bandwidths, spatial-frequency bandwidths, and spatial dimensions, favoring the extraction of various kinds of information from an image. Each such filter occupies an irreducible quantal volume (corresponding to an independent datum) in a four-dimensional information hyperspace whose axes are interpretable as 2D visual space, orientation, and spatial frequency, and thus such a filter set could subserve an optimally efficient sampling of these variables. Evidence is presented that the 2D receptive-field profiles of simple cells in mammalian visual cortex are well described by members of this optimal 2D filter family, and thus such visual neurons could be said to optimize the general uncertainty relations for joint 2D-spatial-2D-spectral information resolution. The variety of their receptive-field dimensions and orientation and spatial-frequency bandwidths, and the correlations among these, reveal several underlying constraints, particularly in width/length aspect ratio and principal axis organization, suggesting a polar division of labor in occupying the quantal volumes of information hyperspace.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

If the variables of a sensory representation normally occur independently of each other, then it is possible to derive the prior probability of any logical function of the variables from the prior probabilities of the individual variables, without any additional knowledge; hence such a representation enormously enlarges the scope of definable events that can be searched for reliable predictors. Finding a Minimum Entropy Code is a possible method of forming such a representation, and methods for doing this are explored in this paper. The main results are (1) to show how to find such a code when the probabilities of the input states form a geometric progression, as is shown to be nearly true for keyboard characters in normal text; (2) to show how a Minimum Entropy Code can be approximated by repeatedly recoding pairs, triples, etc. of an original 7-bit code for keyboard characters; (3) to prove that in some cases enlarging the capacity of the output channel can lower the entropy."

The properties of the operator which approximates a signal at a given resolution were studied. It is shown that the difference of information between the approximation of a signal at the resolutions 2/sup j+1/ and 2/sup j/ (where j is an integer) can be extracted by decomposing this signal on a wavelet orthonormal basis of L/sup 2/(R/sup n/), the vector space of measurable, square-integrable n-dimensional functions. In L/sup 2/(R), a wavelet orthonormal basis is a family of functions which is built by dilating and translating a unique function psi (x). This decomposition defines an orthogonal multiresolution representation called a wavelet representation. It is computed with a pyramidal algorithm based on convolutions with quadrature mirror filters. Wavelet representation lies between the spatial and Fourier domains. For images, the wavelet representation differentiates several spatial orientations.

                "text": "Intracortical injections of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) reveal a system of periodically organized intrinsic connections in primate striate cortex. In layers 2 and 3 these connections form a reticular or latticelike pattern, extending for about 1.5\u20132.0 mm around an injection. This connectional lattice is composed of HRP\u2010labeled walls (350\u2013450 \u03bcm apart in Saimiri and about 500\u2013600 \u03bcm in macaque) surrounding unlabeled central lacunae. Within the lattice walls there are regularly arranged punctate loci of particularly dense HRP label, appearing as isolated patches as the lattice wall labeling thins further from the injection site. A periodic organization has also been demonstrated for the intrinsic connections in layer 4B, which are apparently in register with the supragranular periodicities, although separated from these by a thin unlabeled region. The 4B lattice is particularly prominent in squirrel monkey, extending for 2\u20133 mm from an injection. In both layers, these intrinsic connections are demonstrated by orthogradely and retrogradely transported HRP and seem to reflect a system of neurons with long horizontal axon collaterals, presumably with arborizations at regularly spaced intervals. The intrinsic connectional lattice in layers 2 and 3 resembles the repetitive array of cytochrome oxidase activity in these layers; but despite similarities of dimension and pattern, the two systems do not appear identical. In primate, as previously described in tree shrews (Rockland et al., 1982), the HRP\u2010labeled anatomical connections resemble the pattern of 2\u2010deoxy\u2010glucose accumulation resulting from stimulation with oriented lines, although the functional importance of these connections remains obscure."

And there is a third reason why it has given me much pleasure, for Sir Frederick Bartlett was one of those who had an important influence on the direction of my career some 40 years ago. I had to decide whether to spend my last year at Cambridge reading psychology or physiology, so I attended a short course of introductory lectures he gave in July. About half a dozen of us sat on upright wooden chairs circled around him as he sat in an armchair, smiling benignly. The first thing he did was to tell us to close our notebooks, for he was not going to say anything that would help us to pass any exams. And I believe the very last words of his last lecture were, \u201cSo you see it is all very difficult\u201d. I was very glad he said that, for I had in fact found it all very heavy going: my brain seemed always to be lost in clouds of uncertainty when \u201cremembering\u201d, \u201cthinking\u201d, or \u201cperceiving\u201d were mentioned, because there was no conceptual framework for these processes except the words themselves and others spun around them. What I was looking for were the definable quantities of physics, chemistry and even physiology, these I could handle conceptually in their geometric and functional interactions, whereas I always find a purely verbal argument about abstractions difficult to follow and impossible to believe. So this lack of any nonverbal conceptual framework was very painful."

In the present neural network approach, based on interlaminar interactions involving two layers with fixed weights and one layer with adjustable weights, the network finds coefficients for complete conjoint 2-D Gabor transforms without restrictive conditions. In wavelet expansions based on a biologically inspired log-polar ensemble of dilations, rotations, and translations of a single underlying 2-D Gabor wavelet template, image compression is illustrated with ratios up to 20:1. Also demonstrated is image segmentation based on the clustering of coefficients in the complete 2-D Gabor transform. >"

A number of practical issues concerning its application are addressed. A connection to multivariate density estimation is established, and its properties are investigated through simulation studies and application to real data. The goal of exploratory projection pursuit is to use the data to find low- (one-, two-, or three-) dimensional projections that provide the most revealing views of the full-dimensional data. With these views the human gift for pattern recognition can be applied to help discover effects that may not have been anticipated in advance. Since linear effects are directly captured by the covariance structure of the variable pairs (which are straightforward to estimate) the emphasis here is on the discovery of nonlinear effects such as clustering or other general nonlinear associations among the variables.

Typically we will be in a situation where we have n observations of these random variables, and the parameters of their distribution, such as means, variances and covari-ances are estimated from the values of the observations, but for the moment we think about the distribution of the underlying random variables rather than the particular observations. The basic idea of principal components is to try to describe p dimensional data in as small a number of dimensions (less than p) as possible, while preserving as much as possible of the structures involved. In doing this, we concentrate on variances. The rst step is to look for a linear function z 1 = 1 T x or z 1 = 1 T (x ?) of the elements of x which has maximum variance, where 1 is a vector of p components 11 , 21 , : : : , p1 (beware that some other authors write the suuces the other way round). Note we often subtract the mean. Then 1 T x = 11 x 1 + 21 x 2 + + p1 x p = p X j=1 j1 x j : Next, we look for a linear function z 2 = 2 T x uncorrelated with 1 T x which has maximum variance subject to this condition, and so on, so that at the kth stage a linear function z k = k x is found which has maximum variance subject to being uncorrelated with 1 T x, 2 T x, : : : , k?1 T x. We refer to the kth derived variable k T x as the kth principal component. We stop after the mth stage when, in some sense, the majority of the variation has been accounted for. Before proceeding further, let us recall some results on means and variances of linear functions. Suppose x is any p-dimensional random variable, and that is any constant p-dimensional vector. Then the mean of T x is"

                "text": "Recent computational models of color vision demonstrate that it is possible to achieve exact color constancy over a limited range of lights and surfaces described by linear models. The success of these computational models hinges on whether any sizable range of surface spectral reflectances can be described by a linear model with about three parameters. In the first part of this paper, I analyze two large sets of empirical surface spectral reflectances and examine three conjectures concerning constraints on surface reflectance: that empirical surface reflectances fall within a linear model with a small number of parameters, that empirical surface reflectances fall within a linear model composed of band-limited functions with a small number of parameters, and that the shape of the spectral-sensitivity curves of human vision enhance the fit between empirical surface reflectances and a linear model. I conclude that the first and second conjectures hold for the two sets of spectral reflectances analyzed but that the number of parameters required to model the spectral reflectances is five to seven, not three. A reanalysis of the empirical data that takes human visual sensitivity into account gives more promising results. The linear models derived provide excellent fits to the data with as few as three or four parameters, confirming the third conjecture. The results suggest that constraints on possible surface-reflectance functions and the \"filtering\" properties of the shapes of the spectral-sensitivity curves of photoreceptors can both contribute to color constancy. In the last part of the paper I derive the relation between the number of photoreceptor classes present in vision and the \"filtering\" properties of each class. The results of this analysis reverse a conclusion reached by Barlow: the \"filtering\" properties of human photoreceptors are consistent with a trichromatic visual system that is color constant."

Each record consisted of three tristimulus images (X, Y, and Z) which were analyzed for their color statistics, spatial frequency content, and image correlation. Interactions between color and space were examined using a cone receptor transformation. It is shown that the scene amplitude spectra follow an approximate reciprocal variation with frequency, and that the correlation function can be described by a one-step autoregressive model. The results are discussed in terms of methods for optimum image coding in human and machine vision."
