For example, we desire to obtain an understanding of natural scenes, containing roads, buildings, trees, bushes, etc., as typified by the two frames from a sequence illustrated in Figure 1. The solution to this problem that we are pursuing is to use a computer vision system based upon motion analysis of a monocular image sequence from a mobile camera. By extraction and tracking of image features, representations of the 3D analogues of these features can be constructed."

Following a common consensus in the field, we do not assume that a figure- ground segmentation is available prior to recognition. However, in contrast to most standard approaches for object class recognition, our approach automati- cally segments the object as a result of the categorization. This combination of recognition and segmentation into one process is made pos- sible by our use of an Implicit Shape Model, which integrates both into a common probabilistic framework. In addition to the recognition and segmentation result, it also generates a per-pixel confidence measure specifying the area that supports a hypothesis and how much it can be trusted. We use this confidence to derive a nat- ural extension of the approach to handle multiple objects in a scene and resolve ambiguities between overlapping hypotheses with a novel MDL-based criterion. In addition, we present an extensive evaluation of our method on a standard dataset for car detection and compare its performance to existing methods from the literature. Our results show that the proposed method significantly outper- forms previously published methods while needing one order of magnitude less training examples. Finally, we present results for articulated objects, which show that the proposed method can categorize and segment unfamiliar objects in differ- ent articulations and with widely varying texture patterns, even under significant partial occlusion."

Our primary focus is the development of a learning-based approach to the problem that makes use of a sparse, part-based representation. A vocabulary of distinctive object parts is automatically constructed from a set of sample images of the object class of interest; images are then represented using parts from this vocabulary, together with spatial relations observed among the parts. Based on this representation, a learning algorithm is used to automatically learn to detect instances of the object class in new images. The approach can be applied to any object with distinguishable parts in a relatively fixed spatial configuration; it is evaluated here on difficult sets of real-world images containing side views of cars, and is seen to successfully detect objects in varying conditions amidst background clutter and mild occlusion. In evaluating object detection approaches, several important methodological issues arise that have not been satisfactorily addressed in the previous work. A secondary focus of this paper is to highlight these issues, and to develop rigorous evaluation standards for the object detection problem. A critical evaluation of our approach under the proposed standards is presented."

The approach applies discriminative training of log-linear models to image patch histograms. We show that it works well on three tasks and performs significantly better than other methods using the same features. For example, the method decides that patches containing an eye are most important for distinguishing face from background images. The recognition performance is very competitive with error rates presented in other publications. In particular, a new best error rate for the Caltech motorbikes data of 1.5% is achieved."

The method generalizes and performs well for different tasks, e.g. for radiograph recognition and recognition of objects in cluttered scenes. Here, we further investigate this approach and propose several extensions. Most importantly, the method is substantially improved by adding multi-scale features so that it better accounts for objects of different sizes. Other extensions tested include the use of Sobel features, the generalization of histograms, a method to account for varying image brightness in the PCA domain, and SVMs for classification. The results are improved significantly, i.e. on average we have a 59% relative reduction of the error rate and we are able to obtain a new best error rate of 1.1% on the Caltech motorbikes task."

This bag of keypoints method is based on vector quantization of affine invariant descriptors of image patches. We propose and compare two alternative implementations using different classifiers: Naive Bayes and SVM. The main advantages of the method are that it is simple, computationally efficient and intrinsically invariant. We present results for simultaneously classifying seven semantic visual categories. These results clearly demonstrate that the method is robust to background clutter and produces good categorization accuracy even without exploiting geometric information."

Objects are modeled as flexible constellations of parts. A probabilistic representation is used for all aspects of the object: shape, appearance, occlusion and relative scale. An entropy-based feature detector is used to select regions and their scale within the image. In learning the parameters of the scale-invariant object model are estimated. This is done using expectation-maximization in a maximum-likelihood setting. In recognition, this model is used in a Bayesian manner to classify images. The flexible nature of the model is demonstrated by excellent results over a range of datasets including geometrically constrained classes (e.g. faces, cars) and flexible objects (such as animals)."

In recent years a variety of approaches have been proposed, and impressive results have been reported on a variety of databases. This paper systematically evaluates (1) various local shape descriptors, namely Shape Context and Local Chamfer descriptor and (2) four different interest point detectors for the detection of pedestrians. Those results are compared to the standard global Chamfer matching approach. A main result of the paper is that Shape Context trained on real edge images rather than on clean pedestrian silhouettes combined with the Hessian-Laplace detector outperforms all other tested approaches."

Our basic premise is that this problem is too difficult for any type of model or feature alone. Instead, we present an algorithm that integrates evidence in multiple iterations and from different sources. The core part of our method is the combination of local and global cues via probabilistic top-down segmentation. Altogether, this approach allows examining and comparing object hypotheses with high precision down to the pixel level. Qualitative and quantitative results on a large data set confirm that our method is able to reliably detect pedestrians in crowded scenes, even when they overlap and partially occlude each other. In addition, the flexible nature of our approach allows it to operate on very small training sets."

For use in a real-world system, it is important that this includes the ability to recognize objects at multiple scales. In this paper, we present an approach to multi-scale object categorization using scale-invariant interest points and a scale-adaptive Mean-Shift search. The approach builds on the method from [12], which has been demonstrated to achieve excellent results for the single-scale case, and extends it to multiple scales. We present an experimental comparison of the influence of different interest point operators and quantitatively show the method's robustness to large scale changes."

The first step of our method consists of clustering local scale-invariant descriptors to characterize object class appearance. Next, we train on the groups, and perform feature selection to determine the most discriminative parts. We use local regions to realize robust and sparse part and texture selection invariant to changes in scale, orientation and affine deformation and, as a result, we avoid image normalization in both training and prediction phases. We train our object models without requiring image parts to be labeled or objects to be separated from the background. Moreover, our method continues to work well when images have cluttered background and occluded objects. We evaluate our method on seven recently proposed datasets, and quantitatively compare the effect of different types of local regions and feature selection criteria on object recognition. Our experiments show that local invariant descriptors are an appropriate representation for many different object classes. Our results also confirm the importance of appearance-based discriminative feature selection."

A classifier is then learned for each of these parts, and feature selection is used to determine the most discriminative ones. This approach allows robust pan detection, and it is invariant under scale changes-that is, neither the training images nor the test images have to be normalized. The proposed method is evaluated in car detection tasks with significant variations in viewing conditions, and promising results are demonstrated. Different local regions, classifiers and feature selection methods are quantitatively compared. Our evaluation shows that local invariant descriptors are an appropriate representation for object classes such as cars, and it underlines the importance of feature selection."

                "text": "In this paper we describe the first stage of a new learning system for object detection and recognition. For our system we propose Boosting (5) as the underlying learning technique. This allows the use of very diverse sets of visual features in the learning process within a com- mon framework: Boosting \u2014 together with a weak hypotheses finder \u2014 may choose very inhomogeneous features as most relevant for combina- tion into a final hypothesis. As another advantage the weak hypotheses finder may search the weak hypotheses space without explicit calculation of all available hypotheses, reducing computation time. This contrasts the related work of Agarwal and Roth (1) where Winnow was used as learning algorithm and all weak hypotheses were calculated explicitly. In our first empirical evaluation we use four types of local descriptors: two basic ones consisting of a set of grayvalues and intensity moments and two high level descriptors: moment invariants (8) and SIFTs (12). The descriptors are calculated from local patches detected by an inter- est point operator. The weak hypotheses finder selects one of the local patches and one type of local descriptor and efficiently searches for the most discriminative similarity threshold. This differs from other work on Boosting for object recognition where simple rectangular hypotheses (22) or complex classifiers (20) have been used. In relatively simple images, where the objects are prominent, our approach yields results comparable to the state-of-the-art (3). But we also obtain very good results on more complex images, where the objects are located in arbitrary positions, poses, and scales in the images. These results indicate that our flexible approach, which also allows the inclusion of features from segmented re- gions and even spatial relationships, leads us a significant step towards generic object recognition."

The features are invariant to image scaling, translation, and rotation, and partially invariant to illumination changes and affine or 3D projection. These features share similar properties with neurons in inferior temporal cortex that are used for object recognition in primate vision. Features are efficiently detected through a staged filtering approach that identifies stable points in scale space. Image keys are created that allow for local geometric deformations by representing blurred image gradients in multiple orientation planes and at multiple scales. The keys are used as input to a nearest neighbor indexing method that identifies candidate object matches. Final verification of each match is achieved by finding a low residual least squares solution for the unknown model parameters. Experimental results show that robust object recognition can be achieved in cluttered partially occluded images with a computation time of under 2 seconds."

Recently, many detectors/descriptors have been evaluated in the context of matching as well as invariance to viewpoint changes (Mikolajczyk and Schmid, 2004). However, it is unclear if these results can be generalized to categorization problems, which require different properties of features. We evaluate 5 state-of-the-art scale invariant region detectors and 5 descriptors. Local features are computed for 20 object classes and clustered using hierarchical agglomerative clustering. We measure the quality of appearance clusters and location distributions using entropy as well as precision. We also measure how the clusters generalize from training set to novel test data. Our results indicate that attended SIFT descriptors (Mikolajczyk and Schmid, 2005) computed on Hessian-Laplace regions perform best. Second score is obtained by salient regions (Kadir and Brady, 2001). The results also show that these two detectors provide complementary features. The new detectors/descriptors significantly improve the performance of a state-of-the art recognition approach (Leibe, et al., 2005) in pedestrian detection task"

While categorization algorithms tend to agree in using local descriptors, they differ in the choice of the classifier, with some using generative models and others discriminative approaches. This paper presents a method for object category detection which integrates a generative model with a discriminative classifier. For each object category, we generate an appearance codebook, which becomes a common vocabulary for the generative and discriminative methods. Given a query image, the generative part of the algorithm finds a set of hypotheses and estimates their support in location and scale. Then, the discriminative part verifies each hypothesis on the same codebook activations. The new algorithm exploits the strengths of both original methods, minimizing their weaknesses. Experiments on several databases show that our new approach performs better than its building blocks taken separately. Moreover, experiments on two challenging multi-scale databases show that our new algorithm outperforms previously reported results"

The normalized cut criterion measures both the total dissimilarity between the different groups as well as the total similarity within the groups.

This paper presents a large-scale evaluation of an approach that represents images as distributions (signatures or histograms) of features extracted from a sparse set of keypoint locations and learns a Support Vector Machine classifier with kernels based on two effective measures for comparing distributions, the Earth Mover's Distance and the chi-square distance. We first evaluate the performance of our approach with different keypoint detectors and descriptors, as well as different kernels and classifiers. We then conduct a comparative evaluation with several state-of-the-art recognition methods on four texture and five object databases. On most of these databases, our implementation exceeds the best reported results and achieves comparable performance on the rest. Finally, we investigate the influence of background correlations on recognition performance via extensive tests on the PASCAL database, for which ground-truth object localization information is available. Our experiments demonstrate that image representations based on distributions of local features are surprisingly effective for classification of texture and object images under challenging real-world conditions, including significant intra-class variations and substantial background clutter."

Such natural textures arise from spatial variation of two surface attributes: (1) reflectance and (2) surface normal. In this paper, we provide a unified model to address both these aspects of natural texture. The main idea is to construct a vocabulary of prototype tiny surface patches with associated local geometric and photometric properties. We call these 3D textons. Examples might be ridges, grooves, spots or stripes or combinations thereof. Associated with each texton is an appearance vector, which characterizes the local irradiance distribution, represented as a set of linear Gaussian derivative filter outputs, under different lighting and viewing conditions.Given a large collection of images of different materials, a clustering approach is used to acquire a small (on the order of 100) 3D texton vocabulary. Given a few (1 to 4) images of any material, it can be characterized using these textons. We demonstrate the application of this representation for recognition of the material viewed under novel lighting and viewing conditions. We also illustrate how the 3D texton model can be used to predict the appearance of materials under novel conditions."

Many different descriptors have been proposed in the literature. It is unclear which descriptors are more appropriate and how their performance depends on the interest region detector. The descriptors should be distinctive and at the same time robust to changes in viewing conditions as well as to errors of the detector. Our evaluation uses as criterion recall with respect to precision and is carried out for different image transformations. We compare shape context [Belongie, S, et al., April 2002], steerable filters [Freeman, W and Adelson, E, Setp. 1991], PCA-SIFT [Ke, Y and Sukthankar, R, 2004], differential invariants [Koenderink, J and van Doorn, A, 1987], spin images [Lazebnik, S, et al., 2003], SIFT [Lowe, D. G., 1999], complex filters [Schaffalitzky, F and Zisserman, A, 2002], moment invariants [Van Gool, L, et al., 1996], and cross-correlation for different types of interest regions. We also propose an extension of the SIFT descriptor and show that it outperforms the original method. Furthermore, we observe that the ranking of the descriptors is mostly independent of the interest region detector and that the SIFT-based descriptors perform best. Moments and steerable filters show the best performance among the low dimensional descriptors."

To solve the unified problem, we present an algorithm based on the Augmented Lagrangian Method. Experiments show that SVM_2K performs well on generic object recognition problems in computer vision."

The proposed system automatically synthesizes simple problem-specific feature extractors from a training set of face and nonface patterns, without making any assumptions or using any hand-made design concerning the features to extract or the areas of the face pattern to analyze. The face detection procedure acts like a pipeline of simple convolution and subsampling modules that treat the raw input image as a whole. We therefore show that an efficient face detection system does not require any costly local preprocessing before classification of image areas. The proposed scheme provides very high detection rate with a particularly low level of false positives, demonstrated on difficult test sets, without requiring the use of multiple networks for handling difficult cases. We present extensive experimental results illustrating the efficiency of the proposed approach on difficult test sets and including an in-depth sensitivity analysis with respect to the degrees of variability of the face patterns."

                "text": "The fact that objects in the world appear in different ways depending on the scale of observation has important implications if one aims at describing them. It shows that the notion of scale is of utmost importance when processing unknown measurement data by automatic methods. In their seminal works, Witkin (1983) and Koenderink (1984) proposed to approach this problem by representing image structures at different scales in a so-called scale-space representation. Traditional scale-space theory building on this work, however, does not address the problem of how to select local appropriate scales for further analysis. This article proposes a systematic methodology for dealing with this problem. A framework is presented for generating hypotheses about interesting scale levels in image data, based on a general principle stating that local extrema over scales of different combinations of \u03b3-normalized derivatives are likely candidates to correspond to interesting structures. Specifically, it is shown how this idea can be used as a major mechanism in algorithms for automatic scale selection, which adapt the local scales of processing to the local image structure.Support for the proposed approach is given in terms of a general theoretical investigation of the behaviour of the scale selection method under rescalings of the input pattern and by integration with different types of early visual modules, including experiments on real-world and synthetic data. Support is also given by a detailed analysis of how different types of feature detectors perform when integrated with a scale selection mechanism and then applied to characteristic model patterns. Specifically, it is described in detail how the proposed methodology applies to the problems of blob detection, junction detection, edge detection, ridge detection and local frequency estimation.In many computer vision applications, the poor performance of the low-level vision modules constitutes a major bottleneck. It is argued that the inclusion of mechanisms for automatic scale selection is essential if we are to construct vision systems to automatically analyse complex unknown environments."

Learning the joint distribution of image regions and words has many applications. We consider in detail predicting words associated with whole images (auto-annotation) and corresponding to particular image regions (region naming). Auto-annotation might help organize and access large collections of images. Region naming is a model of object recognition as a process of translating image regions to words, much as one might translate from one language to another. Learning the relationships between image regions and semantic correlates (words) is an interesting example of multi-modal data mining, particularly because it is typically hard to apply data mining techniques to collections of images. We develop a number of models for the joint distribution of image regions and words, including several which explicitly learn the correspondence between regions and words. We study multi-modal and correspondence extensions to Hofmann's hierarchical clustering/aspect model, a translation model adapted from statistical machine translation (Brown et al.), and a multi-modal extension to mixture of latent Dirichlet allocation (MoM-LDA). All models are assessed using a large collection of annotated images of real scenes. We study in depth the difficult problem of measuring performance. For the annotation task, we look at prediction performance on held out data. We present three alternative measures, oriented toward different types of task. Measuring the performance of correspondence methods is harder, because one must determine whether a word has been placed on the right region of an image. We can use annotation performance as a proxy measure, but accurate measurement requires hand labeled data, and thus must occur on a smaller scale. We show results using both an annotation proxy, and manually labeled data."

GNNs can be applied on datasets that contain very general types of graphs and, under mild hypotheses, they have been proven to be universal approximators on graphical domains. Whereas most of the common approaches to graphs processing are based on a preliminary phase that maps each graph onto a simpler data type, like a vector or a sequence of reals, GNNs have the ability to directly process input graphs, thus embedding their connectivity into the processing scheme. In this paper, the main theoretical properties of GNNs are briefly reviewed and they are proposed as a tool for object localization. An experimentation has been carried out on the task of locating the face of a popular Walt Disney character in comic covers. In the dataset the character is shown in a number of different poses, often in cluttered backgrounds, and in high variety of colors. The proposed learning framework provides a way to deal with complex data arising from image segmentation process, without exploiting any prior knowledge on the dataset. The results are very encouraging, prove the viability of the method and the effectiveness of the structural representation of images."

Codebooks are usually constructed by using a method such as k-means to cluster the descriptor vectors of patches sampled either densely ('textons') or sparsely ('bags of features' based on key-points or salience measures) from a set of training images. This works well for texture analysis in homogeneous images, but the images that arise in natural object recognition tasks have far less uniform statistics. We show that for dense sampling, k-means over-adapts to this, clustering centres almost exclusively around the densest few regions in descriptor space and thus failing to code other informative regions. This gives suboptimal codes that are no better than using randomly selected centres. We describe a scalable acceptance-radius based clusterer that generates better codebooks and study its performance on several image classification tasks. We also show that dense representations outperform equivalent keypoint based ones on these tasks and that SVM or mutual information based feature selection starting from a dense codebook further improves the performance."

Numerous applications in computer vision can be naturally interpreted as instanciations of this fundamental problem. Recently, a non-iterative discrete approach, tensor voting, has been introduced to solve this problem and has been applied successfully to various applications. As an alternative, we propose a variational formulation of this problem in the continuous setting and derive an iterative algorithm which approximates its solutions. This method and tensor voting are somewhat the differential and integral form of one another. Although iterative methods are slower in general, the strength of the suggested method is that it can easily be applied when the ambient space is not Euclidean, which is important in many applications. The algorithm consists in solving a partial differential equation that performs a special anisotropic diffusion on an implicit representation of the known set of points. This results in connecting isolated neighbouring points. This approach is very simple, mathematically sound, robust and powerful since it handles in a homogeneous way manifolds of arbitrary dimension and topology, embedded in Euclidean or non-Euclidean spaces, with or without border. We shall present this approach and demonstrate both its benefits and shortcomings in two different contexts: (i) data visual analysis, (ii) skin detection in color images."

Mikolajczyk and Schmid (June 2003) recently evaluated a variety of approaches and identified the SIFT [D. G. Lowe, 1999] algorithm as being the most resistant to common image deformations. This paper examines (and improves upon) the local image descriptor used by SIFT. Like SIFT, our descriptors encode the salient aspects of the image gradient in the feature point's neighborhood; however, instead of using SIFT's smoothed weighted histograms, we apply principal components analysis (PCA) to the normalized gradient patch. Our experiments demonstrate that the PCA-based local descriptors are more distinctive, more robust to image deformations, and more compact than the standard SIFT representation. We also present results showing that using these descriptors in an image retrieval application results in increased accuracy and faster matching."

This paper shows that support vector machines (SVM's) can generalize well on difficult image classification problems where the only features are high dimensional histograms. Heavy-tailed RBF kernels of the form K(x, y) = e(-rho)Sigma(i)/xia-yia/b with a < or = 1 and b < or = 2 are evaluated on the classification of images extracted from the Corel stock photo collection and shown to far outperform traditional polynomial or Gaussian radial basis function (RBF) kernels. Moreover, we observed that a simple remapping of the input x(i)-->x(i)(a) improves the performance of linear SVM's to such an extend that it makes them, for this problem, a valid alternative to RBF kernels."

Luckily, the MPEG-7 international standard is now emerging as both a general framework for content description and a collection of specific agreed-upon content descriptors. We have developed a neural, self-organizing technique for CBIR. Our system is named PicSOM and it is based on pictorial examples and relevance feedback (RF). The name stems from \"picture\" and the self-organizing map (SOM). The PicSOM system is implemented by using tree structured SOMs. In this paper, we apply the visual content descriptors provided by MPEG-7 in the PicSOM system and compare our own image indexing technique with a reference system based on vector quantization (VQ). The results of our experiments show that the MPEG-7-defined content descriptors can be used as such in the PicSOM system even though Euclidean distance calculation, inherently used in the PicSOM system, is not optimal for all of them. Also, the results indicate that the PicSOM technique is a bit slower than the reference system in starting to find relevant images. However, when the strong RF mechanism of PicSOM begins to function, its retrieval precision exceeds that of the reference system."

The first one is completely nonparametric and is based on the the adaptive estimation of the normalized density gradient. Employing the sample point estimator, we define the Variable Bandwidth Mean Shift, prove its convergence, and show its superiority over the fixed bandwidth procedure. The second technique has a semiparametric nature and imposes a local structure on the data to extract reliable scale information. The local scale of the underlying density is taken as the bandwidth which maximizes the magnitude of the normalized mean shift vector. Both estimators provide practical tools for autonomous image and quasi real-time video analysis and several examples are shown to illustrate their effectiveness."

We build the adjacency matrix M of a graph whose nodes represent the potential correspondences and the weights on the links represent pairwise agreements between potential correspondences. Correct assignments are likely to establish links among each other and thus form a strongly connected cluster. Incorrect correspondences establish links with the other correspondences only accidentally, so they are unlikely to belong to strongly connected clusters. We recover the correct assignments based on how strongly they belong to the main cluster of M, by using the principal eigenvector of M and imposing the mapping constraints required by the overall correspondence mapping (one-to-one or one-to-many). The experimental evaluation shows that our method is robust to outliers, accurate in terms of matching rate, while being much faster than existing methods"

                "text": "Chapters 2\u20137 make up Part II of the book: artificial neural networks. After introducing the basic concepts of neurons and artificial neuron learning rules in Chapter 2, Chapter 3 describes a particular formalism, based on signal-plus-noise, for the learning problem in general. After presenting the basic neural network types this chapter reviews the principal algorithms for error function minimization/optimization and shows how these learning issues are addressed in various supervised models. Chapter 4 deals with issues in unsupervised learning networks, such as the Hebbian learning rule, principal component learning, and learning vector quantization. Various techniques and learning paradigms are covered in Chapters 3\u20136, and especially the properties and relative merits of the multilayer perceptron networks, radial basis function networks, self-organizing feature maps and reinforcement learning are discussed in the respective four chapters. Chapter 7 presents an in-depth examination of performance issues in supervised learning, such as accuracy, complexity, convergence, weight initialization, architecture selection, and active learning. Par III (Chapters 8\u201315) offers an extensive presentation of techniques and issues in evolutionary computing. Besides the introduction to the basic concepts in evolutionary computing, it elaborates on the more important and most frequently used techniques on evolutionary computing paradigm, such as genetic algorithms, genetic programming, evolutionary programming, evolutionary strategies, differential evolution, cultural evolution, and co-evolution, including design aspects, representation, operators and performance issues of each paradigm. The differences between evolutionary computing and classical optimization are also explained. Part IV (Chapters 16 and 17) introduces swarm intelligence. It provides a representative selection of recent literature on swarm intelligence in a coherent and readable form. It illustrates the similarities and differences between swarm optimization and evolutionary computing. Both particle swarm optimization and ant colonies optimization are discussed in the two chapters, which serve as a guide to bringing together existing work to enlighten the readers, and to lay a foundation for any further studies. Part V (Chapters 18\u201321) presents fuzzy systems, with topics ranging from fuzzy sets, fuzzy inference systems, fuzzy controllers, to rough sets. The basic terminology, underlying motivation and key mathematical models used in the field are covered to illustrate how these mathematical tools can be used to handle vagueness and uncertainty. This book is clearly written and it brings together the latest concepts in computational intelligence in a friendly and complete format for undergraduate/postgraduate students as well as professionals new to the field. With about 250 pages covering such a wide variety of topics, it would be impossible to handle everything at a great length. Nonetheless, this book is an excellent choice for readers who wish to familiarize themselves with computational intelligence techniques or for an overview/introductory course in the field of computational intelligence.

Our scale and affine invariant detectors are based on the following recent results: (1) Interest points extracted with the Harris detector can be adapted to affine transformations and give repeatable results (geometrically stable). (2) The characteristic scale of a local structure is indicated by a local extremum over scale of normalized derivatives (the Laplacian). (3) The affine shape of a point neighborhood is estimated based on the second moment matrix.Our scale invariant detector computes a multi-scale representation for the Harris interest point detector and then selects points at which a local measure (the Laplacian) is maximal over scales. This provides a set of distinctive points which are invariant to scale, rotation and translation as well as robust to illumination changes and limited changes of viewpoint. The characteristic scale determines a scale invariant region for each point. We extend the scale invariant detector to affine invariance by estimating the affine shape of a point neighborhood. An iterative algorithm modifies location, scale and neighborhood of each point and converges to affine invariant points. This method can deal with significant affine transformations including large scale changes. The characteristic scale and the affine shape of neighborhood determine an affine invariant region for each point.We present a comparative evaluation of different detectors and show that our approach provides better results than existing methods. The performance of our detector is also confirmed by excellent matching results; the image is described by a set of scale/affine invariant descriptors computed on the regions associated with our points."

RNNs and GNNs exploit a similar processing framework, but they can be applied to different input domains. RNNs require the input graphs to be directed and acyclic, whereas GNNs can process any kind of graphs. The aim of this paper consists in understanding whether such a difference affects the behaviour of the models on a real application. An experimental comparison on an image classification problem is presented, showing that GNNs outperforms RNNs. Moreover the main differences between the models are also discussed w.r.t. their input domains, their approximation capabilities and their learning algorithms."

Whereas the k-median problem involves optimizing the simultaneous placement of k facilities, the on-line median problem imposes the following additional constraints: the facilities are placed one at a time; a facility cannot be moved once it is placed, and the total number of facilities to be placed, k, is not known in advance. The objective of an online median algorithm is to minimize the competitive ratio, that is, the worst-case ratio of the cost of an online placement to that of an optimal offline placement. Our main result is a linear-time constant-competitive algorithm for the online median problem. In addition, we present a related, though substantially simpler linear-time constant-factor approximation algorithm for the (metric uncapacitated) facility location problem. The latter algorithm is similar in spirit to the recent primal-dual-based facility location algorithm of Jain and Vazirani, but our approach is more elementary and yields an improved running time."

The application areas range from neural networks and pattern recognition to machine learning and data mining. This book, developed from lectures and tutorials, fulfils two major roles: firstly it provides practitioners with a large toolkit of algorithms, kernels and solutions ready to use for standard pattern discovery problems in fields such as bioinformatics, text analysis, image analysis. Secondly it provides an easy introduction for students and researchers to the growing field of kernel-based pattern analysis, demonstrating with examples how to handcraft an algorithm or a kernel for a new specific application, and covering all the necessary conceptual and mathematical tools to do so."

In spite of this, applied scientists routinely use PLS for classification and there is substantial empirical evidence to suggest that it performs well in that role. The interesting question is: why can a procedure that is principally designed for overdetermined regression problems locate and emphasize group structure? Using PLS in this manner has heurestic support owing to the relationship between PLS and canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and the relationship, in turn, between CCA and linear discriminant analysis (LDA). This paper replaces the heuristics with a formal statistical explanation. As a consequence, it will become clear that PLS is to be preferred over PCA when discrimination is the goal and dimension reduction is needed. Copyright \u00a9 2003 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."
