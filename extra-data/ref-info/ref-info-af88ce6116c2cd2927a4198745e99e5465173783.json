In the word-labeling task, the RNN is used analogously to the more traditional conditional random field (CRF) to assign a label to each word in an input sequence, and has been shown to significantly outperform CRFs. In contrast to CRFs, RNNs operate in an online fashion to assign labels as soon as a word is seen, rather than after seeing the whole word sequence. In this paper, we show that the performance of an RNN tagger can be significantly improved by incorporating elements of the CRF model; specifically, the explicit modeling of output-label dependencies with transition features, its global sequence-level objective function, and offline decoding. We term the resulting model a \u201crecurrent conditional random field\u201d and demonstrate its effectiveness on the ATIS travel domain dataset and a variety of web-search language understanding datasets."

In the word labeling task, a tagger is used to assign a label to each word in an input sequence. Specifically, simple recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown to significantly outperform the previous state-of-the-art - conditional random fields (CRFs). This paper investigates using long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks, which contain input, output and forgetting gates and are more advanced than simple RNN, for the word labeling task. To explicitly model output-label dependence, we propose a regression model on top of the LSTM un-normalized scores. We also propose to apply deep LSTM to the task. We investigated the relative importance of each gate in the LSTM by setting other gates to a constant and only learning particular gates. Experiments on the ATIS dataset validated the effectiveness of the proposed models."

The proposed architecture can be perceived as a neural network (NN) version of the triangular CRF model (TriCRF), in which the intent label and the slot sequence are modeled jointly and their dependencies are exploited. Our slot filling component is a globally normalized CRF style model, as opposed to left-to-right models in recent NN based slot taggers. Its features are automatically extracted through CNN layers and shared by the intent model. We show that our slot model component generates state-of-the-art results, outperforming CRF significantly. Our joint model outperforms the standard TriCRF by 1% absolute for both intent and slot. On a number of other domains, our joint model achieves 0.7-1%, and 0.9-2.1% absolute gains over the independent modeling approach for intent and slot respectively."

In this paper we show that the latent-dynamics (i.e., hidden substructure of shallow phrases) constitutes a problem in shallow parsing, and we show that modeling this intermediate structure is useful. By analyzing the automatically learned hidden states, we show how the latent conditional model explicitly learn latent-dynamics. We propose in this paper the Best Label Path (BLP) inference algorithm, which is able to produce the most probable label sequence on latent conditional models. It outperforms two existing inference algorithms. With the BLP inference, the LDCRF model significantly outperforms CRF models on word features, and achieves comparable performance of the most successful shallow parsers on the CoNLL data when further using part-of-speech features."

In this paper we present two contributions: a new form of learning word embeddings that can leverage information from relevant lexicons to improve the representations, and the first system to use neural word embeddings to achieve state-of-the-art results on named-entity recognition in both CoNLL and Ontonotes NER. Our system achieves an F1 score of 90.90 on the test set for CoNLL 2003---significantly better than any previous system trained on public data, and matching a system employing massive private industrial query-log data."

We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O. 1. Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms."

It is unclear, however, what utility nonlinearity offers in conventional featurebased models. In this study, we show the close connection between CRF and \u201csequence model\u201d neural nets, and present an empirical investigation to compare their performance on two sequence labeling tasks \u2010 Named Entity Recognition and Syntactic Chunking.

We show how to solve this dilemma with Gibbs sampling, a simple Monte Carlo method used to perform approximate inference in factored probabilistic models. By using simulated annealing in place of Viterbi decoding in sequence models such as HMMs, CMMs, and CRFs, it is possible to incorporate non-local structure while preserving tractable inference. We use this technique to augment an existing CRF-based information extraction system with long-distance dependency models, enforcing label consistency and extraction template consistency constraints. This technique results in an error reduction of up to 9% over state-of-the-art systems on two established information extraction tasks."

End-to-end training methods such as Connectionist Temporal Classification make it possible to train RNNs for sequence labelling problems where the input-output alignment is unknown. The combination of these methods with the Long Short-term Memory RNN architecture has proved particularly fruitful, delivering state-of-the-art results in cursive handwriting recognition. However RNN performance in speech recognition has so far been disappointing, with better results returned by deep feedforward networks. This paper investigates deep recurrent neural networks, which combine the multiple levels of representation that have proved so effective in deep networks with the flexible use of long range context that empowers RNNs. When trained end-to-end with suitable regularisation, we find that deep Long Short-term Memory RNNs achieve a test set error of 17.7% on the TIMIT phoneme recognition benchmark, which to our knowledge is the best recorded score."

Conditional random fields offer several advantages over hidden Markov models and stochastic grammars for such tasks, including the ability to relax strong independence assumptions made in those models. Conditional random fields also avoid a fundamental limitation of maximum entropy Markov models (MEMMs) and other discriminative Markov models based on directed graphical models, which can be biased towards states with few successor states. We present iterative parameter estimation algorithms for conditional random fields and compare the performance of the resulting models to HMMs and MEMMs on synthetic and natural-language data."

In these cases, the observations are usually modeled as multinomial distributions over a discrete vocabulary, and the HMM parameters are set to maximize the likelihood of the observations. This paper presents a new Markovian sequence model, closely related to HMMs, that allows observations to be represented as arbitrary overlapping features (such as word, capitalization, formatting, part-of-speech), and defines the conditional probability of state sequences given observation sequences. It does this by using the maximum entropy framework to fit a set of exponential models that represent the probability of a state given an observation and the previous state. We present positive experimental results on the segmentation of FAQ\u2019s."

Instead of exploiting man-made input features carefully optimized for each task, our system learns internal representations on the basis of vast amounts of mostly unlabeled training data.

Results indicate that it is possible to obtain around 50% reduction of perplexity by using mixture of several RNN LMs, compared to a state of the art backoff language model. Speech recognition experiments show around 18% reduction of word error rate on the Wall Street Journal task when comparing models trained on the same amount of data, and around 5% on the much harder NIST RT05 task, even when the backoff model is trained on much more data than the RNN LM. We provide ample empirical evidence to suggest that connectionist language models are superior to standard n-gram techniques, except their high computational (training) complexity.

In this paper we present several extensions that improve both the quality of the vectors and the training speed. By subsampling of the frequent words we obtain significant speedup and also learn more regular word representations. We also describe a simple alternative to the hierarchical softmax called negative sampling. \n \nAn inherent limitation of word representations is their indifference to word order and their inability to represent idiomatic phrases. For example, the meanings of \"Canada\" and \"Air\" cannot be easily combined to obtain \"Air Canada\". Motivated by this example, we present a simple method for finding phrases in text, and show that learning good vector representations for millions of phrases is possible."

Methods that use both labeled and unlabeled data are generally referred to as semi-supervised learning. Although a number of such methods are proposed, at the current stage, we still don't have a complete understanding of their effectiveness. This paper investigates a closely related problem, which leads to a novel approach to semi-supervised learning. Specifically we consider learning predictive structures on hypothesis spaces (that is, what kind of classifiers have good predictive power) from multiple learning tasks. We present a general framework in which the structural learning problem can be formulated and analyzed theoretically, and relate it to learning with unlabeled data. Under this framework, algorithms for structural learning will be proposed, and computational issues will be investigated. Experiments will be given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms in the semi-supervised learning setting."

One approach is to represent time implicitly by its effects on processing rather than explicitly (as in a spatial representation). The current report develops a proposal along these lines first described by Jordan (1986) which involves the use of recurrent links in order to provide networks with a dynamic memory. In this approach, hidden unit patterns are fed back to themselves; the internal representations which develop thus reflect task demands in the context of prior internal states. A set of simulations is reported which range from relatively simple problems (temporal version of XOR) to discovering syntactic/semantic features for words. The networks are able to learn interesting internal representations which incorporate task demands with memory demands; indeed, in this approach the notion of memory is inextricably bound up with task processing. These representations reveal a rich structure, which allows them to be highly context-dependent while also expressing generalizations across classes of items. These representations suggest a method for representing lexical categories and the type/token distinction."

Many existing systems on structured prediction focus on increasing the level of structural dependencies within the model. However, this trend could have been misdirected, because our study suggests that complex structures are actually harmful to generalization ability in structured prediction. To control structure-based overfitting, we propose a structure regularization framework via structure decomposition, which decomposes training samples into mini-samples with simpler structures, deriving a model with better generalization power. We show both theoretically and empirically that structure regularization can effectively control overfitting risk and lead to better accuracy. As a by-product, the proposed method can also substantially accelerate the training speed. The method and the theoretical results can apply to general graphical models with arbitrary structures. Experiments on well-known tasks demonstrate that our method can easily beat the benchmark systems on those highly-competitive tasks, achieving record-breaking accuracies yet with substantially faster training speed."

It is very easy to use and easily configurable so as to perfectly fit the needs of a number of different applications. Results are also very competitive, achieving an accuracy of 97.16% for English on the Wall Street Journal corpus. It has been also successfully applied to Spanish exhibiting a similar performance. A first release of the SVMTool Perl prototype is now freely available for public use. A most efficient C++ version is coming very soon."
