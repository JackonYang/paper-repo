In Experiments I and II, the pictures were line drawings of familiar objects and the words were their printed labels; in Experiment III, the stimuli were photographs of the faces of famous people and their corresponding printed names. Search times in Experiments I and II were consistently faster when the array items were pictures than when they were words, regardless of the mode of the target items. Search was also faster with pictures than with words as targets when the search array also consisted of pictures, but target mode had no consistent effect with words as array items. Experiment III yielded a completely different pattern of results: Search time with names as targets and faces as search array items was significantly slower than in the other three conditions, which did not differ from each other. Considered in relation to several theories, the results are most consistent with a dual-coding interpretation. That is, items that are cognitively represented both verbally and as nonverbal images can be searched and compared in either mode, depending on the demands of the task. The mode actually used depends on whether the search must be conducted through an array of pictures or words."

Ss responded \u201csame\u201d or \u201cdifferent.\u201d Performance was fast and accurate if the interval was short and there was no movement or masking of the pattern during the interval. Performance was slower, less accurate, and highly dependent on pattern complexity if the interval exceeded 100 msec or if there was movement or masking. The results are interpreted as evidence for two distinct classes of visual memory: high-capacity sensory storage which is tied to spatial position and is maskable and brief; and schematic short-term visual memory which is not tied to spatial position, which is protected against masking, and which becomes less effective over the first few seconds but not over the first 600 msec."

There is disagreement, however, about whether those early stages lead to a common abstract representation in memory, the idea of a chair1\u20134, or to two separate representations, one verbal (common to spoken and written words), and the other image-like5. The first view claims that words and images are associated with ideas, but the underlying representation of an idea is abstract. According to the second view, the verbal representation alone is directly associated with abstract information about an object (for example, its superordinate category: furniture). Concrete perceptual information (for example, characteristic shape, colour or size) is associated with the imaginal representation. Translation from one representation to the other takes time, on the second view, which accounts for the observation that naming a line drawing takes longer than naming (reading aloud) a written word6,7. Here we confirm that naming a drawing of an object takes much longer than reading its name, but we show that deciding whether the object is in a given category such as \u2018furniture\u2019 takes slightly less time for a drawing than for a word, a result that seems to be inconsistent with the second view."

It is argued that printed words are processed in two stages, termed \u2018stimulus examination\u2019 and \u2018memory examination\u2019 respectively. Preliminary data relevant to other aspects of the scanning method are also presented: error rates, the importance of motivation, the extent to which words scanned over can be recognized later, and the relation between scanning and reading aloud."

Postinput recognition data indicated a processing disruption of several pictorial items following the emotional as compared to the neutral input and a possible processing disruption of the item immediately preceding the emotional stimulus.

Ss were required to search for new targets after extended practice with one specific target set. Simultaneous memory search was not supported, since searching for one item remained faster than for several items. Serial exhaustive memory search was not supported since the search data were nonlinear. There is evidence that the categorization of a target, even after large amounts of specific practice, is not heavily dependent upon its physical features. A strategy change was detected during practice which allowed more efficient search. It is concluded that a single memory search process can account for the data under both high and low levels of specific practice."

Moreover, a subject trained on such a disjunctive latency task, and then presented with blocks of trials in which there is only one possible stimulus displacement, of probability 1.00, 0.75, 0.50, or 0.25, displays the same latency to that displacement as when it was embedded in one of the disjunctive sets. These results conflict with reports that knowledge of stimulus location determines saccade latency. When the saccade on each trial is under the control of the stimulus on that trial, the size of the set of possible stimulus displacements does not affect latency to a particular displacement. These results also suggest that previous estimates of saccade latency using single stimulus displacements were underestimates, because subjects were not trained to follow stimulus displacement in a disjunctive task. Care is required if saccade latencies are to be entirely attributed to control by stimulus factors."
