The approach is motivated by the fact that many important image structures are heterogeneous and therefore cannot be segmented by traditional region-based methods based on homogeneity or smoothness constraints. Both psychophysical and computational aspects of the problem are studied. \nPsychophysical evidence is presented which shows that properties of bounding contour such as closure act as binding features for the segmentation of 2-D shapes, whereas texture (a region property) does not. These psychological results motivate an investigation of local and global issues in the computation of bounding contours for the purpose of figure/ground segmentation. \nNovel techniques for the local analysis of contour are presented which allow edges to be reliably detected and localized over a broad range of blur scale and contrast in images with shallow depth-of-field and shadows. Local estimates of contour blur are shown to be useful for computing depth segmentation from focal blur in complex images where the continuity assumptions required by existing Fourier techniques do not apply. \nIt is hypothesized that in order to integrate contours fragmented by occlusion and insufficient contrast, the human visual system exploits a measure of geometric contour closure. The results of psychophysical experiments show that a measure for closure based on $L\\sb2$ norm of contour gaps in psychophysically consistent. The existence of this measure is evidence for the computation of geometric closure by the human visual system. \nThese psychophysical findings motivate an algorithm for computing closed bounding contours as cycles of curve tangents. Tangent cycles extracted from a variety of real images are shown to correspond to the bounding contours of 2-D image structures, many of which are heterogeneous over their interior. Thus closure computations are seen to complement region-grouping methods by extending the class of structures which may be segmented to include heterogeneous image structures."

In this paper, the conventional goals of visual reconstruction are generalized to include both visible and occluded forward facing surfaces. This larger fraction of the environment is termed the anterior surfaces. In this paper, we show that the boundaries of the anterior surfaces can be represented in viewer-centered coordinates as a labeled knot diagram. Where boundaries are not occluded and where surface reflectance is distinct from that of the background, boundaries will be marked by image contours. However, where boundaries are occluded, or where surface reflectance matches background reflectance, there will be no detectable luminance change in the image. Deducing the complete image trace of the boundaries of the anterior surfaces under these circumstances is termed the figural completion problem. The second half of this paper describes a computational theory of figural completion. A working model is demonstrated on a variety of illusory contour displays. The experimental system employs a two stage process of completion hypothesis and combinatorial optimization. The labeling scheme is enforced by integer linear inequalities so that the optimal feasible solution of an integer linear program defines a typologically valid surface organization.<<ETX>>"

The inference procedure is divided into two stages: a trace inference stage, which is the subject of the present work, and a curve synthesis stage. It is shown that recovery of the trace of a curve requires estimating local models for the curve at the same time, and that tangent and curvature information are sufficient. These make it possible to specify powerful constraints between estimated tangents to a curve, in terms of a neighborhood relationship called cocircularity, and between curvature estimates, in terms of a curvature consistency relation. Because all curve information is quantized, special care must be taken to obtain accurate estimates of trace points, tangents, and curvatures. This issue is addressed specifically to the introduction of a smoothness constraint and a maximum curvature constraint. The procedure is applied to two types of images: artificial images designed to evaluate curvature and noise sensitivity, and natural images. >"

These edges may determine the shapes of the objects and are invaluable in their identification. This thesis is about using such edge information for recognizing three-dimensional objects in images. In particular, we consider an approach that first identifies image features that are likely to come from a single object, and later uses these features to project similar model features into the image for verification. In light of this approach, we focus on two critical problems: identifying salient curves in images and the propagation of error from image features to projected model features. \nIn our study of saliency, we analyze one of the notable approaches to the problem, Shashua and Ullman's Saliency Network, and propose a new method based on shortest-paths algorithms. The new method is designed to overcome some of the most critical problems in the network. Using shortest-paths methods, we find the optimal curves in the image according to a measure that prefers contours that are long, smooth, and connected. \nFor the verification stage, we consider how to make the verification robust to locational errors in the image features. Error in the image features leads to uncertainty in the projected model features, which deters effective recognition. We show how error propagates when poses are based on three pairs of model and image points, for both Gaussian and bounded error in the detection of image points, and for both scaled-orthographic and perspective projection models. This result applies to objects that are fully three-dimensional, where past results considered only two-dimensional objects. In addition, we show how we can utilize linear programming to compute the propagated error region for any number of initial matches. Finally, we use these results to extend, from two-dimensional to three-dimensional objects, robust implementations of alignment, interpretation-tree search, and transformation clustering.

We explore a local, bottom-up approach to image analysis. We develop operators to identify and classify image junctions, which contain important visual cues for identifying occlusion, transparency, and surface bends. Like the human visual system, we begin with the application of linear filters which are oriented in all possible directions. We develop an efficient way to create an oriented filter of arbitrary orientation by describing it as a linear combination of basis filters. This approach to oriented filtering, which we call steerable filters, offers advantages for analysis as well as computation. We design a variety of steerable filters, including steerable quadrature pairs, which measure local energy. We show applications of these filters in orientation and texture analysis, and image representation and enhancement. We develop methods based on steerable filters to study structures such as contours and junctions. We describe how to post-filter the energy measures in order to more efficiently analyze structures with multiple orientations. We introduce a new detector for contours, based on energy local maxima. We analyze contour phases at energy local maxima, and compare the results with the prediction of a simple model. Using these tools, we analyze junctions. Based on local oriented filters, we develop simple mechanisms which respond selectively to T, L, and X junctions. The T and X junctions may indicate occlusion and transparency, respectively. These mechanism show that detectors for important, low-level visual cues can be built out of oriented filters and energy measures, which resemble responses found in the visual cortex. We present a second approach to junction detection based on salient contours."

This method for local scale control is applied to the problem of detecting and localizing edges in images with shallow depth of field and shadows. We show that edges spanning a broad range of blur scales and contrasts can be recovered accurately by a single system with no input parameters other than the second moment of the sensor noise. A natural dividend of this approach is a measure of the thickness of contours which can be used to estimate focal and penumbral blur. Local scale control is shown to be important for the estimation of blur in complex images, where the potential for interference between nearby edges of very different blur scale requires that estimates be made at the minimum reliable scale."

Classic applications are illustrated such as Shaw's picture description language (1969) applied to bubble chamber photographs, and Ledley's chromosome grammar ( 1965). The student with no particular interest in pattern recognition, who nevertheless desires to grasp a quick overview of what formal language theory is all about, could read this chapter. A minimum of preliminary definitions and notation must be waded through before learning about-types of grammars (regular, context-free, context-sensitive), equivalency of grammars, syntaxdirected translations, and deterministic, nondeterministic, and stochastic systems. Higher dimensional grammars are treated in Chapter Three, i.e., those allowing more complex primitive description and interconnection capabilities. Tree, web, plex, and shape grammars are each described with accompanying examples which make the material very easy to absorb. Chapter Four, on recognition and translation of syntactic structures, presents that integral part of formal language theory known as automata theory. The one-to-one correspondences between types of string grammars and automata are presented here, namely finite automation/regular grammar, push-down automaton/context-free grammar, linear-bounded automaton/ context-sensitive grammar, and Turing machine/unrestricted grammar. Quite properly, the authors restrict their attention to the finite and push-down automata used to accept or reject input strings and to automata for tree recognition, since these are the models thus far proved to be most useful for syntactic pattern recognition tasks. Chapter Five introduces stocastic grammars, languages, and recognizers. The material is well covered and brings the reader up to date (1978). As the authors mention, the impact of this theory on syntactic pattern processing has not been thoroughly realized, and references are cited for one interested in pursuing the topic further. The final chapter deals with grammatical inference and exemplifies the principalideas underlying the problem of obtaining a pattern grammar from a set of samples. Again, the material in this chapter is presented in a logical and easy to understand format. By this time the reader is beginning to understand the limitations of the linguistic aspect of syntactic pattern recognition (Reviewer's opinion), and will draw his or her attention to some of the material which came out of this work in the late sixties, which can be described as structural pattern recognition, and which is the topic of the book review which follows."

A series of search experiments tested detection of targets distinguished from the distractors by differences on a single dimension. Our aim was to use the pattern of search latencies to infer which features are coded automatically in early vision. For each of 12 different dimensions, one or more pairs of contrasting stimuli were tested. Each member of a pair played the role of target in one condition and the role of distractor in the other condition. Many pairs gave rise to a marked asymmetry in search latencies, such that one stimulus in the pair was detected either through parallel processing or with small increases in latency as display size increased, whereas the other gave search functions that increased much more steeply. Targets denned by larger values on the quantitative dimensions of length, number, and contrast, by line curvature, by misaligned orientation, and by values that deviated from a standard or prototypical color or shape were detected easily, whereas targets defined by smaller values on the quantitative dimensions, by straightness, by frame-aligned orientation, and by prototypical colors or shapes required slow and apparently serial search. These values appear to be coded by default, as the absence of the contrasting values. We found no feature of line arrangements that allowed automatic, preattentive detection; nor did connectedness or containment\u2014the two examples of topological features that we tested. We interpret the results as evidence that focused attention to single items or to groups is required to reduce background activity when the Weber fraction distinguishing the pooled feature activity with displays containing a target and with displays containing only distractors is too small to allow reliable discrimination."
