Using binary Bayesian classifiers, we attempt to capture high level concepts from low level image features under the constraint that the test image does belong to one of the classes of interest.

We demonstrate that a small codebook (the optimal size of codebook is selected using a modified MDL criterion) extracted from a vector quantizer can be used to estimate the class-conditional densities of the observed features needed for the Bayesian methodology. On a database of 6931 vacation photographs, our system achieved an accuracy of 90.5% for indoor vs. outdoor classification, 95.3% for city vs. landscape classification, 96.6% for sunset vs. forest and mountain classification, and 95.5% for forest vs. mountain classification.

Based on these groupings, effective indices can be built for an image database. In this paper, we cast the image classification problem in a Bayesian framework. Specifically, we consider city vs. landscape classification, and further, classification of landscape into sunset, forest, and mountain classes. We demonstrate how high-level concepts can be understood from specific low-level image features, under the constraint that the test images do belong to one of the delineated classes. We further demonstrate that a small codebook (the optimal size is selected using the MDL principle) extracted from a vector quantizer, can be used to estimate the class-conditional densities needed for the Bayesian methodology. Classification based on color histograms, color coherence vectors, edge direction histograms, and edge-direction coherence vectors as features shows promising results. On a database of 2,716 city and landscape images, our system achieved an accuracy of 95.3 percent for city vs. landscape classification. On a subset of 528 landscape images, our system achieves an accuracy of 94.9 percent for sunset vs. forest and mountain classification, and 93.6 percent for forest vs. mountain classification. Our final goal is to combine multiple 2- class classifiers into a single hierarchical classifier."

We systematically studied the features of: histograms in the Ohta color space; multiresolution, simultaneous autoregressive model parameters; and coefficients of a shift-invariant DCT. We demonstrate that performance is improved by computing features on subblocks, classifying these subblocks, and then combining these results in a way reminiscent of stacking. State of the art single-feature methods are shown to result in about 75-86% performance, while the new method results in 90.3% correct classification, when evaluated on a diverse database of over 1300 consumer images provided by Kodak."

We propose an approach that lies between uniformly tesselating the images with rectangular regions and relying on fully segmented images. For each image we define 5 partially overlapping, fuzzy regions. From each region in the image we extract the first three moments of the color distribution and store them in the index. The feature vectors in the index are relatively insensitive to small translations and small rotations of an image because they are extracted from fuzzy regions. To retrieve images we define a function which measures the similarity of two color feature vectors. Invariance of retrieval results with respect to the typical image rotations of 90 degrees around the center of the image is guaranteed because our feature similarity function exploits the spatial arrangement of the 5 image regions. We present experimental results using an image database which contains more than 11,000 color images. Our experiments demonstrate clearly that our weak encoding of spatial information significantly increases the discrimination power of the index compared to plain color indexing techniques."

Many visual feature representations have been explored and many systems built. While these research efforts establish the basis of CBIR, the usefulness of the proposed approaches is limited. Specifically, these efforts have relatively ignored two distinct characteristics of CBIR systems: (1) the gap between high-level concepts and low-level features, and (2) the subjectivity of human perception of visual content. This paper proposes a relevance feedback based interactive retrieval approach, which effectively takes into account the above two characteristics in CBIR. During the retrieval process, the user's high-level query and perception subjectivity are captured by dynamically updated weights based on the user's feedback. The experimental results over more than 70000 images show that the proposed approach greatly reduces the user's effort of composing a query, and captures the user's information need more precisely."

We present here an implementation of NeTra, a prototype image retrieval system that uses color, texture, shape and spatial location information in segmented image regions to search and retrieve similar regions from the database. A distinguishing aspect of this system is its incorporation of a robust automated image segmentation algorithm that allows object- or region-based search. Image segmentation significantly improves the quality of image retrieval when images contain multiple complex objects. Images are segmented into homogeneous regions at the time of ingest into the database, and image attributes that represent each of these regions are computed. In addition to image segmentation, other important components of the system include an efficient color representation, and indexing of color, texture, and shape features for fast search and retrieval. This representation allows the user to compose interesting queries such as \u201cretrieve all images that contain regions that have the color of object A, texture of object B, shape of object C, and lie in the upper of the image\u201d, where the individual objects could be regions belonging to different images. A Java-based web implementation of NeTra is available at http://vivaldi.ece.ucsb.edu/Netra."

Examples of the content we use include color, texture, and shape of image objects and regions. Potential applications include medical (\\Give me other images that contain a tumor with a texture like this one\"), photo-journalism (\\Give me images that have blue at the top and red at the bottom\"), and many others in art, fashion, cataloging, retailing, and industry. We describe a set of novel features and similarity measures allowing query by color, texture, and shape of image object. We demonstrate the e ectiveness of the QBIC system with normalized precision and recall experiments on test databases containing over 1000 images and 1000 objects populated from commercially available photo clip art images, and of images of airplane silhouettes. We also consider the e cient indexing of these features, speci cally addressing two problems: (a) for our feature vectors, the desired distance function is not Euclidean, and/or (b) the vectors have high dimensionality. We propose novel, general solutions to both problems by allowing some \\false alarms\" (\\false hits\", or \\false positives\") but no false dismissals. For the rst problem, we introduce a new theorem that makes indexing possible by bounding the non-Euclidean, full cross-term quadratic distance expression with a simple Euclidean distance. For the second, we illustrate how orthogonal transforms, such as the Karhunen Loeve transform, can help reduce the dimensionality, without introducing false dismissals. The resulting QBIC system o ers high quality of output, and signi cant speedup over straightforward indexing alternatives. The system is implemented in X/Motif and C running on an RS/6000.

However, color histograms lack spatial information, so images with very different appearances can have similar histograms. For example, a picture of fall foliage might contain a large number of scattered red pixels; this could have a similar color histogram to a picture with a single large red object. We describe a histogram-based method for comparing images that incorporates spatial information. We classify each pixel in a given color bucket as either coherent or incoherent, based on whether or not it is part of a large similarly-colored region. A color coherence vector (CCV) stores the number of coherent versus incoherent pixels with each color. By separating coherent pixels from incoherent pixels, CCV\u2019s provide finer distinctions than color histograms. CCV\u2019s can be computed at over 5 images per second on a standard workstation. A database with 15,000 images can be queried for the images with the most similar CCV\u2019s in under 2 seconds. We show that CCV\u2019s can give superior results to color his\u2217To whom correspondence should be addressed tograms for image retrieval."

Recent works in video parsing provide a foundation for building interactive and content based video browsing systems. In this paper, a generalized top-down hierarchial clustering process, which adopts partition clustering recursively at each level of the hierarchy, is studied and used to build hierarchical views of video shots. With the clustering processes, when a list of video programs or clips is provided, a browsing system can use either key-frame and/or shot features to cluster shots into classes, each of which consists of shots of similar content. After such clustering, each class of shots can be represented by an icon, which can then be displayed at the high levels of a hierarchical browser. As a result, users can know roughly the content of video shots even without moving down to a lower level of the hierarchy."

approach for utilizing many data dependent user dependent and task dependent features in a semi automated tool Instead of requiring universal similarity measures or manual selection of relevant features the approach provides a learning algorithm for selecting and combining groupings of the data where groupings can be induced by highly spe cialized and context dependent features The se lection process is guided by a rich example based interaction with the user The inherent com binatorics of using multiple features is reduced by a multistage grouping generation weighting and collection process The stages closest to the user are trained fastest and slowly propagate their adaptations back to earlier stages The weighting stage adapts the collection stage s search space across uses so that in later interactions good groupings are found given few examples from the user Described is an interactive time imple mentation of this architecture for semi automatic within image segmentation and across image la beling driven by concurrently active color mod els texture models or manually provided group ings Issues for digital libraries Digital libraries of images video and sound are a rich area for pattern recognition research They also introduce a host of new problems and requirements since the range of possible queries is immense and requires the utilization of many spe cialized features Also systems for retrieval browsing and annotation i e classifying regions often must perform with only a small number of examples from a user i e an insuf cient amount of training data by traditional requirements Thus the area is doubly exciting since it presents the eld of pattern recognition with new challenges while beckoning in new applications One important issue for digital libraries is nding good models and similarity measures for comparing database en tries A part of this di culty is that feature extraction and comparison methods are highly data dependent see Figure This work was supported in part by BT PLC Hewlett Packard Labs and NEC for an example with texture Similarity measures are also user and task dependent as demonstrated by Figure Un fortunately these dependencies are not at this point under stood well enough especially by the typical digital library user to permit careful selection of the optimal measure be forehand Note that the multi resolution simultaneous auto regressive MRSAR model of which fares poorly com pared to the shift invariant eigenvector EV model in the above two examples scores clearly above the EV model on the standard Brodatz database On the same test data but for a perceptually motivated similarity criteria based on periodicity directionality and randomness both the EV and MRSAR models are beat by a new Wold based model Attempts to use intuitive texture features like coarseness contrast and directionality are appropri ate in some cases but do not fully determine all the qualities people might use in judging similarity Thus an a priori opti mal context dependent selection among similarity measures either by human or computer seems unlikely Next the scope of queries that databases need to address is immense Current computational solutions attempt to of fer location of perceptual content nd round red objects and objective content nd pictures of people in Boston Desirable queries also extend to subjective content give me a scene of a romantic forest task speci c content I need something with open space to place text collaborative con tent show me pictures children like and more An swering such queries requires a variety of features or meta data to be attached to the data in a digital library some of which may not be computable directly from the data The implication for algorithms is that they cannot rely on one model or one small set of carefully picked features but will have to drink from a veritable feature hydrant from which only a few drops may be relevant for the query Finally there is a signi cant need for semi automated ver sus fully automated tools Human computer synergy can make ill de ned tasks manageable and has the power to over come many of the problems of current pattern recognition tools An important application of semi automated tools is to assist the population of a database viz the creation of metadata A crucial technical issue for such tools is the selec tion and combination of existing features which features are most useful for a given query or annotation how should they be combined and which combinations are useful for the sys tem to remember so that it gets smarter with increased use This last point is important since not only are the queries immensely variable but the amount of training data i e ex amples provided by a user of what they do and don t want available at any instant is usually limited Hence a tool should strive to improve its generalization ability"

Among the various frameworks in which pattern recognition has been traditionally formulated, the statistical approach has been most intensively studied and used in practice. More recently, neural network techniques and methods imported from statistical learning theory have been receiving increasing attention. The design of a recognition system requires careful attention to the following issues: definition of pattern classes, sensing environment, pattern representation, feature extraction and selection, cluster analysis, classifier design and learning, selection of training and test samples, and performance evaluation. In spite of almost 50 years of research and development in this field, the general problem of recognizing complex patterns with arbitrary orientation, location, and scale remains unsolved. New and emerging applications, such as data mining, web searching, retrieval of multimedia data, face recognition, and cursive handwriting recognition, require robust and efficient pattern recognition techniques. The objective of this review paper is to summarize and compare some of the well-known methods used in various stages of a pattern recognition system and identify research topics and applications which are at the forefront of this exciting and challenging field."

Experiment 1 studies the importance of using (a) semantic information, (2) memory of earlier input and (3) relative, rather than absolute, judgements of image similarity. The target testing paradigm is used in which a user must search for an image identical to a target. We find that the best performance comes from a version of PicHunter that uses only semantic cues, with memory and relative similarity judgements. Second best is use of both pictorial and semantic cues, with memory and relative similarity judgements. Most reports of CBIR systems provide only qualitative measures of performance based on how similar retrieved images are to a target. Experiment 2 puts PicHunter into this context with a more rigorous test. We first establish a baseline for our database by measuring the time required to find an image that is similar to a target when the images are presented in random order. Although PicHunter's performance is measurably better than this, the test is weak because even random presentation of images yields reasonably short search times. This casts doubt on the strength of results given in other reports where no baseline is established."

These tools differ from those used in standard image databases in that they make direct use of the image content rather than relying on annotations. Direct search on image content is made possible by use of semantics-preserving image compression, which reduces images to a small set of perceptually significant coefficients. We describe three Photobook tools in particular: one that allows search based on gray-level appearance, one that uses 2-D shape, and a third that allows search based on textural properties."

Among such requirements is the ability of the representation used for coding to support higher-level tasks such as content-based retrieval. We explore the relationships between probabilistic modeling and data compression to introduce a representation-library-based coding-which, by enabling retrieval in the compressed domain, satisfies this requirement. Because it contains an embedded probabilistic description of the source, this new representation allows the construction of good inference models without compromise of compression efficiency, leads to very efficient procedures for query and retrieval, and provides a framework for higher level tasks such as the analysis and classification of video shots."

This paper describes an approach for integrating a large number of context-dependent features into a semi-automated tool. Instead of requiring universal similarity measures or manual selection of relevant features, the approach provides a learning algorithm for selecting and combining groupings of the data, where groupings can be induced by highly specialized features. The selection process is guided by positive and negative examples from the user. The inherent combinatorics of using multiple features is reduced by a multistage grouping generation, weighting, and collection process. The stages closest to the user are trained fastest and slowly propagate their adaptations back to earlier stages. The weighting stage adapts the collection stage's search space across uses, so that, in later interactions, good groupings are found given few examples from the user."

The uniqueness and effectiveness of this solution lies in its use of video content information provided by a parsing process driven by visual feature analysis. More specifically, parsing will temporally segment and abstract a video source, based on low-level image analyses; then retrieval and browsing of video will be based on key-frames selected during abstraction and spatial-temporal variations of visual features, as well as some shot-level semantics derived from camera operation and motion analysis. These processes, as well as video retrieval and browsing tools, are presented in detail as functions of an integrated system. Also, experimental results on automatic key-frame detection are given."

A universal lossless code which does a good job of compressing must implicitly also do a good job of modeling. In particular, with a collection of codebooks, one for each possible class or model, if codewords are chosen from among the ensemble of codebooks so as to minimize bit rate, then the codebook selected provides an implicit estimate of the underlying class. Less is known about the corresponding connections between lossy compression and continuous sources. We consider aspects of estimating conditional and unconditional densities in conjunction with Bayes-risk weighted vector quantization for joint compression and classification."

To do so, we have conducted two psychophysical scaling experiments and have compared the results to two algorithmic image similarity metrics. For these experiments, we selected a set of 97 digitized photographic images which represent a range of semantic categories, viewing distances, and colors. We then used the two perceptual and the two algorithmic methods to measure the similarity of each image to every other image in the data set, producing four similarity matrices. These matrices were analyzed using multidimensional scaling techniques to gain insight into the dimensions human observers use for judging image similarity, and how these dimensions differ from the results of algorithmic methods. This paper also describes and validates a new technique for collecting similarity judgments which can provide meaningful results with a factor of four fewer judgments, as compared with the paired comparisons method."

The indexing of the latest release will always be of the form \"lvq pak-X.Y\". The instructions below are indexed as in the version lvq pak-1.1, which was released on December 31, 1991. The programs are available in two archive formats, one for the UNIX-environment, the other for MS-DOS, respectively. Both archives contain exactly the same les. These les can be accessed via FTP as follows: 1. Create an FTP connection from wherever you are to machine \"cochlea.hut..\". The Internet address of this machine is 130.233.168.48, for those who need it. 2. Log in as user \"anonymous\" with your own e-mail address as password. 3. Change the remote directory to \"/pub/lvq pak\". 4. At this point the FTP should be able to get a listing of les in this directory with DIR and fetch the ones you want with GET. (The exact FTP commands depend on your local FTP program.) Remember to use the binary transfer mode for compressed les. The LVQ PAK program package includes the following les:-Documentation: README short description of the package and installation instructions document.ps documentation in (c) Postcript format document.ps.Z same as above but compressed document.txt documentation in ASCII format-Source le archives (which contain the documentation, too): lvq p1r1.exe self-extracting MS-DOS archive le lvq pak-1.1.tar UNIX tape archive le lvq pak-1.1.tar.Z same as above but compressed An example of FTP access is given below: unix> ftp cochlea.hut..

An exemplary procedure is given in the documentation of the package. All data les (input vectors and codebooks) are stored in ASCII format for their easy editing and checking. 3.4 Diagnostics With all the programs, it is possible to set the verbose parameter (-v n), where the value of n determines the amount of diagnostic output the program generates. For the visualization of topological relationships of data and codebook vectors, the monitoring program sammon generates a list of coordinates of points that can be displayed two-dimensionally by any standard graphics program.

The video engine is a flexible platform independent architecture which provides support for processing multiple synchronized data streams like image sequences, audio and closed captions. The architecture allows for multi-modal indexing and retrieval of video through the use of media specific primitives.

This paper proposes a new minimum description length (MDL) type criterion, termed MMDL(f or mixture MDL), to select the number of components of the model. MMDLis based on the identification of an \"equivalent sample size\", for each component, which does not coincide with the full sample size. We also introduce an algorithm based on the standard expectation-maximization (EM) approach together with a new agglomerative step, called agglomerative EM (AEM). The experiments here reported have shown that MMDLo utperforms existing criteria of comparable computational cost. The good behavior of AEM, namely its good robustness with respect to initialization, is also illustrated experimentally."

A retinally connected neural network examines small windows of an image and decides whether each window contains a face. The system arbitrates between multiple networks to improve performance over a single network. We use a bootstrap algorithm for training the networks, which adds false detections into the training set as training progresses. This eliminates the difficult task of manually selecting non-face training examples, which must be chosen to span the entire space of non-face images. Comparisons with other state-of-the-art face detection systems are presented; our system has better performance in terms of detection and false-positive rates."

Existing procedures for feature subset selection, such as sequential selection and dynamic programming, do not guarantee optimality of the selected feature subset. Exhaustive search, on the other hand, is generally computationally unfeasible. The present algorithm is very efficient and it selects the best subset without exhaustive search. Computational aspects of the algorithm are discussed. Results of several experiments demonstrate the very substantial computational savings realized. For example, the best 12-feature set from a 24-feature set was selected with the computational effort of evaluating only 6000 subsets. Exhaustive search would require the evaluation of 2 704 156 subsets."

The goal of such a system is data compression: to reduce the bit rate so as to minimize communication channel capacity or digital storage memory requirements while maintaining the necessary fidelity of the data. The mapping for each vector may or may not have memory in the sense of depending on past actions of the coder, just as in well established scalar techniques such as PCM, which has no memory, and predictive quantization, which does. Even though information theory implies that one can always obtain better performance by coding vectors instead of scalars, scalar quantizers have remained by far the most common data compression system because of their simplicity and good performance when the communication rate is sufficiently large. In addition, relatively few design techniques have existed for vector quantizers. During the past few years several design algorithms have been developed for a variety of vector quantizers and the performance of these codes has been studied for speech waveforms, speech linear predictive parameter vectors, images, and several simulated random processes. It is the purpose of this article to survey some of these design techniques and their applications."

Furthermore, the new parameter estimation procedure can be applied in both on-line and batch settings. We show experimentally that it is typically faster than EM, and usually requires about half as many iterations as EM.

The algorithm and its extensions are now standard tools applied to incomplete data problems in virtually every field in which statistical methods are used. Until now, however, no single source offered a complete and unified treatment of the subject.The EM Algorithm and Extensions describes the formulation of the EM algorithm, details its methodology, discusses its implementation, and illustrates applications in many statistical contexts. Employing numerous examples, Geoffrey McLachlan and Thriyambakam Krishnan examine applications both in evidently incomplete data situations-where data are missing, distributions are truncated, or observations are censored or grouped-and in a broad variety of situations in which incompleteness is neither natural nor evident. They point out the algorithm's shortcomings and explain how these are addressed in the various extensions.Areas of application discussed include: Regression Medical imaging Categorical data analysis Finite mixture analysis Factor analysis Robust statistical modeling Variance-components estimation Survival analysis Repeated-measures designs For theoreticians, practitioners, and graduate students in statistics as well as researchers in the social and physical sciences, The EM Algorithm and Extensions opens the door to the tremendous potential of this remarkably versatile statistical tool."

The chapters are original essays and research reports that span a wide range of disciplinary approaches - from experimental psychophysics and psychobiology to mathematical analysis, to a spectrum of problems in visual processing. Further subjects covered include how the earliest stages of processing visual signals takes place, what the role of visual attention focusing is, and the high level problem of how we recognize familiar objects. Theoretical and empirical explorations of such general issues as the complexity of visual processing and the representation of visual knowledge are undertaken."
