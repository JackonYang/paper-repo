The posterior probability is usually derived from a prior model and a likelihood model. The latter relates to how data is observed and is problem domain dependent. The former depends on how various prior constraints are expressed. Markov Random Field Models (MRF) theory is a tool to encode contextual constraints into the prior probability. This paper presents a unified approach for MRF modeling in low and high level computer vision. The unification is made possible due to a recent advance in MRF modeling for high level object recognition. Such unification provides a systematic approach for vision modeling based on sound mathematical principles."

In this approach, an image is first segmented into a collection of disjoint regions which form the nodes of an adjacency graph. Image interpretation is then achieved through assigning object labels, or interpretations, to the segmented regions, or nodes, using domain knowledge, extracted feature measurements, and spatial relationships between the various regions. The interpretation labels are modeled as a MRF on the corresponding adjacency graph, and the image interpretation problem are formulated as a maximum a posteriori estimation rule. Simulated annealing is used to find the best realization, or optimal interpretation. Through the MRF model, this approach also provides a systematic method for organizing and representing domain knowledge through the clique functions of the probability density function underlying MRF.

It is rendered especially difficult by the presence of motion boundaries and occlusion regions which are not taken into account by standard regularization approaches. In this paper, the authors present a multimodal approach to the problem of motion estimation in which the computation of visual motion is based on several complementary constraints. It is shown that multiple constraints can provide more accurate flow estimation in a wide range of circumstances. The theoretical framework relies on Bayesian estimation associated with global statistical models, namely, Markov random fields. The constraints introduced here aim to address the following issues: optical flow estimation while preserving motion boundaries, processing of occlusion regions, fusion between gradient and feature-based motion constraint equations. Deterministic relaxation algorithms are used to merge information and to provide a solution to the maximum a posteriori estimation of the unknown dense motion field. The algorithm is well suited to a multiresolution implementation which brings an appreciable speed-up as well as a significant improvement of estimation when large displacements are present in the scene. Experiments on synthetic and real world image sequences are reported. >"

All use Markov random field (MRF) models to include prior contextual information. The comparison is based on artificial binary images which are degraded by Gaussian noise. Robustness is tested with correlated noise and with object and background textured. The ICM algorithm is evaluated when the degradation and model parameters must be estimated, in both supervised and unsupervised modes and on two real images. The results are assessed by visual inspection and through a numerical criterion. It is concluded that contextual information from MRF models improves segmentation when the number of categories and the degradation model are known and that parameters can be effectively estimated. None of the three algorithms is consistently best, but the ICM algorithm is the most robust. The energy of the a posteriori distribution is not always minimized at the best segmentation.<<ETX>>"

The maximum a posteriori (MAP) criterion is used to formulate what the best segmentation or interpretation of the scene should be, where the scene is assumed to be made up of some fixed number of moving planar surface patches. The Bayesian approach requires, first, specification of prior expectations for the optic flow field, which here is modeled as spatial and temporal Markov random fields; and, secondly, a way of measuring how well the segmentation predicts the measured flow field. The Markov random fields incorporate the physical constraints that objects and their images are probably spatially continuous, and that their images are likely to move quite smoothly across the image plane. To compute the flow predicted by the segmentation, a recent method for reconstructing the motion and orientation of planar surface facets is used. The search for the globally optimal segmentation is performed using simulated annealing."

Two conceptually new algorithms are presented for segmenting textured images into regions in each of which the data are modeled as one of C MRF's. The algorithms are designed to operate in real time when implemented on new parallel computer architectures that can be built with present technology. A doubly stochastic representation is used in image modeling. Here, a Gaussian MRF is used to model textures in visible light and infrared images, and an autobinary (or autoternary, etc.) MRF to model a priori information about the local geometry of textured image regions. For image segmentation, the true texture class regions are treated either as a priori completely unknown or as a realization of a binary (or ternary, etc.) MRF. In the former case, image segmentation is realized as true maximum likelihood estimation. In the latter case, it is realized as true maximum a posteriori likelihood segmentation. In addition to providing a mathematically correct means for introducing geometric structure, the autobinary (or ternary, etc.) MRF can be used in a generative mode to generate image geometries and artificial images, and such simulations constitute a very powerful tool for studying the effects of these models and the appropriate choice of model parameters. The first segmentation algorithm is hierarchical and uses a pyramid-like structure in new ways that exploit the mutual dependencies among disjoint pieces of a textured region."

A spatiotemporal edge in an image sequence is modeled as a surface patch in a 3-D spatiotemporal space. A likelihood ratio test enables its detection as well as simultaneous estimation of its related attributes. It is shown that the computation of this test leads to convolving the image sequence with a set of predetermined masks. The emphasis is on a restricted but widely relevant and useful case of surface patch, namely the planar one. In addition, an implementation of the procedure whose computation cost is merely equivalent to a spatial gradient operator is presented. This method can be of interest for motion-analysis schemes, not only for supplying spatiotemporal segmentation, but also for extracting local motion information. Moreover, it can cope with occlusion contours and important displacement magnitude. Experiments have been carried out with both synthetic and real images. >"

This paper presents a systematic study of these models and defines a general discontinuity adaptive (DA) MRF model. By analyzing the Euler equation associated with the energy minimization, it shows that the fundamental difference between different models lies in the behavior of interaction between neighboring points, which is determined by the a priori smoothness constraint encoded into the energy function. An important necessary condition is derived for the interaction to be adaptive to discontinuities to avoid oversmoothing. This forms the basis on which a class of adaptive interaction functions (AIFs) is defined. The DA model is defined in terms of the Euler equation constrained by this class of AIFs. Its solution is C/sup 1/ continuous and allows arbitrarily large but bounded slopes in dealing with discontinuities. Because of the continuous nature, it is stable to changes in parameters and data, a good property for regularizing ill-posed problems. Experimental results are shown. >"

In this note, we investigate a new comprehensive approach to minimize global energy functions using a multiscale relaxation algorithm. The energy function is minimized over nested subspaces of the original space of possible solutions. These subspaces consist of solutions which are constrained at different scales. The constrained relaxation is implemented via a coarse-to-fine multiresolution algorithm that yields fast convergence towards high quality estimates when compared to standard monoresolution or multigrid relaxation schemes. It also appears to be far less sensitive to local minima than standard relaxation algorithms. The efficiency of the approach is demonstrated on a highly nonlinear combinatorial problem which consists of estimating long-range motion in an image sequence on a discrete label space. The method is compared to standard relaxation algorithms on real world and synthetic image sequences."

The MRF is a coupled one which provides continuity (inside regions of smooth gray tones) and discontinuity (at region boundaries) constraints for the restoration problem which is, in general, ill posed. The computational difficulty associated with the EM procedure for MRFs is resolved by using the mean field theory from statistical mechanics. An orthonormal blur decomposition is used to reduce the chances of undesirable locally optimal estimates. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world images show that this approach provides good blur estimates and restored images. The restored images are comparable to those obtained by a Wiener filter in mean-square error, but are most visually pleasing."

The efficacy of the mean field theory approach is demonstrated on parameter estimation for one-dimensional mixture data and two-dimensional unsupervised stochastic model-based image segmentation.

FRAME combines attractive aspects of two important themes in texture modeling: multi-channel filtering and Markov random field (MRF) modeling. It incorporates the responses of a set of well selected filters into the distribution over a random field and hence has a much stronger descriptive ability than the traditional MRF models. Furthermore, it interprets and clarifies many previous concepts and methods for texture analysis and synthesis from a unified point of view. Algorithms are proposed for probability inference, stochastic simulation and filter selection. Experiments on a variety of textures are described to illustrate our theory and to show the performance of our algorithms. These experiments demonstrate that many textures previously considered as different categories can be modeled and synthesized in a common framework."

An automatic segmentation and description system is used to produce the image representations so that the matching procedures must cope with variations in feature values, missing objects, and possible multiple matches. This environment is used to test different relaxation matching schemes under a variety of conditions. The best performance (of those we compared), in terms of the number of iterations and the number of errors, is for the gradient-based optimization approach of Faugeras and Price. The related optimization approach of Hummel and Zucker performed almost as well, with differences primarily in difficult matches (i.e., where much of the evidence is against the match, for instance, poor segmentations). The product combination rule proposed by Peleg was extremely fast, indeed, too fast to work when global context is needed. The classical Rosenfeld, Hummel, and Zucker method is included for historical comparisons and performed only adequately, producing fewer correct matches and taking more iterations."

Uncertainty in the positions of visually sensed features and ambiguity of feature correspondence call for a probabilistic treatment, capable of maintaining not simply a single estimate of position and shape but an entire distribution. Exact representation of the evolving distribution is possible when the distributions are Gaussian and this yields some powerful approaches. However, normal distributions are limited when clutter is present: because of their unimodality, they cannot be used to represent simultaneous alternative hypotheses. One powerful methodology for maintaining non\u2013Gaussian distributions is based on random sampling techniques. The effectiveness of \u2018factored sampling\u2019 and \u2018Markov chain Monte Carlo\u2019 for interpretation of static images is widely accepted. More recently, factored sampling has been combined with learned dynamical models to propagate probability distributions for object position and shape. Progress in several areas is reported here. First a new observational model is described that takes object opacity into account. Secondly, complex shape models to represent combined rigid and non\u2013rigid motion have been developed, together with a new algorithm to decompose rigid from non\u2013rigid. Lastly, more powerful dynamical prior models have been constructed by appending suitable discrete labels to a continuous system state; this may also have applications to gesture recognition."

The authors consider both the maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) estimate and the minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) estimate for image estimation and image restoration. Compound image models consist of several submodels having different characteristics along with an underlying structure model which govern transitions between these image submodels. Two different compound random field models are employed, the doubly stochastic Gaussian (DSG) random field and a compound Gauss-Markov (CGM) random field. The authors present MAP estimators for DSG and CGM random fields using simulated annealing. A fast-converging algorithm called deterministic relaxation, which, however, converges to only a locally optimal MAP estimate, is also presented as an alternative for reducing computational loading on sequential machines. For comparison purposes, the authors include results on the fixed-lag smoothing MMSE estimator for the DSG field and its suboptimal M-algorithm approximation. >"

A Gauss-Markov random field (GMRF) is used for the conditional density of the intensity array, given the unobserved texture class and a second-order Ising distribution for the prior distribution over the texture classes. The GMRF model for the conditional density allows a closed-form expression for the density to be written, so that the dependence of the density on the label parameters can be expressed. This expression is used here to derive the joint distribution of intensity and label arrays. The joint distribution is maximized using the stochastic relaxation method and the deterministic iterated conditional mode (ICM) technique. The ICM algorithm can be implemented efficiently on a neural net with local connectivity and regular structure. Comparisons of these two methods are given using real textured images.<<ETX>>"

It is well known that multigrid methods can improve significantly the convergence rate and the quality of the final results of iterative relaxation techniques. A hierarchical model is proposed, which consists of a label pyramid and a whole observation field. The parameters of the coarse grid can be derived by simple computation from the finest grid. In the label pyramid, a new local interaction is introduced between two neighbor grids. This model gives a relaxation algorithm which can be run in parallel on the entire pyramid. The model allows propagation of local interactions more efficiently, giving estimates closer to the global optimum for deterministic as well as for stochastic relaxation schemes. It can also be seen as a way to incorporate cliques with far apart sites for a reasonable price.<<ETX>>"

In accordance with the physical phenomena that cause speckle, the speckle processes are modeled as circularly symmetric complex Gaussian random fields. As with real Gaussian fields, certain forms of autocovariance of complex Gaussian field lead to Markovianity properties. With the assumption of a separable autocovariance for the complex Gaussian random fields, local joint statistics of the resulting speckle-intensity fields (magnitude-squared of the complex field) are determined. The speckle model concurs with the known marginal statistics and also accounts for the autocorrelation observed in actual speckled images.

The algorithm we present is a generalization of the ,K-means clustering algorithm to include spatial constraints and to account for local intensity variations in the image. Spatial constraints are included by the use of a Gibbs random field model. Local intensity variations are accounted for in a n iterative procedure involving averaging over a sliding window whose size decreases as the algorithm progresses. Results with an eight-neighbor Gibbs random field model applied to pictures of industrial objects, buildings, aerial photographs, optical characters, and faces, show that the algorithm performs better than the K-means algorithm and its nonadaptive extensions that incorporate spatial constraints by the use of Gibbs random fields. A hierarchical implementation is also presented and results in better performance and faster speed of execution. The segmented images are caricatures of the originals which preserve the most significant features, while removing unimportant details. They can be used in image recognition and as crude representations of the image. The caricatures are easy to display or print using a few grey levels and can be coded very efficiently. In particular, segmentation of faces results in binary sketches which preserve the main characteristics of the face, so that it is easily recognizable. I. INTRODUCTION E present a technique for segmenting a grey-scale image (typically 2.56 levels) into regions of uniform or slowly varying intensity. The segmented image consists of very few levels (typically 2-4). each denoting a different region, as shown in Fig. 1. It is a sketch, or caricature, of the original image which preserves its most significant features, while removing unimportant details. It can thus be the first stage of an image recognition system. However, assuming that the segmented image retains the intelligibility of the original, it can also be used as a crude representation of the image. The caricature has the advantage that it is easy to display or print with very few grey levels. The number of levels is crucial for special display media like paper, cloth, and binary computer screens. Also, the caricature can be coded very efficiently , since we only have to code the transitions between a few grey levels. We develop an algorithm that separates the pixels in the image into clusters based on both their intensity and their"

The Bayes smoothing algorithm yields the a posteriori distribution of the scene value at each pixel, given the total noisy image, in a recursive way. The a posteriori distribution together with a criterion of optimality then determine a Bayes estimate of the scene. The algorithm presented is an extension of a 1-D Bayes smoothing algorithm to 2-D and it gives the optimum Bayes estimate for the scene value at each pixel. Computational concerns in 2-D, however, necessitate certain simplifying assumptions on the model and approximations on the implementation of the algorithm. In particular, the scene (noiseless image) is modeled as a Markov mesh random field, a special class of Markov random fields, and the Bayes smoothing algorithm is applied on overlapping strips (horizontal/vertical) of the image consisting of several rows (columns). It is assumed that the signal (scene values) vector sequence along the strip is a vector Markov chain. Since signal correlation in one of the dimensions is not fully used along the edges of the strip, estimates are generated only along the middle sections of the strips. The overlapping strips are chosen such that the union of the middle sections of the strips gives the whole image. The Bayes smoothing algorithm presented here is valid for scene random fields consisting of multilevel (discrete) or continuous random variables."

                "text": "!, Model-based vision is firmly established as a robust approach to recognizing and locating known rigid objects in the presence of noise, clutter, and occlusion. It is more problematic to apply modelbased methods to images of objects whose appearance can vary, though a number of approaches based on the use of flexible templates have been proposed. The problem with existing methods is that they sacrifice model specificity in order to accommodate variability, thereby compromising robustness during image interpretation. We argue that a model should only be able to deform in ways characteristic of the class of objects it represents. We describe a method for building models by learning patterns of variability from a training set of correctly annotated images. These models can be used for image search in an iterative refinement algorithm analogous to that employed by Active Contour Models (Snakes). The key difference is that our Active Shape Models can only deform to fit the data in ways consistent with the training set. We show several practical examples where we have built such models and used them to locate partially occluded objects in noisy, cluttered images. Q 199s A&& prrss, IN."

                "text": "This thesis investigates approaches to object recognition in computer vision. The starting point of the investigation is depth, or range, images of visible object surfaces. At the representation level, we use attributed relational graphs (ARGs), for object-centered descriptions of surfaces in images as well as models. An ARG encodes invariant properties such as curvature of surfaces, and relations such as distances and normal angles between them. At the computational level, the main problems studied concern firstly the extraction of ARG representation from range images, which involves the issues of continuity-controlled smoothing and reliable computation of surface curvature, and secondly inexact matching between the image ARG and object model ARGs. First we propose a unified computational framework for solving low, intermediate and high level computer vision problems in 3D object recognition from range images. All three levels of computation are cast in an optimisation framework and are suited for implementation on parallel distributed, or neuron-like, architectures. In the low level computation, the tasks are to estimate the curvature images from the input range data, in which depth discontinuities are taken into account to avoid oversmoothing. Subsequent processing at the intermediate level is concerned with segmenting these curvature images into coherent curvature sign maps. At the high level, image features are matched against model features based on the object-centered ARG representation. It is shown that the above computational tasks at each of the three different levels can all be formulated as optimising an energy function. The optimisation is performed using parallel and distributed relaxation-based algorithms which are well suited for neural network implementation. We then further develop the low level work by proposing a class of adaptive regularizer (AR) for continuity-controlled smoothing. We analyze mechanisms by which the AR works. The analysis shows that the fundamental difference between different regularizes lies in properties of interaction between neighboring points, which relates to the smoothing strength, determined by these regularizes. Based on this, we derive conditions under which regularizes are adaptive to discontinuities to avoid oversmoothing. The analysis also shows that adaptive regularization solutions have a closer affinity to solving Euler equations than to minimising some close-formed energy functionals. We further develop the high level work by proposing a parallel distributed approach for matching and recognizing overlapping partially occluded objects. Simultaneous separation and inexact matching of superimposed sub-ARGs is performed by optimising a global gain functional using relaxation labelling methods. We suggest that the approach could potentially perform simultaneous recognition of overlapping free-formed 3D objects directly from range data without segmentation: Segmentation, matching and recognition are all done once the direct mapping from pixels to models is found. The algorithm is inherently parallel and distributive and could be efficiently implemented on commercially available SIMD architectures such as the Connectionist Machine."

A texture model is a mathematical procedure capable of producing and describing a textured image. We explore the use of Markov random fields as texture models. The binomial model, where each point in the texture has a binomial distribution with parameter controlled by its neighbors and ``number of tries'' equal to the number of gray levels, was taken to be the basic model for the analysis. A method of generating samples from the binomial model is given, followed by a theoretical and practical analysis of the method's convergence. Examples show how the parameters of the Markov random field control the strength and direction of the clustering in the image. The power of the binomial model to produce blurry, sharp, line-like, and blob-like textures is demonstrated. Natural texture samples were digitized and their parameters were estimated under the Markov random field model. A hypothesis test was used for an objective assessment of goodness-of-fit under the Markov random field model. Overall, microtextures fit the model well. The estimated parameters of the natural textures were used as input to the generation procedure. The synthetic microtextures closely resembled their real counterparts, while the regular and inhomogeneous textures did not."

The only explicit assumption made is that the intensity data can be modeled by a Gauss Markov random field (GMRF). The image is divided into a number of nonoverlapping regions and the GMRF parameters are computed from each of these regions. A simple clustering method is used to merge these regions. The parameters of the model estimated from the clustered segments are then used in two different schemes, one being all approximation to the maximum a posterior estimate of the labels and the other minimizing the percentage misclassification error. The proposed approach is contrasted with the algorithm of S. Lakshamanan and H. Derin (1989), which uses a simultaneous parameter estimation and segmentation scheme. The results of the adaptive segmentation algorithm of Lakshamanan and Derin are compared with a simple nearest-neighbor classification scheme to show that if enough information is available, simple techniques could be used as alternatives to computationally expensive schemes. >"

The degradation is assumed to be due to a space invariant, periodic, nonseparable known point-spread function, and additive white noise. Our basic approach is to represent the images by a class of spatial interaction models, namely the simultaneous autoregressve models and the conditional Markov models defined on toroidal lattices, and develop minimum mean-squared error restoration algorithms using these models. The restoration algorithms are optimal, if the parameters characterizing the interaction models are exactly known. However, in practice, the parameters are estimated from the images. By using spatial interaction models, we develop restoration algorithms that do not require the availability of the original image or its prototype. The specific structure of the underlying lattice enables the implementation of the filters using fast Fourier transform (FFT) computations, Several restoration examples are given."

RANSAC is capable of interpreting/smoothing data containing a significant percentage of gross errors, and is thus ideally suited for applications in automated image analysis where interpretation is based on the data provided by error-prone feature detectors. A major portion of this paper describes the application of RANSAC to the Location Determination Problem (LDP): Given an image depicting a set of landmarks with known locations, determine that point in space from which the image was obtained. In response to a RANSAC requirement, new results are derived on the minimum number of landmarks needed to obtain a solution, and algorithms are presented for computing these minimum-landmark solutions in closed form. These results provide the basis for an automatic system that can solve the LDP under difficult viewing"

The authors' model exploits three standard constraints on image motion within an optimization framework: (1) data conservation-the intensity structure of a surface patch changes gradually over time; (2) spatial coherence-neighboring points have similar motions; and (3) temporal coherence-the image velocity of a surface patch changes gradually. The authors' formulation takes into account the possibility of multiple motions at a particular location. They present an incremental scheme for the minimization of the objective function, based on simulated annealing. All computations are parallel, local, and incremental, and occlusion and disocclusion boundaries are estimated.<<ETX>>"

The formulation involves the specification of a deterministic structural model along with stochastic observation and motion field models. Two motion models are proposed: a globally smooth model based on vector Markov random fields and a piecewise smooth model derived from coupled vector-binary Markov random fields. Two estimation criteria are studied. In the maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) estimation, the a posteriori probability of motion given data is maximized, whereas in the minimum expected cost (MEC) estimation, the expectation of a certain cost function is minimized. Both algorithms generate sample fields by means of stochastic relaxation implemented via the Gibbs sampler. Two versions are developed: one for a discrete state space and the other for a continuous state space. The MAP estimation is incorporated into a hierarchical environment to deal efficiently with large displacements. >"

Techniques from statistical physics, which can be interpreted as computing marginal probability distributions, are then used to analyze these models and are shown to (1) relate them to existing theories and (2) give insight into the relations between, and relative effectivenesses of, existing theories. In particular we exploit the power of statistical techniques to put global constraints on the set of allowable states of the binary matching elements. The binary elements can then be removed analytically before minimization. This is demonstrated to be preferable to existing methods of imposing such constraints by adding bias terms in the energy functions. We give applications to winner-take-all networks, correspondence for stereo and long-range motion, the traveling salesman problem, deformable template matching, learning, content addressable memories, and models of brain development. The biological plausibility of these networks is briefly discussed."

The method is efficiently implementable on parallel architectures, and provides a unifying procedure for performing a hierarchical, multiscale, coarse-to-fine analysis of image-processing tasks such as restoration, texture analysis, coding, motion analysis, etc. The method is formulated and applied to the restoration of degraded images. The restoration algorithm is a global-optimization algorithm applicable to other optimization problems. It generates iteratively a multilevel cascode of restored images corresponding to different levels of resolution, or scale. In the lower levels of the cascade appear the large-scale features of the image, and in the higher levels, the microscopic features of the image. >"

It uses multiple attributes associated with each image point to yield a generally overdetermined system of constraints, taking into account possible structural discontinuities and occlusions. In the algorithm implemented, intensity, edgeness, and cornerness attributes are used in conjunction with the constraints arising from intraregional smoothness, field continuity and discontinuity, and occlusions to compute dense displacement fields and occlusion maps along the pixel grids. The intensity, edgeness, and cornerness are invariant under rigid motion in the image plane. In order to cope with large disparities, a multiresolution multigrid structure is employed. Coarser level edgeness and cornerness measures are obtained by blurring the finer level measures. The algorithm has been tested on real-world scenes with depth discontinuities and occlusions. A special case of two-view matching is stereo matching, where the motion between two images is known. The algorithm can be easily specialized to perform stereo matching using the epipolar constraint. >"

Specifically, the paper presents random field models for noisy and textured image data based upon a hierarchy of GD. It then presents dynamic programming based segmentation algorithms for noisy and textured images, considering a statistical maximum a posteriori (MAP) criterion. Due to computational concerns, however, sub-optimal versions of the algorithms are devised through simplifying approximations in the model. Since model parameters are needed for the segmentation algorithms, a new parameter estimation technique is developed for estimating the parameters in a GD. Finally, a number of examples are presented which show the usefulness of the Gibbsian model and the effectiveness of the segmentation algorithms and the parameter estimation procedures."

During the last 5-6 years active contour models have become popular for finding the contours of such objects. Connected to these models are iterative algorithms for finding the minimizing energy curves making the curves behave dynamically through the iterations. These approaches do however have several disadvantages. The numerical algorithms that are in use constrain the models that can be used. Furthermore, in many cases only local minima can be achieved. In this paper, the author discusses a method for curve detection based on a fully Bayesian approach. A model for image contours which allows the number of nodes on the contours to vary is introduced. Iterative algorithms based on stochastic sampling is constructed, which make it possible to simulate samples from the posterior distribution, making estimates and uncertainty measures of specific quantities available. Further, simulated annealing schemes making the curve move dynamically towards the global minimum energy configuration are presented. In theory, no restrictions on the models are made. In practice, however, computational aspects must be taken into consideration when choosing the models. Much more general models than the one used for active contours may however be applied. The approach is applied to ultrasound images of the left ventricle and to magnetic resonance images of the human brain, and show promising results. >"

Although they are well suited structurally for implementation on massively parallel, locally interconnected computational architectures, such distributed algorithms are seriously handi capped by an inherent inefficiency at propagating constraints between widely separated processing elements. Hence, they converge extremely slowly when confronted by the large representations of early vision. Application of multigrid methods can overcome this drawback, as we showed in previous work on 3-D surface reconstruction. In this paper, we develop multiresolution iterative algorithms for computing lightness, shape-from-shading, and optical flow, and we examine the efficiency of these algorithms using synthetic image inputs. The multigrid methodology that we describe is broadly applicable in early vision. Notably, it is an appealing strategy to use in conjunction with regularization analysis for the efficient solution of a wide range of ill-posed image analysis problems."

In partitioning, the label values are generic: two labels are the same when the corresponding scene locations are considered to belong to the same region. The distribution incorporates a measure of disparity between certain spatial features of block pairs of pixel gray levels, using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov nonparametric measures of difference between the distributions of these features.

This problem is typical of ill-conditioned inverse problems that frequently arise in low-level computer vision. A conventional method to stabilize the problem is to introduce a priori constraints on X/sup 0/ and design a cost functional H(X) over images X, which is a weighted average of the prior constraints (regularization term) and posterior constraints (data term); the reconstruction is then the image X, which minimizes H. A prominent weakness in this approach, especially with quadratic-type stabilizers, is the difficulty in recovering discontinuities. The authors therefore examine prior smoothness constraints of a different form, which permit the recovery of discontinuities without introducing auxiliary variables for marking the location of jumps and suspending the constraints in their vicinity. In this sense, discontinuities are addressed implicitly rather than explicitly. >"

They argue that representations of structural relationships in the arrangements of primitive image features, as detected by the perceptual organization process, are essential for analyzing complex imagery. They term these representations collated features. The choice of collated features is determined by the generic shape of the desired objects in the scene. The detection process for collated features is more robust than the local operations for region segmentation and contour tracing. The important structural information encoded in collated features aids various visual tasks such as object segmentation, correspondence processes, and shape description. The proposed method initially detects all reasonable feature groupings. A constraint satisfaction network is then used to model the complex interactions between the collations and select the promising ones. Stereo matching is performed on the collations to obtain height information. This aids in further reasoning on the collated features and results in the 3-D description of the desired objects. >"

                "text": "This paper introduces a general purpose scene segmentation system based on the model that the gradient value at region borders exceeds the gradient within regions. All internal and external parameters are identified and discussed, and the methods of selecting their values are specified. User-provided external parameters are based on segmentation scale: the approximate number of regions (within 50%) and typical perimeter:area ratio of objects of interest. Internal variables are assigned values adaptively, based on image data and the external parameters. The algorithm for region formation combines detected edges and a classical region growing procedure which is shown to perform better than either method alone. A confidence measure in the result is provided automatically, based on the match of the actual segmentation to the original model. Using this measure, there is confirmation whether or not the model and the external parameters are appropriate to the image data. This system is tested on many domains, including aerial photographs, small objects on plain and textured backgrounds, CT scans, stained brain tissue sections, white noise only and laser range images. The system is intended to be applied as one module in a larger vision system. The confidence measure provides a means to integrate the result of this segmentation and segmentations based on other modules. This system is also internally modular, so that another segmentation algorithm or another region formation algorithm could be included without redesigning the entire system.

In most situations, the mere gray value variations do not provide sufficient information in order to estimate such a displacement vector field. Supplementary constraints are necessary, for example the postulate that a displacement vector field varies smoothly as a function of the image position. Taken as a general requirement, this creates difficulties at gray value transitions which correspond to occluding contours. Nagel therefore introduced the ``oriented smoothness'' requirement which restricts variations of the displacement vector field only in directions with small or no variation of gray values. This contribution reports results of an investigation about how such an ``oriented smoothness'' constraint may be formulated and evaluated."

Examples are shape from shading, edge detection, motion analysis, structure from motion, and surface interpolation. As shown by Poggio and Koch [Poggio, T. & Koch, C. (1985) Proc. R. Soc. London, Ser. B 226, 303-323], quadratic variational problems, an important subset of early vision tasks, can be \"solved\" by linear, analog electrical, or chemical networks. However, in the presence of discontinuities, the cost function is nonquadratic, raising the question of designing efficient algorithms for computing the optimal solution. Recently, Hopfield and Tank [Hopfield, J. J. & Tank, D. W. (1985) Biol. Cybern. 52, 141-152] have shown that networks of nonlinear analog \"neurons\" can be effective in computing the solution of optimization problems. We show how these networks can be generalized to solve the nonconvex energy functionals of early vision. We illustrate this approach by implementing a specific analog network, solving the problem of reconstructing a smooth surface from sparse data while preserving its discontinuities. These results suggest a novel computational strategy for solving early vision problems in both biological and real-time artificial vision systems."

The author derives the most general form of such a smoothness constraint which is quadratic in first or second derivatives of the grey-level image intensity function, based on three simple assumptions about the smoothness constraint: (1) that it be expressed in a form which is independent of the choice of Cartesian coordinate system in the image; (2) that it be positive definite; and (3) that it not couple different components of the optical flow. It is shown that there are essentially only four such constraints; any smoothness constraint satisfying all three assumptions must be a linear combination of these four, possibly multipled by certain quantities of these four, possibly multipled by certain quantities invariant under a change in the Cartesian coordinate system. Beginning with the three assumptions mentioned above, the author mathematically demonstrates that all the best-known smoothness constraints appearing in the literature are special cases of this general form, and, in particular, that the 'weight matrix' introduced by H.-H. Nagel (1983) is essentially the only physically plausible such constraint.<<ETX>>"

The recognition task includes both locating the overall pattern and identifying each of its features. Location is achieved by finding a geometric registration function that does a good job of superimposing the instance and the model. Identifying the features requires matching each model feature with the corresponding instance feature.A pruned tree-search algorithm is developed which makes effective use of the Soviet ellipsoid algorithm for feasibility of linear constraints. An interesting blend of theoretical analysis and practical implementation shows that the resulting algorithm has an expected runtime that is theoretically asymptotically quadratic in the number of feature points, but practically linear in n for patterns with fewer than 100 points.Contents: Introduction; Task Abstraction; Prior Approaches; A Linear Programming Approach; Geometry of Registrations and Ellipsoids; Worst-Case Number of Feasible Matchings; Random Patterns; Expected Cost of Feasibility Testing; Expected Size of Search Tree; Monte Carlo Trials; Conclusions.Henry S.

The Gibbs parameter determines the degree to which the prior influences the restoration. The presented method yields a MAP restored image, minimally influenced by the prior, for which a statistic falls within an appropriate confidence interval. The method assumes that a close approximation to the blurring function is known. A simple iterative feedback algorithm is presented to statistically select the parameter as the MAP image restoration is being performed. This algorithm is heuristically based on a model reference control formulation, but it requires only a minimal number of iterations for the parameter to settle to its statistically specified value. The performance of the statistical method for selecting the prior parameter and that of the iterative feedback algorithm are demonstrated using both 2-D and 3-D images. >"

It is well known that multigrid methods can improve significantly the convergence rate and the quality of the final results of iterative relaxation techniques. First, we present a classical multiscale model which consists of a label pyramid and a whole observation field. The potential functions of coarser grids are derived by simple computations. The optimization problem is first solved at the higher scale by a parallel relaxation algorithm; then the next lower scale is initialized by a projection of the result. Second, we propose a hierarchical Markov random field model based on this classical model. We introduce new interactions between neighbor levels in the pyramid. It can also be seen as a way to incorporate cliques with far apart sites for a reasonable price. This model results in a relaxation algorithm with a new annealing scheme: the multitemperature annealing (MTA) scheme, which consists of associating higher temperatures to higher levels, in order to be less sensitive to local minima at coarser grids. The convergence to the global optimum is proved by a generalization of the annealing theorem of S. Geman and D. Geman (IEEE Trans. Pattern Anal. Mach. Intell.6, 1984, 721\u2013741)."

A mathematical model encoding the figure-ground discrimination problem that makes explicit a definition of shape based on cocircularity, smoothness, proximity, and contrast is presented. This model consists of building a cost function on the basis of image element interactions. This cost function fits the constraints of an interacting spin system that, in turn, is a well suited physical model that solves hard combinatorial optimization problems. Two combinatorial optimization methods for solving the figure-ground problem, namely mean field annealing, which combines mean field approximation theory and annealing, and microcanonical annealing, are discussed. Mean field annealing may be viewed as a deterministic approximation of stochastic methods such as simulated annealing. The theoretical bases of these methods are described, and the computational models are derived. The efficiencies of mean field annealing, simulated annealing, and microcanonical annealing algorithms are compared. Within the framework of such a comparison, the figure-ground problem may be viewed as a benchmark. >"

Properties of the mean shift are reviewed and its convergence on lattices is proven. The proposed filtering method associates with each pixel in the image the closest local mode in the density distribution of the joint domain. Segmentation into a piecewise constant structure requires only one more step, fusion of the regions associated with nearby modes. The proposed technique has two parameters controlling the resolution in the spatial and range domains. Since convergence is guaranteed, the technique does not require the intervention of the user to stop the filtering at the desired image quality. Several examples, for gray and color images, show the versatility of the method and compare favorably with results described in the literature for the same images."

At the core of this approach is the Robust Sequential Estimator, a robust extension to the method of sequential least squares. Unlike most existing surface characterization techniques, the authors' method generates complete surface hypotheses in parameter space. Given a noisy depth map of an unknown 3-D scene, the algorithm first selects appropriate seed points representing possible surfaces. For each nonredundant seed it chooses the best approximating model from a given set of competing models using a modified Akaike Information Criterion. With this best model, each surface is expanded from its seed over the entire image, and this step is repeated for all seeds. Those points which appear to be outliers with respect to the model in growth are not included in the (possibly disconnected) surface. Point regions are deleted from each newly grown surface in the prune stage. Noise, outliers, or coincidental surface alignment may cause some points to appear to belong to more than one surface. These ambiguities are resolved by a weighted voting scheme within a 5/spl times/5 decision window centered around the ambiguous point. The isolated point regions left after the resolve stage are removed and any missing points in the data are filled by the surface having a majority consensus in an 8-neighborhood. >"

With the Cresceptron, humans as designers need only to provide a good structure for learning, but they are relieved of most design details. The Cresceptron has been tested on the task of visual recognition by recognizing 3-D general objects from 2-D photographic images of natural scenes and segmenting the recognized objects from the cluttered image background. The Cresceptron uses a hierarchical structure to grow networks automatically, adaptively, and incrementally through learning. The Cresceptron makes it possible to generalize training exemplars to other perceptually equivalent items. Experiments with a variety of real-world images are reported to demonstrate the feasibility of learning in the Cresceptron.<<ETX>>"

                "text": "may 7th, 1986, Professor A. F. M. Smith in the Chair] SUMMARY A continuous two-dimensional region is partitioned into a fine rectangular array of sites or \"pixels\", each pixel having a particular \"colour\" belonging to a prescribed finite set. The true colouring of the region is unknown but, associated with each pixel, there is a possibly multivariate record which conveys imperfect information about its colour according to a known statistical model. The aim is to reconstruct the true scene, with the additional knowledge that pixels close together tend to have the same or similar colours. In this paper, it is assumed that the local characteristics of the true scene can be represented by a nondegenerate Markov random field. Such information can be combined with the records by Bayes' theorem and the true scene can be estimated according to standard criteria. However, the computational burden is enormous and the reconstruction may reflect undesirable largescale properties of the random field. Thus, a simple, iterative method of reconstruction is proposed, which does not depend on these large-scale characteristics. The method is illustrated by computer simulations in which the original scene is not directly related to the assumed random field. Some complications, including parameter estimation, are discussed. Potential applications are mentioned briefly."

The algorithm, which aims at obtaining the maximum a posteriori (MAP) segmentation is a simulated annealing algorithm that is interrupted at regular intervals for estimating the GRF parameters. Maximum-likelihood (ML) estimates of the parameters based on the current segmentation are used to obtain the next segmentation. It is proven that the parameter estimates and the segmentations converge in distribution to the ML estimate of the parameters and the MAP segmentation with those parameter estimates, respectively. Due to computational difficulties, however, only an approximate version of the algorithm is implemented. The approximate algorithm is applied on several two- and four-region images with different noise levels and with first-order and second-order neighborhoods. >"

This paper introduces a method for nonlinear image expansion which preserves the discontinuities of the original image, producing an expanded image with improved definition. The maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation techniques that are proposed for noise-free and noisy images result in the optimization of convex functionals. The expanded images produced from these methods will be shown to be aesthetically and quantitatively superior to images expanded by the standard methods of replication, linear interpolation, and cubic B-spline expansion."

A Markov random field (MRF) is employed to represent the prior contextual information. The consistent labelling is defined as the maximum a posteriori (MAP) labelling. It is achieved using iterative updating according to a rule derived using mean field theory (MFT). The benefits of the approach include the embedding of observations into the matching criterion function and the ability of the algorithm to find the global rather than nearest local optimum. The approach is applied to stereo vision and the experimental results demonstrate its viability."

                "text": "This article proposes a general theory and methodology, called the minimax entropy principle, for building statistical models for images (or signals) in a variety of applications. This principle consists of two parts. The first is the maximum entropy principle for feature binding (or fusion): for a given set of observed feature statistics, a distribution can be built to bind these feature statistics together by maximizing the entropy over all distributions that reproduce them. The second part is the minimum entropy principle for feature selection: among all plausible sets of feature statistics, we choose the set whose maximum entropy distribution has the minimum entropy. Computational and inferential issues in both parts are addressed; in particular, a feature pursuit procedure is proposed for approximately selecting the optimal set of features. The minimax entropy principle is then corrected by considering the sample variation in the observed feature statistics, and an information criterion for feature pursuit is derived. The minimax entropy principle is applied to texture modeling, where a novel Markov random field (MRF) model, called FRAME (filter, random field, and minimax entropy), is derived, and encouraging results are obtained in experiments on a variety of texture images. The relationship between our theory and the mechanisms of neural computation is also discussed."

The proposed scheme is a coarse-to-fine search process, and a Hopfield network is used at each stage. Compared with conventional object-matching schemes, the proposed technique provides a more general and compact formulation of the problem and a solution more suitable for parallel implementation. At the coarse search stage, the surface matching scores between the input image and each object model in the database are computed through a Hopfield network and are used to select the candidates for further consideration. At the fine search stage, the object models selected from the previous stage are fed into another Hopfield network for vertex matching. The object model that has the best surface and vertex correspondences with the input image is finally singled out as the best matched model. Experimental results are reported using both synthetic and real range images to corroborate the proposed theory."

The application of this technique usually results in a least squares approximation or a spline fitting of the parameter of interest. This is often adequate for estimating smooth parameter fields. However, when the parameter of interest has discontinuities the estimate formed by this technique will smooth over the discontinuities. Several techniques have been introduced to modify the regularization process to incorporate discontinuities. Many of these approaches however, will themselves be ill-posed or ill-conditioned. This paper presents a technique for incorporating discontinuities into the reconstruction problem while maintaining a well-posed and well-conditioned problem statement. The resulting computational problem is a convex functional minimization problem. This method is compared to previous approaches and examples are presented for the problems of reconstructing curves and surfaces with discontinuities and for estimating image data. Computational issues arising in both analog and digital implementations are also discussed. >"

Silverman in the Chair] SUMMARY Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms, such as the Gibbs sampler, have provided a Bayesian inference machine in image analysis and in other areas of spatial statistics for several years, founded on the pioneering ideas of Ulf Grenander. More recently, the observation that hyperparameters can be included as part of the updating schedule and the fact that almost any multivariate distribution is equivalently a Markov random field has opened the way to the use of MCMC in general Bayesian computation. In this paper, we trace the early development of MCMC in Bayesian inference, review some recent computational progress in statistical physics, based on the introduction of auxiliary variables, and discuss its current and future relevance in Bayesian applications. We briefly describe a simple MCMC implementation for the Bayesian analysis of agricultural field experiments, with which we have some practical experience."

The authors show how to learn such a model from a series of training images depicting a class of objects, producing a model that represents a probability distribution over the variation in object appearance. Features identified in an image through perceptual organization are represented by a graph whose nodes include feature labels and numeric measurements. A learning procedure generalizes multiple image graphs to form a model graph in which the numeric measurements are characterized by probability distributions. A matching procedure, using a similarity metric based on a non-parametric probability density estimator, compares model and image graphs to identify an instance of a modeled object in an image. Experimental results are presented from a system constructed to test this approach. The system learns to recognize partially occluded 2-D objects in 2-D images using shape cues.

This paper presents a comparative study of the two kinds of models. We analyze the mechanisms of adaptation (to discontinuities) and robustness (to outliers) and give a necessary condition for the adaptation and the robustness. We then give a common deenition of both models. The deenition captures the essence of the adaptation ability and gives in theory innnitely many choices of functions suitable for the adaptation in MRF and robust models. The likeness between the two models suggests that results in the two areas are interchangeable to beneet each other."

Given correspondences between these 3D lines and 2D lines found in the image, the goal is to find rotation (R) and transition (T) which map a world coordinate system to the camera coordinate system. Three algorithms are developed: R-then-T, R-and-T, and Med-R-and-T. Algorithms R-then-T and R-and-T are least square algorithms. Algorithm R-then-T solves for rotation first and uses the result to solve for translation. The second algorithm R-and-T solves for both rotation and translation simultaneously. The results from the second algorithm are much better. Some of the correspondences may be wrong. Algorithm Med-R-and-T can handle up to 49.9% outliers or gross errors in the date. It minimizes the median of the square of the same error measure used by the R-and-T algorithm. A closed-form expression function is developed for the uncertainty in the output parameters as a function of the variance of the noise in the input parameters.<<ETX>>"

One of the fundamental weaknesses of current computer vision systems to be used in practical applications is their inability to adapt the segmentation process as real-world changes occur in the image. We present the first closed loop image segmentation system which incorporates a genetic algorithm to adapt the segmentation process to changes in image characteristics caused by variable environmental conditions such as time of day, time of year, clouds, etc. The segmentation problem is formulated as an optimization problem and the genetic algorithm efficiently searches the hyperspace of segmentation parameter combinations to determine the parameter set which maximizes the segmentation quality criteria. The goals of our adaptive image segmentation system are to provide continuous adaptation to normal environmental variations, to exhibit learning capabilities, and to provide robust performance when interacting with a dynamic environment. We present experimental results which demonstrate learning and the ability to adapt the segmentation performance in outdoor color imagery."

In the last five years, MCMC has been introduced into significance testing, general Bayesian inference and maximum likelihood estimation. This paper presents basic methodology of MCMC, emphasizing the Bayesian paradigm, conditional probability and the intimate relationship with Markov random fields in spatial statistics. Hastings algorithms are discussed, including Gibbs, Metropolis and some other variations. Pairwise difference priors are described and are used subsequently in three Bayesian applications, in each of which there is a pronounced spatial or temporal aspect to the modeling. The examples involve logistic regression in the presence of unobserved covariates and ordinal factors; the analysis of agricultural field experiments, with adjustment for fertility gradients; and processing of low-resolution medical images obtained by a gamma camera. Additional methodological issues arise in each of these applications and in the Appendices. The paper lays particular emphasis on the calculation of posterior probabilities and concurs with others in its view that MCMC facilitates a fundamental breakthrough in applied Bayesian modeling."

The partial modeling takes place by taking the Bayesian statistical decision rule and a number of important heuristics into consideration while maximizing the log likelihood function. Applications include the automatic selection of multiple thresholds, single rigid motion estimation or multiple rigid motion segmentation, and estimation from two perspective views. It is believed that the proposed MF estimator will aid in solving many robust estimation problems that demand an estimator that is either highly robust or capable of handling contaminated Gaussian mixture models. >"

The computational complexity is pronounced by the recent minimax entropy (FRAME) models which use large neighborhoods and hundreds of parameters. In this paper, we present a common framework for learning Gibbs models. We identify two key factors that determine the accuracy and speed of learning Gibbs models: The efficiency of likelihood functions and the variance in approximating partition functions using Monte Carlo integration. We propose three new algorithms. In particular, we are interested in a maximum satellite likelihood estimator, which makes use of a set of precomputed Gibbs models called \"satellites\" to approximate likelihood functions. This algorithm can approximately estimate the minimax entropy model for textures in seconds in a HP workstation. The performances of various learning algorithms are compared in our experiments."

Emphasis is placed on a Markov image model described in a lattice by a Gaussian noise and a local regularization term depending upon the image discontinuities. An approximate self-similar property of the model is derived by a process of averaging over half of the lattice sites. This is known as the renormalization group approach. Two multiscale pyramid structures, one of images and the other of image discontinuities, are obtained. The coarse images generated by the proposed method are smooth and show good contrast. The approach, when applied in the reverse order, is capable of enlarging images, while accounting for the original image features. The quality of the derived pyramid is demonstrated by using it to help solve a segmentation problem.<<ETX>>"

But the solution must not smooth over discontinuities in the image, and allowance must be made for the fact that the probability distributions of the smoothness measures are unknown. The authors apply the theory of robust statistics (M-statistics) to obtain a convex regularization that is also maximally robust against misspecification of the probability distribution of large jumps in the unknown. This theory is applied to the optical flow constraint, which is known to be noisy and inaccurate. The authors present some preliminary results showing that convex regularization theory seems to accurately preserve depth boundary information.<<ETX>>"

This book describes an extended series of experiments into the role of geometry in the critical area of object recognition. It provides precise definitions of the recognition and localization problems, describes the methods used to address them, analyzes the solutions to these problems, and addresses the implications of this analysis.The solution to problems of object recognition are of fundamental importance in many real applications and versions of the techniques described here are already being used in industrial settings. Although a number of questions remain to be solved, the authors provide a valuable framework for understanding both the strengths and limitations of using object shape to guide recognition.W. Eric L.

A new theory for solving such problems is presented. Unlike the current heuristic methods, the method used starts from fundamental principles that should be followed by any reconstruction method, regardless of its mathematical or physical implementation. A mathematical procedure which conforms to these principles is presented. One major advantage of the method is the ability to handle shapes containing both smooth and sharp parts without using thresholds. A sharp variation, such as a corner, requires a high-resolution mesh for adequate representation, while slowly varying sections can be represented with sparser mesh points. Unlike current methods, this procedure fits the surface on a varying mesh. The mesh is constructed automatically to be more dense at parts of the image that have more rapid variation. Analytical examples are given in simple cases, followed by numerical experiments. >"

However, parameter estimation for the CGM model is difficult since it is not clear as to how the constraints or interdependence amongst the model parameters can be incorporated into the estimation procedures. As result, the parameter estimates tend to be inconsistent. It is shown that, under some reasonable symmetry constraints, the 80 interdependent parameters of the CGM model can be reduced to seven independent ones. This guarantees the consistency of model parameters obtained from parameter estimation algorithms, thereby removing a main obstacle for the parameter estimation of the CGM model."

We studied the statistics of natural images including the scale invariant properties, then generic prior models were learned to duplicate the observed statistics, based on minimax entropy theory. The resulting Gibbs distributions have potentials of the form U(I; /spl Lambda/, S)=/spl Sigma//sub /spl alpha/=1//sup k//spl Sigma//sub x,y//spl lambda//sup (/spl alpha/)/((F/sup (/spl alpha/)/*I)(x,y)) with S={F/sup (1)/, F/sup (2)/,...,F/sup (K)/} being a set of filters and /spl Lambda/={/spl lambda//sup (1)/(),/spl lambda//sup (2)/(),...,/spl lambda//sup (K)/()} the potential functions. The learned Gibbs distributions confirm and improve the form of existing prior models such as line-process, but, in contrast to all previous models, inverted potentials were found to be necessary. We find that the partial differential equations given by gradient descent on U(I; /spl Lambda/, S) are essentially reaction-diffusion equations, where the usual energy terms produce anisotropic diffusion, while the inverted energy terms produce reaction associated with pattern formation, enhancing preferred image features. We illustrate how these models can be used for texture pattern rendering, denoising, image enhancement, and clutter removal by careful choice of both prior and data models of this type, incorporating the appropriate features."

The input is a list of line segments of an image obtained from a preprocessing stage, which is usually fragmentary and contains extraneous noisy segments. The output is the correspondences between the image line segments and model line segments. We use attributed relational graphs (ARG) to describe images and models. An ARG consists of a set of nodes, each node representing a line segment, and attributed relations between nodes. The task of matching is to find the best correspondences between the image ARG and the model ARG. The correspondences are \nfound using a relaxation labeling algorithm, which optimizes a criterion of similarity. The algorithm is capable of subgraph matching of an image road structure to a map road model covering an area 10 times larger than the area imaged by the sensor, provided that the image distortion due to perspective imaging geometry has been corrected during preprocessing stages. We present matching experiments and demonstrate the stability of the matching method to extraneous line segments, missing line segments, and errors in scaling."

The algorithm consists of five steps: (1) Each image is filtered at different orientations with bar masks of four sizes that increase with eccentricity; the equivalent filters are one or two octaves wide. (2) Zero-crossings in the filtered images, which roughly correspond to edges, are localized. Positions of the ends of lines and edges are also found. (3) For each mask orientation and size, matching takes place between pairs of zero-crossings or terminations of the same sign in the two images, for a range of disparities up to about the width of the mask\u2019s central region. (4) Wide masks can control vergence movements, thus causing small masks to come into correspondence. (5) When a correspondence is achieved, it is stored in a dynamic buffer, called the 2\u00bd-D sketch. It is shown that this proposal provides a theoretical framework for most existing psychophysical and neurophysiological data about stereopsis. Several critical experimental predictions are also made, for instance about the size of Panum\u2019s area under various conditions. The results of such experiments would tell us whether, for example, co-operativity is necessary for the matching process."

This book examines the measurement of this movement and the use of relative movement to locate the boundaries of physical objects in the environment. It investigates the nature of the computations that are necessary to perform this analysis by any vision system, biological or artificial. \nThe author first defines the goals of these visual tasks, reveals the properties of the physical world that a vision system can rely upon to achieve such goals, and suggests general methods that can be used to carry out the tasks. From the general methods, she designs algorithms specifying a particular sequence of computations that a vision system can execute to perform these visual tasks. These algorithms are implemented on a computer system under a variety of circumstances. Combined with the traditional approaches of psychology and neurophysiology, this computational approach provides an exciting analysis of visual function, raising many new questions about the human vision system for further investigation. \nEllen Catherine Hildreth received her doctorate from MIT. She is a Research Scientist in the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory and associate director of theCenter for Biological Information Processing at the Whitaker College of Health Sciences, Technology, and Management. The Measurement of Visual Motion is an ACM Distinguished Dissertation."

We describe a compact parametrized model of facial appearance which takes into account all these sources of variability. The model represents both shape and gray-level appearance, and is created by performing a statistical analysis over a training set of face images. A robust multiresolution search algorithm is used to fit the model to faces in new images. This allows the main facial features to be located, and a set of shape, and gray-level appearance parameters to be recovered. A good approximation to a given face can be reconstructed using less than 100 of these parameters. This representation can be used for tasks such as image coding, person identification, 3D pose recovery, gender recognition, and expression recognition. Experimental results are presented for a database of 690 face images obtained under widely varying conditions of 3D pose, lighting, and facial expression. The system performs well on all the tasks listed above."

The success of the approach depends on the definition of a comprehensive set of goals for the computation of edge points. These goals must be precise enough to delimit the desired behavior of the detector while making minimal assumptions about the form of the solution. We define detection and localization criteria for a class of edges, and present mathematical forms for these criteria as functionals on the operator impulse response. A third criterion is then added to ensure that the detector has only one response to a single edge. We use the criteria in numerical optimization to derive detectors for several common image features, including step edges. On specializing the analysis to step edges, we find that there is a natural uncertainty principle between detection and localization performance, which are the two main goals. With this principle we derive a single operator shape which is optimal at any scale. The optimal detector has a simple approximate implementation in which edges are marked at maxima in gradient magnitude of a Gaussian-smoothed image. We extend this simple detector using operators of several widths to cope with different signal-to-noise ratios in the image. We present a general method, called feature synthesis, for the fine-to-coarse integration of information from operators at different scales. Finally we show that step edge detector performance improves considerably as the operator point spread function is extended along the edge."

The Hough transform is the most common method of extracting geometric primitives. Recently, methods derived from the field of robust statistics have been used for this purpose. We show that extracting a single geometric primitive is equivalent to finding the optimum value of a cost function which has potentially many local minima. Besides providing a unifying way of understanding different primitive extraction algorithms, this model also shows that for efficient extraction the true global minimum must be found with as few evaluations of the cost function as possible. In order to extract a single geometric primitive we choose a number of minimal subsets randomly from the geometric data. The cost function is evaluated for each of these, and the primitive defined by the subset with the best value of the cost function is extracted from the geometric data. To extract multiple primitives, this process is repeated on the geometric data that do not belong to the primitive. The resulting extraction algorithm can be used with a wide variety of geometric primitives and geometric data. It is easily parallelized, and we describe some possible implementations on a variety of parallel architectures. We make a detailed comparison with the Hough transform and show that it has a number of advantages over this classic technique."

Various issues related to representation and modeling of 3-D objects are addressed. A new method for the approximation of 3-D objects by a set of planar faces is discussed. The major advantage of this method is that it is applicable to a complete object and not restricted to single range view which was the limitation of the previous work in 3-D scene analysis. The method is a sequential region growing algorithm. It is not applied to range images, but rather to a set of 3-D points. The 3-D model of an object is obtained by combining the object points from a sequence of range data images corresponding to various views of the object, applying the necessary transformations and then approximating the surface by polygons. A stochastic labeling technique is used to do the shape matching of 3-D objects. The technique matches the faces of an unknown view against the faces of the model. It explicitly maximizes a criterion function based on the ambiguity and inconsistency of classification. It is hierarchical and uses results obtained at low levels to speed up and improve the accuracy of results at higher levels. The objective here is to match the individual views of the object taken from any vantage point. Details of the algorithm are presented and the results are shown on several unknown views of a complicated automobile casting."

An optimal recipe for classifying such patterns is described. It combines the use of an orthonormal expansion for the logarithm of probability functions, with the generation of a joint probability distribution from lower-order marginals. The unwieldy nature of the optimal recipe leads to the consideration of dependence represented by a Markov chain and a two-dimensional analog called a Markov mesh. The Markov chain has a \"reflecting\" property in that the r th order nonstationary chain implies that a point depends on its r nearest neighbors on each side. By scanning along a grid-filling curve so that the 2r neighbors of a point are geometrically close to it, certain spatial dependencies are obtained. The grid-filling curves are sequences of functions which have Hilbert \"space-filling\" curves as their limit. This simple approach does not provide for many of the spatial dependencies that should be considered. A novel extension of Markov chain methods into two dimensions leads to the Markov mesh which economically takes care of a much larger class of spatial dependencies. Likelihood ratio classification based on Markov chain and Markov mesh assumptions requires the estimation of a much smaller number of parameters than the general case. The development presented in this paper is new and need not be restricted to binary variables."

Shape matching is viewed as a ``segment matching'' problem. Unlike the previous work, the technique is based on a stochastic labeling procedure which explicitly maximizes a criterion function based on the ambiguity and inconsistency of classification. To reduce the computation time, the technique is hierarchical and uses results obtained at low levels to speed up and improve the accuracy of results at higher levels. This basic technique has been extended to the situation where various objects partially occlude each other to form an apparent object and our interest is to find all the objects participating in the occlusion. In such a case several hierarchical processes are executed in parallel for every object participating in the occlusion and are coordinated in such a way that the same segment of the apparent object is not matched to the segments of different actual objects. These techniques have been applied to two-dimensional simple closed curves represented by polygons and the power of the techniques is demonstrated by the examples taken from synthetic, aerial, industrial and biological images where the matching is done after using the actual segmentation methods."

Further modifications of the OSL algorithm guarantee convergence to the unique maximum of the log posterior function. Convergence is proved under a specific set of sufficient conditions. Several of these conditions concern the potential function of the Gibb's prior, and a number of candidate potential functions are identified. Generalization of the OSL algorithm to transmission tomography is also considered."

The authors apply flexible constraints, in the form of a probabilistic deformable model, to the problem of segmenting natural 2-D objects whose diversity and irregularity of shape make them poorly represented in terms of fixed features or form. The parametric model is based on the elliptic Fourier decomposition of the boundary. Probability distributions on the parameters of the representation bias the model to a particular overall shape while allowing for deformations. Boundary finding is formulated as an optimization problem using a maximum a posteriori objective function. Results of the method applied to real and synthetic images are presented, including an evaluation of the dependence of the method on prior information and image quality. >"

In general, the solutions proposed in the past solved this prob- lem only partially: Either the mathematical model encoding the figure-ground problem was too simple, the optimization methods that were used were not efficient enough, or they could not guarantee that the global minimum of the cost function describing the figure-ground model would be found. The method that we devised and is described in this paper is tailored around three main contributions. First, we suggest a mathematical model encoding the figure- ground discrimination problem that makes explicit a definition of shape (or figure) based on cocircularity, smoothness, proximity, and contrast. This model consists of building a cost function on the basis of image element interactions. Moreover, this cost func- tion fits the constraints of an interacting spin system that, in turn, is a well suited physical model that solves hard combinatorial optimization problems Second, we suggest two combinatorial optimization methods for solving the figure-ground problem, namely i) mean field annealing, which combines mean field approximation theory and annealing, and ii) microcanonical annnealing. Mean field annealing may well be viewed as a deterministic approximation of stochastic methods such as simulated annealing. We describe, in detail, the theoretical bases of these methods, derive computa- tional models, and provide practical algorithms. Third, we provide a comparison of the efficiency of mean field annealing, simulated annealing, and microcanonical annealing algorithms. Within the framework of such a comparison, the figure-ground problem may well be viewed as a benchmark Index rem-Feature grouping, figure-ground discrimination, low-level vision, mean field annealing, microcanonical anneal- ing, recursive neural networks, simulated annealing, stochastic optimization theory, thresholding."

Through regularization, they may be reformulated as well-posed variational principles whose solutions are computable. Standard regularization theory employs quadratic stabilizing functionals that impose global smoothness constraints on possible solutions. Discontinuities present serious difficulties to standard regularization, however, since their reconstruction requires a precise spatial control over the smoothing properties of stabilizers. This paper proposes a general class of controlled-continuity stabilizers which provide the necessary control over smoothness. These nonquadratic stabilizing functionals comprise multiple generalized spline kernels combined with (noncontinuous) continuity control functions. In the context of computational vision, they may be thought of as controlled-continuity constraints. These generic constraints are applicable to visual reconstruction problems that involve both continuous regions and discontinuities, for which global smoothness constraints fail."

A critical, intermediate goal of edge detection is the detection and characterization of significant intensity changes. This paper discusses this part of the edge detection problem. To characterize the types of intensity changes derivatives of different types, and possibly different scales, are needed. Thus, we consider this part of edge detection as a problem in numerical differentiation. We show that numerical differentiation of images is an ill-posed problem in the sense of Hadamard. Differentiation needs to be regularized by a regularizing filtering operation before differentiation. This shows that this part of edge detection consists of two steps, a filtering step and a differentiation step. Following this perspective, the paper discusses in detail the following theoretical aspects of edge detection. 1) The properties of different types of filters-with minimal uncertainty, with a bandpass spectrum, and with limited support-are derived. Minimal uncertainty filters optimize a tradeoff between computational efficiency and regularizing properties. 2) Relationships among several 2-D differential operators are established. In particular, we characterize the relation between the Laplacian and the second directional derivative along the gradient. Zero crossings of the Laplacian are not the only features computed in early vision. 3) Geometrical and topological properties of the zero crossings of differential operators are studied in terms of transversality and Morse theory."

Furthermore, discontinuities of any order of derivative can be detected by providing for continuous line processes, which selectively inhibit smoothing. Second- and higher-order networks are required for many problems in early vision; first-order networks are often unsatisfactory. Examples in surface interpolation, edge detection, and image segmentation are shown. Solution of these types of problems typically takes a prohibitive amount of time, even on supercomputers. A significant advantage of these proposed networks is that they can be mapped directly to analog VLSI hardware.<<ETX>>"

Two point patterns (sets of points) (x/sub i/) and (x/sub i/); i=1, 2, . . ., n are given in m-dimensional space, and the similarity transformation parameters (rotation, translation, and scaling) that give the least mean squared error between these point patterns are needed. Recently, K.S. Arun et al. (1987) and B.K.P. Horn et al. (1987) presented a solution of this problem. Their solution, however, sometimes fails to give a correct rotation matrix and gives a reflection instead when the data is severely corrupted. The proposed theorem is a strict solution of the problem, and it always gives the correct transformation parameters even when the data is corrupted. >"

The energy function is highly nonconvex, and finding the global minimum is a nontrival problem. When constraints on the interactions between line processes are removed, the deterministic, graduated nonconvexity (GNC) algorithm has been shown to find close to optimum solutions. The GNC model is generalized. Any number of constraints on the line processes can be added as a result of using the adiabatic approximation. The resulting algorithm is a combination of the conjugate gradient (CG) and the iterated conditional modes (ICM) algorithms and is completely deterministic. Since the GNC algorithm can be obtained as a special case of this approach, the algorithm is called the generalized GNC or G/sup 2/NC algorithm. It is executed on two aerial images.

We analyze the task requirements in terms of what information needs to be represented, how to represent it, what kind of paradigms can be used to process it, and how to implement the paradigms. We describe shape surfaces by curves and patches, which we represent by linear primitives, such as points, lines, and planes. Next we describe algo rithms to construct this representation from range data. We then propose the paradigm of recognizing objects while locat ing them. We analyze the basic constraint of rigidity that can be exploited, which we implement as a prediction and verifi cation scheme that makes efficient use of the representation. Results are presented for data obtained from a laser range finder, but both the shape representation and the matching algorithm are general and can be used for other types of data, such as ultrasound, stereo, and tactile."

Specific topics in early vision and their regularization are then analyzed rigorously, characterizing existence, uniqueness, and stability of solutions. A fundamental difficulty that arises in almost every vision problem is scale, that is, the resolution at which to operate. Methods that have been proposed to deal with the problem include scale-space techniques that consider the behavior of the result across a continuum of scales. From the point of view of regulation theory, the concept of scale is related quite directly to the regularization parameter lambda . It suggested that methods used to obtained the optimal value of lambda may provide, either directly or after suitable modification, the optimal scale associated with the specific instance of certain problems. >"

The Hamiltonian used in the original model is minimized, but far more efficiently. The basis of microcanonical annealing is the Creutz algorithm. Unlike its counterpart, the familiar Metropolis algorithm, the Creutz algorithm simulates a thermally isolated system at equilibrium. The hierarchical control structure, together with a Brownian state-transition function, tracks ground states across scale, beginning with small, coarsely coded levels.

Frequently, processes are needed which reduce ambiguity and noise, and select the best label among several possible choices. Relaxation labeling processes are just such a class of algorithms. They are based on the parallel use of local constraints between labels. This paper develops a theory to characterize the goal of relaxation labeling. The theory is founded on a definition of con-sistency in labelings, extending the notion of constraint satisfaction. In certain restricted circumstances, an explicit functional exists that can be maximized to guide the search for consistent labelings. This functional is used to derive a new relaxation labeling operator. When the restrictions are not satisfied, the theory relies on variational cal-culus. It is shown that the problem of finding consistent labelings is equivalent to solving a variational inequality. A procedure nearly identical to the relaxation operator derived under restricted circum-stances serves in the more general setting. Further, a local convergence result is established for this operator. The standard relaxation labeling formulas are shown to approximate our new operator, which leads us to conjecture that successful applications of the standard methods are explainable by the theory developed here. Observations about con-vergence and generalizations to higher order compatibility relations are described."

Prior knowledge of an object shape is described by a prototype template which consists of the representative contour/edges, and a set of probabilistic deformation transformations on the template. A Bayesian scheme, which is based on this prior knowledge and the edge information in the input image, is employed to find a match between the deformed template and objects in the image. Computational efficiency is achieved via a coarse-to-fine implementation of the matching algorithm. Our method has been applied to retrieve objects with a variety of shapes from images with complex background. The proposed scheme is invariant to location, rotation, and moderate scale changes of the template."

Generalized cross-validation is to devise an automatic algorithm for finding the optimal value of the smoothing (regularization) parameter from the data. The cross-validated smoothing splines are then used to obtain optimal estimates of the derivatives of quantized contours. Experimental results are presented which demonstrate the robustness of the method applied to the estimation of curvature of quantized contours under variable scale, rotation, and partial occlusion.

During the last two decades, the method of maximum likelihood has become the most widely followed approach to this problem, thanks primarily to the advent of high speed electronic computers. Here, we first offer a brief survey of the literature directed toward this problem and review maximum-likelihood estimation for it. We then turn to the subject of ultimate interest, which is a particular iterative procedure for numerically approximating maximum-likelihood estimates for mixture density problems. This procedure, known as the EM algorithm, is a specialization to the mixture density context of a general algorithm of the same name used to approximate maximum-likelihood estimates for incomplete data problems. We discuss the formulation and theoretical and practical properties of the EM algorithm for mixture densities, focussing in particular on ..."

                "text": "SUMMARY A generalization of the sampling method introduced by Metropolis et al. (1953) is presented along with an exposition of the relevant theory, techniques of application and methods and difficulties of assessing the error in Monte Carlo estimates. Examples of the methods, including the generation of random orthogonal matrices and potential applications of the methods to numerical problems arising in statistics, are discussed. For numerical problems in a large number of dimensions, Monte Carlo methods are often more efficient than conventional numerical methods. However, implementation of the Monte Carlo methods requires sampling from high dimensional probability distributions and this may be very difficult and expensive in analysis and computer time. General methods for sampling from, or estimating expectations with respect to, such distributions are as follows. (i) If possible, factorize the distribution into the product of one-dimensional conditional distributions from which samples may be obtained. (ii) Use importance sampling, which may also be used for variance reduction. That is, in order to evaluate the integral J = X) p(x)dx = Ev(f), where p(x) is a probability density function, instead of obtaining independent samples XI, ..., Xv from p(x) and using the estimate J, = Zf(xi)/N, we instead obtain the sample from a distribution with density q(x) and use the estimate J2 = Y{f(xj)p(x1)}/{q(xj)N}. This may be advantageous if it is easier to sample from q(x) thanp(x), but it is a difficult method to use in a large number of dimensions, since the values of the weights w(xi) = p(x1)/q(xj) for reasonable values of N may all be extremely small, or a few may be extremely large. In estimating the probability of an event A, however, these difficulties may not be as serious since the only values of w(x) which are important are those for which x -A. Since the methods proposed by Trotter & Tukey (1956) for the estimation of conditional expectations require the use of importance sampling, the same difficulties may be encountered in their use. (iii) Use a simulation technique; that is, if it is difficult to sample directly from p(x) or if p(x) is unknown, sample from some distribution q(y) and obtain the sample x values as some function of the corresponding y values. If we want samples from the conditional dis"

Local orientation and spatial frequencies are used as the key parameters for classifying texture. The information is obtained by creating a local multifrequency multiorientation channel decomposition of the image, with the width of each frequency band constant on a logarithmic scale. This decomposition is implemented by applying a set of Gabor-like functions that were modified to have a decreased frequency selectivity when the filter's center frequency increases. The set of filter outputs is then used to create robust texture descriptors. The segmentation algorithm uses the similarity of the descriptors to determine the existence of texture regions and to outline their border rather than concentrating on segregating the textures. The method has been applied to image containing natural textures, resulting in a good segmentation of the texture regions.<<ETX>>"

The article raises the question as to whether location of discontinuities is necessary in this process. The author proposes a class of adaptive regularizers (ARs) for reconstruction in the framework of regularization, in an attempt to solve the conflict between 'oversmoothing across discontinuities' and 'finding discontinuities'. The proposal differs from existing methods in the way it controls continuity, in which true discontinuities are considered in the mathematical sense only. A simple analog neuron-like circuit for hardware implementation is suggested. Experimental results are presented.<<ETX>>"

The approach is to use three-dimensional models of the objects to find them in range data. The matching strategy starts with a distinctive edge feature, such as the edge at the end of a cylindrical part, and then \"grows\" a match by add ing compatible features one at a time. (The order of features to be considered is predetermined by an interactive, off-line, feature-selection process.) Once a sufficient number of com patible features has been detected to allow a hypothesis to be formed, the verification procedure evaluates it by comparing the measured range data with data predicted according to the hypothesis. When all the objects in the scene have been hy pothesized and verified in this manner, a configuration- understanding procedure determines which objects are on top of others by analyzing the patterns of range data predicted from all the hypotheses. We also present experimental results of the system's performance in recognizing and locating castings in a bin."

The value of the regularization parameter depends on the variance of the noise in the data. The problem of choosing the regularization parameter and estimating the noise variance in image restoration is examined. An error analysis based on an objective mean-square-error (MSE) criterion is used to motivate regularization. Two approaches for choosing the regularization parameter and estimating the noise variance are proposed. The proposed and existing methods are compared and their relationship to linear minimum-mean-square-error filtering is examined. Experiments are presented that verify the theoretical results."

Smith, \"On group assessment of utility and worth attributes using interpretive structural modeling,\" Compuiters alnd Abstract Relaxation labeling is a process that attempts to disambiguate probabilistic labelings of objects. Compatibility coefficients play an important role in the relaxation process. No explanation exists at present for their exact meaning, and no algorithm has been proposed to generate them. Some possible interpretations of these coefficients are presented, and algorithms are suggested to obtain them from the initial probabilistic labeling. Examples are given for the case where relaxation is used to disambiguate the detection of curves in a picture."

We conclude that: 1) \"Orthodox\" sampling theory methods are useful in problems where we have a known model (sampling distribution) for the properties of the noise, but no appreciable prior information about the quantities being estimated. 2) MAXENT is optimal in problems where we have prior information about multiplicities, but no noise. 3) The full Bayesian solution includes both of these as special cases and is needed in problems where we have both prior information and noise. 4) AR models are in one sense a special case of MAXENT, but in another sense they are ubiquitous in all spectral analysis problems with discrete time series. 5) Empirical methods such as Blackman-Tukey, which do not invoke even a likelihood function, are useful in the preliminary, exploratory phase of a problem where our knowledge is sufficient to permit intuitive judgments about how to organize a calculation (smoothing, decimation, windows, prewhitening, padding with zeroes, etc.) but insufficient to set up a quantitative model which would do the proper things for us automatically and optimally."

Although these algorithms have been shown experimentally to be successful there has been little theoretical analysis of them. In this paper we demonstrate connections between mean field theory methods and other approaches, in particular, barrier function and interior point methods. As an explicit example, we summarize our work on the linear assignment problem. In this previous work we defined a number of algorithms, including deterministic annealing, for solving the assignment problem. We proved convergence, gave bounds on the convergence times, and showed relations to other optimization algorithms."

We consider the graph partition and the travelling salesman problems. The key new ingredient is a reduction of solution space by one dimension by using graded neurons, thereby avoiding the destructive redundancy that has plagued these problems when using straightforward neural network techniques. This approach maps the problems onto Potts glass rather than spin glass theories. A systematic prescription is given for estimating the phase transition temperatures in advance, which facilitates the choice of optimal parameters. This analysis, which is performed for both serial and synchronous updating of the mean field theory equations, makes it possible to consistently avoid chaotic behavior.When exploring this new technique numerically we find the results very encouraging; the quality of the solutions are in parity with those obtained by using optimally tuned simulated annealing heuristics. Our numerical study, which for TSP extends to 200-city problems, exhibits an impressive level of parameter insensitivity. (Less)"

The computational approach taken in this system is motivated by both physiology and information theory, as well as by the practical requirements of near-real-time performance and accuracy. Our approach treats the face recognition problem as an intrinsically two-dimensional (2-D) recognition problem rather than requiring recovery of three-dimensional geometry, taking advantage of the fact that faces are normally upright and thus may be described by a small set of 2-D characteristic views. The system functions by projecting face images onto a feature space that spans the significant variations among known face images. The significant features are known as \"eigenfaces,\" because they are the eigenvectors (principal components) of the set of faces; they do not necessarily correspond to features such as eyes, ears, and noses. The projection operation characterizes an individual face by a weighted sum of the eigenface features, and so to recognize a particular face it is necessary only to compare these weights to those of known individuals. Some particular advantages of our approach are that it provides for the ability to learn and later recognize new faces in an unsupervised manner, and that it is easy to implement using a neural network architecture."

                "text": "SummarySmoothing splines are well known to provide nice curves which smooth discrete, noisy data. We obtain a practical, effective method for estimating the optimum amount of smoothing from the data. Derivatives can be estimated from the data by differentiating the resulting (nearly) optimally smoothed spline.We consider the modelyi(ti)+\u03b5i,i=1, 2, ...,n,ti\u2208[0, 1], whereg\u2208W2(m)={f:f,f\u2032, ...,f(m\u22121) abs. cont.,f(m)\u2208\u21122[0,1]}, and the {\u03b5i} are random errors withE\u03b5i=0,E\u03b5i\u03b5j=\u03c32\u03b4ij. The error variance \u03c32 may be unknown. As an estimate ofg we take the solutiongn, \u03bb to the problem: Findf\u2208W2(m) to minimize\n$$\\frac{1}{n}\\sum\\limits_{j = 1}^n {(f(t_j ) - y_j )^2 + \\lambda \\int\\limits_0^1 {(f^{(m)} (u))^2 du} }$$\n. The functiongn, \u03bb is a smoothing polynomial spline of degree 2m\u22121. The parameter \u03bb controls the tradeoff between the \u201croughness\u201d of the solution, as measured by\n$$\\int\\limits_0^1 {[f^{(m)} (u)]^2 du}$$\n, and the infidelity to the data as measured by\n$$\\frac{1}{n}\\sum\\limits_{j = 1}^n {(f(t_j ) - y_j )^2 }$$\n, and so governs the average square errorR(\u03bb; g)=R(\u03bb) defined by\n$$R(\\lambda ) = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum\\limits_{j = 1}^n {(g_{n,\\lambda } (t_j ) - g(t_j ))^2 }$$\n. We provide an estimate\n$$\\hat \\lambda$$\n, called the generalized cross-validation estimate, for the minimizer ofR(\u03bb). The estimate\n$$\\hat \\lambda$$\n is the minimizer ofV(\u03bb) defined by\n$$V(\\lambda ) = \\frac{1}{n}\\parallel (I - A(\\lambda ))y\\parallel ^2 /\\left[ {\\frac{1}{n}{\\text{Trace(}}I - A(\\lambda ))} \\right]^2$$\n, wherey=(y1, ...,yn)t andA(\u03bb) is then\u00d7n matrix satisfying(gn, \u03bb (t1), ...,gn, \u03bb (tn))t=A (\u03bb) y. We prove that there exist a sequence of minimizers\n$$\\tilde \\lambda = \\tilde \\lambda (n)$$\n ofEV(\u03bb), such that as the (regular) mesh{ti}i=1n becomes finer,\n$$\\mathop {\\lim }\\limits_{n \\to \\infty } ER(\\tilde \\lambda )/\\mathop {\\min }\\limits_\\lambda ER(\\lambda ) \\downarrow 1$$\n. A Monte Carlo experiment with several smoothg's was tried withm=2,n=50 and several values of \u03c32, and typical values of\n$$R(\\hat \\lambda )/\\mathop {\\min }\\limits_\\lambda R(\\lambda )$$\n were found to be in the range 1.01\u20131.4. The derivativeg\u2032 ofg can be estimated by\n$$g'_{n,\\hat \\lambda } (t)$$\n. In the Monte Carlo examples tried, the minimizer of\n$$R_D (\\lambda ) = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum\\limits_{j = 1}^n {(g'_{n,\\lambda } (t_j ) - } g'(t_j ))$$\n tended to be close to the minimizer ofR(\u03bb), so that\n$$\\hat \\lambda$$\n was also a good value of the smoothing parameter for estimating the derivative."

They have therefore not been available for application to Bayesian model determination, where the dimensionality of the parameter vector is typically not fixed. This paper proposes a new framework for the construction of reversible Markov chain samplers that jump between parameter subspaces of differing dimensionality, which is flexible and entirely constructive. It should therefore have wide applicability in model determination problems. The methodology is illustrated with applications to multiple change-point analysis in one and two dimensions, and to a Bayesian comparison of binomial experiments."

We are given a fixed system of n sites, labelled by the first n positive integers, and an associated vector x of observations, Xi, . . ., Xn, which, in turn, is presumed to be a realization of a vector X of (dependent) random variables, Xi, . . ., X.. In practice, the sites may represent points or regions in space and the random variables may be either continuous or discrete. The main statistical objectives are the following: firstly, to provide a means of using the available concomitant information, particularly the configuration of the sites, to attach a plausible probability distribution to the random vector X; secondly, to estimate any unknown parameters in the distribution from the realization x; thirdly, where possible, to quantify the extent of disagreement between hypothesis and observation."

Closed-form least-squares solutions are given to the overconstrained 2D-2D and 3D-3D pose estimation problems. A globally convergent iterative technique is given for the 2D-perspective-projection-3D pose estimation problem. A simplified linear solution and a robust solution to the 2D-perspective-projection-2D-perspective-projection pose-estimation problem are also given. Simulation experiments consisting of millions of trials with varying numbers of pairs of corresponding points and varying signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) with either Gaussian or uniform noise provide data suggesting that accurate inference of rotation and translation with noisy data may require corresponding point data sets with hundreds of corresponding point pairs when the SNR is less than 40 dB. The experimental results also show that the robust technique can suppress the blunder data which come from outliers or mismatched points. >"

The principle permits estimation of the number of the parameters in statistical models in addition to their values and even of the way the parameters appear in the models; i.e., of the model structures. The principle rests on a new way to interpret and construct a universal prior distribution for the integers, which makes sense even when the parameter is an individual object. Truncated realvalued parameters are converted to integers by dividing them by their precision, and their prior is determined from the universal prior for the integers by optimizing the precision. 1. Introduction. In this paper we study estimation based upon the principle of minimizing the total number of binary digits required to rewrite the observed data, when each observation is given with some precision. Instead of attempting at an absolutely shortest description, which would be futile, we look for the optimum relative to a class of parametrically given distributions. This Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle, which we introduced in a less comprehensive form in [25], turns out to degenerate to the more familiar Maximum Likelihood (ML) principle in case the number of parameters in the models is fixed, so that the description length of the parameters themselves can be ignored. In another extreme case, where the parameters determine the data, it similarly degenerates to Jaynes's principle of maximum entropy, [14]. But the main power of the new criterion is that it permits estimates of the entire model, its parameters, their number, and even the way the parameters appear in the model; i.e., the model structure. Hence, there will be no need to supplement the estimated parameters with a separate hypothesis test to decide whether a model is adequately parameterized or, perhaps, over parameterized."

The recognition network consists of three levels?a layer of AND gates, a set of linear summing networks in parallel, and a maximum selection circuit. Formulas for weights or recognition parameters are also derived, as logarithms of ratios of conditional probabilities. These formulas lead to a straightforward procedure of estimating weights from sample characters, which are then used in subsequent recognition. Simulation of the recognition method is performed on a digital computer. The program consists of two main operations-estimation of parameters from sample characters, and recognition using these estimated values. The experimental results indicate that the effect of neighbor dependence upon recognition performance is significant. On the basis of a rather small sample of 50 sets of hand-printed alphanumeric characters, the recognition performance of the nearest-neighbor method compares favorably with other recognition schemes."

The approach operates by examining all hypotheses about pairings between sensed data and object surfaces and efficiently discarding inconsistent ones by using local constraints on: distances between faces, angles between face normals, and angles (relative to the surface normals) of vectors between sensed points. The method described here is an extension of a method for recognition and localization of nonoverlapping parts previously described in [18] and [15]."

Roughly, a random field with denumerable state space S is described by a probability measure \u03bc on the space \u03a9 = S T of all configurations of values from S on the generalized time set T. In this chapter we discuss certain extensions of Markov chains, called Markov fields which have been important objects of study in the recent development of probability theory. Only some of the highlights of this rich theory will be covered; we concentrate especially on the case T = \u2124 = the integers, where the connections with classical Markov chain theory are deepest."

For certain values of the coefficients, some processes will have a single nontrivial convergence point regardless of the initial labeling. For other choices of the coefficients, there can be more than one possible convergence point, and different solutions can be obtained for different initial labelings. In the probabilistic approach where the coefficients are predefined in terms of joint probabilities, there are always two nontrivial convergence points for all possible coefficients. The results are also compared to the Bayesian analysis that can be obtained in this simple case of two nodes. Since certain selections of coefficients can give unacceptable results even in this simple case, it can be expected that the proper selection of coefficients will be much more important in the general case involving larger numbers of nodes and labels."

This distinction is made primarily on the basis of the difficulty of solving these two types of nonlinear problems. The first type is the less difficult of the two, and in this, Part I of the paper, it is shown how it is solved by the gradient projection method. It should be noted that since a linear objective function is a special case of a nonlinear objective function, the gradient projection method will also solve a linear programming problem. In Part II of the paper [16], the extension of the gradient projection method to the more difficult problem of nonlinear constraints and equations will be described. The basic paper on linear programming is the paper by Dantzig [5] in which the simplex method for solving the linear programming problem is presented. The nonlinear programming problem is formulated and a necessary and sufficient condition for a constrained maximum is given in terms of an equivalent saddle value problem in the paper by Kuhn and Tucker [10]. Further developments motivated by this paper, including a computational procedure, have been published recently [1]. The gradient projection method was originally presented to the American Mathematical Society"

By interpreting an ensemble of attributed graphs as the outcomes of a random graph, we can use its lower order distribution to characterize the ensemble. To reflect the variability of a random graph, Shannon's entropy measure is used. To synthesize an ensemble of attributed graphs into the distribution of a random graph (or a set of distributions), we propose a distance measure between random graphs based on the minimum change of entropy before and after their merging. When the ensemble contains more than one class of pattern graphs, the synthesis process yields distributions corresponding to various classes. This process corresponds to unsupervised learning in pattern classification. Using the maximum likelihood rule and the probability computed for the pattern graph, based on its matching with the random graph distributions of different classes, we can classify the pattern graph to a class."

(ii) does the sequence of parameter estimates generated by EM converge? Several convergence results are obtained under conditions that are applicable to many practical situations. Two useful special cases are: (a) if the unobserved complete-data specification can be described by a curved exponential family with compact parameter space, all the limit points of any EM sequence are stationary points of the likelihood function; (b) if the likelihood function is unimodal and a certain differentiability condition is satisfied, then any EM sequence converges to the unique maximum likelihood estimate. A list of key properties of the algorithm is included."

The displays contained two side-by-side fields with different statistical, topological or heuristic properties. Discrimination was defined as that spontaneous visual process which gives the immediate impression of two distinct fields. The condition for such discrimination was found to be based primarily on clusters or lines formed by proximate points of uniform brightness. A similar rule of connectivity with hue replacing brightness was obtained by using varicolored dots of equal subjective brightness. The limitations in discriminating complex line structures were also investigated."

We discuss a couple of loss functions which do take context into account and when combined with the joint prior probability constraint create a decision problem requiring a combinatorial state space search.

                "text": "Hopfield-type networks convert a combinatorial optimization to a constrained real optimization and solve the latter using the penalty method. There is a dilemma with such networks: when tuned to produce good-quality solutions, they can fail to converge to valid solutions; and when tuned to converge, they tend to give low-quality solutions. This paper proposes a new method, called the augmented Lagrange-Hopfield (ALH) method, to improve Hopfield-type neural networks in both the convergence and the solution quality in solving combinatorial optimization. It uses the augmented Lagrange method, which combines both the Lagrange and the penalty methods, to effectively solve the dilemma. Experimental results on the travelling salesman problem (TSP) show superiority of the ALH method over the existing Hopfield-type neural networks in the convergence and solution quality. For the ten-city TSPs, ALH finds the known optimal tour with 100% success rate, as the result of 1000 runs with different random initializations. For larger size problems, it also finds remarkably better solutions than the compared methods while always converging to valid tours."

The classical maximum likelihood estimation procedure is reviewed and a new estimate minimum information theoretical criterion (AIC) estimate (MAICE) which is designed for the purpose of statistical identification is introduced. When there are several competing models the MAICE is defined by the model and the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters which give the minimum of AIC defined by AIC = (-2)log-(maximum likelihood) + 2(number of independently adjusted parameters within the model). MAICE provides a versatile procedure for statistical model identification which is free from the ambiguities inherent in the application of conventional hypothesis testing procedure. The practical utility of MAICE in time series analysis is demonstrated with some numerical examples."

The effective number of parameters is adjusted automatically to match the complexity of the problem. The solution is expressed as a linear combination of supporting patterns. These are the subset of training patterns that are closest to the decision boundary. Bounds on the generalization performance based on the leave-one-out method and the VC-dimension are given.

This deterministic system has collective properties in very close correspondence with the earlier stochastic model based on McCulloch - Pitts neurons. The content- addressable memory and other emergent collective properties of the original model also are present in the graded response model. The idea that such collective properties are used in biological systems is given added credence by the continued presence of such properties for more nearly biological \"neurons.\" Collective analog electrical circuits of the kind described will certainly function. The collective states of the two models have a simple correspondence. The original model will continue to be useful for simulations, because its connection to graded response systems is established. Equations that include the effect of action potentials in the graded response system are also developed."

Unlike many generalizations of the univariate median, repeated median estimates maintain the high 50% breakdown value and can resist the effects of outliers even when they comprise nearly half of the data. Because they are calculated directly, not iteratively, repeated median procedures can be used as starting values for iterative robust estimation methods. For bivariate linear regression with symmetric errors, repeated median estimates are unbiased and Fisher consistent, and their efficiency under Gaussian sampling can be comparable to the efficiency of the univariate median.

The output of a given node is calculated using probabilities, rather than threshold or sigmoid function. The paper describes their basic architecture, their processing mechanism, the principles of their operation, and their learning mechanism. The main characteristics of the Boltzmann machine is the fact that, when subjected to reducing noise, it has a final probability of resting in given states which is in direct proportion to Hopfield's calculation of the energy of those states. The key problem is to control the values of such energies by changing the weights."

We employ elasticity theory to construct differential equations that model the behavior of non-rigid curves, surfaces, and solids as a function of time. Elastically deformable models are active: they respond in a natural way to applied forces, constraints, ambient media, and impenetrable obstacles. The models are fundamentally dynamic and realistic animation is created by numerically solving their underlying differential equations. Thus, the description of shape and the description of motion are unified."

The MAP configuration minimizes the energy of a posterior (Gibbs) distribution. When the label set is discrete, the minimization is combinatorial. This paper proposes to use the continuous relaxation labeling (RL) method for the minimization. The RL converts the original NP complete problem into one of polynomial complexity. Annealing may be combined into the RL process to improve the quality (globalness) of RL solutions. Performance comparison among four different RL algorithms is given."

The basic idea is not only to take into account {\\em how much} of an object can be seen in the image, but also {\\em what parts} of it are jointly present. I show that this additional information can improve the specificity (i.e., reduce the probability of false positive matches) of a recognition algorithm. I demonstrate formally that most commonly used quality of match measures employed by recognition algorithms are based on an independence assumption. Using the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle and a simple scene-description language as a guide, I show that this independence assumption is not satisfied for common scenes, and propose several important higher-order statistical properties of matches that approximate some aspects of these statistical dependencies. I have implemented a recognition system that takes advantage of this additional statistical information and demonstrate its efficacy in comparisons with a standard recognition system based on bounded error matching. We also observe that the existing use of grouping and segmentation methods has significant effects on the performance of recognition systems that are similar to those resulting from the use of higher-order statistical information. Our analysis provides a statistical framework in which to understand the effects of grouping and segmentation on recognition and suggests ways to take better advantage of such information."
