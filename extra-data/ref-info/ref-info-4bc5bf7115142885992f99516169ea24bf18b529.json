The approach is based on computational-geometry algorithms for off-line enumeration of maximal white rectangles and on-line rectangle unification. These support a fast, simple, and general heuristic for geometric layout segmentation, in which white space is covered greedily by rectangles until all text blocks are isolated. Design of the heuristic can be substantially automated by an analysis of the empirical statistical distribution of properties of covering rectangles: for example, the stopping rule can be chosen by Rosenblatt\u2019s perceptron training algorithm. Experimental trials show good behavior on the large and useful class of textual Manhattan layouts. On complex layouts from English-language technical journals of many publishers, the method finds good segmentations in a uniform and nearly parameter-free manner. On a variety of non-Latin texts, some with vertical text lines, the method finds good segmentations without prior knowledge of page and text-line orientation."

Changing the target language may involve simultaneous changes in symbol sets, typefaces, sizes of text, page layouts, linguistic contexts, and imaging defects. The strategy has been to isolate the effects of these sources of variation within separate, independent engineering subsystems. In this way, it has been possible to construct, with a minimum of manual effort, classifiers for arbitrary combinations of symbols, typefaces, sizes, and imaging defects. An attempt has been made to rid the algorithms of all language-specific rules, relying instead on automatic learning from examples and generalized table-driven methods. For some tasks it has been feasible to avoid language dependency altogether. Linguistic context can be exploited through data-directed filtering algorithms in a uniform and modular manner, so that preexisting tools developed by computational linguistics can readily be applied. These principles are illustrated by trials on English, Swedish, Tibetan, and special technical texts. >"

The resulting strokes and other shapes are mapped, using a shape-clustering approach, into binary features which are then fed into a statistical Bayesian classifier. Large-scale trials have shown better than 97 percent top choice correct performance on mixtures of six dissimilar fonts, and over 99 percent on most single fonts, over a range of point sizes.

The structure of the background (white space) is analyzed, assisted by an enumeration of all maximal white rectangles. For this enumeration, the most computationally expensive step, an algorithm has been developed that, aside from a sort, achieves an expected runtime linear in the number of black connected components. The crucial engineering decision is the specification of a partial order on white rectangles to express domain-specific knowledge of preferred shapes and sizes. This order determines a sequence of partial covers of the background, and thus, a sequence of nested page segmentations. In experimental trials on Manhattan layouts, good segmentations often occur early in this sequence, using a simple and uniform shape-direction rule. This is a global-to-local strategy, which for some tasks is superior to strategies currently emphasized in the literature, including bottom-up and top-down.<<ETX>>"
