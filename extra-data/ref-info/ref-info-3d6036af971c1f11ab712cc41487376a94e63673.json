We show that our models achieve an improvement in LP/LR, PPL and/or WER over the reported baseline results using the SLM on the UPenn Treebank and Wall Street Journal (WSJ) corpora, respectively. Analysis of parsing performance shows correlation between the quality of the parser (as measured by precision/recall) and the language model performance (PPL and WER). A remarkable fact is that the enriched SLM outperforms the baseline 3-gram model in terms of WER by 10% when used in isolation as a second pass (N-best re-scoring) language model."

This is intrinsically difficult because of the curse of dimensionality: a word sequence on which the model will be tested is likely to be different from all the word sequences seen during training. Traditional but very successful approaches based on n-grams obtain generalization by concatenating very short overlapping sequences seen in the training set. We propose to fight the curse of dimensionality by learning a distributed representation for words which allows each training sentence to inform the model about an exponential number of semantically neighboring sentences. The model learns simultaneously (1) a distributed representation for each word along with (2) the probability function for word sequences, expressed in terms of these representations. Generalization is obtained because a sequence of words that has never been seen before gets high probability if it is made of words that are similar (in the sense of having a nearby representation) to words forming an already seen sentence. Training such large models (with millions of parameters) within a reasonable time is itself a significant challenge. We report on experiments using neural networks for the probability function, showing on two text corpora that the proposed approach significantly improves on state-of-the-art n-gram models, and that the proposed approach allows to take advantage of longer contexts."

Almost all state.. o. f-the-art systems use statistical n-gram language models estimated on text corpora. One principle problem with such language models is the fact that many of the n-grams are never observed even in very large training corpora, and therefore it is common to back-off to a lower-order model. In this paper we propose to address this problem by carrying out the estimation task in a continuous space, enabling a smooth interpolation of the probabilities. A neural network is used to learn the projection of the words onto a continuous space and to estimate the n-gram probabilities. The connectionist language model is being evaluated on the DARPA HUB5 conversational telephone speech recognition task and preliminary results show consistent improvements in both perplexity and word error rate."

In this paper, we describe a method for statistical modeling based on maximum entropy. We present a maximum-likelihood approach for automatically constructing maximum entropy models and describe how to implement this approach efficiently, using as examples several problems in natural language processing."
