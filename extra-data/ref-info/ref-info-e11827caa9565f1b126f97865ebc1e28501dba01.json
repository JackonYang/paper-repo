                "text": "In the central nervous system the visual pathway from retina to striate cortex provides an opportunity to observe and compare single unit responses at several distinct levels. Patterns of light stimuli most effective in influencing units at one level may no longer be the most effective at the next. From differences in responses at successive stages in the pathway one may hope to gain some understanding of the part each stage plays in visual perception. By shining small spots of light on the light-adapted cat retina Kuffler (1953) showed that ganglion cells have concentric receptive fields, with an 'on' centre and an 'off ' periphery, or vice versa. The 'on' and 'off' areas within a receptive field were found to be mutually antagonistic, and a spot restricted to the centre of the field was more effective than one covering the whole receptive field (Barlow, FitzHugh & Kuffler, 1957). In the freely moving lightadapted cat it was found that the great majority of cortical cells studied gave little or no response to light stimuli covering most of the animal's visual field, whereas small spots shone in a restricted retinal region often evoked brisk responses (Hubel, 1959). A moving spot of light often produced stronger responses than a stationary one, and sometimes a moving spot gave more activation for one direction than for the opposite. The present investigation, made in acute preparations, includes a study of receptive fields of cells in the cat's striate cortex. Receptive fields of the cells considered in this paper were divided into separate excitatory and inhibitory ('on' and 'off') areas. In this respect they resembled retinal ganglion-cell receptive fields. However, the shape and arrangement of excitatory and inhibitory areas differed strikingly from the concentric pattern found in retinal ganglion cells. An attempt was made to correlate responses to moving stimuli"

It would be astonishing if such a structure did not profoundly modify the response patterns of fibres coming into it. In the cat's visual cortex, the receptive field arrangements of single cells suggest that there is indeed a degree of complexity far exceeding anything yet seen at lower levels in the visual system. In a previous paper we described receptive fields of single cortical cells, observing responses to spots of light shone on one or both retinas (Hubel & Wiesel, 1959). In the present work this method is used to examine receptive fields of a more complex type (Part I) and to make additional observations on binocular interaction (Part II). This approach is necessary in order to understand the behaviour of individual cells, but it fails to deal with the problem of the relationship of one cell to its neighbours. In the past, the technique of recording evoked slow waves has been used with great success in studies of functional anatomy. It was employed by Talbot & Marshall (1941) and by Thompson, Woolsey & Talbot (1950) for mapping out the visual cortex in the rabbit, cat, and monkey. Daniel & Whitteiidge (1959) have recently extended this work in the primate. Most of our present knowledge of retinotopic projections, binocular overlap, and the second visual area is based on these investigations. Yet the method of evoked potentials is valuable mainly for detecting behaviour common to large populations of neighbouring cells; it cannot differentiate functionally between areas of cortex smaller than about 1 mm2. To overcome this difficulty a method has in recent years been developed for studying cells separately or in small groups during long micro-electrode penetrations through nervous tissue. Responses are correlated with cell location by reconstructing the electrode tracks from histological material. These techniques have been applied to"

These methods eliminate anaesthetics, paralysing drugs, brain-stem lesions, and other acute experimental procedures. They make it possible to record electrical events in the higher central nervous system with the animal in a normal state, and to correlate these electrical events with such variables as waking state, attention, learning, and motor activity. The present paper describes a method for unit recording from the cortex of unanaesthetized, unrestrained cats, and presents some observations from the striate cortex. The objectives have been (1) to observe maintained unit activity under various conditions such as sleep and wakefulness, and (2) to find for each unit the natural stimuli which most effectively influence firing. Of 400 units observed, some 200 are presented here because of their common characteristics. Since there is reason to believe that the remainiing 200 units were afferent fibres from the lateral geniculate nucleus, these will be described in a separate paper. A preliminary account of some of this work has been given elsewhere (Hubel, 1958)."

Our method is to find what sort of stimulus causes the largest activity in one nerve fiber and then what is the exciting aspect of that stimulus such that variations in everything else cause little change in the response. It has been known for the past 20 years that each fiber is connected not to a few rods and cones in the retina but to very many over a fair area. Our results show that for the most part within that area, it is not the light intensity itself but rather the pattern of local variation of intensity that is the exciting factor. There are four types of fibers, each type concerned with a different sort of pattern. Each type is uniformly distributed over the whole retina of the frog. Thus, there are four distinct parallel distributed channels whereby the frog's eye informs his brain about the visual image in terms of local pattern independent of average illumination. We describe the patterns and show the functional and anatomical separation of the channels. This work has been done on the frog, and our interpretation applies only to the frog."

The answer to this old chestnut is certainly \"yes\": Computers have been made to play chess and checkers, to prove theorems, to solve intricate problems of strategy. Yet the intelligence implied by such activities has an elusive, unnatural quality. It is not based on any orderly development of cognitive skills. In particular, the machines are not well equipped to select from their environment the things, or the relations, they are going to think about. In this they are sharply distinguished from intelligent living organisms. Every child learns to analyze speech into meaningful patterns long before he can prove any propositions. Computers can find proofs, but they cannot understand the simplest spoken instructions. Even the earliest computers could do arithmetic superbly, but only very recently have they begun to read the written digits that a child recognizes before he learns to add them. Understanding speech and reading print are examples of a basic intellectual skill that can variously be called cognition, abstraction or perception; perhaps the best general termfor it is patternrecognition. Except for their inability to recognize patterns, machines (or, more accurately, the programs that tell machines what to do) have now met most of the classic criteria of intelligence that skeptics have proposed. They can outperform their designers: The checker-playing program devised by Arthur L. Samuel of International Business Machines Corporation (1959a) usually beats him. They are original: The \"Logic Theorist,\" a creation of a group from the Carnegie Institute of Technology and the RAND Corporation [Newell, Simon, and Shaw (1956a, 19576)] has found proofs for many of the theorems in Principia Mathematica, the"

The method may be applied to any form of spatial pattern, but in the present instance, patterns consisting of line figures are considered. The pattern is presented to a flying-spot scanner connected to a digital computer. The shape of the pattern is analysed and a statement is prepared describing the basic features of the pattern. The pattern is then recognized by comparing this statement with a number of others already stored in the computer which relate to named patterns. Patterns are recognized independently of the angle at which they are presented to the scanner, and may be of any size provided that limits imposed by the resolution of the scanner are not exceeded. The average time to recognize a character is 60 seconds with the system programmed on a medium-speed computer. Special-purpose equipment built to perform certain of the stages of the process, together with the use of higher-speed computers now envisaged, will reduce this time by at least a thousandfold. If a new pattern is presented to the machine it will indicate its inability to recognize the pattern, but by giving the machine the name of the pattern, it may become one of the standard patterns which it can subsequently recognize. All the patterns recognized by the machine are hand-drawn and consist of such symbols as the capital letters of the alphabet and numerals, although the system is in no way limited to any special set of characters. Using exactly the same method but with an increase in the degree of complexity, it will be possible for machines to read handwriting. Special allowances are made for imperfections in the patterns, including breaks and general ill-definition. Where there is some confusion and an unknown pattern resembles two or more of the standard patterns, the relative degrees of similarity of the unknown to each of these standard patterns is printed out by the machine."

The program starts not only without any knowledge of specific patterns to be input, but also without any operators for processing inputs. Operators are generated and refined by the program itself as a function of the problem space and of its own successes and failures in dealing with the problem space. Not only does the program learn information about different patterns, it also learns or constructs, in part at least, a secondary code appropriate for the analysis of the particular set of patterns input to it."

This program consists of two subroutines: (1) to search for logic circuits having certain constraints on hardware design, and (2) to evaluate these logics in terms of their discriminating ability over samples of the character set they are expected to recognize. An executive routine is used to apply these subroutines to select a complete logic with a given performance and complexity. This logic consists of 39 to 96 AND gates connected to a shift register and a table look-up or resistance network comparison system. \n \nThe methods were applied to the design of recognitionl ogics for the 52 upper and lower case characters of IBM Electric Modern Pica type font and lower case Cyrillic characters scanned from Russian text. In both cases when the logics were tested on data different from that used to design the logics, the substitution rate was about one error per thousand. A single logic was designed to read two different Cyrillic fonts. For this design, an error rate of one error per hundred characters was observed. \n \nSeveral experiments are reported ona number of logics designed for typewritten data, and single- and two-font Cyrillic data. The performances of different recognitionsy stems are compared as a function of the complexity of the recognition logics."
