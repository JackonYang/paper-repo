In the previous part we developed the basic form of the model and showed how it accounts for several of the fundamental phenomena of work perception. In this part, we first present a number of new experiments and show how the model accounts for these experiments. Then we propose a number of extensions of the model to such cases as spoken input, pronunciation tasks, and words embedded in sentential context. Finally, we discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the model, pointing out further possible extensions of the model to account for aspects of word perception currently ignored. The new experiments all revolve around what we call the 'context enhancement effect.' These experiments are designed to assess the roles of direct and indirect evidence concerning the identity of a letter in an input string."

Subjects viewed brief, masked presentations of words and pronounceable pseudowords differing in letter cluster frequency. Identification of both display types was compared to control single letters. Perceptual accuracy was indexed by probe forced-choice responses and full verbal reports of the displays. Evidence that familiarity of whole-word units facilitated encoding was mixed but, on balance, favorable. Evidence that familiarity of letter-cluster units facilitated encoding was completely absent. This negative finding is surprising in view of the fact that we did obtain a large advantage of letters in pseudo-words as well as words over single letters. The discussion section considers an alternative to the view that perceivers use detectors for familiar letter-cluster units in the process of forming representations of pronounceable, orthographically regular letter strings."

The current research was directed at discovering the psychologically relevant properties of this structure. Two fundamental descriptions were independently varied in the construction of six-letter nonword strings. A probabilistic description based on the frequency of occurrence of letters in each position was factorially combined with a rule-governed description defined in terms of graphemic and phonological constraints. College sophomores and sixth-grade readers were asked to indicate whether or not a predesignated target letter was present in these strings. For both groups of readers, orthographic regularity and summed positional frequency were found to have only a small facilitative effect on reaction time (RT). In contrast, RTs to say \"no\" increased dramatically with increases in the number of letters in the catch string that were physically similar to the target letter. In another experiment, the letter string was presented for a short duration, followed immediately by masking stimulus and then the target letter. College students indicated whether or not the target was present in the test string. Accuracy of performance was critically dependent on the orthographic regularity and summed positional frequencies of the letters in the test string. No effect of letter similarity was observed. The large differences that were observed between these two tasks were accounted for in terms of the stages of processing that are critical for performance in the tasks."

Stimuli were words, orthographically regular but unfamiliar pseudowords, and orthographically irregular nonsense strings. In the first two experiments, subjects knew that several different kinds of stimuli would occur in each block of trials and that one kind would occur much more often than the others. No matter which stimulus subjects expected to see most often, accuracy on words and pseudowords differed little, and both were identified considerably better than nonsense. In the third and fourth experiments, subjects were led to believe that only on stimulus type would occur but were surreptitiously shown another type on a small number of trials. Words were again identified more accurately than nonsense, and the size of the effect was independent of expectations. However, when either words or nonsense strings were expected exclusively, pseudoword accuracy did not differ from nonsense accuracy. Only when subjects knew that pseudowords would occur did they identify pseudowords more accurately than nonsense. This dissociation between word and pseudoword identification indicates the operation of two independent encoding mechanisms during tachistoscopic recognition, a stimulus-specific or logogenlike system sensitive to particular familiar strings and an orthographic mechanism sensitive to generally applicable constraints on letter sequencing. The stimulus-specific mechanism appears to be utilized automatically, but use of the orthographic mechanism is under strategic control. As shown in the first two experiments, however, rather extraordinary measures were required to demonstrate the flexibility of the orthographic processes used in this task."

The model is a \"sophisticated guessing\" model which takes explicit account of the geometry of the characters which make up the words or letter strings. Explicit attempts are made to account for word frequency effects, effects due to letter transition probabilities, and effects due to physical similarity of character strings to one another. A word recognition experiment using the set of three-letter words is reported, and the model is used to make quantitative predictions of these results as well as to give a qualitative account for a number of results in the literature. Finally, it is shown that under certain simplifying assumptions this sophisticated guessing model is isomorphic with the \"criterion bias\" model as developed in 1967 by Broadbent. The process whereby words are recognized has long fascinated experimental psy-Several related findings have commanded the most attention. For example, more letters per unit time may be apprehended when a word is presented than when a string of unrelated letters is presented (Huey, 1908). A letter string formed by taking a word and either deleting or replacing one or two letters is often clearly perceived as that word (Pillsbury, 1897). Other things being equal, words which occur frequently in the language are more easily perceived than those which occur less frequently (Goldia-The more the statistics of letter strings approximate those of words, the better the perception of the letter strings (cf. Miller, Bruner, & Postman , 1954). The more predictable a word is within a sentence, the more easily it is Most explanations of these phenomena suggest that they all result from the fact that the subject combines internally provided information about language with externally provided information from the sensory system (cf. Morton, 1969, 1970). By this argument, words are easier to see than nonwords because we can apply our knowledge of the vocabulary of the language. Knowledge of relative frequencies of words in the language allows us to read high-frequency words more readily. Knowledge of syntactic and semantic relations allows us to read words more easily in the context of 99"

To account for these results a model was proposed in which an input string is first parsed into syllablelike units, which are then recorded into speech. It was demonstrated that the perceptual accuracy for a string is correlated with the number of recoding steps needed to convert that string into speech. Experiment 2 further demonstrated that this recoding process can predict perceptibility differences among strings with varying numbers of phonotactic violations, and Experiment 3 assessed some of the specific assumptions of the recoding process."

This illusory effect, called phonemic restoration (PhR), causes the physically absent phoneme to seem as real as the speech sounds which are present. The extraneous sound seems to occur along with other phonemes without interfering with their clarity. But if a silent gap (rather than an extraneous sound) replaces the same phoneme, the interruption in the sentence is more readily localized in its true position and PhRs occours less frequently. Quantitative measures were taken both of the incidence of PhRs and of the direction and extent of temporal mislocalizations of interruptions for several related stimuli under a variety of experimental conditions. The results were connected with other auditory illusions and temporal confusions reported in the literature, and suggestions were made concerning mechanisms employed normally for verbal organization."

A model called the cascade model is presented and it is shown to be compatible with the general form of the relation between time and accuracy in speed-accuracy trade-off experiments. In the model , experimentlLlmanipulations may have either or both of two effects on a processing level: They may alter the rate of response or the asymptotic quality pf the output. The effects of such manipulations on the output of a system of proessesare described. The model is then used to reexamine, the subtraction and additive factors methods for analyzing the composition of systems of processes. The examination of the additive factors method yields particularly interesting results. Among them is the finding that factors that affect the rates of two different processes would be expected to have additive effects on reaction times under the cascade model, whereas factors that both affect the rate of the same process would tend to interact, just as in the case in which the manipulations affect the durations of discrete stages. On the other hand, factors that affect asymptotic output tend to interact whether they affect the same or different processes. In light of this observation, the conclusions drawn from several studies about the locus of perceptual and attentional effects on processing are reexamined. Finally, an outline is presented of a new method for analyzing processes in cascade. The method extends the additive factors method to an analysis of the parameters of the function relating response time and accuracy."

Mispronunciations were produced by changing one consonant sound in a three-syllable word by one, two, or four distinctive features (e.g., busily to \u201cpizily,\u201d \u201cvisily,\u201d or \u201csizily\u201d). Mispronunciations involving a single feature change were seldom detected, while two and four feature changes were readily detected. The syllable in which a mispronunciation occurred did not affect the probability of detecting a mispronunciation. However, reaction times to mispronounced words were at least a third of a second slower when they occurred in the-first syllable of the word. The results were taken to support the notion that words are identified by their distinctive features."

Four-letter strings of random consonants were presented in varying display locations relative to the fixation point with the observers\u2019 eye movements monitored to limit them to a single fixation for each display. Salient properties of the serial position curves include an overall central-peripheral gradient, higher performance at the ends than the interior of letter strings regardless of absolute location, and left-right asymmetry in the visual field, all of these being largely independent of viewing time. Errors reflecting loss of positional information are prominent even at extended viewing times, are more nearly symmetrical in the left and right visual fields than other types of errors, and, in contrast to item errors, occur less frequently in letter sequences that have high frequencies in English. Further, transposition errors exhibit a pronounced peripheral-to-central drift, possibly reflecting gradients of positional uncertainty. Such gradients may be implicated in the peripheral-central asymmetry of the lateral interference effects exerted by other letters on a target letter in a nonfoveal location."

The fuillctional unit of cognitive coding is suggested to be an adaptive resonance, or amplification and ,prolongation of neural activity, that occurs when afferent data and efferent expectancies reach consensus through a matching process. The resonant state embodies the perceptual event, or attentional focus, and its amplified and sustained activities are capable of driving slow changes of long-term memor:r\"' Mismatch between afferent data and efferent expectancies yields a global sulppression of activity and triggers a reset of short-term memory, as well as raJ~id parallel search and hypothesis testing for uncommitted cells. These mechanisms help to explain and predict, as manifestations of the unified theme of stable code development, positive and negative aftereffects, the McCollough effect, spatial frequency adaptation, monocular rivalry, binocular rivalry and hysteresis, pattern completion, and Gestalt switching; analgesia, partial reinforcement acquisition effect, conditioned reinforcers, underaroused versus overaroused depression; the contingent negative variation, P300, and pontoge]lliculo-occipital waves; olfactory coding, corticogeniculate feedback, matching of proprioceptive and terminal motor maps, and cerebral dominance. The psychophysiological mechanisms that unify these effects are inherently nonlinear and parallel and are inequivalent to the computer, probabilistic, and linear models currently in use."

When a familiar object is in an unusual orientation, the deciding factor in the choice of the canonical object-based frame may be the fact that relative to this frame the object has a familiar shape description. This may suggest that we first hypothesise an object-based frame and then test the resultant shape description for familiarity. However, it is possible to organise the interactions between units in a parallel network so that the pattern of activity in the network simultaneously converges on a representation of the shape and a representation of the object-based frame of reference. The connections in the network are determined by the constraints inherent in the image formation process."

                        "text": "The results of these experiments have been accounted for by the logogen model of Morton ( 1969 ). Our model is quite like the logogen model in various ways, as we pointed out in Part I, and it is clear that it would account for the facilitation and interference effects of appropriate and inappropriate context. As in the logogen model, we would simply imagine that a context would tend to prime the nodes for words consistent with it. Such words would tend to benefit from this priming. The interference with performance of words inconsistent with the context could be accounted for in various ways. One possibility is that the contextual inputs directly inhibit the nodes for words not consistent with the context. However direct inhibition may not be necessary to account for the effect, because our model provides two other possible sources of interference. Priming one set of words would result in relative inhibition of nodes for other words, owing to the lateral interference mechanism, provided the context was strong enough to drive the activations of nodes for contextually appropriate words above the interaction threshold. Furthermore the process of selecting a response takes into account the strengths of all of the logogens, and active logogens other than the correct one have the effect of reducing the proba' bility that the correct response will be chosen. Because we have considered performance in Reicher's (1969) forced-choice paradigm so extensively, it seems appropriate to comment on the effect of linguistic context on performance in this paradigm."
