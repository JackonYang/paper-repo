This paper deals with the problem of finding low rank realization matrices A. It is motivated by a minimization problem in multilayer perceptrons. The subject is approached by means of the Farkas lemma, which allows characterization of the sign matrices realizable with a given rank. Based on this result and on some other standard techniques of matrix algebra such as the cyclic Fourier transform, low rank realizations are obtained for sign matrices having certain nice combinatorial structures. Furthermore, the paper includes an elementary lower bound on the rank and a counting of realizable sign vectors."

This procedure takes a set of input/output pattern pairs and attempts to learn their functional relationship; it develops the necessary representational features during the course of learning. A series of computer simulation studies was carried out to assess the ability of these networks to accurately label sounds, to learn to recognize sounds without labels, and to learn feature representations of continuous speech. These studies demonstrated that the networks can learn to label presegmented test tokens with accuracies of up to 95%. Networks trained on segmented sounds using a strategy that requires no external labels were able to recognize and delineate sounds in continuous speech. These networks developed rich internal representations that included units which corresponded to such traditional distinctions as vowels and consonants, as well as units that were sensitive to novel and nonstandard features. Networks trained on a large corpus of unsegmented, continuous speech without labels also developed interesting feature representations, which may be useful in both segmentation and label learning. The results of these studies, while preliminary, demonstrate that backpropagation learning can be used with complex, natural data to identify a feature structure that can serve as the basis for both analysis and nontrivial pattern recognition."

Various transforms such as discrete Fourier, discrete cosine, Walsh-Hadamard, slant, Haar, discrete linear basis, Hadamard-Haar, rapid, lower triangular, generalized Haar, slant Haar and Karhunen-Loeve are defined and developed. Pertinent properties of these transforms such as power spectra, cyclic and dyadic convolution and correlation are outlined. Efficient algorithms for fast implementation of these transforms based on matrix partitioning or matrix factoring are presented. The application of these transforms in speech and image processing, spectral analysis, digital filtering (linear, nonlinear, optimal and suboptimal), nonlinear systems analysis, spectrography, digital holography, industrial testing, spectrometric imaging, feature selection, and patter recognition is presented. The utility and effectiveness of these transforms are evaluated in terms of some standard performance criteria such as computational complexity, variance distribution, mean-square error, correlated rms error, rate distortion, data compression, classification error, and digital hardware realization."

In this recognition system, each phoneme is characterized by a very simple 3-state Hidden Markov Model (HMM) which is trained on connected speech by a Viterbi algorithm. Each state has associated with it a continuous (Gaussian) or discrete probability density function (pdf). With the phonemic models so obtained, the recognition is then performed either directly at word level (by the reconstruction of reference words from the models of the constituting phonemes) or via a phonemic labelling. Good results are obtained as well with a German ten digit vocabulary (20 phonemes) as with a French 80 word vocabulary (36 phonemes)."
