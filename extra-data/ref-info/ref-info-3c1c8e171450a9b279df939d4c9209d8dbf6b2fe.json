Using the bag-of-words representation and the linear support vector machine, one can partly fulfill the goal, but the accuracy of linear classifiers is not high and the obtained features are not informative for users. We propose to combine item set mining and large margin classifiers to select features from the power set of all visual words. Our resulting classification rule is easier to browse and simpler to understand, because each feature has richer information. As a next step, each image is represented as a graph where nodes correspond to local image features and edges encode geometric relations between features. Combining graph mining and boosting, we can obtain a classification rule based on subgraph features that contain more information than the set features. We evaluate our algorithm in a web-retrieval ranking task where the goal is to reject outliers from a set of images returned for a keyword query. Furthermore, it is evaluated on the supervised classification tasks with the challenging VOC2005 data set. Our approach yields excellent accuracy in the unsupervised ranking task compared to a recently proposed probabilistic model and competitive results in the supervised classification task."

Our primary focus is the development of a learning-based approach to the problem that makes use of a sparse, part-based representation. A vocabulary of distinctive object parts is automatically constructed from a set of sample images of the object class of interest; images are then represented using parts from this vocabulary, together with spatial relations observed among the parts. Based on this representation, a learning algorithm is used to automatically learn to detect instances of the object class in new images. The approach can be applied to any object with distinguishable parts in a relatively fixed spatial configuration; it is evaluated here on difficult sets of real-world images containing side views of cars, and is seen to successfully detect objects in varying conditions amidst background clutter and mild occlusion. In evaluating object detection approaches, several important methodological issues arise that have not been satisfactorily addressed in the previous work. A secondary focus of this paper is to highlight these issues, and to develop rigorous evaluation standards for the object detection problem. A critical evaluation of our approach under the proposed standards is presented."

In particular, perceptual association rules, a novel extension of traditional association rules, are used to distill the frequent perceptual events in large image datasets in order to discover interesting patterns. The focus is on spatial associations although the method is equally applicable to associations within or between other dimensions; i.e., spectral, or in the case of video, temporal. A primary contribution is the derivation of image equivalents for the traditional association rule components, namely the items, the itemsets, and the rules. The proposed approach is modular, consisting of three steps that can be individually adapted to a particular application. First, the image dataset is labeled in a perceptually meaningful way using a visual thesaurus. Second, the firstand second-order associations are tabulated in a scalable data structure termed a spatial event cube. Finally, the higher-order associations and rules are determined using an adaptation of the Apriori algorithm. The proposed approach is applied to an aerial video dataset to demonstrate the kinds of knowledge perceptual association rules can help"

One of the largest repositories for such data is the World Wide Web (WWW). We present Cortina, a large-scale image retrieval system for the WWW. It handles over 3 million images to date. The system retrieves images based on visual features and collateral text. We show that a search process which consists of an initial query-by-keyword or query-by-image and followed by relevance feedback on the visual appearance of the results is possible for large-scale data sets. We also show that it is superior to the pure text retrieval commonly used in large-scale systems. Semantic relationships in the data are explored and exploited by data mining, and multiple feature spaces are included in the search process."

While categorization algorithms tend to agree in using local descriptors, they differ in the choice of the classifier, with some using generative models and others discriminative approaches. This paper presents a method for object category detection which integrates a generative model with a discriminative classifier. For each object category, we generate an appearance codebook, which becomes a common vocabulary for the generative and discriminative methods. Given a query image, the generative part of the algorithm finds a set of hypotheses and estimates their support in location and scale. Then, the discriminative part verifies each hypothesis on the same codebook activations. The new algorithm exploits the strengths of both original methods, minimizing their weaknesses. Experiments on several databases show that our new approach performs better than its building blocks taken separately. Moreover, experiments on two challenging multi-scale databases show that our new algorithm outperforms previously reported results"

We present a complete framework that starts with the extraction of various local regions of either discontinuity or homogeneity. A variety of local descriptors can be applied to form a set of feature vectors for each local region. Boosting is used to learn a subset of such feature vectors (weak hypotheses) and to combine them into one final hypothesis for each visual category. This combination of individual extractors and descriptors leads to recognition rates that are superior to other approaches which use only one specific extractor/descriptor setting. To explore the limitation of our system, we had to set up new, highly complex image databases that show the objects of interest at varying scales and poses, in cluttered background, and under considerable occlusion. We obtain classification results up to 81 percent ROC-equal error rate on the most complex of our databases. Our approach outperforms all comparable solutions on common databases."

The user supplies a query object by selecting a region of a query image, and the system returns a ranked list of images that contain the same object, retrieved from a large corpus. We demonstrate the scalability and performance of our system on a dataset of over 1 million images crawled from the photo-sharing site, Flickr [3], using Oxford landmarks as queries. Building an image-feature vocabulary is a major time and performance bottleneck, due to the size of our dataset. To address this problem we compare different scalable methods for building a vocabulary and introduce a novel quantization method based on randomized trees which we show outperforms the current state-of-the-art on an extensive ground-truth. Our experiments show that the quantization has a major effect on retrieval quality. To further improve query performance, we add an efficient spatial verification stage to re-rank the results returned from our bag-of-words model and show that this consistently improves search quality, though by less of a margin when the visual vocabulary is large. We view this work as a promising step towards much larger, \"web-scale \" image corpora."

A vocabulary of information-rich object parts is automatically constructed from a set of sample images of the object class of interest. Images are then represented using parts from this vocabulary, along with spatial relations observed among them. Based on this representation, a feature-efficient learning algorithm is used to learn to detect instances of the object class. The framework developed can be applied to any object with distinguishable parts in a relatively fixed spatial configuration. We report experiments on images of side views of cars. Our experiments show that the method achieves high detection accuracy on a difficult test set of real-world images, and is highly robust to partial occlusion and background variation.In addition, we discuss and offer solutions to several methodological issues that are significant for the research community to be able to evaluate object detection approaches."

The learned model is used for automatic visual recognition and semantic segmentation of photographs. Our discriminative model exploits novel features, based on textons, which jointly model shape and texture. Unary classification and feature selection is achieved using shared boosting to give an efficient classifier which can be applied to a large number of classes. Accurate image segmentation is achieved by incorporating these classifiers in a conditional random field. Efficient training of the model on very large datasets is achieved by exploiting both random feature selection and piecewise training methods. \n \nHigh classification and segmentation accuracy are demonstrated on three different databases: i) our own 21-object class database of photographs of real objects viewed under general lighting conditions, poses and viewpoints, ii) the 7-class Corel subset and iii) the 7-class Sowerby database used in [1]. The proposed algorithm gives competitive results both for highly textured (e.g. grass, trees), highly structured (e.g. cars, faces, bikes, aeroplanes) and articulated objects (e.g. body, cow)."

This work is distinguished by three key contributions. The first is the introduction of a new image representation called the \"integral image\" which allows the features used by our detector to be computed very quickly. The second is a learning algorithm, based on AdaBoost, which selects a small number of critical visual features from a larger set and yields extremely efficient classifiers. The third contribution is a method for combining increasingly more complex classifiers in a \"cascade\" which allows background regions of the image to be quickly discarded while spending more computation on promising object-like regions. The cascade can be viewed as an object specific focus-of-attention mechanism which unlike previous approaches provides statistical guarantees that discarded regions are unlikely to contain the object of interest. In the domain of face detection the system yields detection rates comparable to the best previous systems. Used in real-time applications, the detector runs at 15 frames per second without resorting to image differencing or skin color detection."

Our emphasis is on data mining of image content without the use of auxiliary domain knowledge. The purpose of our experiments is to explore the feasibility of this approach. A synthetic image set containing geometric shapes was generated to test our initial algorithm implementation. Our experimental results show that there is promise in image mining based on content. We compare these results against the rules obtained from manually identifying the shapes. We analyze the reasons for discrepancies. We also suggest directions for future work."

The training images contain a preponderance of clutter and learning is unsupervised. Our models represent objects as probabilistic constellations of rigid parts (features). The variability within a class is represented by a join probability density function on the shape of the constellation and the appearance of the parts. Our method automatically identifies distinctive features in the training set. The set of model parameters is then learned using expectation maximization. When trained on different, unlabeled and unsegmented views of a class of objects, each component of the mixture model can adapt to represent a subset of the views. Similarly, different component models can also \"specialize\" on sub-classes of an object class. Experiments on images of human heads, leaves from different species of trees, and motor-cars demonstrate that the method works well over a wide variety of objects."

The model is a sparse representation of the object, and consists of a star topology configuration of parts modeling the output of a variety of feature detectors. The optimal choice of feature types (whose repertoire includes interest points, curves and regions) is made automatically. In recognition, the model may be applied efficiently in an exhaustive manner, bypassing the need for feature detectors, to give the globally optimal match within a query image. The approach is demonstrated on a wide variety of categories, and delivers both successful classification and localization of the object within the image."

We achieve this using generative models from the statistical text literature: probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (pLSA), and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). In text analysis these are used to discover topics in a corpus using the bag-of-words document representation. Here we discover topics as object categories, so that an image containing instances of several categories is modelled as a mixture of topics. The models are applied to images by using a visual analogue of a word, formed by vector quantizing SIFT like region descriptors. We investigate a set of increasingly demanding scenarios, starting with image sets containing only two object categories through to sets containing multiple categories (including airplanes, cars, faces, motorbikes, spotted cats) and background clutter. The object categories sample both intra-class and scale variation, and both the categories and their approximate spatial layout are found without supervision. We also demonstrate classification of unseen images and images containing multiple objects. Performance of the proposed unsupervised method is compared to the semi-supervised approach of [7].1 1This work was sponsored in part by the EU Project CogViSys, the University of Oxford, Shell Oil, and the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency."

Our approach considers object categorization and figure-ground segmentation as two interleaved processes that closely collaborate towards a common goal. As shown in our work, the tight coupling between those two processes allows them to benefit from each other and improve the combined performance.\n\nThe core part of our approach is a highly flexible learned representation for object shape that can combine the information observed on different training examples in a probabilistic extension of the Generalized Hough Transform. The resulting approach can detect categorical objects in novel images and automatically infer a probabilistic segmentation from the recognition result. This segmentation is then in turn used to again improve recognition by allowing the system to focus its efforts on object pixels and to discard misleading influences from the background. Moreover, the information from where in the image a hypothesis draws its support is employed in an MDL based hypothesis verification stage to resolve ambiguities between overlapping hypotheses and factor out the effects of partial occlusion.\n\nAn extensive evaluation on several large data sets shows that the proposed system is applicable to a range of different object categories, including both rigid and articulated objects. In addition, its flexible representation allows it to achieve competitive object detection performance already from training sets that are between one and two orders of magnitude smaller than those used in comparable systems.\n"

The efficiency and quality is exhibited in a live demonstration that recognizes CD-covers from a database of 40000 images of popular music CD\u2019s. The scheme builds upon popular techniques of indexing descriptors extracted from local regions, and is robust to background clutter and occlusion. The local region descriptors are hierarchically quantized in a vocabulary tree. The vocabulary tree allows a larger and more discriminatory vocabulary to be used efficiently, which we show experimentally leads to a dramatic improvement in retrieval quality. The most significant property of the scheme is that the tree directly defines the quantization. The quantization and the indexing are therefore fully integrated, essentially being one and the same. The recognition quality is evaluated through retrieval on a database with ground truth, showing the power of the vocabulary tree approach, going as high as 1 million images."

We achieve this discovery using probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (pLSA), a generative model from the statistical text literature, here applied to a bag of visual words representation for each image. The scene classification on the object distribution is carried out by a k-nearest neighbour classifier. \n \nWe investigate the classification performance under changes in the visual vocabulary and number of latent topics learnt, and develop a novel vocabulary using colour SIFT descriptors. Classification performance is compared to the supervised approaches of Vogel & Schiele [19] and Oliva & Torralba [11], and the semi-supervised approach of Fei Fei & Perona [3] using their own datasets and testing protocols. In all cases the combination of (unsupervised) pLSA followed by (supervised) nearest neighbour classification achieves superior results. We show applications of this method to image retrieval with relevance feedback and to scene classification in videos."

Methods for efficiently searching this incredibly rich resource are vital for a large number of applications. These include object recognition, computer graphics, personal photo collections, online image search tools. In this paper, our goal is to develop efficient image search and scene matching techniques that are not only fast, but also require very little memory, enabling their use on standard hardware or even on handheld devices. Our approach uses recently developed machine learning techniques to convert the Gist descriptor (a real valued vector that describes orientation energies at different scales and orientations within an image) to a compact binary code, with a few hundred bits per image. Using our scheme, it is possible to perform real-time searches with millions from the Internet using a single large PC and obtain recognition results comparable to the full descriptor. Using our codes on high quality labeled images from the LabelMe database gives surprisingly powerful recognition results using simple nearest neighbor techniques."

The algorithm is intended for use by blind and visually impaired subjects walking through city scenes. We first obtain a dataset of city images taken by blind and normally sighted subjects. From this dataset, we manually label and extract the text regions. Next we perform statistical analysis of the text regions to determine which image features are reliable indicators of text and have low entropy (i.e. feature response is similar for all text images). We obtain weak classifiers by using joint probabilities for feature responses on and off text. These weak classifiers are used as input to an AdaBoost machine learning algorithm to train a strong classifier. In practice, we trained a cascade with 4 strong classifiers containing 79 features. An adaptive binarization and extension algorithm is applied to those regions selected by the cascade classifier. Commercial OCR software is used to read the text or reject it as a non-text region. The overall algorithm has a success rate of over 90% (evaluated by complete detection and reading of the text) on the test set and the unread text is typically small and distant from the viewer."

The object is represented by a set of viewpoint invariant region descriptors so that recognition can proceed successfully despite changes in viewpoint, illumination and partial occlusion. The temporal continuity of the video within a shot is used to track the regions in order to reject unstable regions and reduce the effects of noise in the descriptors. The analogy with text retrieval is in the implementation where matches on descriptors are pre-computed (using vector quantization), and inverted file systems and document rankings are used. The result is that retrieved is immediate, returning a ranked list of key frames/shots in the manner of Google. The method is illustrated for matching in two full length feature films."

Recognition is based on MAP decision making over weak object hypotheses from local descriptor responses in the mobile imagery. We present an improvement over the standard SIFT key detector (Lowe, 2004) by selecting only informative (i-SIFT) keys for descriptor matching. Selection is applied first to reduce the complexity of the object model and second to accelerate detection by selective filtering. We present results on the MPG-20 mobile phone imagery with severe illumination, scale and viewpoint changes in the images, performing with p ap 98% accuracy in identification, efficient (100%) background rejection, efficient (0%) false alarm rate, and reliable quality of service under extreme illumination conditions, significantly improving standard SIFT based recognition in every sense, providing mportant for mobile vision - runtimes which are ap 8 (ap 24) times faster for the MPG-20 (ZuBuD) database"

The model is scale and translation invariant. In the training phase, image regions that optimize an objective function are automatically located in the training images, without requiring any user annotation such as bounding boxes. The objective function measures visual similarity between training image pairs, using the spatial distribution of both appearance patches and edges. The optimization is initialized using discriminative features. The model enables the detection (localization) of multiple instances of the object class in test images, and can be used as a precursor to training other visual models that require bounding box annotation. The detection performance of the model is assessed on the PASCAL Visual Object Classes Challenge 2006 test set. For a number of object classes the performance far exceeds the current state of the art of fully supervised methods."

This technique works by partitioning the image into increasingly fine sub-regions and computing histograms of local features found inside each sub-region. The resulting \"spatial pyramid\" is a simple and computationally efficient extension of an orderless bag-of-features image representation, and it shows significantly improved performance on challenging scene categorization tasks. Specifically, our proposed method exceeds the state of the art on the Caltech-101 database and achieves high accuracy on a large database of fifteen natural scene categories. The spatial pyramid framework also offers insights into the success of several recently proposed image descriptions, including Torralba\u2019s \"gist\" and Lowe\u2019s SIFT descriptors."

                "text": "This thesis is concerned with the problem of visual object categorization, that is of reeognizing unseen-before objects, localizing them in cluttered real-worid images, and assigning the correct category label. This capability is one of the core compe\u00ac tencies of the human visual system. Yet, Computer vision Systems are still far from reaching a comparable level of Performance.Moreover,Computer visionresearch has in the past mainly focused on the simpler and more specific problem of identifying known objects under novel viewing conditions. The visual categorization problem is closely linked to the task of figure-ground segmentation, that is of dividing the image into an object and a non-objeet part. Historically, figure-ground segmentation has often been seen as an important and even necessary preprocessing step for object recognition. However, purely bottomup approacheshave so far been unable to yield segmentationsof sufficient quality, so that most current recognition approacheshave been designed to work independently from segmentation. In contrast,this thesis considers object categorization and figure-ground segmen\u00ac tation as two interleaved processes that closely collaborate towards a common goal. The core part of our work is a probabilisticformulation which integrates both capabilities into a common framework. As shown in our experiments, the tight coupling between those two processes allows them to profit from each other and improve their individual Performances. The resulting approach can detect categorical objects in novel images and automatically compute a segmentationfor them. This segmenta\u00ac tion is then used to again improve recognition by allowing the System to focus its effort on object pixels and discard misleading influencesfrom the background. In addition to improving the recognition Performance for individual hypotheses, the top-down segmentation also allows to determine exactly from where a hypoth\u00ac esis draws its support. We use this information to design a hypothesis verification stage based on the MDL principle that resolves ambiguities between overlapping hypotheseson a per-pixel level and factorsout the effects of partialocclusion. Altogether, this procedureconstitutes a novel mechanismin object detection that allows to analyze scenes containing multiple objects in a principled manner. Our results show that it presents an improvement over conventional criteria based on bounding box overlap and permitsmore aecurate aeeeptancedecisions. Our approach is based on a highly flexible implicit representation for object shape that can combine the information of local parts observed on different training exam\u00ac ples and interpolate between the correspondingobjects. As a result, the proposed method can learn object modeis already from few training examples and achieve competitive object detection Performance with training sets that are between one and two orders of magnitude smaller than those used in comparable Systems. An extensive evaluation on several large data sets shows that the system is applicable to many different object categories, including both rigid and articulated objects."

The ideal summary presents the most interesting and important aspects of the scene with minimal redundancy. We propose a solution to this problem using multi-user image collections from the Internet. Our solution examines the distribution of images in the collection to select a set of canonical views to form the scene summary, using clustering techniques on visual features. The summaries we compute also lend themselves naturally to the browsing of image collections, and can be augmented by analyzing user-specified image tag data. We demonstrate the approach using a collection of images of the city of Rome, showing the ability to automatically decompose the images into separate scenes, and identify canonical views for each scene."

                "text": "The nearestor near-neighbor query problems arise in a large variety of database applications, usually in the context of similarity searching. Of late, there has been increasing interest in building search/index structures for performing similarity search over high-dimensional data, e.g., image databases, document collections, time-series databases, and genome databases. Unfortunately, all known techniques for solving this problem fall prey to the \\curse of dimensionality.\" That is, the data structures scale poorly with data dimensionality; in fact, if the number of dimensions exceeds 10 to 20, searching in k-d trees and related structures involves the inspection of a large fraction of the database, thereby doing no better than brute-force linear search. It has been suggested that since the selection of features and the choice of a distance metric in typical applications is rather heuristic, determining an approximate nearest neighbor should su ce for most practical purposes. In this paper, we examine a novel scheme for approximate similarity search based on hashing. The basic idea is to hash the points Supported by NAVY N00014-96-1-1221 grant and NSF Grant IIS-9811904.

We provide experimental evidence that our method gives signi cant improvement in running time over other methods for searching in highdimensional spaces based on hierarchical tree decomposition. Experimental results also indicate that our scheme scales well even for a relatively large number of dimensions (more than 50)."

Many different descriptors have been proposed in the literature. It is unclear which descriptors are more appropriate and how their performance depends on the interest region detector. The descriptors should be distinctive and at the same time robust to changes in viewing conditions as well as to errors of the detector. Our evaluation uses as criterion recall with respect to precision and is carried out for different image transformations. We compare shape context [Belongie, S, et al., April 2002], steerable filters [Freeman, W and Adelson, E, Setp. 1991], PCA-SIFT [Ke, Y and Sukthankar, R, 2004], differential invariants [Koenderink, J and van Doorn, A, 1987], spin images [Lazebnik, S, et al., 2003], SIFT [Lowe, D. G., 1999], complex filters [Schaffalitzky, F and Zisserman, A, 2002], moment invariants [Van Gool, L, et al., 1996], and cross-correlation for different types of interest regions. We also propose an extension of the SIFT descriptor and show that it outperforms the original method. Furthermore, we observe that the ranking of the descriptors is mostly independent of the interest region detector and that the SIFT-based descriptors perform best. Moments and steerable filters show the best performance among the low dimensional descriptors."

Such natural textures arise from spatial variation of two surface attributes: (1) reflectance and (2) surface normal. In this paper, we provide a unified model to address both these aspects of natural texture. The main idea is to construct a vocabulary of prototype tiny surface patches with associated local geometric and photometric properties. We call these 3D textons. Examples might be ridges, grooves, spots or stripes or combinations thereof. Associated with each texton is an appearance vector, which characterizes the local irradiance distribution, represented as a set of linear Gaussian derivative filter outputs, under different lighting and viewing conditions.Given a large collection of images of different materials, a clustering approach is used to acquire a small (on the order of 100) 3D texton vocabulary. Given a few (1 to 4) images of any material, it can be characterized using these textons. We demonstrate the application of this representation for recognition of the material viewed under novel lighting and viewing conditions. We also illustrate how the 3D texton model can be used to predict the appearance of materials under novel conditions."

After reviewing existing edge and gradient based descriptors, we show experimentally that grids of histograms of oriented gradient (HOG) descriptors significantly outperform existing feature sets for human detection. We study the influence of each stage of the computation on performance, concluding that fine-scale gradients, fine orientation binning, relatively coarse spatial binning, and high-quality local contrast normalization in overlapping descriptor blocks are all important for good results. The new approach gives near-perfect separation on the original MIT pedestrian database, so we introduce a more challenging dataset containing over 1800 annotated human images with a large range of pose variations and backgrounds."

We focus on a particular type of model where objects are represented as flexible constellations of rigid parts (features). The variability within a class is represented by a joint probability density function (pdf) on the shape of the constellation and the output of part detectors. In a first stage, the method automatically identifies distinctive parts in the training set by applying a clustering algorithm to patterns selected by an interest operator. It then learns the statistical shape model using expectation maximization. The method achieves very good classification results on human faces and rear views of cars."

Many parameter estimation techniques have been proposed for relevance feedback. However, most of them are either based on ad-hoc heuristics or only partial solutions. In this paper, we introduce the first technique that not only has a solid theoretical framework but also takes into account the multi-level image content model. This technique formulates a vigorous optimization problem. By using Lagrange multipliers, we have derived the explicit optimal solutions for both the query vectors and the weights associated with the two-level image model. Experimental results on realworld image collections have shown the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed algorithm."

Two key properties of QBIC are (1) its use of image and video content-computable properties of color, texture, shape and motion of images, videos and their objects-in the queries, and (2) its graphical query language, in which queries are posed by drawing, selecting and other graphical means. This article describes the QBIC system and demonstrates its query capabilities. QBIC technology is part of several IBM products. >"

We show that our method is able to overcome some of the problems involved in navigating databases using tags only, such as synonymy or different languages, spelling mistakes, homonymy, or missing tags. On the other hand, image search based on visual features can be simplified substantially by the use of tags. We present technical details of our prototype system and show some preliminary results."

                "text": "The problem of automatically learning object models for recognition and pose estimation is addressed. In contrast to the traditional approach, the recognition problem is formulated as one of matching appearance rather than shape. The appearance of an object in a two-dimensional image depends on its shape, reflectance properties, pose in the scene, and the illumination conditions. While shape and reflectance are intrinsic properties and constant for a rigid object, pose and illumination vary from scene to scene. A compact representation of object appearance is proposed that is parametrized by pose and illumination. For each object of interest, a large set of images is obtained by automatically varying pose and illumination. This image set is compressed to obtain a low-dimensional subspace, called the eigenspace, in which the object is represented as a manifold. Given an unknown input image, the recognition system projects the image to eigenspace. The object is recognized based on the manifold it lies on. The exact position of the projection on the manifold determines the object's pose in the image.A variety of experiments are conducted using objects with complex appearance characteristics. The performance of the recognition and pose estimation algorithms is studied using over a thousand input images of sample objects. Sensitivity of recognition to the number of eigenspace dimensions and the number of learning samples is analyzed. For the objects used, appearance representation in eigenspaces with less than 20 dimensions produces accurate recognition results with an average pose estimation error of about 1.0 degree. A near real-time recognition system with 20 complex objects in the database has been developed. The paper is concluded with a discussion on various issues related to the proposed learning and recognition methodology."

Such large collections are inherently difficult to browse, and become excessively so as they grow in size, making summaries an important tool in rendering these collections accessible. Our summary algorithm is based on spa-tial patterns in photo sets, as well as textual-topical patterns and user (photographer) identity cues. The algorithm can be expanded to support social, temporal, and other factors. The summary can thus be biased by the content of the query, the user making the query, and the context in which the query is made.A modified version of our summarization algorithm serves as a basis for a new map-based visualization of large collections of geo-referenced photos, called Tag Maps. Tag Maps visualize the data by placing highly representative textual tags on relevant map locations in the viewed region, effectively providing a sense of the important concepts embodied in the collection.An initial evaluation of our implementation on a set of geo-referenced photos shows that our algorithm and visualization perform well, producing summaries and views that are highly rated by users."

Objects are modeled as flexible constellations of parts. A probabilistic representation is used for all aspects of the object: shape, appearance, occlusion and relative scale. An entropy-based feature detector is used to select regions and their scale within the image. In learning the parameters of the scale-invariant object model are estimated. This is done using expectation-maximization in a maximum-likelihood setting. In recognition, this model is used in a Bayesian manner to classify images. The flexible nature of the model is demonstrated by excellent results over a range of datasets including geometrically constrained classes (e.g. faces, cars) and flexible objects (such as animals)."

We detail algorithms for insertion of objects and split management, which keep the M-tree always balanced - several heuristic split alternatives are considered and experimentally evaluated. Algorithms for similarity (range and k-nearest neighbors) queries are also described. Results from extensive experimentation with a prototype system are reported, considering as the performance criteria the number of page I/O\u2019s and the number of distance computations. The results demonstrate that the Mtree indeed extends the domain of applicability beyond the traditional vector spaces, performs reasonably well in high-dimensional data spaces, and scales well in case of growing files."

In such domains a cascade of simple classifiers each trained to achieve high detection rates and modest false positive rates can yield a final detector with many desirable features: including high detection rates, very low false positive rates, and fast performance. Achieving extremely high detection rates, rather than low error, is not a task typically addressed by machine learning algorithms. We propose a new variant of AdaBoost as a mechanism for training the simple classifiers used in the cascade. Experimental results in the domain of face detection show the training algorithm yields significant improvements in performance over conventional AdaBoost. The final face detection system can process 15 frames per second, achieves over 90% detection, and a false positive rate of 1 in a 1,000,000."

Much of this enthusiasm is due to a successful new approximate nearest neighbor approach called Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH). In this paper we ask the question: can earlier spatial data structure approaches to exact nearest neighbor, such as metric trees, be altered to provide approximate answers to proximity queries and if so, how? We introduce a new kind of metric tree that allows overlap: certain datapoints may appear in both the children of a parent. We also introduce new approximate k-NN search algorithms on this structure. We show why these structures should be able to exploit the same random-projection-based approximations that LSH enjoys, but with a simpler algorithm and perhaps with greater efficiency. We then provide a detailed empirical evaluation on five large, high dimensional datasets which show up to 31-fold accelerations over LSH. This result holds true throughout the spectrum of approximation levels."

In this paper, we show that formulating the problem in a Naive Bayesian classification framework makes such preprocessing unnecessary and produces an algorithm that is simple, efficient, and robust. Furthermore, it scales well to handle large number of classes. To recognize the patches surrounding keypoints, our classifier uses hundreds of simple binary features and models class posterior probabilities. We make the problem computationally tractable by assuming independence between arbitrary sets of features. Even though this is not strictly true, we demonstrate that our classifier nevertheless performs remarkably well on image datasets containing very significant perspective changes."

This way, using a mobile phone with integrated camera, users can interact with objects or \"things\" in a very simple manner. A further advantage is that the objects themselves don't have to be tagged with any kind of markers. At the core of our system lies an object recognition method, which identifies an object from a query image through multiple recognition stages, including local visual features, global geometry, and optionally also metadata such as GPS location. We present two applications for our system, namely a slide tagging application for presentation screens in smart meeting rooms and a cityguide on a mobile phone. Both systems are fully functional, including an application on the mobile phone, which allows simplest point-and-shoot interaction with objects. Experiments evaluate the performance of our approach in both application scenarios and show good recognition results under challenging conditions."

We present a method for learning object categories from just a few images (1 /spl sim/ 5). It is based on incorporating \"generic\" knowledge which may be obtained from previously learnt models of unrelated categories. We operate in a variational Bayesian framework: object categories are represented by probabilistic models, and \"prior\" knowledge is represented as a probability density function on the parameters of these models. The \"posterior\" model for an object category is obtained by updating the prior in the light of one or more observations. Our ideas are demonstrated on four diverse categories (human faces, airplanes, motorcycles, spotted cats). Initially three categories are learnt from hundreds of training examples, and a \"prior\" is estimated from these. Then the model of the fourth category is learnt from 1 to 5 training examples, and is used for detecting new exemplars a set of test images."

However, its mining ability is limited to transaction data consisting of items. In reality, there are many applications where data are described in a more structural way, e.g. chemical compounds and Web browsing history. There are a few approaches that can discover characteristic patterns from graph-structured data in the field of machine learning. However, almost all of them are not suitable for such applications that require a complete search for all frequent subgraph patterns in the data. In this paper, we propose a novel principle and its algorithm that derive the characteristic patterns which frequently appear in graph-structured data. Our algorithm can derive all frequent induced subgraphs from both directed and undirected graph structured data having loops (including self-loops) with labeled or unlabeled nodes and links. Its performance is evaluated through the applications to Web browsing pattern analysis and chemical carcinogenesis analysis."

The procedure is based on a very low dimensional representation of the scene, that we term the Spatial Envelope. We propose a set of perceptual dimensions (naturalness, openness, roughness, expansion, ruggedness) that represent the dominant spatial structure of a scene. Then, we show that these dimensions may be reliably estimated using spectral and coarsely localized information. The model generates a multidimensional space in which scenes sharing membership in semantic categories (e.g., streets, highways, coasts) are projected closed together.

In this paper, we describe a slide indexing and retrieval system in which the slides are captured as images (through a framegrabber) at the moment they are displayed during a presentation and then transcribed with an optical character recognition (OCR) system. In this context, we show that such an approach presents several advantages over the use of commercial software (API based) to obtain the slide transcriptions. We report a set of retrieval experiments conducted on a database of 26 real presentations (570 slides) collected at a workshop. The experiments show that the overall retrieval performance is close to that obtained using either a manual transcription of the slides or the API software. Moreover, the experiments show that the OCR-based approach outperforms significantly the API in extracting the text embedded in images and figures"

                "text": "The main purpose of this paper is to describe a process for partitioning an N-dimensional population into k sets on the basis of a sample. The process, which is called 'k-means,' appears to give partitions which are reasonably efficient in the sense of within-class variance. That is, if p is the probability mass function for the population, S = {S1, S2, * *, Sk} is a partition of EN, and ui, i = 1, 2, * , k, is the conditional mean of p over the set Si, then W2(S) = ff=ISi f z u42 dp(z) tends to be low for the partitions S generated by the method. We say 'tends to be low,' primarily because of intuitive considerations, corroborated to some extent by mathematical analysis and practical computational experience. Also, the k-means procedure is easily programmed and is computationally economical, so that it is feasible to process very large samples on a digital computer. Possible applications include methods for similarity grouping, nonlinear prediction, approximating multivariate distributions, and nonparametric tests for independence among several variables. In addition to suggesting practical classification methods, the study of k-means has proved to be theoretically interesting. The k-means concept represents a generalization of the ordinary sample mean, and one is naturally led to study the pertinent asymptotic behavior, the object being to establish some sort of law of large numbers for the k-means. This problem is sufficiently interesting, in fact, for us to devote a good portion of this paper to it. The k-means are defined in section 2.1, and the main results which have been obtained on the asymptotic behavior are given there. The rest of section 2 is devoted to the proofs of these results. Section 3 describes several specific possible applications, and reports some preliminary results from computer experiments conducted to explore the possibilities inherent in the k-means idea. The extension to general metric spaces is indicated briefly in section 4. The original point of departure for the work described here was a series of problems in optimal classification (MacQueen [9]) which represented special"

They use the kd-tree data structure to reduce the large number of nearest-neighbor queries issued by the traditional algorithm. Sufficient statistics are stored in the nodes of the kd-tree. Then an analysis of the geometry of the current cluster centers results in great reduction of the work needed to update the centers. Our algorithms behave exactly as the traditional k-means algorithm. Proofs of correctness are included. The kd-tree can also be used to initialize the k-means starting centers efficiently. Our algorithms can be easily extended to provide fast ways of computing the error of a given cluster assignment regardless of the method in which those clusters were obtained. We also show how to use them in a setting which allows approximate clustering results, with the benefit of running faster. We have implemented and tested our algorithms on both real and simulated data. Results show a speedup factor of up to 170 on real astrophysical data, and superiority over the naive algorithm on simulated data in up to 5 dimensions. Our algorithms scale well with respect to the number of points and number of centers allowing for clustering with tens of thousands of centers."

The association mining task consists of identifying the frequent itemsets, and then forming conditional implication rules among them. We present efficient algorithms for the discovery of frequent itemsets which forms the compute intensive phase of the task. The algorithms utilize the structural properties of frequent itemsets to facilitate fast discovery. The items are organized into a subset lattice search space, which is decomposed into small independent chunks or sublattices, which can be solved in memory. Efficient lattice traversal techniques are presented which quickly identify all the long frequent itemsets and their subsets if required. We also present the effect of using different database layout schemes combined with the proposed decomposition and traversal techniques. We experimentally compare the new algorithms against the previous approaches, obtaining improvements of more than an order of magnitude for our test databases."

Our work is motivated by the pictorial structure models introduced by Fischler and Elschlager. The basic idea is to represent an object by a collection of parts arranged in a deformable configuration. The appearance of each part is modeled separately, and the deformable configuration is represented by spring-like connections between pairs of parts. These models allow for qualitative descriptions of visual appearance, and are suitable for generic recognition problems. We address the problem of using pictorial structure models to find instances of an object in an image as well as the problem of learning an object model from training examples, presenting efficient algorithms in both cases. We demonstrate the techniques by learning models that represent faces and human bodies and using the resulting models to locate the corresponding objects in novel images."

Our system consists of an image-based modeling front end that automatically computes the viewpoint of each photograph as well as a sparse 3D model of the scene and image to model correspondences. Our photo explorer uses image-based rendering techniques to smoothly transition between photographs, while also enabling full 3D navigation and exploration of the set of images and world geometry, along with auxiliary information such as overhead maps. Our system also makes it easy to construct photo tours of scenic or historic locations, and to annotate image details, which are automatically transferred to other relevant images. We demonstrate our system on several large personal photo collections as well as images gathered from Internet photo sharing sites."

                "text": "Mining frequent patterns in transaction databases, time-series databases, and many other kinds of databases has been studied popularly in data mining research. Most of the previous studies adopt an Apriori-like candidate set generation-and-test approach. However, candidate set generation is still costly, especially when there exist prolific patterns and/or long patterns.\nIn this study, we propose a novel frequent pattern tree (FP-tree) structure, which is an extended prefix-tree structure for storing compressed, crucial information about frequent patterns, and develop an efficient FP-tree-based mining method, FP-growth, for mining the complete set of frequent patterns by pattern fragment growth. Efficiency of mining is achieved with three techniques: (1) a large database is compressed into a highly condensed, much smaller data structure, which avoids costly, repeated database scans, (2) our FP-tree-based mining adopts a pattern fragment growth method to avoid the costly generation of a large number of candidate sets, and (3) a partitioning-based, divide-and-conquer method is used to decompose the mining task into a set of smaller tasks for mining confined patterns in conditional databases, which dramatically reduces the search space. Our performance study shows that the FP-growth method is efficient and scalable for mining both long and short frequent patterns, and is about an order of magnitude faster than the Apriori algorithm and also faster than some recently reported new frequent pattern mining methods."

The emergence of vast amounts of geographically-calibrated image data is a great reason for computer vision to start looking globally - on the scale of the entire planet! In this paper, we propose a simple algorithm for estimating a distribution over geographic locations from a single image using a purely data-driven scene matching approach. For this task, we leverage a dataset of over 6 million GPS-tagged images from the Internet. We represent the estimated image location as a probability distribution over the Earthpsilas surface. We quantitatively evaluate our approach in several geolocation tasks and demonstrate encouraging performance (up to 30 times better than chance). We show that geolocation estimates can provide the basis for numerous other image understanding tasks such as population density estimation, land cover estimation or urban/rural classification."

Our idea is to intelligently choose images to match, both at a per-view and per-pixel level. We show that such adaptive view selection enables robust performance even with dramatic appearance variability. The stereo matching technique takes as input sparse 3D points reconstructed from structure-from-motion methods and iteratively grows surfaces from these points. Optimizing for surface normals within a photoconsistency measure significantly improves the matching results. While the focus of our approach is to estimate high-quality depth maps, we also show examples of merging the resulting depth maps into compelling scene reconstructions. We demonstrate our algorithm on standard multi-view stereo datasets and on casually acquired photo collections of famous scenes gathered from the Internet."

Our basic premise is that this problem is too difficult for any type of model or feature alone. Instead, we present an algorithm that integrates evidence in multiple iterations and from different sources. The core part of our method is the combination of local and global cues via probabilistic top-down segmentation. Altogether, this approach allows examining and comparing object hypotheses with high precision down to the pixel level. Qualitative and quantitative results on a large data set confirm that our method is able to reliably detect pedestrians in crowded scenes, even when they overlap and partially occlude each other. In addition, the flexible nature of our approach allows it to operate on very small training sets."

One of these concerns large-scale, \u2018global\u2019 structures, and the aim is to model the shapes, or features of the shapes, of distributions. The other concerns small-scale, \u2018local\u2019 structures, and the aim is to detect these anomalies and decide if they are real or chance occurrences. In the context of signal detection in the pharmaceutical sector, most interest lies in the second of the above two aspects; however, signal detection occurs relative to an assumed background model, therefore, some discussion of the first aspect is also necessary. This paper gives a lightning overview of data mining and its relation to statistics, with particular emphasis on tools for the detection of adverse drug reactions."

                "text": "Many techniques for association rule mining and feature selection require a suitable metric to capture the dependencies among variables in a data set. For example, metrics such as support, confidence, lift, correlation, and collective strength are often used to determine the interestingness of association patterns. However, many such measures provide conflicting information about the interestingness of a pattern, and the best metric to use for a given application domain is rarely known. In this paper, we present an overview of various measures proposed in the statistics, machine learning and data mining literature. We describe several key properties one should examine in order to select the right measure for a given application domain. A comparative study of these properties is made using twenty one of the existing measures. We show that each measure has different properties which make them useful for some application domains, but not for others. We also present two scenarios in which most of the existing measures agree with each other, namely, support-based pruning and table standardization. Finally, we present an algorithm to select a small set of tables such that an expert can select a desirable measure by looking at just this small set of tables."

Or you just wanted to see a few talks from a conference you did not attend? Video proceedings, which contain videos of all the conference talks, would be of a great value in these cases and in many others. With recent progress in digital video, streaming technology, large storage, Internet and especially video indexing and retrieval technology, video proceedings finally become a reality. The key challenge is to create it in an efficient way and to provide the user with easy, intuitive and rapid access to the talks and the snippets of video that he is looking for. This paper describes an application that allows a nearly automatic real time creation of video proceedings. All the talks are captured in video, and are automatically indexed by speech recognition and video analysis tools. The abstracts and speaker's biography are extracted from the text proceedings and are converted to web pages. Free text search in speech and efficient multi-view video browsing are combined with a table of contents to compose fully searchable and browsable video proceedings. The paper covers different aspects of the problem, an overview of the CueVideo system and examples from two conferences that we have processed using this system."

We introduce a simplified model of a deformable object class and derive the optimal detector for this model. However, the optimal detector is not realizable except under special circumstances (independent part positions). A cousin of the optimal detector is developed which uses \u201csoft\u201d part detectors with a probabilistic description of the spatial arrangement of the parts. Spatial arrangements are modeled probabilistically using shape statistics to achieve invariance to translation, rotation, and scaling. Improved recognition performance over methods based on \u201chard\u201d part detectors is demonstrated for the problem of face detection in cluttered scenes."

A different method for evaluating and finding itemsets referred to as otrongIyl collective itemsets is proposed. The concepts of \u201csupport\u201d of an itemset and correlation of the items within an itemset are related, though not quite the same. This criterion stresses the importance of the actual correlation of the items with one another rather than the absolute support, Previously proposed methods to provide correlated itemsets are not necessarily applicable to very large databases, We provide an algorithm which provides very good computational efficiency, while maintaining statistical robuetneas, The fact that this algorithm relies on relative measures rather than absolute measures such as support also implies that the method can be applied to find association rules in datasets in which items may appear in a sizeable percentage of the transactions (dense datasets), datasets in which the items have varying density, or even negative association rules,"

The solution to this problem that we are pursuing is to use a computer vision system based upon motion analysis of a monocular image sequence from a mobile camera. By extraction and tracking of image features, representations of the 3D analogues of these features can be constructed."

The object detection problem is formulated as finding paths through the network resembling the model outlines, and a computationally efficient detection technique is presented. An extensive experimental evaluation on detecting five diverse object classes over hundreds of images demonstrates that our method works in very cluttered images, allows for scale changes and considerable intra-class shape variation, is robust to interrupted contours, and is computationally efficient."

A new set of image elements that are put into correspondence, the so called extremal regions, is introduced. Extremal regions possess highly desirable properties: the set is closed under 1. continuous (and thus projective) transformation of image coordinates and 2. monotonic transformation of image intensities. An efficient (near linear complexity) and practically fast detection algorithm (near frame rate) is presented for an affinely-invariant stable subset of extremal regions, the maximally stable extremal regions (MSER). A new robust similarity measure for establishing tentative correspondences is proposed. The robustness ensures that invariants from multiple measurement regions (regions obtained by invariant constructions from extremal regions), some that are significantly larger (and hence discriminative) than the MSERs, may be used to establish tentative correspondences. The high utility of MSERs, multiple measurement regions and the robust metric is demonstrated in wide-baseline experiments on image pairs from both indoor and outdoor scenes. Significant change of scale (3.5\u00d7), illumination conditions, out-of-plane rotation, occlusion , locally anisotropic scale change and 3D translation of the viewpoint are all present in the test problems. Good estimates of epipolar geometry (average distance from corresponding points to the epipolar line below 0.09 of the inter-pixel distance) are obtained."

An alternate way of modeling the objects in these data sets is to use graphs. Within that model, the problem of finding frequent patterns becomes that of discovering subgraphs that occur frequently over the entire set of graphs.The authors present a computationally efficient algorithm for finding all frequent subgraphs in large graph databases. We evaluated the performance of the algorithm by experiments with synthetic datasets as well as a chemical compound dataset. The empirical results show that our algorithm scales linearly with the number of input transactions and it is able to discover frequent subgraphs from a set of graph transactions reasonably fast, even though we have to deal with computationally hard problems such as canonical labeling of graphs and subgraph isomorphism which are not necessary for traditional frequent itemset discovery."

It is being created in the context of a project that is developing meeting browsing technology and will eventually be released publicly. Some of the meetings it contains are naturally occurring, and some are elicited, particularly using a scenario in which the participants play different roles in a design team, taking a design project from kick-o' to completion over the course of a day. The corpus is being recorded using a wide range of devices including close-talking and far-field microphones, individual and room-view video cameras, projection, a whiteboard, and individual pens, all of which produce output signals that are synchronized with each other. It is also being hand-annotated for many different phenomena, including orthographic transcription, discourse properties such as named entities and dialogue acts, summaries, emotions, and some head and hand gestures. We describe the data set, including the rationale behind using elicited material, and explain how the material is being recorded, transcribed and annotated."

The concepts of an optimal number of features, representativeness of the training data, and the need to avoid overfitting to the training data are stressed. The chapter shows that methods such as the support vector machine and artificial neural networks are subject to these same training limitations, although each has its advantages. For neural networks, the multilayer perceptron architecture and back-propagation algorithm are described. The chapter distinguishes between supervised and unsupervised learning, demonstrating the advantages of the latter and showing how methods such as clustering and principal components analysis fit into the SPR framework. The chapter also defines the receiver operating characteristic, which allows an optimum balance between false positives and false negatives to be achieved."

However, as data mining techniques are being increasingly applied to nontraditional domains, existing frequent pattern discovery approaches cannot be used. This is because the transaction framework that is assumed by these algorithms cannot be used to effectively model the data sets in these domains. An alternate way of modeling the objects in these data sets is to represent them using graphs. Within that model, one way of formulating the frequent pattern discovery problem is that of discovering subgraphs that occur frequently over the entire set of graphs. We present a computationally efficient algorithm, called FSG, for finding all frequent subgraphs in large graph data sets. We experimentally evaluate the performance of FSG using a variety of real and synthetic data sets. Our results show that despite the underlying complexity associated with frequent subgraph discovery, FSG is effective in finding all frequently occurring subgraphs in data sets containing more than 200,000 graph transactions and scales linearly with respect to the size of the data set."

The approach relies on identifying groups of local affine regions (image features having a characteristic appearance and elliptical shape) that remain approximately affinely rigid across a range of views of an object, and across multiple instances of the same object class. These groups, termed semi-local affine parts, are learned using correspondence search between pairs of unsegmented and cluttered input images, followed by validation against additional training images. The proposed approach is applied to the recognition of butterflies in natural imagery."

In addition, this document presents the rationale, design and results of psychophysical experiments that were conducted to address some key issues that arose during PicHunter's development. The PicHunter project makes four primary contributions to research on CBIR. First, PicHunter represents a simple instance of a general Bayesian framework which we describe for using relevance feedback to direct a search. With an explicit model of what users would do, given the target image they want, PicHunter uses Bayes's rule to predict the target they want, given their actions. This is done via a probability distribution over possible image targets, rather than by refining a query. Second, an entropy-minimizing display algorithm is described that attempts to maximize the information obtained from a user at each iteration of the search. Third, PicHunter makes use of hidden annotation rather than a possibly inaccurate/inconsistent annotation structure that the user must learn and make queries in. Finally, PicHunter introduces two experimental paradigms to quantitatively evaluate the performance of the system, and psychophysical experiments are presented that support the theoretical claims."

We show how this, in its own right, gives a fast and effective clustering of data. But more importantly we show how it can produce a well-balanced structure similar to a Ball-Tree (Omohundro, 1991) or a kind of metric tree (Uhlmann, 1991; Ciaccia, Patella, & Zezula, 1997) in a way that is neither \"topdown\" nor \"bottom-up\" but instead \"middleout\". We then show how this structure, decorated with cached sufficient statistics, allows a wide variety of statistical learning algorithms to be accelerated even in thousands of dimensions."

In this paper we consider the situation where no relevance information is available, that is, at the start of the search. Based on a probabilistic model, strategies are proposed for the initial search and an intermediate search. Retrieval experiments with the Cranfield collection of 1,400 documents show that this initial search strategy is better than conventional search strategies both in terms of retrieval effectiveness and in terms of the number of queries that retrieve relevant documents. The intermediate search is shown to be a useful substitute for a relevance feedback search. Experiments with queries that do not retrieve relevant documents at high rank positions indicate that a cluster search would be an effective alternative strategy."

A major portion of this paper describes the application of RANSAC to the Location Determination Problem (LDP): Given an image depicting a set of landmarks with known locations, determine that point in space from which the image was obtained. In response to a RANSAC requirement, new results are derived on the minimum number of landmarks needed to obtain a solution, and algorithms are presented for computing these minimum-landmark solutions in closed form.

Faces are represented by labeled graphs, based on a Gabor wavelet transform. Image graphs of new faces are extracted by an elastic graph matching process and can be compared by a simple similarity function. The system differs from Lades et al. (1993) in three respects. Phase information is used for accurate node positioning. Object-adapted graphs are used to handle large rotations in depth. Image graph extraction is based on a novel data structure, the bunch graph, which is constructed from a small set of sample image graphs."

Document length normalization is used to fairly retrieve documents of all lengths. In this study, we ohserve that a normalization scheme that retrieves documents of all lengths with similar chances as their likelihood of relevance will outperform another scheme which retrieves documents with chances very different from their likelihood of relevance. We show that the retrievaf probabilities for a particular normalization method deviate systematically from the relevance probabilities across different collections. We present pivoted normalization, a technique that can be used to modify any normalization function thereby reducing the gap between the relevance and the retrieval probabilities. Training pivoted normalization on one collection, we can successfully use it on other (new) text collections, yielding a robust, collectzorz independent normalization technique. We use the idea of pivoting with the well known cosine normalization function. We point out some shortcomings of the cosine function andpresent two new normalization functions\u2013-pivoted unique normalization and piuotert byte size nornaahzation."

Since its inception, a number of significant FIM algorithms have been developed to speed up mining performance. Unfortunately, when the dataset size is huge, both the memory use and computational cost can still be prohibitively expensive. In this work, we propose to parallelize the FP-Growth algorithm (we call our parallel algorithm PFP) on distributed machines. PFP partitions computation in such a way that each machine executes an independent group of mining tasks. Such partitioning eliminates computational dependencies between machines, and thereby communication between them. Through empirical study on a large dataset of 802,939 Web pages and 1,021,107 tags, we demonstrate that PFP can achieve virtually linear speedup. Besides scalability, the empirical study demonstrates that PFP to be promising for supporting query recommendation for search engines."

We achieve interactive frame rates of up to 20 Hz for natural feature tracking from textured planar targets on current-generation phones. We use an approach based on heavily modified state-of-the-art feature descriptors, namely SIFT and Ferns. While SIFT is known to be a strong, but computationally expensive feature descriptor, Ferns classification is fast, but requires large amounts of memory. This renders both original designs unsuitable for mobile phones. We give detailed descriptions on how we modified both approaches to make them suitable for mobile phones. We present evaluations on robustness and performance on various devices and finally discuss their appropriateness for augmented reality applications."

We avoid network latency by implementing the algorithm on the phone and deliver excellent performance by adapting a state-of-the-art image retrieval algorithm based on robust local descriptors. Matching is performed against a database of highly relevant features, which is continuously updated to reflect changes in the environment. We achieve fast updates and scalability by pruning of irrelevant features based on proximity to the user. By compressing and incrementally updating the features stored on the phone we make the system amenable to low-bandwidth wireless connections. We demonstrate system robustness on a dataset of location-tagged images and show a smart-phone implementation that achieves a high image matching rate while operating in near real-time."

In contrast to related systems which perform computationally intensive image processing tasks on remote servers, our intention is to carry out all computations directly on the phone. This ensures little or even no network traffic and consequently decreases cost for online times. Our laboratory experiments and field surveys have shown that photographed museum exhibits can be recognized with a probability of over 90%.We have evaluated different feature sets to optimize the recognition rate and performance. Our experiments revealed that normalized color features are most effective for our method. Choosing such a feature set allows recognizing an object below one second on up-to-date phones. The amount of data that is required for differentiating 50 objects from multiple perspectives is less than 6KBytes."

Our scale and affine invariant detectors are based on the following recent results: (1) Interest points extracted with the Harris detector can be adapted to affine transformations and give repeatable results (geometrically stable). (2) The characteristic scale of a local structure is indicated by a local extremum over scale of normalized derivatives (the Laplacian). (3) The affine shape of a point neighborhood is estimated based on the second moment matrix.Our scale invariant detector computes a multi-scale representation for the Harris interest point detector and then selects points at which a local measure (the Laplacian) is maximal over scales. This provides a set of distinctive points which are invariant to scale, rotation and translation as well as robust to illumination changes and limited changes of viewpoint. The characteristic scale determines a scale invariant region for each point. We extend the scale invariant detector to affine invariance by estimating the affine shape of a point neighborhood. An iterative algorithm modifies location, scale and neighborhood of each point and converges to affine invariant points. This method can deal with significant affine transformations including large scale changes. The characteristic scale and the affine shape of neighborhood determine an affine invariant region for each point.We present a comparative evaluation of different detectors and show that our approach provides better results than existing methods. The performance of our detector is also confirmed by excellent matching results; the image is described by a set of scale/affine invariant descriptors computed on the regions associated with our points."

We also show that the algorithm finds the exact near neigbhor in O(log n) time for data satisfying certain \"bounded growth\" condition.Unlike earlier schemes, our LSH scheme works directly on points in the Euclidean space without embeddings. Consequently, the resulting query time bound is free of large factors and is simple and easy to implement. Our experiments (on synthetic data sets) show that the our data structure is up to 40 times faster than kd-tree."

Users tend to forget what they saw relatively fast after leaving such a display. In this paper, we present a new interaction technique for transferring information from a public display onto a personal mobile phone with its built-in camera. Instead of having to rely on their memory, users simply take a picture of the information of interest. Instead of just storing the image, our system then retrieves the actual data represented on the screen, such as a stock quote, news text, or piece of music. The Shoot & Copy technique does not require visual codes that interfere with shown content or reduce screen real estate. Our prototype allows users to capture an arbitrary region of a standard desktop screen, containing icons, which represent pieces of data. The captured image is then analyzed and a reference to the corresponding data is sent back to the mobile phone. Once the user has time to view the information in more detail, our system allows retrieving the actual data from this reference. We present our prototype and the methods it uses for image processing, as well as an evaluation of our interaction technique illustrating its potential use and applications."

Such codes can be attached to physical objects in order to retrieve object-related information and functionality. They are also suitable for display on electronic screens. The proposed visual code system allows the simultaneous detection of multiple codes, introduces a position-independent coordinate system, and provides the phone\u2019s orientation as a parameter. The ability to detect objects in the user\u2019s vicinity offers a natural way of interaction and strengthens the role of mobile phones in a large number of application scenarios. We describe the hardware requirements, the design of a suitable visual code, a lightweight recognition algorithm, and present some example applications."

As a general data structure, graph can model complicated relations among data with wide applications in bioinformatics, Web exploration, and etc. However, mining large graph patterns in challenging due to the presence of an exponential number of frequent subgraphs. Instead of mining all the subgraphs, we propose to mine closed frequent graph patterns. A graph g is closed in a database if there exists no proper supergraph of g that has the same support as g. A closed graph pattern mining algorithm, CloseGraph, is developed by exploring several interesting pruning methods. Our performance study shows that CloseGraph not only dramatically reduces unnecessary subgraphs to be generated but also substantially increases the efficiency of mining, especially in the presence of large graph patterns."

The model we study can be interpreted as a broad, abstract extension of the well-studied on-line prediction model to a general decision-theoretic setting. We show that the multiplicative weight-update Littlestone?Warmuth rule can be adapted to this model, yielding bounds that are slightly weaker in some cases, but applicable to a considerably more general class of learning problems. We show how the resulting learning algorithm can be applied to a variety of problems, including gambling, multiple-outcome prediction, repeated games, and prediction of points in Rn. In the second part of the paper we apply the multiplicative weight-update technique to derive a new boosting algorithm. This boosting algorithm does not require any prior knowledge about the performance of the weak learning algorithm. We also study generalizations of the new boosting algorithm to the problem of learning functions whose range, rather than being binary, is an arbitrary finite set or a bounded segment of the real line."

Association rules are intended to identify patterns of the type: \u201cA customer purchasing item A often also purchases item B.\u201d Motivated partly by the goal of generalizing beyond market basket data and partly by the goal of ironing out some problems in the definition of association rules, we develop the notion of dependence rules that identify statistical dependence in both the presence and absence of items in itemsets. We propose measuring significance of dependence via the chi-squared test for independence from classical statistics. This leads to a measure that is upward-closed in the itemset lattice, enabling us to reduce the mining problem to the search for a border between dependent and independent itemsets in the lattice. We develop pruning strategies based on the closure property and thereby devise an efficient algorithm for discovering dependence rules. We demonstrate our algorithm's effectiveness by testing it on census data, text data (wherein we seek term dependence), and synthetic data."

Experiments show that the new algorithm is effective for datasets with up to 1000 dimensions, and becomes more and more effective as the number k of clusters increases.

The approach operates by examining all hypotheses about pairings between sensed data and object surfaces and efficiently discarding inconsistent ones by using local constraints on: distances between faces, angles between face normals, and angles (relative to the surface normals) of vectors between sensed points. The method described here is an extension of a method for recognition and localization of nonoverlapping parts previously described in [18] and [15]."

Discovering associations between items in a large database is one such data mining activity. In finding associations, support is used as an indicator as to whether an association is interesting. In this paper, we discuss three alternative interest measures for associations: any-confidence, all-confidence, and bond. We prove that the important downward closure property applies to both all-confidence and bond. We show that downward closure does not hold for any-confidence. We also prove that, if associations have a minimum all-confidence or minimum bond, then those associations will have a given lower bound on their minimum support and the rules produced from those associations will have a given lower bound on their minimum confidence as well. However, associations that have that minimum support (and likewise their rules that have minimum confidence) may not satisfy the minimum all-confidence or minimum bond constraint. We describe the algorithms that efficiently find all associations with a minimum all-confidence or minimum bond and present some experimental results."

The system we propose consists of: a pre-processing phase, a phase for mining the resulted transactional database, and a final phase to organize the resulted association rules in a classification model. The experimental results show that the method performs well, reaching over 80% in accuracy. Moreover, this paper illustrates how important the data cleaning phase is in building an accurate data mining architecture for image classification."

The author extends current methods of parameter solving to handle objects with arbitrary curved surfaces and with any number of internal parameters representing articulation, variable dimensions, or surface deformations. Numerical stabilization methods are developed that take account of inherent inaccuracies in the image measurements and allow useful solutions to be determined even when there are fewer matches than unknown parameters. The Levenberg-Marquardt method is used to always ensure convergence of the solution. These techniques allow model-based vision to be used for a much wider class of problems than was possible with previous methods. Their application is demonstrated for tracking the motion of curved, parameterized objects. >"

These applications require a new model of association between pairs of elements in streams. We develop an algorithm, Streaming-Rules, to report association rules with tight guarantees on errors, using limited processing per element, and minimal space. The modular design of Streaming-Rules allows for integration with current stream management systems, since it employs existing techniques for finding frequent elements. The presentation emphasizes the applicability of the algorithm to fraud detection in advertising networks. Such fraud instances have not been successfully detected by current techniques. Our experiments on synthetic data demonstrate scalability and efficiency. On real data, potential fraud was discovered."

However, even though RFID tags are continuously falling in price, their widespread use on consumer items is still several years away, rendering large-scale experiments with such an ''internet of things'' difficult. Much more ubiquitous are printed bar codes, yet so far their recognition required either specialized scanner equipment or custom-tailored bar codes an equally significant deployment hurdle. We have developed a freely available EAN-13 bar code recognition and information system that is both lightweight and fast enough for the use on camera equipped mobile phones, thus significantly lowering the barrier for large-scale, realworld testing of novel information and interaction applications based on ''connected'' physical objects. This demo presents our main contribution: A toolkit, consisting of a J2ME client for the barcode recognition on camera phones and a corresponding Java based server for linking the recognized product code to free and commercial databases on the internet, as well as two simple prototypical services (applications) based on this toolkit. With these tools, researchers can quickly develop fullfledged information and interaction applications based on EAN-13 product codes, and deploy them with a simple download to potentially large user bases in a much more effective manner than with the previously necessary special scanning equipment. We hope that this ''low tech'' version of bridging the gap will allow the community to quickly develop and try out more realistic and widespread applications, and thus gain real-world experiences for better jump-starting the future internet of things, today."

From this field comes a large demand for cheaper and more flexible ways of 3D reconstruction. This paper describes a web-based 3D reconstruction service, developed to relieve those needs of the cultural heritage field. This service consists of a pipeline that starts with the user uploading images of an object or scene(s) he wants to reconstruct in 3D. The automatic reconstruction process, running on a server connected to a cluster of computers, computes the camera calibration, as well as dense depth (or range-) maps for the images. This result can be downloaded from an ftp server and visualized with a specific tool running on the user\u2019s PC."

The rapid developme nt of Web-based learning and new concepts like virtual classrooms, virtual laboratories and virtual universities introduces many new issues to be addressed. On the technical side, we need to develop effective e-technologies for supporting distance education. On the learning and management side, we need to consider issues such as new style of learning and different system set-u p requirements. Finally, the issue of standardization of e-Iearning systems should also be considered. In this special issue, our focus will be on the technical side, although other issues related to knowledge and data engineering for e-Iearning may also be considered. Topics: In this special issue, we call for original papers describing novel knowledge and data engineering techniques that support e-Iearning. Preference will be given to papers that include an evaluation of users' experience in using the proposed methods. Areas of interests include, but are not limited to: \u2022 Semantic Web technology for e-Iearning \u2022 Data modeling (eg., XML) for efficient management of course materials \u2022 Searching and indexing techniques to suppo rt effective course notes retrieval \u2022 User-centric e-Iearning systems and user interaction management \u2022 Profiling techniques to support grading and learning recommendation \u2022 Data and knowledge base suppo rt for pervasive e-Iearning \u2022 Course material analysis and understanding \u2022 Automatic generation of questions and answers \u2022 Collaborative communities for e-Iearning"

It appears in new format, an octavo size, approximately that of a popular magazine, instead of a quarto ; and it is now published by the Cambridge University Press. Discovery, since its foundation soon after the Great War, with Sir J. J. Thorn on, Sir Frederic Kenyon and the late Prof. R. S. Conway as its trustees, has consistently maintained a high standard of accuracy and a uniform distinction in style in bringing before an educated, but non-technical, public, information relating to the latest advances in knowledge and scientific discovery. Originally published by the house of John Murray, it was transferred to Messrs. Benn Bros, in 1924, by whom it has been published since that date until March of the current year, when responsibility for its future production was accepted by the Syndics of the Cambridge University Press. Dr. C. P. Snow, of Christ's College, Cambridge, will act as editor. Although the form of publication is changed, there will be no break in policy, which under the general supervision of the Committee representing the Trustees will be to continue to place before its readers, so far as possible, an accurate and universal view of advance, not only in physics, astronomy, biochemistry and medicine, but also in archaeology, travel, architecture and the like in terms and phrasing of general appeal. The first issue in the new form holds out every hope of the fullest attainment of this aim. Among the contributors are Sir James Jeans, who writes on \u201cThe Origin of the Planets\", and Dr. L. Infeld, a pupil of and collaborator with Prof. Einstein, on \"Holes in Empty Space\u201d, while Mr. R. Philmore and Dr. J. Judkin contribute an amusing inquest on the scientific aspects of methods of murder in detective fiction. An article on new developments in colour photography is illustrated by a colour plate taken on the New Agfacolour film. We wish the new editor and publishers every success in their endeavour to enlarge popular interest in the progress of science."

In this paper we regard learning as the phenomenon of knowledge acquisition in the absence of explicit programming. We give a precise methodology for studying this phenomenon from a computational viewpoint. It consists of choosing an appropriate information gathering mechanism, the learning protocol, and exploring the class of concepts that can be learnt using it in a reasonable (polynomial) number of steps. We find that inherent algorithmic complexity appears to set serious limits to the range of concepts that can be so learnt. The methodology and results suggest concrete principles for designing realistic learning systems."

                "text": "Web mediated communications revolutionized traditional social interactions. It is designed to facilitate information exchange between individuals and to enable people to connect with friends, family, classmates etc. virtually. By the formation of virtual communities, \u201cweb mediated communication\u201d is defined as a wider concept known as \u201csocial media\u201d. Social media enhances the volume of communications and interpersonal interactions based on the power of web 2.0 technology. People join to the virtual communities of online social networks to procure information from everywhere, share ideas, experiences, photos, videos and memorable moments while extending friendships beyond the geographical and cultural borders. The emergence and fast growth of social media among people added value to the web activities and convinced web masters to integrate web services such as e-mail, chat, discussion rooms, forums and third party applications to the social media web sites. Many of social media web sites are hosting millions of members, equipping their web sites with communication tools, sharing options, dynamic content creation and collaborative authoring facilities which never experienced before. Facebook, Twitter and GooglePlus are examples of most known social media web sites which gained popularity among people so fast. Social media helps people to make new friends, find lost friends and old classmates while providing an opportunity to build new friendships. This new communication technology empowers people to collaborate in authoring of the web content and causes the information sharing synergy. Such positive aspects are enough for people to ignore the consequences of joining social media. Despite the rise of friendships in number, the physical encounters are substituted by virtual ones which causes weak friendship ties. In addition, social media platforms promise the security and privacy of users, but issues such as identity theft and worm attacks threaten users' privacy and security. Social media is in its infancy, adopted among people for less than a decade whereas a lack of research in this field is evident. The author of this thesis aimed at filling this gap by investigating the positive and negative effects of using social media through collecting the users' experiences and professionals' viewpoints. Theoretical study primarily illuminated the main positive and negative aspects while the findings of empirical research verified by theoretical study identified other practical effects and aspects of social media."

This paper describes the history of the Classroom 2000 project and provides results of extended evaluations of the effect of automated capture on the teaching and learning experience. There are many important lessons to take away from this long-term, large-scale experiment with a living, ubiquitous computing environment.

Based on this lexicographic order gSpan adopts the depth-first search strategy to mine frequent connected subgraphs efficiently. Our performance study shows that gSpan substantially outperforms previous algorithms, sometimes by an order of magnitude."

Already today, devices like a notebook computer or a personal digital assistent (PDA) can easily connect to the Internet via IEEE 802.11 networks (WaveLAN) or similar technologies provided at so-called hot-spots. In the near future, even smaller devices can join a wireless network to exchange status information or send and receive commands. In this paper, we present sample uses of a generic Bluetooth component that we have developed and that has been successfully integrated into various mininature devices to transmit sensor data or exchange control commands. The use of standard protocols like TCP/IP, Obex, and HTTP simplifies the use of those devices with conventional devices (notebook, PDA, cell-phone) without even requiring special drivers or applications for these devices. While such scenarios have already often been dreamt of, we are able to present a working solution based on small and cost-effective standard elements. We describe two applications that illustrate the power this approach in the broad area of e-commerce, e-learning, and e-government: the BlueWand, a small, pen-like device that can control Bluetooth devices in its vincinity by simple gestures, and a door plate that can display messages that are posted to it e.g. by a Bluetooth PDA."
