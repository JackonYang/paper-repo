The polarities of words in a sentence are not always the same as that of the sentence, because there can be polarity-shifters such as negation expressions. The proposed method models the polarity-shifters. Our model can be trained in two different ways: word-wise and sentence-wise learning. In sentence-wise learning, the model can be trained so that the prediction of sentence polarities should be accurate. The model can also combined with features used in previous work such as bag-of-words and n-grams. We empirically show that our method improves the performance of sentiment classification of sentences especially when we have only small amount of training data."

Motivation for this task comes from the desire to provide tools for information analysts in government, commercial, and political domains, who want to automatically track attitudes and feelings in the news and on-line forums. How do people feel about recent events in the Middle East? Is the rhetoric from a particular opposition group intensifying? What is the range of opinions being expressed in the world press about the best course of action in Iraq? A system that could automatically identify opinions and emotions from text would be an enormous help to someone trying to answer these kinds of questions. Researchers from many subareas of Artificial Intelligence and Natural Language Processing have been working on the automatic identification of opinions and related tasks. To date, most such work has focused on sentiment or subjectivity classification at the document or sentence level. Document classification tasks include, for example, distinguishing editorials from news articles and classifying reviews as positive or negative. A common sentence-level task is to classify sentences as subjective or objective. This paper presents a new approach to phrase-level sentiment analysis that first determines whether an expression is neutral or polar and then disambiguates the polarity of the polar expressions. With this approach, the system is able to automatically identify the contextual polarity for a large subset of sentiment expressions, achieving results that are significantly better than baseline."

Using movie reviews as data, we find that standard machine learning techniques definitively outperform human-produced baselines. However, the three machine learning methods we employed (Naive Bayes, maximum entropy classification, and support vector machines) do not perform as well on sentiment classification as on traditional topic-based categorization. We conclude by examining factors that make the sentiment classification problem more challenging."

In particular, words or constituents within the expression can interact with each other to yield a particular overall polarity. In this paper, we view such subsentential interactions in light of compositional semantics, and present a novel learning-based approach that incorporates structural inference motivated by compositional semantics into the learning procedure. Our experiments show that (1) simple heuristics based on compositional semantics can perform better than learning-based methods that do not incorporate compositional semantics (accuracy of 89.7% vs. 89.1%), but (2) a method that integrates compositional semantics into learning performs better than all other alternatives (90.7%). We also find that \"content-word negators\", not widely employed in previous work, play an important role in determining expression-level polarity. Finally, in contrast to conventional wisdom, we find that expression-level classification accuracy uniformly decreases as additional, potentially disambiguating, context is considered."

Our aim is to develop a method for extracting opinions that represent evaluation of concumer products in a structured form. To achieve the goal, we need to consider some issues that are relevant to the extraction task: How the task of opinion extraction and structurization should be designed, and how to extract the opinions which we defined. We define an opinion unit consisting of a quadruple, that is, the opinion holder, the subject being evaluated, the part or the attribute in which it is evaluated, and the evaluation that expresses positive or negative assessment. In this task, we focus on two subtasks (a) extracting subject/aspect-evaluation relations, and (b) extracting subject/aspect-aspect relations, we approach each extraction task using a machine learning-based method. In this paper, we discuss how customer reviews in web documents can be best structured. We also report on the results of our experiments and discuss future directions."

In this paper we show that the latent-dynamics (i.e., hidden substructure of shallow phrases) constitutes a problem in shallow parsing, and we show that modeling this intermediate structure is useful. By analyzing the automatically learned hidden states, we show how the latent conditional model explicitly learn latent-dynamics. We propose in this paper the Best Label Path (BLP) inference algorithm, which is able to produce the most probable label sequence on latent conditional models. It outperforms two existing inference algorithms. With the BLP inference, the LDCRF model significantly outperforms CRF models on word features, and achieves comparable performance of the most successful shallow parsers on the CoNLL data when further using part-of-speech features."

This wasthe \ufb01rst effort to produce a multi-lingual test collectionfor evaluating opinion extraction at NTCIR.Opinion and sentiment analysis has been receivinga lot of attention in the natural language processing re-search community recently [2, 9, 7]. With the broadrange of information sources available on the web,and rapid increase in the uptake of social community-oriented websites that foster user-generated contentthere has been further interest by both commercial andgovernmental parties in trying to automatically ana-lyze and monitor the tide of prevalent attitudes on theweb. As a result, interest in automatically detectingsentences in which an opinion is expressed ([12] etc.),the polarity of the expression ([13] etc.), targets, andopinion holders ([1] etc.) has been receiving more at-tention in the research community. Applications in-clude tracking response to and opinions about com-mercial products, governmental policies, tracking blogentries for potential political scandals and so on.In the Sixth NTCIR Workshop, a new pilot task foropinion analysis has been introduced. The pilot taskhas tracks in three languages: Chinese, English, andJapanese. In this paper, we present an overview of thetest collection, task design, and evaluation results us-ing the test collection across the Chinese, Japanese,and English data.We believe that this pilot task presents a unique op-portunity to expand the study of opinionated text anal-ysis across languages due to the comparable nature ofthe corpus. The documents have been carefully se-lected based on the manual relevance judgments as-signed in a cross-lingual Information Retrieval task,ensuring a high quality corpus that is relevant in allthree languages.This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2,we explain the task design for the"

In this paper, we develop a discriminative framework for simultaneous sequence segmentation and labeling which can capture both intrinsic and extrinsic class dynamics. Our approach incorporates hidden state variables which model the sub-structure of a class sequence and learn dynamics between class labels. Each class label has a disjoint set of associated hidden states, which enables efficient training and inference in our model. We evaluated our method on the task of recognizing human gestures from unsegmented video streams and performed experiments on three different datasets of head and eye gestures. Our results demonstrate that our model compares favorably to Support Vector Machines, Hidden Markov Models, and Conditional Random Fields on visual gesture recognition tasks."

We compare its performance with that of the method developed by Buckley and LeNir (1985), which combines cycles of BFGS steps and conjugate direction steps. Our numerical tests indicate that the L-BFGS method is faster than the method of Buckley and LeNir, and is better able to use additional storage to accelerate convergence. We show that the L-BFGS method can be greatly accelerated by means of a simple scaling. We then compare the L-BFGS method with the partitioned quasi-Newton method of Griewank and Toint (1982a). The results show that, for some problems, the partitioned quasi-Newton method is clearly superior to the L-BFGS method. However we find that for other problems the L-BFGS method is very competitive due to its low iteration cost. We also study the convergence properties of the L-BFGS method, and prove global convergence on uniformly convex problems."
