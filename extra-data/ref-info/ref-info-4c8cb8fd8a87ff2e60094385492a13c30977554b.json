The techniques are derived from the fields of image processing. pattern recognition, and machine vision. The objective in document image analysis is to recognize page contents including layout, text, and figures. Although optical character recognition (OCR) fds within the context of document image analysis. we do not cover this area. since OCR techniques have been covered extensively in the literature. We also limit the focus to images containing binary information. Topics covered are segmentation of document image into text and graphics regions, vectorization to obtain lines, identification of graphical primitives, and generation of succinct image interpretations."

Because the Hough transform is computationally expensive, the amount of data within a document image is reduced through the computation of its horizontal and vertical black runlengths. Histograms of these runlengths are used to determine whether the document is in portrait or landscape orientation. A gray scale burst image is created from the black runlengths that are perpendicular to the text lines by placing the length of the run in the run's bottom-most pixel. By creating a burst image from the original document image, the processing time of the Hough transform can be reduced by a factor of as much as 7.4 for documents with gray-scale images. Because only small runlengths are input to the Hough transform and because the accumulator array is incremented by the runlength associated with a pixel rather than by a factor of 1, the negative effects of noise, black margins, and figures are avoided. Consequently, interline spacing can be determined more accurately.<<ETX>>"
