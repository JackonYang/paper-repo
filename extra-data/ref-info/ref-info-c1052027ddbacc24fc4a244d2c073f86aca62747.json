Given a natural language question, DEANNA translates questions into a structured SPARQL query that can be evaluated over knowledge bases such as Yago, Dbpedia, Freebase, or other Linked Data sources. DEANNA analyzes questions and maps verbal phrases to relations and noun phrases to either individual entities or semantic classes. Importantly, it judiciously generates variables for target entities or classes to express joins between multiple triple patterns. We leverage the semantic type system for entities and use constraints in jointly mapping the constituents of the question to relations, classes, and entities. We demonstrate the capabilities and interface of DEANNA, which allows advanced users to influence the translation process and to see how the different components interact to produce the final result."

In the previous work, we developed FREyA, an interactive Natural Language Interface for querying ontologies. It uses syntactic parsing in combination with the ontology-based lookup in order to interpret the question, and involves the user if necessary. The user's choices are used for training the system in order to improve its performance over time. In this paper, we discuss the suitability of FREyA to query the Linked Open Data. We report its performance in terms of precision and recall using the MusicBrainz and DBpedia datasets."

Formulating information needs with conventional structured query languages is difficult due to the sheer size of schema information available to the user. We address this challenge by proposing a new query language that blends keyword search with structured query processing over large information graphs with rich semantics. Our formalism for structured queries based on keywords combines the flexibility of keyword search with the expressiveness of structures queries. We propose a solution to the resulting disambiguation problem caused by introducing keywords as primitives in a structured query language. We show how expressions in our proposed language can be rewritten using the vocabulary of the web-extracted KB, and how different possible rewritings can be ranked based on their syntactic relationship to the keywords in the query as well as their semantic coherence in the underlying KB. An extensive experimental study demonstrates the efficiency and effectiveness of our approach. Additionally, we show how our query language fits into QUICK, an end-to-end information system that integrates web-extracted data graphs with full-text search. In this system, the rewritten query describes an arbitrary topic of interest for which corresponding entities, and documents relevant to the entities, are efficiently retrieved."

Question answering approaches have been proposed as a good compromise between intuitiveness and expressivity. Most question answering systems translate questions into triples which are matched against the RDF data to retrieve an answer, typically relying on some similarity metric. However, in many cases, triples do not represent a faithful representation of the semantic structure of the natural language question, with the result that more expressive queries can not be answered. To circumvent this problem, we present a novel approach that relies on a parse of the question to produce a SPARQL template that directly mirrors the internal structure of the question. This template is then instantiated using statistical entity identification and predicate detection. We show that this approach is competitive and discuss cases of questions that can be answered with our approach but not with competing approaches."

For example, large knowledge bases have been automatically constructed by information extraction from Wikipedia and other Web sources. Entities and relationships can be represented by subject-property-object triples in the RDF model, and can then be precisely searched by structured query languages like SPARQL. Because of their Boolean-match semantics, such queries often return too few or even no results. To improve recall, it is thus desirable to support users by automatically relaxing or reformulating queries in such a way that the intention of the original user query is preserved while returning a sufficient number of ranked results. \n \nIn this paper we describe comprehensive methods to relax SPARQL-like triplepattern queries in a fully automated manner. Our framework produces a set of relaxations by means of statistical language models for structured RDF data and queries. The query processing algorithms merge the results of different relaxations into a unified result list, with ranking based on any ranking function for structured queries over RDF-data. Our experimental evaluation, with two different datasets about movies and books, shows the effectiveness of the automatically generated relaxations and the improved quality of query results based on assessments collected on the Amazon Mechanical Turk platform."

These collections can be viewed as graphs of entities and relationships (ER graphs) and can be represented as a set of subject-property-object (SPO) triples in the Semantic-Web data model RDF. Queries can be expressed in the W3C-endorsed SPARQL language or by similarly designed graph-pattern search. However, exact-match query semantics often fall short of satisfying the users' needs by returning too many or too few results. Therefore, IR-style ranking models are crucially needed. In this paper, we propose a language-model-based approach to ranking the results of exact, relaxed and keyword-augmented graph pattern queries over RDF graphs such as ER graphs. Our method estimates a query model and a set of result-graph models and ranks results based on their Kullback-Leibler divergence with respect to the query model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our ranking model by a comprehensive user study."

We need systems that allow a user to ask a question in everyday language and receive an answer quickly and succinctly, with sufficient context to validate the answer. Current search engines can return ranked lists of documents, but they do not deliver answers to the user. Question answering systems address this problem. Recent successes have been reported in a series of question-answering evaluations that started in 1999 as part of the Text Retrieval Conference (TREC). The best systems are now able to answer more than two thirds of factual questions in this evaluation."

The resulting link detector and disambiguator performs very well, with recall and precision of almost 75%. This performance is constant whether the system is evaluated on Wikipedia articles or \"real world\" documents.\n This work has implications far beyond enriching documents with explanatory links. It can provide structured knowledge about any unstructured fragment of text. Any task that is currently addressed with bags of words - indexing, clustering, retrieval, and summarization to name a few - could use the techniques described here to draw on a vast network of concepts and semantics."

We describe BANKS, a system which enables keyword-based search on relational databases, together with data and schema browsing. BANKS enables users to extract information in a simple manner without any knowledge of the schema or any need for writing complex queries. A user can get information by typing a few keywords, following hyperlinks, and interacting with controls on the displayed results. BANKS models tuples as nodes in a graph, connected by links induced by foreign key and other relationships. Answers to a query are modeled as rooted trees connecting tuples that match individual keywords in the query. Answers are ranked using a notion of proximity coupled with a notion of prestige of nodes based on inlinks, similar to techniques developed for Web search. We present an efficient heuristic algorithm for finding and ranking query results."

In this paper, we extend question-answering techniques, first studied in the information retrieval literature, to the web and experimentally evaluate their performance.First we introduce Mulder, which we believe to be the first general-purpose, fully-automated question-answering system available on the web. Second, we describe Mulder's architecture, which relies on multiple search-engine queries, natural-language parsing, and a novel voting procedure to yield reliable answers coupled with high recall. Finally, we compare Mulder's performance to that of Google and AskJeeves on questions drawn from the TREC-8 question answering track. We find that Mulder's recall is more than a factor of three higher than that of AskJeeves. In addition, we find that Google requires 6.6 times as much user effort to achieve the same level of recall as Mulder."

Several systems have been proposed to link spots on Web pages to entities in Wikipedia. They are largely based on local compatibility between the text around the spot and textual metadata associated with the entity. Two recent systems exploit inter-label dependencies, but in limited ways. We propose a general collective disambiguation approach. Our premise is that coherent documents refer to entities from one or a few related topics or domains. We give formulations for the trade-off between local spot-to-entity compatibility and measures of global coherence between entities. Optimizing the overall entity assignment is NP-hard. We investigate practical solutions based on local hill-climbing, rounding integer linear programs, and pre-clustering entities followed by local optimization within clusters. In experiments involving over a hundred manually-annotated Web pages and tens of thousands of spots, our approaches significantly outperform recently-proposed algorithms."

This paper shows that the output of state-of-the-art Open IE systems is rife with uninformative and incoherent extractions. To overcome these problems, we introduce two simple syntactic and lexical constraints on binary relations expressed by verbs. We implemented the constraints in the ReVerb Open IE system, which more than doubles the area under the precision-recall curve relative to previous extractors such as TextRunner and woepos. More than 30% of ReVerb's extractions are at precision 0.8 or higher---compared to virtually none for earlier systems. The paper concludes with a detailed analysis of ReVerb's errors, suggesting directions for future work."

This paper presents a robust method for collective disambiguation, by harnessing context from knowledge bases and using a new form of coherence graph. It unifies prior approaches into a comprehensive framework that combines three measures: the prior probability of an entity being mentioned, the similarity between the contexts of a mention and a candidate entity, as well as the coherence among candidate entities for all mentions together. The method builds a weighted graph of mentions and candidate entities, and computes a dense subgraph that approximates the best joint mention-entity mapping. Experiments show that the new method significantly outperforms prior methods in terms of accuracy, with robust behavior across a variety of inputs."

As the Web becomes ever more enmeshed with our daily lives, there is a growing desire for direct access to raw data not currently available on the Web or bound up in hypertext documents. Linked Data provides a publishing paradigm in which not only documents, but also data, can be a first class citizen of the Web, thereby enabling the extension of the Web with a global data space based on open standards - the Web of Data. In this Synthesis lecture we provide readers with a detailed technical introduction to Linked Data. We begin by outlining the basic principles of Linked Data, including coverage of relevant aspects of Web architecture. The remainder of the text is based around two main themes - the publication and consumption of Linked Data. Drawing on a practical Linked Data scenario, we provide guidance and best practices on: architectural approaches to publishing Linked Data; choosing URIs and vocabularies to identify and describe resources; deciding what data to return in a description of a resource on the Web; methods and frameworks for automated linking of data sets; and testing and debugging approaches for Linked Data deployments. We give an overview of existing Linked Data applications and then examine the architectures that are used to consume Linked Data from the Web, alongside existing tools and frameworks that enable these. Readers can expect to gain a rich technical understanding of Linked Data fundamentals, as the basis for application development, research or further study.

Drawing on a practical Linked Data scenario, we provide guidance and best practices on: architectural approaches to publishing Linked Data; choosing URIs and vocabularies to identify and describe resources; deciding what data to return in a description of a resource on the Web; methods and frameworks for automated linking of data sets; and testing and debugging approaches for Linked Data deployments. We give an overview of existing Linked Data applications and then examine the architectures that are used to consume Linked Data from the Web, alongside existing tools and frameworks that enable these. Readers can expect to gain a rich technical understanding of Linked Data fundamentals, as the basis for application development, research or further study."

In this paper, we provide a high-level overview of the TyCor framework and discuss how it is integrated in Watson, focusing on and evaluating three TyCor components that leverage the community built semi-structured and structured knowledge resources -- DBpedia (in conjunction with the YAGO ontology), Wikipedia Categories and Lists. These resources complement each other well in terms of precision and granularity of type information, and through links to Wikipedia, provide coverage for a large set of instances."

YAGO builds on entities and relations and currently contains more than 1 million entities and 5 million facts. This includes the Is-A hierarchy as well as non-taxonomic relations between entities (such as HASONEPRIZE). The facts have been automatically extracted from Wikipedia and unified with WordNet, using a carefully designed combination of rule-based and heuristic methods described in this paper. The resulting knowledge base is a major step beyond WordNet: in quality by adding knowledge about individuals like persons, organizations, products, etc. with their semantic relationships - and in quantity by increasing the number of facts by more than an order of magnitude. Our empirical evaluation of fact correctness shows an accuracy of about 95%. YAGO is based on a logically clean model, which is decidable, extensible, and compatible with RDFS. Finally, we show how YAGO can be further extended by state-of-the-art information extraction techniques."

In the IBM Watson\u2122 system, these hypotheses are potential answers to Jeopardy!\u2122 questions and are generated by two components: search and candidate generation. The search component retrieves content relevant to a given question from Watson's knowledge resources. The candidate generation component identifies potential answers to the question from the retrieved content. In this paper, we present strategies developed to use characteristics of Watson's different knowledge sources and to formulate effective search queries against those sources. We further discuss a suite of candidate generation strategies that use various kinds of metadata, such as document titles or anchor texts in hyperlinked documents. We demonstrate that a combination of these strategies brings the correct answer into the candidate answer pool for 87.17% of all the questions in a blind test set, facilitating high end-to-end question-answering performance."

                "text": "The TREC 2003 question answering track contained two tasks, the passages task and the main task. In the passages task, systems returned a single text snippet in response to factoid questions; the evaluation metric was the number of snippets that contained a correct answer. The main task contained three separate types of questions, factoid questions, list questions, and definition questions. Each of the questions was tagged as to its type and the different question types were evaluated separately. The final score for a main task run was a combination of the scores for the separate question types. This paper defines the various tasks included in the track and reports the evaluation results. Since the TREC 2003 track was the first time for significant participation in the definition and list subtasks, the paper also examines the reliability of the evaluation for these tasks. TREC introduced the first question answering (QA) track in TREC-8 (1999). The goal of the track is to foster research on systems that retrieve answers rather than documents in response to a question, with particular emphasis on systems that can function in unrestricted domains. The tasks in the track have evolved over the years to focus research on particular aspects of the problem deemed important to improving the state-of-the-art. The task in the original QA tracks required systems to return text snippets drawn from a large corpus of newspaper articles in response to closed-class or factoid questions such as Who invented the paper clip?. Each response was judged by a human assessor; a response was marked correct if an answer to the question was contained within the snippet. Unfortunately, the relative effectiveness of different systems was masked by the fact that two different snippets could both contain a correct answer while one was a significantly better response then the other [4]. To force systems to demonstrate their ability to locate the actual answer, the TREC 2002 task required systems to return exact answers, text strings consisting of a complete answer and nothing else. Strings that contained a right answer with additional text were judged to be \u201cinexact\u201d and did not contribute to a system\u2019s score. Pinpointing the precise extent of an answer is a more difficult problem than finding a text segment that contains an answer, and there are applications of QA technology that do not require this extra step. To provide a forum for research groups interested in these applications, the TREC 2003 track included a \u201cpassages\u201d task that allowed text segments containing answers to be returned. The other task in the track, the main task, required exact responses. While the test set of questions for the passages task contained only factoid questions, the main task contained list and definition questions as well as factoid questions. Each question type was evaluated separately, and the final score for a main task run was a combination of the scores for the three questions types. This paper provides an overview of the results of the TREC 2003 QA track. The first two sections describe the two tasks in the track and present the evaluation results for the tasks. Since the TREC 2003 track was the first time for significant participation in the definition and list subtasks, Section 4 examines the reliability of the evaluation used for these tasks. This analysis demonstrates that the evaluation results for the definition task must be interpreted with care as using different assessors can cause substantial changes in the relative evaluation scores. Using more questions in the definition test set should increase the stability of the evaluation."

                "text": "The TREC 2005 Question Answering track contained three tasks: the main question answering task, the document ranking task, and the relationship task. The main task was the same as the single TREC 2004 QA task. In the main task, question series were used to define a set of targets. Eac h series was about a single target and contained factoid and list questions. The final question in the series was an \u201cOt her\u201d question that asked for additional information about the target that was not covered by previous questions in the series. The document ranking task was to return a ranked list of documents for each question from a subset of the questions in the main task, where the documents were thought to contain an answer to the question. In the relationship tas k, systems were given TREC-like topic statements that ended with a question asking for evidence for a particular relationship. The goal of the TREC question answering (QA) track is to foster research on systems that return answers themselves, rather than documents containing answers, in response to a question. The track started in TREC-8 (1999), with the first several editions of the track focused on factoid questions. A factoid question is a fact-based, short answer question such as How many calories are there in a Big Mac? . The task in the TREC 2003 QA track was a combined task that contained list and definition questions in additio n to factoid questions [1]. A list question asks for differen t instances of a particular kind of information to be returned , such as List the names of chewing gums . Answering such questions requires a system to assemble an answer from information located in multiple documents. A definition question asks for interesting information about a particul ar person or thing such as Who is Vlad the Impaler?or What is a golden parachute?. Definition questions also require systems to locate inform ation in multiple documents, but in this case the information of interest is much less crisply de lineated. The TREC 2004 test set contained factoid and list questions grouped into different series, where each series had the target of a definition associated with it [2]. Each questi on in a series asked for some information about the target. In addition, the final question in each series was an explicit \u201cOther\u201d question, which was to be interpreted as \u201cTell me other interesting things about this target I don\u2019t know enou gh to ask directly\u201d. This last question is roughly equivalen t to the definition questions in the TREC 2003 task. Several concerns regarding the TREC 2005 QA track were raised during the TREC 2004 QA breakout session. Since the TREC 2004 task was rather different from previous years\u2019 tasks, there was the desire to repeat the task largely unchanged. There was also the desire to build infrastructure that would allow a closer examination of the role document retrieval techniques play in supporting QA technology. As a result of this discussion, the main task for the 2005 QA track was decided to be essentially the same as the 2004 task in that the test set would consist of a set of questio n series where each series asks for information regarding a particular target. As in TREC 2004, the targets included people, organizations, and other entities (things); unlike TREC 2004 the target could also be an event. Events were added since the document set from which the answers are to be drawn are newswire articles. The runs were evaluated using the same methodology as in TREC 2004, except that the primary measure was the per-series score instead of the combined component score. The document ranking task was added to the TREC 2005 track to address the concern regarding document retrieval and QA. The task was to submit, for a subset of 50 of the questions in the main task, a ranked list of up to 1000 documents for each question. Groups whose primary emphasis was document retrieval rather than QA, were allowed to participate in the document ranking task without submitting actual answers for the main task. However, all TREC 2005 submissions to the main task were required to include a ranked list of documents for each question in the document"

The extent of the challenge includes fielding a real-time automatic contestant on the show, not merely a laboratory exercise. The Jeopardy! Challenge helped us address requirements that led to the design of the DeepQA architecture and the implementation of Watson. After 3 years of intense research and development by a core team of about 20 researches, Watson is performing at human expert-levels in terms of precision, confidence and speed at the Jeopardy! Quiz show. Our results strongly suggest that DeepQA is an effective and extensible architecture that may be used as a foundation for combining, deploying, evaluating and advancing a wide range of algorithmic techniques to rapidly advance the field of QA."
