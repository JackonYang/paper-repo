These are ensembles of decision trees that act directly on image pixels, and therefore do not need the expensive computation of filter-bank responses or local descriptors. They are extremely fast to both train and test, especially compared with k-means clustering and nearest-neighbor assignment of feature descriptors. The nodes in the trees provide (i) an implicit hierarchical clustering into semantic textons, and (ii) an explicit local classification estimate. Our second contribution, the bag of semantic textons, combines a histogram of semantic textons over an image region with a region prior category distribution. The bag of semantic textons is computed over the whole image for categorization, and over local rectangular regions for segmentation. Including both histogram and region prior allows our segmentation algorithm to exploit both textural and semantic context. Our third contribution is an image-level prior for segmentation that emphasizes those categories that the automatic categorization believes to be present. We evaluate on two datasets including the very challenging VOC 2007 segmentation dataset. Our results significantly advance the state-of-the-art in segmentation accuracy, and furthermore, our use of efficient decision forests gives at least a five-fold increase in execution speed."

To this end we combine three ingredients: (i) shape and appearance representations that support spatial pyramid matching over a region of interest. This generalizes the representation of Lazebnik et al., (2006) from an image to a region of interest (ROI), and from appearance (visual words) alone to appearance and local shape (edge distributions); (ii) automatic selection of the regions of interest in training. This provides a method of inhibiting background clutter and adding invariance to the object instance 's position; and (iii) the use of random forests (and random ferns) as a multi-way classifier. The advantage of such classifiers (over multi-way SVM for example) is the ease of training and testing. Results are reported for classification of the Caltech-101 and Caltech-256 data sets. We compare the performance of the random forest/ferns classifier with a benchmark multi-way SVM classifier. It is shown that selecting the ROI adds about 5% to the performance and, together with the other improvements, the result is about a 10% improvement over the state of the art for Caltech-256."

Large numbers of descriptors and large codebooks are needed for good results and this becomes slow using k-means.

This technique works by partitioning the image into increasingly fine sub-regions and computing histograms of local features found inside each sub-region. The resulting \"spatial pyramid\" is a simple and computationally efficient extension of an orderless bag-of-features image representation, and it shows significantly improved performance on challenging scene categorization tasks. Specifically, our proposed method exceeds the state of the art on the Caltech-101 database and achieves high accuracy on a large database of fifteen natural scene categories. The spatial pyramid framework also offers insights into the success of several recently proposed image descriptions, including Torralba\u2019s \"gist\" and Lowe\u2019s SIFT descriptors."

So far, intensity-based descriptors have been widely used for feature extraction at salient points. To increase illumination invariance and discriminative power, color descriptors have been proposed. Because many different descriptors exist, a structured overview is required of color invariant descriptors in the context of image category recognition. Therefore, this paper studies the invariance properties and the distinctiveness of color descriptors (software to compute the color descriptors from this paper is available from http://www.colordescriptors.com) in a structured way. The analytical invariance properties of color descriptors are explored, using a taxonomy based on invariance properties with respect to photometric transformations, and tested experimentally using a data set with known illumination conditions. In addition, the distinctiveness of color descriptors is assessed experimentally using two benchmarks, one from the image domain and one from the video domain. From the theoretical and experimental results, it can be derived that invariance to light intensity changes and light color changes affects category recognition. The results further reveal that, for light intensity shifts, the usefulness of invariance is category-specific. Overall, when choosing a single descriptor and no prior knowledge about the data set and object and scene categories is available, the OpponentSIFT is recommended. Furthermore, a combined set of color descriptors outperforms intensity-based SIFT and improves category recognition by 8 percent on the PASCAL VOC 2007 and by 7 percent on the Mediamill Challenge."

Our system is able to represent highly variable object classes and achieves state-of-the-art results in the PASCAL object detection challenges. While deformable part models have become quite popular, their value had not been demonstrated on difficult benchmarks such as the PASCAL data sets. Our system relies on new methods for discriminative training with partially labeled data. We combine a margin-sensitive approach for data-mining hard negative examples with a formalism we call latent SVM. A latent SVM is a reformulation of MI--SVM in terms of latent variables. A latent SVM is semiconvex, and the training problem becomes convex once latent information is specified for the positive examples. This leads to an iterative training algorithm that alternates between fixing latent values for positive examples and optimizing the latent SVM objective function."

This paper presents a simple but effective coding scheme called Locality-constrained Linear Coding (LLC) in place of the VQ coding in traditional SPM. LLC utilizes the locality constraints to project each descriptor into its local-coordinate system, and the projected coordinates are integrated by max pooling to generate the final representation. With linear classifier, the proposed approach performs remarkably better than the traditional nonlinear SPM, achieving state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks. Compared with the sparse coding strategy [22], the objective function used by LLC has an analytical solution. In addition, the paper proposes a fast approximated LLC method by first performing a K-nearest-neighbor search and then solving a constrained least square fitting problem, bearing computational complexity of O(M + K2). Hence even with very large codebooks, our system can still process multiple frames per second. This efficiency significantly adds to the practical values of LLC for real applications."

To enable a computer to do this is however a challenging task. Take people-playing-musical-instrument (PPMI) as an example; to distinguish a person playing violin from a person just holding a violin requires subtle distinction of characteristic image features and feature arrangements that differentiate these two scenes. Most of the existing image representation methods are either too coarse (e.g. BoW) or too sparse (e.g. constellation models) for performing this task. In this paper, we propose a new image feature representation called \u201cgrouplet\u201d. The grouplet captures the structured information of an image by encoding a number of discriminative visual features and their spatial configurations. Using a dataset of 7 different PPMI activities, we show that grouplets are more effective in classifying and detecting human-object interactions than other state-of-the-art methods. In particular, our method can make a robust distinction between humans playing the instruments and humans co-occurring with the instruments without playing."

Acc ordingly, we suggest a two-stage algorithm: First, a relational part based objec t model is learnt using unsegmented object images from the inclusive class (e.g., m otorcycles in general). The model is then used to build a class-specific vector repres ntation for images, where each entry corresponds to a model\u2019s part. In the second stage we train a standard discriminative classifier to classify subclass in ta ces (e.g., cross motorcycles) based on the class-specific vector representation.

                "text": "In this paper, a new learning framework - probabilistic boosting-tree (PBT), is proposed for learning two-class and multi-class discriminative models. In the learning stage, the probabilistic boosting-tree automatically constructs a tree in which each node combines a number of weak classifiers (evidence, knowledge,) into a strong classifier (a conditional posterior probability). It approaches the target posterior distribution by data augmentation (tree expansion) through a divide-and-conquer strategy. In the testing stage, the conditional probability is computed at each tree node based on the learned classifier, which guides the probability propagation in its sub-trees. The top node of the tree therefore outputs the overall posterior probability by integrating the probabilities gathered from its sub-trees. Also, clustering is naturally embedded in the learning phase and each sub-tree represents a cluster of certain level. The proposed framework is very general and it has interesting connections to a number of existing methods such as the A* algorithm, decision tree algorithms, generative models, and cascade approaches. In this paper, we show the applications of PBT for classification, detection, and object recognition. We have also applied the framework in segmentation"

The method applies to classes of objects that are recognizable by people with appropriate expertise (e.g., animal species or airplane model), but not (in general) by people without such expertise. It can be seen as a visual version of the 20 questions game, where questions based on simple visual attributes are posed interactively. The goal is to identify the true class while minimizing the number of questions asked, using the visual content of the image. We introduce a general framework for incorporating almost any off-the-shelf multi-class object recognition algorithm into the visual 20 questions game, and provide methodologies to account for imperfect user responses and unreliable computer vision algorithms. We evaluate our methods on Birds-200, a difficult dataset of 200 tightly-related bird species, and on the Animals With Attributes dataset. Our results demonstrate that incorporating user input drives up recognition accuracy to levels that are good enough for practical applications, while at the same time, computer vision reduces the amount of human interaction required."

The procedure is based on a very low dimensional representation of the scene, that we term the Spatial Envelope. We propose a set of perceptual dimensions (naturalness, openness, roughness, expansion, ruggedness) that represent the dominant spatial structure of a scene. Then, we show that these dimensions may be reliably estimated using spectral and coarsely localized information. The model generates a multidimensional space in which scenes sharing membership in semantic categories (e.g., streets, highways, coasts) are projected closed together. The performance of the spatial envelope model shows that specific information about object shape or identity is not a requirement for scene categorization and that modeling a holistic representation of the scene informs about its probable semantic category."

Both experiments demonstrated the same pattern of results: Low-pass filtering selectively impaired subordinate-level category verification, while having little to no effect on basic-level category verification. Subordinate categorization consequently relies to a greater degree on high spatial frequencies of images. This vulnerability of subordinate-level processing was specific to a lack of high spatial frequency information, as opposed to other visual information, since neither high-pass filtering nor the addition of phase noise produced a comparable reduction in performance. These results are consistent with the notion that object recognition at basic levels relies on the general shapes of objects, whereas recognition at subordinate levels relies on finer visual details."

The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund & R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference, ***, 148\u2013156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression."

Meanwhile, common human actions such as ''reading a book'', ''playing a guitar'' or ''writing notes'' also provide a natural description for many still images. In addition, some actions in video such as ''taking a photograph'' are static by their nature and may require recognition methods based on static cues only. Motivated by the potential impact of recognizing actions in still images and the little attention this problem has received in computer vision so far, we address recognition of human actions in consumer photographs. We construct a new dataset available at http://www.di.ens.fr/willow/research/stillactions/ with seven classes of actions in 911 Flickr images representing natural variations of human actions in terms of camera view-point, human pose, clothing, occlusions and scene background. We study action recognition in still images using the state-of-the-art bag-of-features methods as well as their combination with the part-based Latent SVM approach of Felzenszwalb et al. In particular, we investigate the role of background scene context and demonstrate that improved action recognition performance can be achieved by (i) combining the statistical and part-based representations, and (ii) integrating person-centric description with the background scene context. We show results on our newly collected dataset of seven common actions as well as demonstrate improved performance over existing methods on the datasets of Gupta et al. and Yao and Fei-Fei."
