Estimating such deformations constitutes an important subtask in several computer vision problems relating to image correspondence and shape estimation. The following subjects are treated: The problem of decomposing affine flow fields into simpler components is analysed in detail. A canonical parametrization is presented based on singular value decomposition, which naturally separates the rotationally invariant components of the flow field from the rotationally variant ones. A novel mechanism is presented for automatic selection of scale levels when estimating local affine deformations. This mechanism is expressed within a multiscale framework where disparity estimates are computed in a hierarchical coarse-to-fine manner and corrected using iterative techniques. Then, deformation estimates are selected from the scales that minimize a certain normalized residual over scales. Finally, the descriptors so obtained serve as initial data for computing refined estimates of the local deformations.<<ETX>>"

The texture distortion is modeled at a point in any particular direction on the image plane as an affine transformation. The parameters of the affine transform are related to the viewer. A technique is developed for estimating affine transforms between nearby image patches. It is based on solving a system of linear constraints derived from a differential analysis. Given the estimated affine transforms in a number of directions, it is possible to recover local shape and orientation of the surface. It is not necessary to explicitly identify texels or make restrictive assumptions about the nature of the image texture.

The need for two scale parameters is emphasized: a local scale, for describing the amount of smoothing used for suppressing noise and irrelevant details when computing primitive texture descriptors from image data; and an integration scale, for describing the size of the region in space over which the statistics of the local descriptors is accummulated. The proposed computational model is expressed completely in terms of different invariants defined from Gaussian derivatives at multiple scales in scale-space. The resulting texture description can be combined with various assumptions about surface texture to estimate local surface orientation. Two specific assumptions, weak isotropy and constant area, are explored in more detail. Results from experiments on real and synthetic reference data with known geometry that demonstrate the viability of the approach are presented.<<ETX>>"

In particular we show how the changes in first, second and third moments of edge orientation and changes in density are directly related to the rotation (curl), scale (divergence) and deformation components of an affine transformation. A simple implementation is described which does not require point, edge or contour correspondences to be established. It is tested on a wide range of repetitive and non-repetitive visual textures which are neither isotropic nor homogeneous. As a demonstration of the power of this technique the estimated affine transforms are used as the first stage in shape from texture and structure from motion applications."

The patches are filtered using gaussians and derivatives of gaussians. The problem of finding the affine transform is reduced to that of finding the appropriate deformed filter to use.

Witkin's (1987) maximum-likelihood algorithm for shape from texture. The method is based on analysis of the directional statistics of the input data. It can be applied to both smooth curves and polygons, open or closed curves, symmetric figures, and scattered texture edges; thus, it appears to have wider applicability than previous methods. The weak isotropy heuristic captures many important properties (such as various types of symmetry) of both random and regular planar shape, and it also leads to a computationally efficient estimation algorithm based on observables in the image which are direct correlates of the surface orientation. These correlates make it possible to compute an approximate estimate of surface orientation in a single step. In certain simple cases this first estimate is exactly right, and in experiments with natural images it is typically within 5 degrees of the final estimate.<<ETX>>"

Crucial information about three-dimensional structure is provided by the spatial distribution of surface markings, particularly for static monocular views: Projection distorts texture geometry in a manner tha depends systematically on surface shape and orientation. To isolate and measure this projective distortion in an image is to recover the three dimensional structure of the textured surface. For natural textures, we show that the uniform density assumption (texels are uniformly distributed) is enough to recover the orientation of a single textured plane in view, under perspective projection. Furthermore, when the texels cannot be found, the edges of the image are enough to determine shape, under a more general assumption, that the sum of the lengths of the contours on the world plane is about the same everywhere. Finally, several experimental results for synthetic and natural images are presented."

The theory is developed for the case when such orientation computations are necessary at all local neighborhoods of the n-dimensional Euclidean space. Detection of orientation is shown to correspond to fitting an axis or a plane to the Fourier transform of an n-dimensional structure. The solution of this problem is related to the solution of a well-known matrix eigenvalue problem. The computations can be performed in the spatial domain without actually doing a Fourier transformation. Along with the orientation estimate, a certainty measure, based on the error of the fit, is proposed. Two applications in image analysis are considered: texture segmentation and optical flow. The theory is verified by experiments which confirm accurate orientation estimates and reliable certainty measures in the presence of noise. The comparative results indicate that the theory produces algorithms computing robust texture features as well as optical flow. >"

An expression showing the dependence of localized image spectral moments on localized surface spectral moments and on local surface orientation is derived. The local image spectra are measured with wavelets, and the expression is solved for the surface orientation at each point. Because the method uses localized spectral information, it operates at a very low level in the visual hierarchy. No extraction of texture or edge elements is required. The wavelet-based computation used is biologically plausible, easily parallelized for rapid computation, and has been shown to be the basis for effective solutions to a variety of other vision tasks. The method is demonstrated on a number of real-world examples.<<ETX>>"

It is well known that under a weak perspective the image motion of points on a plane can be characterized by an affine transformation. It is shown that the relative image motion of a nearby non-coplanar point and its projection on the plane is equivalent to motion parallax, and because it is independent of view rotations it is a reliable geometric cue to 3-D shape and viewer/object motion. The authors summarize why structure from motion algorithms are often very sensitive to errors in the measured image velocities and then show how to efficiently and reliably extract an incomplete qualitative solution. They also show how to augment this into a complete solution if additional constraints or views are available. A real-time example is presented in which the 3-D visual interpretation of hand gestures or a hand-held object is used as part of a man-machine interface. This is an alternative to the Polhemus coil instrumented Dataglove commonly used in sensing manual gestures.<<ETX>>"

The so-called structure-from-motion problem is to infer the structure of these spatial configurations from the sequence of projections. For rigid transformations, a unique metrical reconstruction is known to be possible from three orthographic views of four points. However, human observers seem able to obtain much shape information from a mere pair of views, as is evident in the case of binocular stereo. Moreover, human observers seem to find little use for the information provided by additional views, even though some improvement certainly occurs. The rigidity requirement in its strict form is also relaxed. We indicate how solutions of the structure-from-motion problem can be stratified in such a way that one explicitly knows at which stages various a priori assumptions enter and specific geometrical expertise is required. An affine stage is identified at which only smooth deformation is assumed (thus no rigidity constraint is involved) and no metrical concepts are required. This stage allows one to find the spatial configuration (modulo an affinity) from two views. The addition of metrical methods allows one to find shape from two views, modulo a relief transformation (depth scaling and shear). The addition of a third view then merely serves to settle the calibration. Results of a numerical experiment are discussed."

The geometric information content of the gradient of binocular disparity is analyzed for the general case of a fixating system with symmetric or asymmetric vergence, and with either known or unknown viewing geometry. A computationally inexpensive technique which exploits this analysis is proposed. This technique allows a local estimate of surface orientation to be computed directly from the local statistics of the left and right image brightness gradients, without iterations or search.

                "text": "When computing descriptors of image data, the type of information that can be extracted may be strongly dependent on the scales at which the image operators are applied. This article presents a systematic methodology for addressing this problem. A mechanism is presented for automatic selection of scale levels when detecting one-dimensional image features, such as edges and ridges.A novel concept of a scale-space edge is introduced, defined as a connected set of points in scale-space at which: (i) the gradient magnitude assumes a local maximum in the gradient direction, and (ii) a normalized measure of the strength of the edge response is locally maximal over scales. An important consequence of this definition is that it allows the scale levels to vary along the edge. Two specific measures of edge strength are analyzed in detail, the gradient magnitude and a differential expression derived from the third-order derivative in the gradient direction. For a certain way of normalizing these differential descriptors, by expressing them in terms of so-called \u03b3-normalized derivatives, an immediate consequence of this definition is that the edge detector will adapt its scale levels to the local image structure. Specifically, sharp edges will be detected at fine scales so as to reduce the shape distortions due to scale-space smoothing, whereas sufficiently coarse scales will be selected at diffuse edges, such that an edge model is a valid abstraction of the intensity profile across the edge.Since the scale-space edge is defined from the intersection of two zero-crossing surfaces in scale-space, the edges will by definition form closed curves. This simplifies selection of salient edges, and a novel significance measure is proposed, by integrating the edge strength along the edge. Moreover, the scale information associated with each edge provides useful clues to the physical nature of the edge.With just slight modifications, similar ideas can be used for formulating ridge detectors with automatic selection, having the characteristic property that the selected scales on a scale-space ridge instead reflect the width of the ridge.It is shown how the methodology can be implemented in terms of straightforward visual front-end operations, and the validity of the approach is supported by theoretical analysis as well as experiments on real-world and synthetic data."

This is achieved by repeatedly convolving the signal with a very small averaging filter modulated by a measure of the signal discontinuity at each point. This process is related to the anisotropic diffusion reported by P. Perona and J. Malik (1987) but it has a much simpler formulation and is not subject to instability or divergence. Real examples show how this approach can be applied to the smoothing of various types of signals. The detected features do not move, and thus no tracking is needed. The last property makes it possible to derive a novel scale-space representation of a signal using a small number of scales. Finally, this process is easily implemented on parallel architectures: the running time on a 16 K connection machine is three orders of magnitude faster than on a serial machine.<<ETX>>"

The basic idea behind the algorithm is to use an oriented filter, namely the gradient of the Gaussian, and perform manipulations on the resulting gradient vector field. The most important aspect of the algorithm is that it is provably optimal in estimating the local orientations of an oriented texture. An added strength of the algorithm is that it is simpler and has a better signal-to-noise ratio than previous approaches, because it utilizes fewer derivative operations. Also proposed is a measure of coherence which is based on the use of the angle and coherence images as intrinsic images. An analysis of oriented textures requires the computation of these intrinsic images as a first step. In this sense, the computation of the orientation field, resulting in the intrinsic images, is indispensable in the analysis of oriented textures. Results from a number of experiments indicate the usefulness of the angle and coherence intrinsic images.<<ETX>>"

True elements are selected from the set of candidate elements by finding the planar surface that best predicts the observed areas of the latter. Results are shown for a variety of natural textures, including waves, flowers, rocks, clouds, and dirt clods. >"

The diffusion coefficient is chosen to vary spatially in such a way as to encourage intraregion smoothing rather than interregion smoothing. It is shown that the 'no new maxima should be generated at coarse scales' property of conventional scale space is preserved. As the region boundaries in the approach remain sharp, a high-quality edge detector which successfully exploits global information is obtained. Experimental results are shown on a number of images. Parallel hardware implementations are made feasible because the algorithm involves elementary, local operations replicated over the image. >"

We discuss these requirements and classify them into three categories: \u201carchitectural requirements\u201d like locality, recursivity and causality in the scale space, \u201cstability requirements\u201d like the comparison principle and \u201cmorphological requirements\u201d, which correspond to shape-preserving properties (rotation invariance, scale invariance, etc.). A complete classification is given of all image multiscale transforms satisfying these requirements. This classification yields a characterization of all classical models and includes new ones, which all are partial differential equations. The new models we introduce have more invariance properties than all the previously known models and in particular have a projection invariance essential for shape recognition. Numerical experiments are presented and compared. The same method is applied to the multiscale analysis of movies. By introducing a property of Galilean invariance, we find a single multiscale morphological model for movie analysis."

A genuinely discrete scale-space theory is developed and its connection to the continuous scale-space theory is explained. Special attention is given to discretization effects, which occur when results from the continuous scale-space theory are to be implemented computationally. The 1D problem is solved completely in an axiomatic manner. For the 2D problem, the author discusses how the 2D discrete scale space should be constructed. The main results are as follows: the proper way to apply the scale-space theory to discrete signals and discrete images is by discretization of the diffusion equation, not the convolution integral; the discrete scale space obtained in this way can be described by convolution with the kernel, which is the discrete analog of the Gaussian kernel, a scale-space implementation based on the sampled Gaussian kernel might lead to undesirable effects and computational problems, especially at fine levels of scale; the 1D discrete smoothing transformations can be characterized exactly and a complete catalogue is given; all finite support 1D discrete smoothing transformations arise from repeated averaging over two adjacent elements (the limit case of such an averaging process is described); and the symmetric 1D discrete smoothing kernels are nonnegative and unimodal, in both the spatial and the frequency domain. >"

We prove that in any dimension the only filter that does not create generic zero crossings as the scale increases is the Gaussian. This result can be generalized to apply to level crossings of any linear differential operator: it applies in particular to ridges and ravines in the image intensity. In the case of the second derivative along the gradient, there is no filter that avoids creation of zero crossings, unless the filtering is performed after the derivative is applied."

This article deals with the axiomatic formulation of the special type of multi-scale representation known as scale-space representation. Specifically, this work is concerned with the problem of how different choices of basic assumptions (scale-space axioms) restrict the class of permissible smoothing operations.A scale-space formulation previously expressed for discrete signals is adapted to the continuous domain. The basic assumptions are that the scale-space family should be generated by convolution with a one-parameter family of rotationally symmetric smoothing kernels that satisfy a semi-group structure and obey a causality condition expressed as a non-enhancement requirement of local extrema. Under these assumptions, it is shown that the smoothing kernel is uniquely determined to be a Gaussian.Relations between this scale scale-space formulation and recent formulations based on scale invariance are explained in detail. Connections are also pointed out to approaches based on non-uniform smoothing."
