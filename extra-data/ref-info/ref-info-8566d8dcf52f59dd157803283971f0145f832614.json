In the past, these dependencies have not been introduced into the mathematical model when designing an optimal pattern-recognition system. In this paper the optimal decision rule is derived under the assumption of Markov dependence among the patterns to be recognized. Subsequently, this decision rule is applied to character-recognition problems. The main idea is to balance appropriately the information which is obtained from contextual considerations and the information from measurements on the character being recognized and thus arrive at a decision using both. Bayes' decision in Markov chains is presented and this mode of decision is adapted to character recognition. A look-ahead mode of decision is presented. The problem of estimation of transition probabilities is discussed. The experimental system is described and results of experiments on English legal text and names are presented."

A binary matrix representation of signal is used in this paper. A nearest-neighbor dependence method is obtained by going beyond the usual assumption of statistical independence. The recognition network consists of three levels?a layer of AND gates, a set of linear summing networks in parallel, and a maximum selection circuit. Formulas for weights or recognition parameters are also derived, as logarithms of ratios of conditional probabilities. These formulas lead to a straightforward procedure of estimating weights from sample characters, which are then used in subsequent recognition. Simulation of the recognition method is performed on a digital computer. The program consists of two main operations-estimation of parameters from sample characters, and recognition using these estimated values. The experimental results indicate that the effect of neighbor dependence upon recognition performance is significant. On the basis of a rather small sample of 50 sets of hand-printed alphanumeric characters, the recognition performance of the nearest-neighbor method compares favorably with other recognition schemes."

We show that Latin square puzzles, finding N-ary relations, graph or auto-mata homomorphisms, graph colorings, as well as determining satisfiability of propositional logic statements and solving scene and edge labeling problems, are all special cases of the general consistent labeling problem. We then discuss the various approaches that researchers have used to speed up the tree search required to find consistent labelings. Each of these approaches uses a particular look-ahead operator to help eliminate backtracking in the tree search. Finally, we define the \u00bfKP two-parameter class of look-ahead operators which includes, as special cases, the operators other researchers have used."

                "text": "The Hearsay-II system, developed during the DARPA-sponsored five-year speech-understanding research program, represents both a specific solution to the speech-understanding problem and a general framework for coordinating independent processes to achieve cooperative problem-solving behavior. As a computational problem, speech understanding reflects a large number of intrinsically interesting issues. Spoken sounds are achieved by a long chain of successive transformations, from intentions, through semantic and syntactic structuring, to the eventually resulting audible acoustic waves. As a consequence, interpreting speech means effectively inverting these transformations to recover the speaker's intention from the sound. At each step in the interpretive process, ambiguity and uncertainty arise. \n \nThe Hearsay-II problem-solving framework reconstructs an intention from hypothetical interpretations formulated at various levels of abstraction. In addition, it allocates limited processing resources first to the most promising incremental actions. The final configuration of the Hearsay-II system comprises problem-solving components to generate and evaluate speech hypotheses, and a focus-of-control mechanism to identify potential actions of greatest value. Many of these specific procedures reveal novel approaches to speech problems. Most important, the system successfully integrates and coordinates all of these independent activities to resolve uncertainty and control combinatorics. Several adaptations of the Hearsay-II framework have already been undertaken in other problem domains, and it is anticipated that this trend will continue; many future systems necessarily will integrate diverse sources of knowledge to solve complex problems cooperatively. \n \nDiscussed in this paper are the characteristics of the speech problem in particular, the special kinds of problem-solving uncertainty in that domain, the structure of the Hearsay-II system developed to cope with that uncertainty, and the relationship between Hearsay-II's structure and those of other speech-understanding systems. The paper is intended for the general computer science audience and presupposes no speech or artificial intelligence background."

Previous techniques that utilized context involved letter transition probabilities of digrams and trigrams. This research introduces the concept of binary digrams which overcomes some of the problems of past approaches. They can be used to extract offectively the \"syntax\" of the dictionary while requiring very modest amounts of storage. A computationally feasible procedure is described which allows the accuracy requirements of the character recognizer to be relaxed if it is followed by a contextual postprocessor. The modified recognition system is allowed to output several alternatives for each character, while the postprocessor selects the proper string of characters by having access to both the dictionary and the dictionary syntax. A theoretical estimate of the recognition rate is derived, and experimental results demonstrate the ability of the system to achieve low error and rejection rates."

The carotid arterial pulse wave is of medical importance because of variation in its structure induced by arterial aging and cardiovascular disease. The syntax-driven waveform analysis system has been applied with good results to these pulse waves to detect and measure structural variations. The waveform parsing system is modeled on a compiler-compiler system and allows the user to enter application specific information as data. It is thus general enough to be applicable to other waveforms."
