                "text": "We present a new approach for modeling multi-modal data sets, focusing on the specific case of segmented images with associated text. Learning the joint distribution of image regions and words has many applications. We consider in detail predicting words associated with whole images (auto-annotation) and corresponding to particular image regions (region naming). Auto-annotation might help organize and access large collections of images. Region naming is a model of object recognition as a process of translating image regions to words, much as one might translate from one language to another. Learning the relationships between image regions and semantic correlates (words) is an interesting example of multi-modal data mining, particularly because it is typically hard to apply data mining techniques to collections of images. We develop a number of models for the joint distribution of image regions and words, including several which explicitly learn the correspondence between regions and words. We study multi-modal and correspondence extensions to Hofmann's hierarchical clustering/aspect model, a translation model adapted from statistical machine translation (Brown et al.), and a multi-modal extension to mixture of latent Dirichlet allocation (MoM-LDA). All models are assessed using a large collection of annotated images of real scenes. We study in depth the difficult problem of measuring performance. For the annotation task, we look at prediction performance on held out data. We present three alternative measures, oriented toward different types of task. Measuring the performance of correspondence methods is harder, because one must determine whether a word has been placed on the right region of an image. We can use annotation performance as a proxy measure, but accurate measurement requires hand labeled data, and thus must occur on a smaller scale. We show results using both an annotation proxy, and manually labeled data."

Firstly, images are segmented into regions, which are classified into region types using a variety of features. A mapping between region types and keywords supplied with the images, is then learned, using a method based around EM. This process is analogous with learning a lexicon from an aligned bitext. For the implementation we describe, these words are nouns taken from a large vocabulary. On a large test set, the method can predict numerous words with high accuracy. Simple methods identify words that cannot be predicted well. We show how to cluster words that individually are difficult to predict into clusters that can be predicted well -- for example, we cannot predict the distinction between train and locomotive using the current set of features, but we can predict the underlying concept. The method is trained on a substantial collection of images. Extensive experimental results illustrate the strengths and weaknesses of the approach."

We incorporate statistical natural language processing in order to deal with free text. We demonstrate the current system on a difficult dataset, namely 10000 images of work from the Fine Arts Museum of San Francisco. The images include line drawings, paintings, and pictures of sculpture and ceramics. Many of the images have associated free text which varies greatly from physical description to interpretation and mood. We use WordNet to provide semantic grouping information and to help disambiguate word senses, as well as emphasize the hierarchical nature of semantic relationships. This allows us to impose a natural structure on the image collection that reflects semantics to a considerable degree. Our method produces a joint probability distribution for words and picture elements. We demonstrate that this distribution can be used: (a) to provide illustrations for given captions, and (b) to generate words for images outside the training set. Results from this annotation process yield a quantitative study of our method. Finally, the annotation process can be seen as a form of object recognizer that has been learned through a partially supervised process."

This approach means that large scale experiments are relatively easy, so we can evaluate the effects of various early and midlevel vision algorithms on recognition performance. We evaluate various image segmentation algorithms by determining word prediction accuracy for images segmented in various ways and represented by various features. We take the view that good segmentations respect object boundaries, and so word prediction should be better for a better segmentation. However, it is usually very difficult in practice to obtain segmentations that do not break up objects, so most practitioners attempt to merge segments to get better putative object representations. We demonstrate that our paradigm of word prediction easily allows us to predict potentially useful segment merges, even for segments that do not look similar (for example, merging the black and white halves of a penguin is not possible with feature-based segmentation; the main cue must be \"familiar configuration\"). These studies focus on unsupervised learning of recognition. However, we show that word prediction can be markedly improved by providing supervised information for a relatively small number of regions together with large quantities of unsupervised information. This supervisory information allows a better and more discriminative choice of features and breaks possible symmetries."

Objects are modeled as flexible constellations of parts. A probabilistic representation is used for all aspects of the object: shape, appearance, occlusion and relative scale. An entropy-based feature detector is used to select regions and their scale within the image. In learning the parameters of the scale-invariant object model are estimated. This is done using expectation-maximization in a maximum-likelihood setting. In recognition, this model is used in a Bayesian manner to classify images. The flexible nature of the model is demonstrated by excellent results over a range of datasets including geometrically constrained classes (e.g. faces, cars) and flexible objects (such as animals)."

The parameters of the DRF model are learned using penalized maximum pseudo-likelihood method. Furthermore, the form of the DRF model allows the MAP inference for binary classification problems using the graph min-cut algorithms.

The discriminative random fields offer several advantages over the conventional Markov random field (MRF) framework. First, the DRFs allow to relax the strong assumption of conditional independence of the observed data generally used in the MRF framework for tractability. This assumption is too restrictive for a large number of applications in vision. Second, the DRFs derive their classification power by exploiting the probabilistic discriminative models instead of the generative models used in the MRF framework. Finally, all the parameters in the DRF model are estimated simultaneously from the training data unlike the MRF framework where likelihood parameters are usually learned separately from the field parameters. We illustrate the advantages of the DRFs over the MRF framework in an application of man-made structure detection in natural images taken from the Corel database."

Smith in the Chair] SUMMARY A continuous two-dimensional region is partitioned into a fine rectangular array of sites or \"pixels\", each pixel having a particular \"colour\" belonging to a prescribed finite set. The true colouring of the region is unknown but, associated with each pixel, there is a possibly multivariate record which conveys imperfect information about its colour according to a known statistical model. The aim is to reconstruct the true scene, with the additional knowledge that pixels close together tend to have the same or similar colours. In this paper, it is assumed that the local characteristics of the true scene can be represented by a nondegenerate Markov random field. Such information can be combined with the records by Bayes' theorem and the true scene can be estimated according to standard criteria. However, the computational burden is enormous and the reconstruction may reflect undesirable largescale properties of the random field. Thus, a simple, iterative method of reconstruction is proposed, which does not depend on these large-scale characteristics. The method is illustrated by computer simulations in which the original scene is not directly related to the assumed random field. Some complications, including parameter estimation, are discussed. Potential applications are mentioned briefly."

                "text": "Researchers in the field of statistical image analysis are concerned with different issues, such as image restoration, boundary detection, or even object recognition, which may be used in such different contexts as images returned by satellite or medical images produced by emission tomography. There are, of course, many other issues one might address in using statistics to analyze an image. This particular research focuses on the selection of a model for a digital image. \nAlthough model selection has been studied extensively in many areas of statistics, very little has been done within the context of image analysis. Thus this research is restricted to the most elementary images: those which are of a single texture (i.e., an image which, in its entirety, is nothing but carpet, wood grain, clouds in the sky, or some other single type of \"texture\"). The models under consideration are parametric Gibbs-Markov random fields. \nParameter estimation is then a critical matter. The maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) is quite intractable for such models. This research focuses on two alternatives to the MLE: a Monte Carlo maximum likelihood estimate (MCMLE), and the maximum pseudo-likelihood estimate (MPLE). Asymptotic rates for the mean square error and for a moderate deviation probability are derived for the MPLE. \nThe main goal of this research is the development of information criteria for choosing a model, similar to the Bayesian information criteria used in model selection for time series and for exponential families. We establish criteria based on the MLE, the MCMLE and the MPLE. We show that the criteria based on the MLE and MCMLE are both approximations to the true Bayes solution to the model selection problem; and we also show the (weak) consistency of the criterion based on the MPLE. \nA simulation study of the useful parameter estimation techniques and model selection criteria is presented, using several simple models. Implementation of the model selection criteria on real textures is also discussed."

Rather than focusing on local features and their consistencies in the image data, our approach aims at extracting the global impression of an image. We treat image segmentation as a graph partitioning problem and propose a novel global criterion, the normalized cut, for segmenting the graph. The normalized cut criterion measures both the total dissimilarity between the different groups as well as the total similarity within the groups. We show that an efficient computational technique based on a generalized eigenvalue problem can be used to optimize this criterion. We have applied this approach to segmenting static images and found results very encouraging."

The features are invariant to image scaling, translation, and rotation, and partially invariant to illumination changes and affine or 3D projection. These features share similar properties with neurons in inferior temporal cortex that are used for object recognition in primate vision. Features are efficiently detected through a staged filtering approach that identifies stable points in scale space. Image keys are created that allow for local geometric deformations by representing blurred image gradients in multiple orientation planes and at multiple scales. The keys are used as input to a nearest neighbor indexing method that identifies candidate object matches. Final verification of each match is achieved by finding a low residual least squares solution for the unknown model parameters. Experimental results show that robust object recognition can be achieved in cluttered partially occluded images with a computation time of under 2 seconds."

Many different descriptors have been proposed in the literature. It is unclear which descriptors are more appropriate and how their performance depends on the interest region detector. The descriptors should be distinctive and at the same time robust to changes in viewing conditions as well as to errors of the detector. Our evaluation uses as criterion recall with respect to precision and is carried out for different image transformations. We compare shape context [Belongie, S, et al., April 2002], steerable filters [Freeman, W and Adelson, E, Setp. 1991], PCA-SIFT [Ke, Y and Sukthankar, R, 2004], differential invariants [Koenderink, J and van Doorn, A, 1987], spin images [Lazebnik, S, et al., 2003], SIFT [Lowe, D. G., 1999], complex filters [Schaffalitzky, F and Zisserman, A, 2002], moment invariants [Van Gool, L, et al., 1996], and cross-correlation for different types of interest regions. We also propose an extension of the SIFT descriptor and show that it outperforms the original method. Furthermore, we observe that the ranking of the descriptors is mostly independent of the interest region detector and that the SIFT-based descriptors perform best. Moments and steerable filters show the best performance among the low dimensional descriptors."

A classifier is then learned for each of these parts, and feature selection is used to determine the most discriminative ones. This approach allows robust pan detection, and it is invariant under scale changes-that is, neither the training images nor the test images have to be normalized. The proposed method is evaluated in car detection tasks with significant variations in viewing conditions, and promising results are demonstrated. Different local regions, classifiers and feature selection methods are quantitatively compared. Our evaluation shows that local invariant descriptors are an appropriate representation for object classes such as cars, and it underlines the importance of feature selection."

Using these measures, we demonstrate a sound experimental framework, based on statistical ANOVA tests, to compare and contrast three edge based organization modules, namely, those of Etemadi et al. (1991), Jacobs (1996), and Sarkar-Boyer (1993) in the domain of aerial objects using 50 images. With adapted parameters, the Jacobs module performs overall the best for constraint based recognition. For fixed parameters, the Sarkar-Boyer module is the best in terms of recognition accuracy and indexing speedup. Etemadi et al.'s module performs equally well with fixed and adapted parameters while the Jacobs module is most sensitive to fixed and adapted parameter choices. The overall performance ranking of the modules is Jacobs, Sarkar-Boyer, and Etemadi et al."

However, it is unclear which descriptors are more appropriate and how their performance depends on the interest point detector. The descriptors should be distinctive and at the same time robust to changes in viewing conditions as well as to errors of the point detector. Our evaluation uses as criterion detection rate with respect to false positive rate and is carried out for different image transformations. We compare SIFT descriptors (Lowe, 1999), steerable filters (Freeman and Adelson, 1991), differential invariants (Koenderink ad van Doorn, 1987), complex filters (Schaffalitzky and Zisserman, 2002), moment invariants (Van Gool et al., 1996) and cross-correlation for different types of interest points. In this evaluation, we observe that the ranking of the descriptors does not depend on the point detector and that SIFT descriptors perform best. Steerable filters come second ; they can be considered a good choice given the low dimensionality."

We define a concept of word-by-word alignment between such pairs of sentences. For any given pair of such sentences each of our models assigns a probability to each of the possible word-by-word alignments. We give an algorithm for seeking the most probable of these alignments. Although the algorithm is suboptimal, the alignment thus obtained accounts well for the word-by-word relationships in the pair of sentences. We have a great deal of data in French and English from the proceedings of the Canadian Parliament. Accordingly, we have restricted our work to these two languages; but we feel that because our algorithms have minimal linguistic content they would work well on other pairs of languages. We also feel, again because of the minimal linguistic content of our algorithms, that it is reasonable to argue that word-by-word alignments are inherent in any sufficiently large bilingual corpus."

The most dramatic instance of this is the near Shannon-limit performance of \"Turbo Codes\" -- codes whose decoding algorithm is equivalent to loopy belief propagation in a chain-structured Bayesian network. \n \nIn this paper we ask: is there something special about the error-correcting code context, or does loopy propagation work as an approximate inference scheme in a more general setting? We compare the marginals computed using loopy propagation to the exact ones in four Bayesian network architectures, including two real-world networks: ALARM and QMR. We find that the loopy beliefs often converge and when they do, they give a good approximation to the correct marginals. However, on the QMR network, the loopy beliefs oscillated and had no obvious relationship to the correct posteriors. We present some initial investigations into the cause of these oscillations, and show that some simple methods of preventing them lead to the wrong results."
