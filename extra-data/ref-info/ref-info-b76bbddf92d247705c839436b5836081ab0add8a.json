A key component of image indexing is the selection of image regions that are likely to contain the queried object. In this paper we propose attentional selection as a paradigm for selection during image indexing. Specifically, we present an implementation of a model of attentional selection to perform indexing in the domain of technical manual documents depicting line drawing images of physical equipment. The indexing system developed selects regions containing a 3D machine part in relevant pages of the manual in response to a query describing the part. Model-based object recognition then confirms the presence of the part at that location by solving for the pose of the queried object."

Usually those archives are combined with a database management system or with full text retrieval to search the documents. An additional retrieval method to search already known images in personal document image archives using layout knowledge is presented. This knowledge can be the size, position, and color of layout objects, but also the position of keywords. A layout editor is proposed, which allows the interactive generation of a layout query using object oriented drawing functions. The layout search can be done in a relational database, which was filled with the help of layout recognition methods. For better results and performance special search methods and structures are necessary. Examples for those methods are quad trees to locate layout objects at absolute positions, neighborhood tables to find object pairs with certain spatial relationships, and full text search in page or object areas.<<ETX>>"

While this approach is attractive in many respects, there are situations in which complete recognition and format conversion is either unnecessary or very difficult to achieve with sufficient accuracy. This paper presents several applications illustrating an alternative approach to scanned text processing in which document processing operations are performed on image elements extracted from the scanned document image. The central and novel insight is that many document processing operations may be implemented directly by geometrical operations on image blobs, without explicit knowledge of the symbolic character labels (that is, without automatic character recognition). The applications are implemented as part of image EMACS, an editor for binary document images, and include editing multilingual documents, reformatting text to a new column width, differential comparison of two versions of a document, and preprocessing an image prior to character recognition."

                "text": "This research explores the interaction of textual and photographic information in an integrated text/image database environment. Specifically, We present a content-based retrieval system for captioned group photographs of people (i.e., human faces) where groups can consist of one or more members. By understanding the caption accompanying a picture, we are able to extract information useful in (i) retrieving the picture and (ii) directing an image interpretation system identify relevant objects (in this case, faces) in the picture. For the latter, we incorporate techniques from our ongoing research on photo understanding using accompanying text. Current image-based techniques have limitations; for example, similarity techniques used for retrieving faces will not perform well in group photographs where the locations of faces is not known a priori or where face sizes are small. By exploiting caption information, we assist a face locator in detecting human faces in a photograph and subsequently labelling them. Text-based similarity algorithms have principally relied on statistical techniques to index and classify documents (e.g., vector models). It is necessary to employ natural language processing techniques in order to derive deeper semantics from captions which contain far fewer words than documents. Our approach is unique since it goes beyond a superficial combination of existing text-based and image-based approaches to information retrieval."

Being content-based, the indexing method depends not only on the graphical structures in the drawings, but on the textual entries as well. No a priori knowledge is used in the indexing scheme, since application-speciic assumptions cannot be made when dealing with a heterogeneous collection of drawings. The indexes are computed from features extracted from documents in the collection. Textual features are constructed from characters recognized using an optical character recognition (OCR) system. Graphical features are constructed by grouping graphical primitives. Preliminary results presented here indicate that our indexing method is quite eeective."

The IDIR system will provide close connections with and utilization of document analysis and image processing techniques, advanced computing and networking, and modern approaches to database management. The system design consists of aggressively modularized components to enhance the development of individual parts which are used in the complete solution, including: Interface speciications, multipurpose feature extraction, an integrated eecient query language, physical retrieval from an object-oriented database, and delivery of retrieved objects. In this paper, we introduce the general framework, feature extraction modules, query capabilities, a graphical query interface, and the application interface. We demonstrate each component of the system and how the query mechanisms can be used to handle both content and structural queries eeectively."

The input to MARCO are raster images of separate map layers and raster images of map composites. A legend-driven map interpretation system converts map layer images from their physical representation to their logical representation. This logical representation is then used to automatically index both the composite and the layer images. Methods for incorporating logical and physical layer images as well as composite images into the framework of a relational database management system are described. Indices are constructed on both the contextual and the spatial data thereby enabling efficient retrieval of layer and composite images based on contextual as well as spatial specifications. Example queries and query processing strategies using these indices are described. The user interface is demonstrated via the execution of an example query. Results of an experimental study on a large amount of data are presented. The system is evaluated in terms of accuracy and in terms of query execution time."

A first approach to classification might be the use of OCR on each document followed by analysis of the resulting ASCII text. But if the quality of a document is poor, the format unconstrained, or time is critical, complete OCR of each image is not appropriate. An alternative approach is the use of word shape recognition (as opposed to individual character recognition) and the subsequent classification of documents by the presence or absence of selected keywords. Use of word shape recognition not only provides a more robust collection of features but also eliminates the need for character segmentation (a leading cause of error in OCR). In this paper we describe a system we have developed for the detection of isolated words, word portions, as well as multi-word phrases in images of documents. It is designed to be used with large, changeable, keyword sets and very large document sets. The system provides for automated training of desired keywords and creation of indexing filters to speed matching."

Similar documents are gathered into several clusters and a representative document of each cluster is shown to users. To make users infer the content of the database from several representatives, the documents must be separated into tight clusters, in which documents are connected with high similarities. At the same time, clustering must be fast for user interaction. We propose an O(n/sup 2/) time, O(n) space cluster extraction method. It is faster than the ordinal clustering methods, and its clusters compare favorably with those produced by Complete Link for tightness. When we deal with OCR-ed documents, term loss caused by recognition faults can change similarities between documents. We also examined the effect of recognition faults to the performance of document clustering."

By searching for any query term on the premise that there are errors in the recognized text, the methods presented can tolerate such errors, and therefore costly manual post-editing is not required after OCR recognition. In the applied approach, confusion matrices are used to store characters which are likely to be interchanged when a particular character is missrecognized, and the respective probability of each occurrence. Moreover, a 2-gram matrix is used to store probabilities of character connection, i.e., which letter is likely to come after another. Multiple search terms are generated for an input query term by making reference to confusion matrices, after which a full-text search is run for each search term. The validity of retrieved terms is determined based on error-occurrence and character connection probabilities. The performance of these methods is experimentally evaluated by determining retrieval effectiveness, i.e., by calculating recall and precision rates. Results indicate marked improvement in comparison with exact matching."

This method has the advantage of saving cost and time compared with the manual registration of types and labels of graphs as search indexes in electronic filing systems. The method is implemented in an advanced document image retrieval system, and the efficiency of the index registration is ascertained by experiment. The outline of this method is as follows: The types of graphs, the axes, and the labels of axes are initially detected. The types of graphs are classified into several categories and labels are attached to the axes. Next, the types are registered as indexes of the graphs, and the label images are recognized and converted into ASCII data, and also stored as indexes. An automaton model is used in the process of attaching the labels to analyze the components of the images. The automaton model refers to a knowledge-base of stored rules of layout structure. It then chooses appropriate labels for each axis."

It is the author's job to design the document so that the information it contains can be interpreted accurately and efficiently. To do this, the author can make use of a set of stylistic tools. In this paper, we introduce the concept of document functionality, which attempts to describe the roles of documents and their components in the process of transferring information. A functional description of a document provides insight into the type of the document, into its intended uses, and into strategies for automatic document interpretation and retrieval. To demonstrate these ideas, we define a taxonomy of functional document components and show how functional descriptions can be used to reverse-engineer the intentions of the author, to navigate in document space, and to provide important contextual information to aid in interpretation."

Thereby, the similarities between queries and documents as well as the similarities between documents themselves are of importance. Document similarities may be used in order to generate links between documents that lead users from one document to related ones. Studies have shown that the vector-space model is robust in the context of OCR-processing if manually constructed queries are used. However it is not clear whether this model, if used for hypertext construction, is robust with regard to data corruption as caused by OCR engines. In this paper, we describe the performance of automatic hypertext construction, based on the vector-space model, with regard to three different measures: the number of overtakings within the used rankings, the accumulated distance of a document's position within the rankings and a comparison based on recall-precision graphs."

In constructing information spaces such as digital libraries, we have to collect vast amount of information and convert it into uniformly organized data. Since much of the information must be converted from various media automatically, the space contains garbled text with various accuracy. For utilizing these texts, we need to satisfy the three requirements, i.e., high recall, high precision and fast matching process. In order to satisfy these requirements, we have been developing a two-phase matching system. The presented method is used for fast and high recall candidate word selection in the first phase. The key idea of the method is to use a portion of characters of a word and a distance pattern in order to use current index techniques. By experiments, we confirm that the presented method achieves high recall even for the poorly recognized texts."

Features extracted from the CCITT fax-compressed representations of two images are compared to determine their visual similarity and whether they are equivalent (i.e., scanned from the same original). Pass codes in the compressed data are used as features. A fixed grid is imposed on the image and a feature vector is derived from the number of pass codes in each grid cell. The features vectors are compared to locate a group of documents that are visually similar to the input image. The equivalence of two documents is determined by applying the Hausdorff distance to the two-dimensional arrangement of pass codes in small patches of each image."

Because of the diiculty of constructing test collections to obtain this data, we have carried out evaluations using simulated OCR output on a variety of databases.

The imaged text can be composed of a number of different fonts and can contain graphics. A combination of morphology, simple statistical methods and hidden Markov modeling is used to detect and locate the phrases. The image is deskewed, and then bounding boxes are found for text-lines in the image using multiresolution morphology. Baselines, toplines and the x-height in a text-line are identified using simple statistical methods. The distance between baseline and x-height is used to normalize each hypothesized text-line bounding box, and the columns of pixel values in a normalized bounding box serve as the feature vector for that box. Hidden Markov models are crated for each user-specified search string and to represent all text and graphics other than the search strings. Phrases are identified using Viterbi decoding on a spotting network created from the models. The operating point of the system can be varied to trade off the percentage of words correctly spotted and the percentage of false alarms. Results are given using a subset of the UW English Document Image Database I."

The methodology has the advantages of being able to adapt to nonuniform page degradations and of being based on a model of image defects that is estimated directly from a set of calibrating degraded document images. Further, unlike other global filtering schemes, our methodology filters only words that have been misspelled by the OCR with a high probability. In the first stage of the process, we extract a training sample of candidate misspelled word subimages from the set of calibration images before and after the degradation that we wish to undo. These word subimages are registered to extract defect pixels. The second stage of our methodology uses a vector quantization based algorithm to construct a summary model of the defect pixels. The final stage of the algorithm uses the summary model to restore degraded document images. We evaluate the performance of the methodology for a variety of parameter settings on a real world sample of degraded FAX transmitted documents. The methodology eliminates up to 56.4% of the OCR character errors introduced as a result of FAX transmission for our sample experiment."

In the first stage, connected groups of pixels, corresponding approximately to individual characters, are extracted from the image. These are matched against an adaptively constructed library of patterns seen so far, and the resulting sequence of symbol identification numbers is coded and transmitted. From this information, along with the library itself and the offset from one mark to the next, an approximate image can be reconstructed. The result is a lossy method of compression that outperforms other schemes. The second stage employs the reconstructed image as an aid for encoding the original image using a statistical context-based compression technique. This yields a total bandwidth for exact transmission appreciably undercutting that required by other lossless binary image compression methods. Taken together, the lossy, and lossless methods provide an effective two-stage progressive transmission capability for textual images which has application for legal, medical, and historical purposes, and to archiving in general. >"

The system, which we call the post-processing system, is designed to improve the quality of text produced by an OCR device in preparation for subsequent retrieval from an information system. The system is composed of numerous parts: an information retrieval system, an English dictionary, a domain-specific dictionary, and a collection of algorithms and heuristics designed to correct as many OCR errors as possible. For the remaining errors that cannot be corrected, the system passes them on to a user-level editing program. This post-processing system can be viewed as part of a larger system that would streamline the steps of taking a document from its hard copy form to its usable electronic form, or it can be considered a stand alone system for OCR error correction. An earlier version of this system has been used to process approximately 10,000 pages of OCR generated text. Among the OCR errors discovered by this version, about 87% were corrected. We implement numerous new parts of the system, test this new version, and present the results."

Captions are essential to understanding multimedia and to finding relevant examples quickly. Our approach, shared by (Srihari, 1994), is to analyze both the caption and the picture in advance, then match user English queries to these semantic networks in a way that maximizes retrieval speed. Our theory and algorithms are being tested on a particular example, 100,000 captions constituting the entire unclassified portion of the photographic library at NAWC-WD, the U.S. Navy test facility in China Lake, California, USA (Rowe and Guglielmo, 1993), plus some of the pictures. Our focus is thus on technical captions and technical pictures that required specialized domain-dependent knowledge to interpret. (Rowe and Guglielmo, 1993) shows experimental results that confirm that our approach to caption-only processing gets higher precision for similar recall than a keyphrasematching system for the same application."

Although the HMT is sensitive to the types of noise found in scanned images, including both boundary and random noise, a simple extension, the blur HMT, is relatively robust. The noise immunity of the blur HMT derives from its ability to treat both types of noise together, and to remove them by appropriate dilations. In analogy with the Hausdorff metric for the distance between two sets, metric generalizations for special cases of the blur HMT are derived. Whereas Hausdorff uses both directions of the directed distances between two sets, a metric derived from a special case of the blur HMT uses just one direction of the directed distances between foreground and background components of two sets. For both foreground and background, the template is always the first of the directed sets. A less restrictive metric generalization, where the disjoint foreground and background components of the template need not be set complements, is also derived. For images with a random component of noise, the blur HMT is sensitive only to the size of the noise, whereas Hausdorff matching is sensitive to its location. It is also shown how these metric functions can be derived from the distance functions of the foreground and background of an image, using dilation by the appropriate templates. The blur HMT is implemented efficiently with Boolean image operations. The FG and BG images are dilated with structuring elements that depend on image noise and pattern variability, and the results are then eroded with templates derived from patterns to be matched. Subsampling the patterns on a regular grid can improve speed and maintain match quality, and examples are given that indicate how to explore the parameter space. The blur HMT can be used as a fast heuristic to avoid more expensive integer-based matching techniques. Truncated matches give the same result as full erosions and are much faster."

Text, image and graphics regions in a document image are treated as three diierent \\texture\" classes. Feature vectors based on multi-scale wavelet packet representation are used for local classiication. Segmentation is performed by propagating soft local decisions made on small windows across neighboring blocks and integrating them to reduce their \\ambiguities\" and increase their \\conndence\" as more contextual evidence is obtained from the image data. Local votes propagate in a neighborhood, within and across scales, and majorities of weighted votes give the nal decisions. The method has been tested on document page decomposition tasks, and the results of these tests are presented. The algorithm is general, can be applied to other segmentation and classiication tasks, is based on parallel, distributed and independent computations and has low complexity."

This process relies on the transformation of the text image into character shape codes, a rapid and robust process, and on special lexica which contain information on the \"shape\" of words and the character ambiguities present within particular word shape classifications. We rely on the structure of English (in the current case) and the high percentage of singleton mappings between the shape codes and the characters in the words. Considerable ambiguity is removed by simple lookup in the specially tuned and structured lexicon and substitution on a character-by-character basis. Ambiguity is further reduced by template matching using exemplars derived from surrounding text, taking advantage of the local consistency of font, face and size as well as image quality."

It is based on the N-gram technique that is commonly used for text similarity. The process of computing an image profile in terms of its N/spl times/M-grams is described. Results of experiments on images from various categories are presented. The N/spl times/M-gram method with three different similarity measures is compared to the results of categorization using other well-known texture features and grey-level distribution features. The results show that, for our test images, texture features are suitable for image categorization, and N/spl times/M-gram based methods are the best overall choice of texture features for this task."

In a hidden Markov model (HMM) based spotter recognition time is dominated by the time required to compute the state conditional observation probabilities. These probabilities are a measure of how well the data match each state in the model. In this paper discrete and continuous hidden Markov models are compared based on speed and accuracy in spotting for phrases in text images. For the discrete HMM, vector quantization is used to associate each continuous feature vector with a discrete value. For the continuous HMMs, the observation distributions for the feature vectors are modeled by either a single Gaussian, or a mixture of two Gaussians. Comparisons were made on a subset of the UW English Document Image Database I. The best accuracy was observed when a mixture of two Gaussians was used in the continuous HMM. The discrete HMM provides for faster spotting particularly when long phrases are used."

Word bounding boxes of potential keywords are extracted from the image using a morphology-based preprocessor. Feature vectors based on the external shape and internal structure of the word are computed over vertical columns of pixels in a word bounding box. For each user-specified keyword, an HMM is created by concatenating appropriate context-dependent character HMMs. Nonkeywords are modeled using an HMM based on context-dependent subcharacter models. Keyword spotting is performed using a Viterbi search through the HMM network created by connecting the keyword and nonkeyword HMMs in parallel. Applications of word-image spotting include information filtering in images from facsimile and copy machines, and information retrieval from text image databases.<<ETX>>"

We describe a set of symbol and page models which are used to degrade an ideal text by introducing errors which typically occur during scanning, decomposition and recognition of document images. A rst generation of the software is described which implements the page models and allows the use of transition probabilities , either extracted from real data or generated synthetically, to corrupt text."

The Dienst protocol uses HTTP (the protocol of the World Wide Web) as a transport layer, making Dienst servers accessible from any WWW client. Dienst is currently used as the infrastructure for a distributed computer science technical report library by a number of U.S. universities. This document is intended as a guide for Dienst site administrators and implementors of other digital library systems. It describes the architecture of an individual server and network of Dienst servers and includes the server installation instructions.

The key feature of the method is soft pattern matching, a way of making use of the information in previously encountered characters without risking the introduction of character substitution errors. We can obtain lossless compression about 20 percent better than that of the JBIG standard by direct application of this method. By allowing some loss in a controlled manner based partly on the pattern matching, we can obtain compression ratios about two to four times the compression ratios of JBIG and three to eight times those of G3 facsimile with no visible loss of quality."

Document extracts consisting of roughly 20% of the original cart be as informative as the full text of a document, which suggests that even shorter extracts may be useful indicative summmies.

Recognizing these objects facilitates the recognition of document classes. Some promising results have been achieved by using autoassociator-based artificial neural networks (AANN) in the presence of homogeneously distributed noise. However, the performance drops significantly when dealing with spot-noisy logos, where strips or blobs produce a partial obstruction of the pictures. We propose a new approach for training AANNs especially conceived for dealing with spot noise. The basic idea is to introduce new metrics for assessing the reproduction error in AANNs. The proposed algorithm, referred to as spot-backpropagation (S-BP), is significantly more robust with respect to spot-noise than classical Euclidean norm-based backpropagation (BP). Our experimental results are based on a database of 88 real logos that are artificially corrupted by spot-noise."

Syllable-based models were created and the models trained on spontaneous speech in which words had been labeled by a panel of listeners for degree of emphasis. Emphatic speech from one speaker was automatically detected and summarizing excerpts were identified, with no noticeable difference when compared to excerpts selected by individual subjects. The extensibility of the emphasis detector to other speakers was tested on a small sample of telephone speech by ten other speakers.<<ETX>>"
