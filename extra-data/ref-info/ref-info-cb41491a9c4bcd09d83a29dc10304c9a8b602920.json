There are basically two types of constraints, database constraints and arithmetic constraints. The target of DA is then to optimize the constraint system, where the main challenge is the fuzziness of the OCR results. Efficiency is gained by a transition of the variables' state from 'soft' to 'hard'. Propagation is used to make sure that the result of the analysis is globally consistent. As an industrial application of (soft) constraints, smartFIX demonstrates the versatility of the generic constraints approach."

Searching for a set of known table headers (approach 1) works rather well in a significant number of documents. But this approach (though it is implemented tolerant to OCR errors) is not tolerant enough towards some kinds of even minor aberrations. This not only decreases the recognition results, but also, even worse, makes users feel uncomfortable. Pragmatically trying to mimic for what the human eyes might key, leads to our two further, complementary approaches: searching for layout structures which resemble parts of columns (approach 2), and searching for groupings of similar lines (approach 3). The suitability of the approaches for our system requires them to be very simple to implement and simple to explain to users, computationally cheap, and combinable. In the domain of health insurances who receive huge amounts of so called medical liquidations on a daily basis we obtain very good results. On document samples representative for the every day practice of five customers-health insurance companies-tables were spotted as good and as fast as the customers expected the system to be. We thus consider our current approaches as a step towards cognitive adequacy."

The disciplines of knowledge engineering and knowledge management are closely tied. Knowledge engineering deals with the development of information systems in which knowledge and reasoning play pivotal roles. Knowledge management, a newly developed field at the intersection of computer science and management, deals with knowledge as a key resource in modern organizations. Managing knowledge within an organization is inconceivable without the use of advanced information systems; the design and implementation of such systems pose great organization as well as technical challenges. The book covers in an integrated fashion the complete route from corporate knowledge management, through knowledge analysis and engineering, to the design and implementation of knowledge-intensive information systems. The CommonKADS methodology, developed over the last decade by an industry-university consortium led by the authors, is used throughout the book. CommonKADS makes as much use as possible of the new UML notation standard. Beyond information systems applications, all software engineering and computer systems projects in which knowledge plays an important role stand to benefit from the CommonKADS methodology."

While the majority of approaches rely on learning linear classifiers, there is also some interest in describing document categories by text patterns. We introduce a model for learning patterns for text categorization (the LPT-model) that does not rely on an attribute-value representation of documents but represents documents essentially \"as they are\". Based on the LPT-model, we focus on learning patterns within a relatively simple pattern language. We compare different search heuristics and pruning methods known from various symbolic rule learners on a set of representative text categorization problems. The best results were obtained using the m-estimate as search heuristics combined with the likelihood-ratio-statics for pruning. Even better results can be obtained, when replacing the likelihoodratio-statics by a new measure for pruning; this we call l-measure. In contrast to conventional measures for pruning, the l-measure takes into account properties of the search space."
