In this paper we present a new image representation which provides a transformation from the raw pixel data to a small set of image regions which are coherent in color and texture space. This so-called \"blobworld\" representation is based on segmentation using the expectation-maximization algorithm on combined color and texture features. The texture features we use for the segmentation arise from a new approach to texture description and scale selection. We describe a system that uses the blobworld representation to retrieve images. An important and unique aspect of the system is that, in the context of similarity-based querying, the user is allowed to view the internal representation of the submitted image and the query results. Similar systems do not offer the user this view into the workings of the system; consequently, the outcome of many queries on these systems can be quite inexplicable, despite the availability of knobs for adjusting the similarity metric."

We present here an implementation of NeTra, a prototype image retrieval system that uses color, texture, shape and spatial location information in segmented image regions to search and retrieve similar regions from the database. A distinguishing aspect of this system is its incorporation of a robust automated image segmentation algorithm that allows object- or region-based search. Image segmentation significantly improves the quality of image retrieval when images contain multiple complex objects. Images are segmented into homogeneous regions at the time of ingest into the database, and image attributes that represent each of these regions are computed. In addition to image segmentation, other important components of the system include an efficient color representation, and indexing of color, texture, and shape features for fast search and retrieval. This representation allows the user to compose interesting queries such as \u201cretrieve all images that contain regions that have the color of object A, texture of object B, shape of object C, and lie in the upper of the image\u201d, where the individual objects could be regions belonging to different images. A Java-based web implementation of NeTra is available at http://vivaldi.ece.ucsb.edu/Netra."

                "text": "The increasing amount of information available in today''s world raises the need to retrieve relevant data efficiently. Unlike text-based retrieval, where keywords are successfully used to index into documents, content-based image retrieval poses up front the fundamental questions how to extract useful image features and how to use them for intuitive retrieval. We present a novel approach to the problem of navigating through a collection of images for the purpose of image retrieval, which leads to a new paradigm for image database search. We summarize the appearance of images by distributions of color or texture features, and we define a metric between any two such distributions. This metric, which we call the \"Earth Mover''s Distance\" (EMD), represents the least amount of work that is needed to rearrange the mass is one distribution in order to obtain the other. We show that the EMD matches perceptual dissimilarity better than other dissimilarity measures, and argue that it has many desirable properties for image retrieval. Using this metric, we employ Multi-Dimensional Scaling techniques to embed a group of images as points in a two- or three-dimensional Euclidean space so that their distances reflect image dissimilarities as well as possible. Such geometric embeddings exhibit the structure in the image set at hand, allowing the user to understand better the result of a database query and to refine the query in a perceptually intuitive way. By iterating this process, the user can quickly zoom in to the portion of the image space of interest. We also apply these techniques to other modalities such as mug-shot retrieval."

The channels are represented by a bank of even-symmetric Gabor filters that nearly uniformly covers the spatial-frequency domain. Feature images are obtained by subjecting each (selected) filtered image to a nonlinear transformation and computing a measure of energy around each pixel. Region-based segmentations are obtained by using a square-error clustering algorithm. Edge-based segmentations are obtained by applying an edge detector to each feature image and combining their magnitude responses. An integrated segmentation technique that combines the strengths of the previous two techniques while eliminating their weaknesses is proposed. The integrated approach is truly unsupervised, since it eliminates the need for knowing the exact number of texture categories in the image.<<ETX>>"

Users prefer to ask for pictures using notions of content that are strongly oriented to the presence of abstractly defined objects. Computer programs that implement these queries automatically are desirable, but are hard to build because conventional object recognition techniques from computer vision cannot recognize very general objects in very general contexts. This paper describes our approach to object recognition, which is structured around a sequence of increasingly specialized grouping activities that assemble coherent regions of image that can be shown to satisfy increasingly stringent constraints. The constraints that are satisfied provide a form of object classification in quite general contexts. This view of recognition is distinguished by: far richer involvement of early visual primitives, including color and texture; hierarchical grouping and learning strategies in the classification process; the ability to deal with rather general objects in uncontrolled configurations and contexts. We illustrate these properties with four case-studies: one demonstrating the use of color and texture descriptors; one showing how trees can be described by fusing texture and geometric properties; one learning scenery concepts using grouped features; and one showing how this view of recognition yields a program that can tell, quite accurately, whether a picture contains naked people or not."

Systems are beginning to emerge in both the research and commercial sectors based on 'content-based' image retrieval, a technique which explicitly manages image assets by directly representing their visual attributes. The Virage image search engine provides an open framework for building such systems. The Virage engine expresses visual features as image 'primitives.' Primitives can be very general (such as color, shape, or texture) or quite domain specific (face recognition, cancer cell detection, etc.). The basic philosophy underlying this architecture is a transformation from the data-rich representation of explicit image pixels to a compact, semantic-rich representation of visually salient characteristics. In practice, the design of such primitives is non-trivial, and is driven by a number of conflicting real-world constraints (e.g. computation time vs. accuracy). The virage engine provides an open framework for developers to 'plug-in' primitives to solve specific image management problems. The architecture has been designed to support both static images and video in a unified paradigm. The infrastructure provided by the Virage engine can be utilized to address high-level problems as well, such as automatic, unsupervised keyword assignment, or image classification."

Examples of the content we use include color, texture, and shape of image objects and regions. Potential applications include medical (`Give me other images that contain a tumor with a texture like this one'), photo-journalism (`Give me images that have blue at the top and red at the bottom'), and many others in art, fashion, cataloging, retailing, and industry. Key issues include derivation and computation of attributes of images and objects that provide useful query functionality, retrieval methods based on similarity as opposed to exact match, query by image example or user drawn image, the user interfaces, query refinement and navigation, high dimensional database indexing, and automatic and semi-automatic database population. We currently have a prototype system written in X/Motif and C running on an RS/6000 that allows a variety of queries, and a test database of over 1000 images and 1000 objects populated from commercially available photo clip art images. In this paper we present the main algorithms for color texture, shape and sketch query that we use, show example query results, and discuss future directions."

This is a special case of the transportation problem from linear optimization, for which efficient algorithms are available. The EMD also allows for partial matching. When used to compare distributions that have the same overall mass, the EMD is a true metric, and has easy-to-compute lower bounds. In this paper we focus on applications to image databases, especially color and texture. We use the EMD to exhibit the structure of color-distribution and texture spaces by means of Multi-Dimensional Scaling displays. We also propose a novel approach to the problem of navigating through a collection of color images, which leads to a new paradigm for image database search."

Textures are modeled as irradiance patterns containing a limited range of spatial frequencies, where mutually distinct textures differ significantly in their dominant characterizing frequencies. By encoding images into multiple narrow spatial frequency and orientation channels, the slowly varying channel envelopes (amplitude and phase) are used to segregate textural regions of different spatial frequency, orientation, or phase characteristics. Thus, an interpretation of image texture as a region code, or carrier of region information, is emphasized. The channel filters used, known as the two-dimensional Gabor functions, are useful for these purposes in several senses: they have tunable orientation and radial frequency bandwidths and tunable center frequencies, and they optimally achieve joint resolution in space and in spatial frequency. By comparing the channel amplitude responses, one can detect boundaries between textures. Locating large variations in the channel phase responses allows discontinuities in the texture phase to be detected. Examples are given of both types of texture processing using a variety of real and synthetic textures. >"

We consider the images as points in a metric space in which we wish to move around so as to locate image neighborhoods of interest, based on color information. The data base images are mapped to distributions in color space, these distributions are appropriately compressed, and then the distances between all pairs I; J of images are computed based on the work needed to rearrange the mass in the compressed distribution representing I to that of J . We also propose the use of multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) techniques to embed a group of images as points in a twoor three-dimensional Euclidean space so that their distances are preserved as much as possible. Such geometric embeddings allow the user to perceive the dominant axes of variation in the displayed image group. In particular, displays of 2-d MDS embeddings can be used to organize and re ne the results of a nearest-neighbor query in a perceptually intuitive way. By iterating this process, the user is able to quickly navigate to the portion of the image space of interest."

Our model can predict the salience of texture boundaries in any arbitrary gray-scale image.

These transforms are conjoint spatial/spectral representations, which provide a complete image description in terms of locally windowed 2-D spectral coordinates embedded within global 2-D spatial coordinates. In the present neural network approach, based on interlaminar interactions involving two layers with fixed weights and one layer with adjustable weights, the network finds coefficients for complete conjoint 2-D Gabor transforms without restrictive conditions. In wavelet expansions based on a biologically inspired log-polar ensemble of dilations, rotations, and translations of a single underlying 2-D Gabor wavelet template, image compression is illustrated with ratios up to 20:1. Also demonstrated is image segmentation based on the clustering of coefficients in the complete 2-D Gabor transform. >"

We discuss a class of models for human motion mechanisms in which the first stage consists of linear filters that are oriented in space-time and tuned in spatial frequency. The outputs of quadrature pairs of such filters are squared and summed to give a measure of motion energy. These responses are then fed into an opponent stage. Energy models can be built from elements that are consistent with known physiology and psychophysics, and they permit a qualitative understanding of a variety of motion phenomena."
