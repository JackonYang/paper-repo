TINA integrates key ideas from context free grammars, Augmented Transition Networks (ATN's), and the unification concept. TINA provides a seamless interface between syntactic and semantic analysis, and also produces a highly constraining probabilistic language model to improve recognition performance. An initial set of context-free rewrite rules provided by hand is first converted to a network structure. Probability assignments on all arcs in the network are obtained automatically from a set of example sentences. The parser uses a stack decoding search strategy, with a top-down control flow, and includes a feature-passing mechanism to deal with long-distance movement, agreement, and semantic constraints. TINA provides an automatic sentence generation capability that has been effective for identifying overgeneralization problems as well as in producing a word-pair language model for a recognizer. The parser is currently integrated with MIT's SUMMIT recognizer for use in two application domains, with the parser screening recognizer outputs either at the sentential level or to filter partial theories during the active search process."

HBG incorporates lexical, syntactic, semantic, and structural information from the parse tree into the disambiguation process in a novel way. We use a corpus of bracketed sentences, called a Treebank, in combination with decision tree building to tease out the relevant aspects of a parse tree that will determine the correct parse of a sentence. This stands in contrast to the usual approach of further grammar tailoring via the usual linguistic introspection in the hope of generating the correct parse. In head-to-head tests against one of the best existing robust probabilistic parsing models, which we call P-CFG, the HBG model significantly outperforms P-CFG, increasing the parsing accuracy rate from 60% to 75%, a 37% reduction in error."

As a consequence, one parse tree can usually be generated by several derivations that involve different subtrees. This leads to a statistics where the probability of a parse is equal to the sum of the probabilities of all its derivations. In (Scha, 1990) an informal introduction to DOP is given, while (Bod, 1992a) provides a formalization of the theory. In this paper we compare DOP with other stochastic grammars in the context of Formal Language Theory. It it proved that it is not possible to create for every DOP-model a strongly equivalent stochastic CFG which also assigns the same probabilities to the parses. We show that the maximum probability parse can be estimated in polynomial time by applying Monte Carlo techniques. The model was tested on a set of hand-parsed strings from the Air Travel Information System (ATIS) spoken language corpus. Preliminary experiments yield 96% test set parsing accuracy."

An innovative method (called \"CLAWS\") was recently developed by those working with the Lancaster-Oslo/Bergen Corpus of British English. This algorithm uses a systematic calculation based upon the probabilities of co-occurrence of particular tags. Its accuracy is high, but it is very slow, and it has been manually augmented in a number of ways. The effects upon accuracy of this manual augmentation are not individually known.The current paper presents an algorithm for disambiguation that is similar to CLAWS but that operates in linear rather than in exponential time and space, and which minimizes the unsystematic augments. Tests of the algorithm using the million words of the Brown Standard Corpus of English are reported; the overall accuracy is 96%. This algorithm can provide a fast and accurate front end to any parsing or natural language processing system for English."

                "text": "This paper examines the possibility of automatically discovering the lexieal features of a language. There is strong evidence that the set of possible lexical features which can be used in a language is unbounded, and thus not innate. Lakoff [Lakoff 87] describes a language in which the feature -I-woman-or-fire-ordangerons-thing exists. This feature is based upon ancient folklore of the society in which it is used. If the set of possible lexieal features is indeed unbounded, then it cannot be par t of the innate Universal Grammar and must be learned. Even if the set is not unbounded, the child is still left with the challenging task of determining which features are used in her language. If a child does not know a priori what lexical features are used in her language, there are two sources for acquiring this information: semantic and syntactic cues. A learner using semantic cues could recognize that words often refer to objects, actions, and properties, and from this deduce the lexical features: noun, verb and adjective. Pinker [Pinker 89] proposes that a combination of semantic cues and innate semantic primitives could account for the acquisition of verb features. He believes that the child can discover semantic properties of a verb by noticing the types of actions typically taking place when the verb is uttered. Once these properties are known, says Pinker, they can be used to reliably predict the distributional behavior of the verb. However, Gleitman [Gleitman 90] presents evidence that semantic cues axe not sufficient for a child to acquire verb features and believes that the use of this semantic information in conjunction with information about the subcategorization properties of the verb may be sufficient for learning verb features. This paper takes Glei tman's suggestion to the extreme, in hope of determining whether syntactic cues may not just aid in feature discovery, but may be all tha t is necessary. We present evidence for the sufficiency of a strictly syntax-based model for discovering"

                "text": "Recently there has been a conceptual shift to modular theories of syntax in linguistics. Instead of being based on complex and large rule systems, these theories rely on the interaction of a small set of universal principles that are parameterized across languages. These theories pose many new and difficult problems for the design of parsing systems. The major issue tackled in this thesis is how to achieve substantial linguistic coverage and efficient parsing whilst maintaining a level of representation of principles close to that used in the linguistics literature. \nThis thesis describes a principle-based parsing system that achieves substantial coverage. Because of the free and complex interaction between principles, one major barrier to the use of these theories has been the problem of finding a comprehensive, yet consistent set of principles. Using a small set of twenty-five principles, the system has been demonstrated to correctly account for hundreds of different constructions from an introductory linguistics textbook. Also, illustrating the universal nature of principle-based theories, the same set of principles has been demonstrated to cover examples of Japanese as well as English data. \nThis thesis also investigates the problem of configuring principles for efficient parsing. The parsing system incorporates flexible parameters of control independent from principle definitions. These control parameters effectively define a family of parsers that incorporate the same linguistic knowledge, but with different performance characteristics. By investigating the effect of variations in control settings, we obtain a characterization of the relevant computational properties of principles that determine the most appropriate control configurations for efficient parsing. \nLastly, this thesis investigates the problem of representing principles at a level that is readily accessible to the linguist. Given the continual revision of linguistic theories, parsing systems must be updated frequently to track the revisions and advances in linguistic theory. By adopting a high-level, logic-based representation, together with the use of automatic compilation techniques, the system tackles the problem of bridging the gap between an abstract and an efficiently executable representation. This approach simplifies the necessary task of formalization and provides an answer to the parser obsolescence problem.

This paper describes a computational grammar coder which has been completely programmed and is oper~tional on Lhe IBM 7090. It is part of a complete syntactic annlysis system for which it accomplishes word-class coding, using a computational approach rather than the usual method of dictionary lookup. The resulting system is completely contained in less than 1~,000 computer words. It processes running English text on the IBM 7090 at a rate of more than 1250 words per minute. Since the system is not dependent on large dictionaries, it operates on any ordinary English text. In preliminary experiments with scientific text, the system correctly and unambiguously coded over 90 percent of the words in two samples of scientific writing. A fair proportion of the remaining ambiguity can be removed at higher levels of synvactic analysis, but the problem of structural ambiguity in natural languages is seen to be a critical one in the development of practical language processing systems."

The algorithm works by beginning in a very naive state of knowledge about phrase structure. By repeatedly comparing the results of bracketing in the current state to proper bracketing provided in the training corpus, the system learns a set of simple structural transformations that can be applied to reduce the number of errors. After describing the algorithm, we present results and compare these results to other recent results in automatic grammar induction."

The technique duplicates the performance of hand-coded rules and requires human intervention only during the training phase. Because the training instances are built on parser output rather than word cooccurrences, the technique requires a small number of training examples and can be used on small to medium-sized corpora. Our initial results suggest that the approach may provide a general method for the automated acquisition of a variety of disambiguation heuristics for natural language systems, especially for problems that require the assimilation of syntactic and semantic knowledge."

Starting from scratch, automated and semiautomated methods are employed to build a part of speech tagger for the text. There are three steps to building the tagger: uncovering a set of part of speech tags, building a lexicon which indicates for each word its most likely tag, and learning rules to both correct mistakes in the learned lexicon and discover where contextual information can repair tagging mistakes. The long term goal of this work is to create a system which would enable somebody to take a large text in a language he does not know, and with only a few hours of help from a speaker of the language, accurately annotate the text with part of speech information."

Instead, the APRIL system seeks a labelled tree structure which maximizes a numerical measure of conformity to statistical norms derived from a sample of parsed text. No distinction between legal and illegal trees arises: any labelled tree has a value. Because the search space is large and has an irregular geometry, APRIL seeks the best tree using simulated annealing, a stochastic optimization technique. Beginning with an arbitrary tree, many randomly-generated local modifications are considered and adopted or rejected according to their effect on tree-value: acceptance decisions are made probabilistically, subject to a bias against adverse moves which is very weak at the outset but is made to increase as the random walk through the search space continues. This enables the system to converge on the global optimum without getting trapped in local optima. Performance of an early version of the APRIL system on authentic inputs is yielding analyses with a mean accuracy of 75.3% using a schedule which increases processing linearly with sentence-length; modifications currently being implemented should eliminate a high proportion of the remaining errors."

These constraints are important in blocking incorrect analyses in natural language processing systems. However, these constraints are domain-specific and hence must be developed anew when a system is ported to a new domain. A discovery procedure for selectional constraints is therefore essential in enhancing the portability of such systems.This paper describes a semi-automated procedure for collecting the co-occurrence patterns from a sample of texts in a domain, and then using these patterns as the basis for selectional constraints in analyzing further texts. We discuss some of the difficulties in automating the collection process, and describe two experiments that measure the completeness of these patterns and their effectiveness compared with manually-prepared patterns. We then describe and evaluate a procedure for selectional constraint relaxation, intended to compensate for gaps in the set of patterns. Finally, we suggest how these procedures could be combined with a system that queries a domain expert, in order to produce a more efficient discovery procedure."

This method is based on the hypothesis that constituent boundaries can be extracted from a given sentence (or word sequence) by analyzing the mutual information values of the part of speech n-grams within the sentence. This hypothesis is supported by the performance of an implementation of this parsing algorithm which determines a recursive unlabeled bracketing of unrestricted English text with a relatively low error rate. This paper derives the generalized mutual information statistic, describes the parsing algorithm, and presents results and sample output from the parser."

In this lecture we review some known algorithms which handle PCFGs; in particular an algorithm for the computation of the total probability that a PCFG generates a given sentence (Inside), an algorithm for finding the most probable parse tree (Viterbi), and an algorithm for the estimation of the probabilities of the rewriting rules of a PCFG given a corpus (Inside-Outside). Moreover, we introduce the Left-to-Right Inside algorithm, which computes the probability that successive applications of the grammar rewriting rules (beginning with the sentence start symbol s) produce a word string whose initial substring is a given one."

                "text": "A recent article, The importance of language universals,' raises a problem that is fundamental to all linguistic science, and is of particular relevance at the present time in the light of current developments in linguistic method. The authors refer to the importance of studying those features of culture that are found to be universal in human society, one of which is language itself. They then suggest (and this is a topic that requires some elaboration) that linguistics and the study of languages will be benefited by an investigation of 'universals of language', features of human language exhibited everywhere, in all speech communities. They proceed to suggest and enumerate such universals in the fields of phonology, grammar, and semantics. A quest for what the authors call 'language universals' has been part of general linguistic studies throughout their history, and has been felt by many to be the factor of unity in the subject and a justification for regarding linguistics, the study of language, as an academic discipline separate from the study of various individual languages.2 In his inaugural address,3 delivered in Amsterdam in May 1947, Reichling discusses the present state and outlook of linguistic studies, and concludes that while there is of course no 'general language' studied in general linguistics, linguistics is an 'empirical science' which 'aims at tracing and defining the universal categories of speech-phenomena, as well as the factors on which these categories depend. It further studies the non-universal categories of speechphenomena in their relation to the universal ones.' Ernst Otto4 declares: 'die allgemeine Sprachwissenschaft hat die Aufgabe, die durchgehenden Kategorien der menschlichen Sprache heraus zu arbeiten'. On this view, linguistics is an inductive science seeking general rules underlying particular phenomena, and general features common to all individual languages. In the field of grammar, which is discussed more specifically in this paper, Hjelmslev has made an important contribution in his Principes de grammaire g6ndrale,6 and any consideration of general grammatical problems must take his treatment of the subject into account. He states that, without the concept of a general 'panchronic', abstract system of grammar, the study of individual languages will be little more than 'nihilism', depending for its methods solely on pragmatic convenience. By 'panchronic' Hjelmslev means a grammatical framework that shall"

The initial grammar for the inference process makes no assumption of the kinds of structures and their distributions. The inferred grammar is evaluated by its predicting power and by comparing the bracketing of held out sentences imposed by the inferred grammar with the partial bracketings of these sentences given in the corpus. Using part-of-speech tags as the only source of lexical information, high bracketing accuracy is achieved even with a small subset of the available training material (1045 sentences): 94.4% for test sentences shorter than 10 words and 90.2% for sentences shorter than 15 words."

In this paper, we present a simple rule-based part of speech tagger which automatically acquires its rules and tags with accuracy comparable to stochastic taggers. The rule-based tagger has many advantages over these taggers, including: a vast reduction in stored information required, the perspicuity of a small set of meaningful rules, ease of finding and implementing improvements to the tagger, and better portability from one tag set, corpus genre or language to another. Perhaps the biggest contribution of this work is in demonstrating that the stochastic method is not the only viable method for part of speech tagging. The fact that a simple rule-based tagger that automatically learns its rules can perform so well should offer encouragement for researchers to further explore rule-based tagging, searching for a better and more expressive set of rule templates and other variations on the simple but effective theme described below."

This paper presents a generalization of these algorithms to certain denumerable\u2010state, hidden Markov processes. This algorithm permits automatic training of the stochastic analog of an arbitrary context free grammar. In particular, in contrast to many grammatical inference methods, the new algorithm allows the grammar to have an arbitrary degree of ambiguity. Since natural language is often syntactically ambiguous, it is necessary for the grammatical inference algorithm to allow for this ambiguity. Furthermore, allowing ambiguity in the grammar allows errors in the recognition process to be explicitly modeled in the grammar rather than added as an extra component."

They propose a model that administrators can employ that minimizes bias. In a similar vein, the next chapter, by Jeffery Braden and Sandra Fradd, suggests ways that administrators can anticipate difficulties and intervene before such referrals are necessary. William Tikunoff, in the eighth chapter, focuses on instructional leadership. He discusses the characteristics of an effective principal and targets specific areas, such as effective time management. The final chapter, by Beatrice Ward, addresses the greatest resource of any educational institution: the teachers. She describes the clinical approach to teacher development and how it can be implemented. Overall, this book fills a need for basic, factual information about legal requirements, program types, and effective instructional and leadership strategies with respect to the LEP population. Furthermore, it provides guidance on the complex issue of special education for LEP students, particularly the referral process. An additional chapter exploring different models for assessment and program design for these students would have provided depth and balance. Although there is necessarily some overlap between the chapters, it is reinforcing, not repetitive. In addition to being extremely useful to administrators, this book would be of value to school personnel such as psychologists, special education consultants, LEP consultants, instructors-in short, for anyone committed to the design and delivery of effective instructional programs for LEP students."

Words are represented by the relative frequency distributions of contexts in which they appear, and relative entropy between those distributions is used as the similarity measure for clustering. Clusters are represented by average context distributions derived from the given words according to their probabilities of cluster membership. In many cases, the clusters can be thought of as encoding coarse sense distinctions. Deterministic annealing is used to find lowest distortion sets of clusters: as the annealing parameter increases, existing clusters become unstable and subdivide, yielding a hierarchical \"soft\" clustering of the data. Clusters are used as the basis for class models of word coocurrence, and the models evaluated with respect to held-out test data."

These results show that phrase structure trees, when viewed in certain ways, have much more descriptive power than one would have thought. We have given a brief account of local constraints on structural descriptions and an intuitive proof of a theorem about local constraints. We have compared the local constraints approach to some aspects of Gazdar's framework and that of Peters and Ritchie and of Karttunen. We have also presented some results on skeletons (phrase structure trees without labels) which show that phrase structure trees, even when deprived of the labels, retain in a certain sense all the structural information. This result has implications for grammatical inference procedures."

Given a corpus of text, one can measure the tendencies of pairs of words to occur in common contexts, and use these measurements to define clusters of words. Applied to basic English text, this procedure yields clusters which correspond very closely to the traditional parts of speech (nouns, verbs, articles, etc.). For FORTRAN text, the clusters obtained correspond to integers, operations, etc.; for English text regarded as a sequence of letters (or of phonemes) rather than words, the vowels and the consonants are obtained as clusters. Finally, applied to the gray shades in a digitized picture, the procedure yields slice levels which appear to be useful for figure extraction."

Unfortunately, there is no obvious alternative, no other simple way for lexicographers to keep track of what has been done or for readers to find the word they are looking for. But a frequent objection to this solution is that finding things on an alphabetical list can be tedious and time-consuming. Many people who would like to refer to a dictionary decide not to bother with it because finding the information would interrupt their work and break their train of thought."

Simulated annealing (e.g. Kirkpatrick et alo 1983, Bridle & Moore 1984, Ackley et al. 1985) is a stochastic computational technique for finding optimal solutions to combinatorial problems for which the combinatorial explosion phenomenon rules out the possibility of systematically examining each alternative. It is currently being applied to the practical problem of optimizing the physical design of computer circuitry, and to the theoretical problems of resolving patterns of auditory and visual stimulation into meaningful arrangements of phonemes and three-dimensional objects. Grammatical parsing -resolving unanalysed linear sequences of words into meaningful grammatical structures -can be regarded as a perception problem logically analogous to those just cited, and simulated annealing holds great promise as a parsing technique."

Since k-DL properly includes other well-known techniques for representing Boolean functions such as k-CNF (formulae in conjunctive normal form with at most k literals per clause), k-DNF (formulae in disjunctive normal form with at most k literals per term), and decision trees of depth k, our result strictly increases the set of functions that are known to be polynomially learnable, in the sense of Valiant (1984). Our proof is constructive: we present an algorithm that can efficiently construct an element of k-DL consistent with a given set of examples, if one exists."

This new technology led to major breakthroughs in the quality of both data and theory. The field is now at the threshold of a possible second major breakthrough stimulated by the dissemination of personal computing. Researchers are now able to transcribe tape-recorded data into computer files. With this new medium it is easy to conduct global searches for word combinations across collections of files. It is also possible to enter new codings of the basic text line. Because of the speed and accuracy with which computer files can be copied, it is now much easier to share data between researchers. To foster this sharing of computerized data, a group of child language researchers has established the Child Language Data Exchange System (CHILDES). This article details the formation of the CHILDES, the governance of the system, the nature of the database, the shape of the coding conventions, and the types of computer programs being developed."

The first edition of this book, Programming Perl, hit the shelves in 1990, and was quickly adopted as the undisputed bible of the language. Since then, Perl has grown with the times, and so has this book. \nProgramming Perl is not just a book about Perl. It is also a unique introduction to the language and its culture, as one might expect only from its authors. Larry Wall is the inventor of Perl, and provides a unique perspective on the evolution of Perl and its future direction. Tom Christiansen was one of the first champions of the language, and lives and breathes the complexities of Perl internals as few other mortals do. Jon Orwant is the editor of The Perl Journal, which has brought together the Perl community as a common forum for new developments in Perl. \nAny Perl book can show the syntax of Perl's functions, but only this one is a comprehensive guide to all the nooks and crannies of the language. Any Perl book can explain typeglobs, pseudohashes, and closures, but only this one shows how they really work. Any Perl book can say that my is faster than local, but only this one explains why. Any Perl book can have a title, but only this book is affectionately known by all Perl programmers as The Camel. \nThis third edition of Programming Perl has been expanded to cover version 5.6 of this maturing language. New topics include threading, the compiler, Unicode, and other new features that have been added since the previous edition."

Its appearance is so frequent, and the phenomena in which it appears so diverse, that one is led to the conjecture that if these phenomena have any property in common it can only be a similarity in the structure of the underlying probability mechanisms. The empirical distributions to which we shall refer specifically are: (A) distributions of words in prose samples by their frequency of occurrence, (B) distributions of scientists by number of papers published, (C) distributions of cities by population, (D) distributions of incomes by size, and (E) distributions of biological genera by number of species. No one supposes that there is any connexion between horse-kicks suffered by soldiers in the German army and blood cells on a microscope slide other than that the same urn scheme provides a satisfactory abstract model of both phenomena. It is in the same direction that we shall look for an explanation of the observed close similarities among the five classes of distributions listed above. The observed distributions have the following characteristics in common: (a) They are J-shaped, or at least highly skewed, with very long upper tails. The tails can generally be approximated closely by a function of the form"

Attention has particularly focused on the ECP as a constraint on the representations resulting from Wh Movement (see for example Jaeggli (1980a), Chomsky (1981a), Kayne (1981a), Stowell (1981), Huang (1982)). In this article we will address such issues as (a) the definition of \u201cproper government,\u201d (b) the level(s) of representation to which the ECP applies, and (c) the relationship between the ECP and other principles. We will integrate this discussion into a treatment of Wh Movement in general and wh-in-situ in particular."

                "text": "RESUMEN Cualquier enfoque serio del estudio del lenguaje parte del uso de sentido comun, reemplazandolo por algun concepto tecnico. La practica general ha sido definir \u201clenguaje\u201d como extensional y externalizado (lenguaje-E). Sin embargo, tal concepto de lenguaje y sus variantes plantea numerosos problemas , y en este articulo se argumenta que el lenguaje-E es un termino artificial sin estatus alguno en una teoria del lenguaje. Una tactica mejor seria considerar el \u201clenguaje\u201d como intensional e internalizado (lenguaje-I). Teniendo presente esta concepcion, el enfoque del lenguaje como conocimiento de una capacidad \u2013 algo muy comun entre los filosofos influenciados por Wittgenstein\u2013 se rechaza como pura fantasia. Por otra parte, el abandono de las reglas en favor de principios generales hace que la cuestion de por que elegimos unas reglas en vez de otras, simplemente no se plantea. Todo esto parece forzarnos a abandonar muchas doctrinas comunmente aceptadas sobre el lenguaje y el conocimiento. Hay una estructura innata que determina el armazon dentro del cual se desarrollan el pensamiento y el lenguaje, llegando hasta detalles muy precisos e intrincados. El lenguaje y el pensamiento se despiertan en la mente y siguen un curso en gran medida predeterminado, del mismo modo que muchas otras propiedades biologicas."

This connection to statistical mechanics exposes new information and provides an unfamiliar perspective on traditional optimization problems and methods."

Thus, for example, it is hard for most parsers to take advantage of the fact that wine is typically drunk, produced, and sold, but (probably) not pruned. So too, it is hard for a parser to know which verbs go with which prepositions (e.g., set up) and which nouns fit together to form compound noun phrases (e.g., computer programmer). This paper will attempt to show that many of these types of concerns can be addressed with syntactic methods (symbol pushing), and need not require explicit semantic interpretation. We have found that it is possible to identify many of these interesting co-occurrence relations by computing simple summary statistics over millions of words of text. This paper will summarize a number of experiments carried out by various subsets of the authors over the last few years. The term collocation will be used quite broadly to include constraints on SVO (subject verb object) triples, phrasal verbs, compound noun phrases, and psycholinguistic notions of word association (e.g., doctorinurse)."

Verbs are detected by a novel technique based on the Case Filter of Rouvret and Vergnaud (1980). The completeness of the output list increases monotonically with the total number of occurrences of each verb in the corpus. False positive rates are one to three percent of observations. Five SFs are currently detected and more are planned. Ultimately, I expect to provide a large SF dictionary to the NLP community and to train dictionaries for specific corpora."
