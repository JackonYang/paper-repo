As of December 1998 the database includes 556 forms produced by approximately 250 different writers. The database consists of full English sentences. It could serve as a basis for a variety of handwriting recognition tasks. The main focus, however is on recognition techniques that use linguistic knowledge beyond the lexicon level. This knowledge can be automatically derived from the corpus or it can be supplied from external sources."

In contrast to other systems, whole lines of text are the basic units for the recognizer. Thus the difficult problem of segmenting a line of text into individual words can be avoided. Another novel feature of the system is the incorporation of a statistical language model into the recognizer. Experiments on the database described previously by the authors (1999) have shown that a recognition rate on the word level of 79.5% and 60.05% for small (776 words) and larger (7719 words) vocabularies can be reached. These figures increase to 84.3% and 67.32% if the top ten choices are taken into account."

Five functional modules included in the system are introduced in this paper: (i) pre-processing, which concerns introducing an image representation for easy manipulation of large page images and image handling procedures using the image representation; (ii) line separation, concerning text line detection and extracting images of lines of text from a page image; (iii) word segmentation, which concerns locating word gaps and isolating words from a line of text image obtained efficiently and in an intelligent manner; (iv) word recognition, concerning handwritten word recognition algorithms; and (v) linguistic post-pro- cessing, which concerns the use of linguistic constraints to intelligently parse and recognize text. Key ideas employed in each functional module, which have been developed for dealing with the diversity of handwriting in its various aspects with a goal of system reliability and robustness, are described in this paper. Preliminary experiments show promising results in terms of speed and accuracy."

Thus linguistic knowledge beyond the lexicon level is incorporated in the recognition process. Another novel feature of the system is that the HMM is applied in such a way that the difficult problem of segmenting a line of text into individual words is avoided. A number of experiments with various language models and large vocabularies have been conducted. The language models used in the system were also analytically compared based on their perplexity."

The features extracted mainly correspond to visible characteristics of the writing, for example, the width, the slant and the height of the three main writing zones. Additionally, features based on the fractal behavior of the writing, which are correlated with the writing's legibility, are used. With these features two classifiers are applied: a k-nearest neighbor and a feedforward neural network classifier. In the experiments, 100 pages of text written by 20 different writers are used. By classifying individual text lines, an average recognition rate of 87.8% for the k-nearest neighbor and 90.7% for the neural network is measured. By a simple maximum ranking over all lines of a page, all texts are correctly assigned to the corresponding writers. Compared to these results, an average recognition rate of 98% was measured when humans assigned persons to the text lines."

The system is based on Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) using discrete and hybrid modeling techniques. Here, we focus on two aspects of the recognition system. First, we present different hybrid modeling techniques, whereas one depends on an information theory-based neural network (MMI-criterion) used as a vector quantizer and the other uses a neural net for estimating the a posteriori probabilities to replace the codebook of a tied-mixture HMM system. This is the first paper where we present this novel approach -called tied posteriors- for handwriting recognition. Second, we demonstrate the usage of a language model, that consists of character n-grams, as an alternative to the recognition with a large dictionary of German words. Our resulting system for character recognition yields significantly better recognition results using an unlimited vocabulary."

The other is to offer a means by which an evaluator can compare various algorithms objectively. The authors collected 100 sets of KS 2350 handwritten Korean character images. They tried to collect as many writing styles as possible. The first 70 sets were generated by more than 500 different writers, and each of the remaining 30 sets was written by the same person. Writers wrote down the characters in prespecified boxes and the database was created by scanning the data sheets by an image scanner. Each image is the size of 100/spl times/100 with 256 gray levels. Finally, the authors analyze the quality of the database created and calculated various statistics of the database PE92.<<ETX>>"

If this is the case it is likely that recognizing these features will be a useful technique for the machine recognition of cursive script. A new method of detecting the presence of these features in a cursive handwritten word is described. The method uses constrained snakes which adapt to fit the maxima in the distance transform of a word image while retaining their basic shape. When the shape has settled into a potential minimum its goodness-of-fit is used to determine whether a match has been found. The features located by this method are passed on to a neural network recognizer. Examples of the features recognized are shown, and results for word recognition for this method on a single-author database of scanned data with 825 word vocabulary are presented.<<ETX>>"

The purpose of the project is to propose and implement solutions to the growing need of handwriting samples for online handwriting recognizers used by pen-based computers. Researchers from several companies and universities have agreed on a data format, a platform of data exchange and a protocol for recognizer benchmarks. The online handwriting data of concern may include handprint and cursive from various alphabets (including Latin and Chinese), signatures and pen gestures. These data will be compiled and distributed by the Linguistic Data Consortium. The benchmarks will be arbitrated the US National Institute of Standards and Technologies. We give a brief introduction to the UNIPEN format. We explain the protocol of data exchange and benchmarks."

Different experimental approaches for incorporating these recognition methods into a more powerful system are also presented. The resulting multiple-expert system proves that the consensus of these methods tends to compensate for individual weaknesses, while preserving individual strengths. It is shown that it is possible to reduce the substitution rate to a desired level while maintaining a fairly high recognition rate in the classification of totally unconstrained handwritten ZIP code numerals. If reliability is of the utmost importance, substitutions can be avoided completely (reliability=100%) while retaining a recognition rate above 90%. Results are compared with those for some of the most effective numeral recognition systems found in the literature. >"
