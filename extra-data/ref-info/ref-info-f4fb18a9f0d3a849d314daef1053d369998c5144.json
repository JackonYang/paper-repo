Let r, g and b denote the 3 color bands of the image of an object (stretched out as vectors) then the color angular index comprises the 3 inter-band angles (one per pair of image vectors). The color edge angular index is calculated from the image's color edge map (the Laplacian of the color bands) in a similar way. These angles capture important low-order statistical information about the color and edge distributions and invariant to the spectral power distribution of the scene illuminant. The 6 illumination-invariant angles provide the basis for angular indexing into a database of objects or textures and has been tested on both Swain's database of color objects which were all taken under the same illuminant and Healey and Wang's database of color textures which were taken under several different illuminants. Color angular indexing yields excellent recognition rates for both data sets."

Object appearance is represented by colour-based features computed from image neighbourhoods with multi-modal colour density function. Stable invariants are derived from modes of the density function that are robustly located by the mean shift algorithm. The problem of extracting local invariant colour features is addressed directly, without a need for prior segmentation or edge detection. The signature is concise - an image is typically represented by a few hundred bytes, a few thousands for very complex scenes. \n \nThe algorithm's performance is first tested on a region-based image retrieval task achieving a good (92%) hit rate at a speed of 600 image comparisons per second. The method is shown to operate successfully under changing illumination, viewpoint and object pose, as well as non-rigid object deformation, partial occlusion and the presence of background clutter dominating the scene. The performance of the multimodal neighbourhood signature method is also evaluated on a standard colour object recognition task using a publicly available dataset. Very good recognition performance (average match percentile 99.5%) was achieved in real time (average 0.28 seconds for recognising a single image) which compares favourably with results reported in the literature."

Color indexing fails, however, when the incident illumination varies either spatially or spectrally. Although this limitation might be overcome by preprocessing with a color constancy algorithm, we instead propose histogramming color ratios. Since the ratios of color RGB triples from neighboring locations are relatively insensitive to changes in the incident illumination, this circumvents the need for color constancy preprocessing. Results of tests with the new color-constant-color-indexing algorithm on synthetic and real images show that it works very well even when the illumination varies spatially in its intensity and color. >"

The interface reflection represents the highlights from the original image, and the body reflection represents the original image with highlights removed. Such intrinsic images are of interest because the geometric properties of each type of reflection are simpler than the geometric properties of intensity in a black-and-white image. The algorithm is based upon a physical model of reflection which states that two distinct types of reflection--interface and body reflection--occur, and that each type can be decomposed into a relative spectral distribution and a geometric scale factor. This model is far more general than typical models used in computer vision and computer graphics, and includes most such models as special cases. In addition, the model does not assume a point light source or uniform illumination distribution over the scene. The properties of spectral projection into color space are used to derive a new model of pixel-value color distribution, and this model is exploited in an algorithm to derive the intrinsic images. Suggestions are provided for extending the model to deal with diffuse illumination and for analyzing the intrinsic images of reflection. Additional keywords: Dischromatic reflection model. (Author)"

The extension of feature detection to the color domain prevents information loss due to isoluminance and allows us to exploit the photometric information. To fully exploit the extra information in the color data, the vector nature of color data has to be taken into account and a sound framework is needed to combine feature and photometric invariance theory. In this paper, we focus on the structure tensor, or color tensor, which adequately handles the vector nature of color images. Further, we combine the features based on the color tensor with photometric invariant derivatives to arrive at photometric invariant features. We circumvent the drawback of unstable photometric invariants by deriving an uncertainty measure to accompany the photometric invariant derivatives. The uncertainty is incorporated in the color tensor, hereby allowing the computation of robust photometric invariant features. The combination of the photometric invariance theory and tensor-based features allows for detection of a variety of features such as photometric invariant edges, corners, optical flow, and curvature. The proposed features are tested for noise characteristics and robustness to photometric changes. Experiments show that the proposed features are robust to scene incidental events and that the proposed uncertainty measure improves the applicability of full invariants."

We exploit the Gaussian scale-space paradigm for color images to define a framework for the robust measurement of object reflectance from color images. Object reflectance is derived from a physical reflectance model based on the Kubelka-Munk theory for colorant layers. Illumination and geometrical invariant properties are derived from the reflectance model. Invariance and discriminative power of the color invariants is experimentally investigated, showing the invariants to be successful in discounting shadow, illumination, highlights, and noise. Extensive experiments show the different invariants to be highly discriminative, while maintaining invariance properties. The presented framework for color measurement is well-founded in the physics of color as well as in measurement science. Hence, the proposed invariants are considered more adequate for the measurement of invariant color features than existing methods."

However, it is unclear which descriptors are more appropriate and how their performance depends on the interest point detector. The descriptors should be distinctive and at the same time robust to changes in viewing conditions as well as to errors of the point detector. Our evaluation uses as criterion detection rate with respect to false positive rate and is carried out for different image transformations. We compare SIFT descriptors (Lowe, 1999), steerable filters (Freeman and Adelson, 1991), differential invariants (Koenderink ad van Doorn, 1987), complex filters (Schaffalitzky and Zisserman, 2002), moment invariants (Van Gool et al., 1996) and cross-correlation for different types of interest points. In this evaluation, we observe that the ranking of the descriptors does not depend on the point detector and that SIFT descriptors perform best. Steerable filters come second ; they can be considered a good choice given the low dimensionality."

This bag of keypoints method is based on vector quantization of affine invariant descriptors of image patches. We propose and compare two alternative implementations using different classifiers: Naive Bayes and SVM. The main advantages of the method are that it is simple, computationally efficient and intrinsically invariant. We present results for classifying nine semantic visual categories and comment on results obtained by Fergus et al using a different method on the same data set. We obtain excellent results as well for multi class categorization as for object detection. A thorough evaluation clearly demonstrates that our method is robust to background clutter and produces good categorization accuracy even without exploiting geometric information."

Textures are represented using a part dictionary found by quantizing the appearance of scale- or affine- invariant keypoints. Object classes are represented using a dictionary of composite semi-local parts, or groups of neighboring keypoints with stable and distinctive appearance and geometric layout. A discriminative maximum entropy framework is used to learn the posterior distribution of the class label given the occurrences of parts from the dictionary in the training set. Experiments on two texture and two object databases demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework for visual classification."

For these applications, robustness with respect to shadows, shading, and specularities is desired. Features based on derivatives of photometric invariants, which we is called full invariants, provide the desired robustness. However, because computation of photometric invariants involves nonlinear transformations, these features are unstable and, therefore, impractical for many applications. We propose a new class of derivatives which we refer to as quasi-invariants. These quasi-invariants are derivatives which share with full photometric invariants the property that they are insensitive for certain photometric edges, such as shadows or specular edges, but without the inherent instabilities of full photometric invariants. Experiments show that the quasi-invariant derivatives are less sensitive to noise and introduce less edge displacement than full invariant derivatives. Moreover, quasi-invariants significantly outperform the full invariant derivatives in terms of discriminative power."

If the two illuminants are the same colour but are placed at different positions then corresponding rgb pixels are related by simple scale factors. In contrast if the lighting geometry is held fixed but the colour of the light changes then it is the individual colour channels (e.g. all the red pixel values or all the green pixels) that are a scaling apart. It is well known that the image dependencies due to lighting geometry and illuminant colour can be respectively removed by normalizing the magnitude of the rgb pixel triplets (e.g. by calculating chromaticities) and by normalizing the lengths of each colour channel (by running the \u2018grey-world\u2019 colour constancy algorithm). However, neither normalization suffices to account for changes in both the lighting geometry and illuminant colour."

In this article we propose a new hypothesis for color constancy, namely the Grey-Edge hypothesis assuming that the average edge difference in a scene is achromatic. Based on this hypothesis, we propose an algorithm for color constancy. Recently, the Grey-World hypothesis and the max-RGB method were shown to be two instantiations of a Minkowski norm based color constancy method. Similarly we also propose a more general version of the Grey-Edge hypothesis which assumes that the Minkowsky norm of derivatives of the reflectance of surfaces is achromatic. The algorithms are tested on a large data set of images under different illuminants, and the results show that the new method outperforms the Grey-World assumption and the max-RGB method. Results are comparable to more elaborate algorithms, however at lower computational costs."

Objects are modeled as flexible constellations of parts. A probabilistic representation is used for all aspects of the object: shape, appearance, occlusion and relative scale. An entropy-based feature detector is used to select regions and their scale within the image. In learning the parameters of the scale-invariant object model are estimated. This is done using expectation-maximization in a maximum-likelihood setting. In recognition, this model is used in a Bayesian manner to classify images. The flexible nature of the model is demonstrated by excellent results over a range of datasets including geometrically constrained classes (e.g. faces, cars) and flexible objects (such as animals)."

A consequence of this result is that any color constancy algorithm that makes 3\u20132 assumptions, such as the Maloney\u2013Wandell subspace algorithm, Forsyth\u2019s MWEXT, and the Funt\u2013Drew lightness algorithm, must effectively calculate a simple von Kries-type scaling of sensor responses, i.e., a diagonal matrix. Our results are strong in the sense that no constraint is placed on the initial spectral sensitivities of the sensors. In addition to purely theoretical arguments, we present results from simulations of von Kries-type color constancy in which the spectra of real illuminants and reflectances along with the human-cone-sensitivity functions are used. The simulations demonstrate that when the cone sensor space is transformed to its new basis in the appropriate manner a diagonal matrix supports nearly optimal color constancy."
