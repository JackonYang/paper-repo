Measures of match which are suitable for this purpose are discussed, as are methods for pruning the search for a match. The mathematics necessary to convert a set of matchings into a workable camera model are given, along with calculations which use this model and a pair of image points to locate the corresponding scene point. Methods are included to detect some types of unmatchable target areas in the original data and for detecting when a supposed match is invalid. Region growing techniques are di9 for extend matching areas into regions of constant parallax and for delimiting uniform regions in an image. Also, two algorithms are presented to show some of the ways in which these techniques can be combined to perform useful tasks in the processing of stereo images."

A class of algorithms, which may be used to determine similarity in a far more efficient manner than methods currently in use, is introduced in this paper. There may be a saving of computation time of two orders of magnitude or more by adopting this new approach. The problem of translational image registration, used for an example throughout, is discussed and the problems with the most widely used method-correlation explained. Simple implementations of the new algorithms are introduced to motivate the basic idea of their structure.

The author has analyzed the computations performed in the course of visual motion analysis. Workable schemes able to perform certain tasks performed by the visual system have been constructed and used as vehicles for investigating the problems faced by the visual system and its methods for solving them.Two major problems are treated: first, the correspondence problem, which concerns the identification of image elements that represent the same object at different times, thereby maintaining the perceptual identity of the object in motion or in change. The second problem is the three-dimensional interpretation of the changing image once a correspondence has been established.The author's computational approach to visual theory makes the work unique, and it should be of interest to psychologists working in visual perception and readers interested in cognitive studies in general, as well as computer scientists interested in machine vision, theoretical neurophysiologists, and philosophers of science."

The pictures are first geometrically normalized to a common point of view. Then they are photometrically normalized to eliminate the differences due to different illumination, camera characteristics, and reflectance properties of the scene due to different sun and view angles. These pictures are then geometrically registered by maximizing the cross correlation between areas in them. The final normalized and registered pictures are then differenced point by point."

In Foundations of Cyclopean Perception (first published in 1971 and unavailable for years), Bela Julesz traced the visual information flow in the brain, analyzing how the brain combines separate images received from the two eyes to produce depth perception. Julesz developed novel tools to do this: random-dot stereograms and cinematograms, generated by early digital computers at Bell Labs. These images, when viewed with the special glasses that came with the book, revealed complex, three-dimensional surfaces; this mode of visual stimulus became a paradigm for research in vision and perception. This reprint edition includes all 48 color random-dot designs from the original, as well as the special 3-D glasses required to view them.Foundations of Cyclopean Perception has had a profound impact on the vision studies community. It was chosen as one of the one hundred most influential works in cognitive science in a poll conducted by the University of Minnesota's Center for Cognitive Sciences. Many copies are \"permanently borrowed\" from college libraries; used copies are sought after online. Now, with this facsimile of the 1971 edition, the book is available again to cognitive scientists, neuroscientists, vision researchers, artists, and designers."
