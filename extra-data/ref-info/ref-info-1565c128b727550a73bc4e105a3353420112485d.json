                "text": "Previous to the war 1914-1918, Siam had already realised the usefulness of aircraft. In 1911, the Ministry of War sent three officers of the Royal Engineer to study the art of flying in France. After having obtained their certificates, they returned to Siam in 1913. The Siamese Royal Flying Corps was then established to train pilot and organize Military Aviation. When the Siamese Government declared War on the Central Powers, in 1917, a contingent of pilots and mechanics, together with motor transport and troops, were sent to join the Allies in France. At the end of the War, owing to all the world\u2019s progress in aviation, and owing to the necessity for the development in flying service for military, and above all for civil purposes the Royal Flying Corps was then turned into the Royal Aeronautical Service; with the aim to direct general aviation of the country and to seek the ways and means of using aircraft for public benefit. On October 13, 1919, the Siamese Government signed the International Convention concerning Aerial Navigation. The Royal Aeronautical Service employs many kinds of aeroplanes for different purposes, among which are some of Siamese design."
