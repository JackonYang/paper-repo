                "text": "The relation of the structure of the retina to factors influencing visual acuity is examined in some detail. Dimensions of the foveal cones have been redetermined in a series of measurements on histological materials from several sources. In no case has center to center distance between the most central cones in adult human eyes been found less than 2.0\u03bc nor greater than 2.3\u03bc, these being values for the living eye, due allowance being made for shrinkage of the preparations. Photomicrographs of the central foveal mosaic are shown to illustrate the rapid increase in center to center distance between cones a short distance from the small central fovea. These results are in general agreement with those of Polyak. This cone mosaic is in good accord with the observed effect on resolution acuity of the particular location of the image within the fovea. The central cones are of such size that the optical system of the eye at optimum pupil concentrates approximately three-quarters of the energy of a star image into a circle containing three cones, but some additional optical mechanism must exist in the retina to prevent loss of this image quality by spread of rays after the focus, but within the retinal depth represented by the length of the cones. Optical processes occurring within the cones are considered in detail. It is shown that not only is the Stiles and Crawford effect explained quantitatively by these processes, but also that the spread of rays beyond the focus is prevented, so that the retinal mosaic can behave as though the light receptors were concentrated in the focal plane. This same process also makes possible greatly increased light absorption per unit weight of cone pigment. The structure of the retina is thus consistent, numerically, with resolution acuity at high illumination but does not account for observed changes in acuity as retinal illumination is reduced. Ballistic stimulation of 10 microsecond duration eliminates effect of eye movements and serves to test both the Hecht theory of change of acuity with luminance, and the alternate hypothesis that very few quanta are absorbed per cone at threshold, statistical variation in this number accounting for the acuity change. The result of these experiments indicates that neither theory can be accepted."

A beam of light, reflected from a plane mirror on a contact lens, is used to project onto a screen an image of a dark line against a bright background. The screen is viewed by the same eye through an optical system which compensates for the doubling of the angle of rotation of the beam projected from the mirror on the contact lens. Thus, any motion of the eye causes a deviation of the beam such that the retinal image of the projected line undergoes the same displacement as do the retinal receptor cells. By comparison with normal viewing of the same test objects it is found that (1) when first presented, the finest lines are seen with normal or slightly better than normal acuity, (2) within a few seconds the lines begin to disappear, and (3) within one minute even coarse lines are seen only intermittently. The results may be interpreted in terms of local retinal adaptation to a stationary field."

Only one parameter, the quantum efficiency of the primary photo process, locates position on this scale. The characteristic equation for the performance of an ideal device has the form BC2\u03b12=constantwhere B is the luminance of the scene, and C and \u03b1 are respectively the threshold contrast and angular size of a test object in the scene. This ideal type of performance is shown to be satisfied by a simple experimental television pickup arrangement. By means of the arrangement, two parameters, storage time of the eye and threshold signal-to-noise ratio are determined to be 0.2 seconds and five respectively. Published data on the performance of the eye are compared with ideal performance. In the ranges of B(10\u22126 to 102 footlamberts), C(2 to 100 percent) and \u03b1(2\u2032 to 100\u2032), the performance of the eye may be matched by an ideal device having a quantum efficiency of 5 percent at low lights and 0.5 percent at high lights. This is of considerable technical importance in simplifying the analysis of problems involving comparisons of the performance of the eye and man-made devices. To the extent that independent measurements of the quantum efficiency of the eye confirm the values (0.5 percent to 5.0 percent), the performance of the eye is limited by fluctuations in the primary photo process. To the same extent, other mechanisms for describing the eye that do not take these fluctuations into account are ruled out. It is argued that the phenomenon of dark adaptation can be ascribed only in small part to the primary photo-process and must be mainly controlled by a variable gain mechanism located between the primary photo-process and the nerve fibers carrying pulses to the brain."

In conformity with this, the relation of critical fusion frequency to intensity is a single function for centrally fixated areas below 2\u00b0, and a double function for similarly fixated, larger areas. The two sections of such data are easily identified with rod activity at low intensities and with cone activity at high intensities. 2. The curves describing the rod data are the same for all areas, differing only in the values of the associated dimensional constants which control the location of the curves on the coordinate axes. Similarly, the curves for the cone data are the same for all areas; the tendency for an increase in maximal frequency with area is the expression merely of the value of a constant which determines the position of the data on the frequency axis. Area, therefore, does not influence the fundamental nature of the flicker relation through each receptor system, but merely alters the extraneous constants of the relation. 3. The curves which describe the measurements are represented by two equations, one for rods and one for cones; both equations are derived from the stationary state descriptive of the initial event in the photoreceptor process."

Their variation with test method, and conflict with other data, suggest only an indirect relation to the absorption curves of receptors. Blue and yellow in the retinal periphery, in the central fovea, and in transient effects, act as if coupled physiologically. Yellow proves independent of red and green, and blue has many characteristics of rod function.To adjust the Helmholtz view of deficiency to modern observations, new mechanisms for white and hues are needed in the cortex. The Muller theory adds black and locates in the retina this inner zone; but likewise fails to assign it a physiological mechanism. Recent experiments confirm the retinal location of both yellow and black mechanisms; hence an opponents theory seems unavoidable. The psychophysical evidence calls for unsymmetric synaptic connections before the \u201cprimary processes,\u201d and also after them to create hues and luminosity separately."

The procedure used allowed an image of a 2-mm circular aperture to be focused in the plane of the pupil. Tests showed that astigmatism did not influence the data obtained for the peripheral stimuli.The curve of log critical frequency against log brightness for foveal observation does not show an inflection in its rise to a maximum. The curves for peripheral observations rise to a plateau at low brightnesses, dip at medium to low brightnesses, and rise again to a maximum, thus giving the conventional \u201ccone\u201d curve at high brightnesses. The maximum is lower and lower for locations increasingly distant from the fovea.Data on color thresholds indicate that rods probably make their contributions to the initial part of the \u201ccone\u201d branch.Comparison of data for green and white central fields shows that these colors give data that superimpose for equivalent foveal stimulation. For peripheral stimulation a slight shift of the curve for green (with respect to the curve for white) seems to occur in the direction of lower brightnesses. The latter effect is interpreted to be a Purkinje shift.The Purkinje shift is greatly emphasized when orange and green peripheral fields are used. Green light, matched foveally with orange light, is more effective than orange in providing peripheral flicker.The data are interpreted to mean that rods function and interact with cones at levels of brightness that are often considered to be photopic."

The first experiment studies the intensity-duration function for peripheral threshold stimulation of the human eye, over a range of durations from 0.02 second to 0.24 second. The form of the flashes presented involves a rapid onset and cessation (i.e., a nearly rectangular wave). The second experiment determines the total energy required for threshold excitation for flashes of various wave forms (i.e., with different onset and cessation times), the maximum duration always being below the critical duration obtained in the first experiment.The results of the first experiment agree with previous studies in showing that below a certain critical duration the product of light intensity and duration is constant. Above this critical duration the intensity remains constant. The transition from the relationship It=C to I=Const. is abrupt and occurs at 0.10 second.The results of the second experiment indicate that changes in the wave form, within the limits of variation introduced, do not affect the total amount of energy required for threshold below the limit of a critical duration. These findings give additional generality to the Bunsen-Roscoe law and to the view that the essential element in producing a constant effect in response to flashes of light is the total energy of the stimulus."
