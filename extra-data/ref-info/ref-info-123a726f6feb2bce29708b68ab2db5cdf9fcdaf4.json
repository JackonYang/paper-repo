While such research has been very successful, it is by no means obvious why similarity-based generalizations should be useful, since they may simply reflect coincidences. Proponents of explanation-based learning, a new, knowledge-intensive method of examining single examples to derive generalizations based on underlying causal models, could contend that their methods are more fundamentally grounded, and that there is no need to look for similarities across examples. In this paper, we present the issues, and then show why similarity-based methods are important. We present four reasons why robust machine learning must involve the integration of similarity-based and explanation-based methods. We argue that: 1) it may not always be practical or even possible to determine a causal explanation; 2) similarity usually implies causality; 3) similarity-based generalizations can be refined over time; 4) similarity-based and explanation-based methods complement each other in important ways."

Theorem-proving on the computer, using procedures based on the fund~mental theorem of Herbrand concerning the first-order predicate etdeulus, is examined with ~ view towards improving the efticieney and widening the range of practical applicability of these procedures. A elose analysis of the process of substitution (of terms for variables), and the process of t ruth-funct ional analysis of the results of such substitutions, reveals that both processes can be combined into a single new process (called resolution), i terating which is vastty more ef[ieient than the older cyclic procedures consisting of substitution stages alternating with truth-functional analysis stages. The theory of the resolution process is presented in the form of a system of first<~rder logic with .just one inference principle (the resolution principle). The completeness of the system is proved; the simplest proof-procedure based oil the system is then the direct implementation of the proof of completeness. Howew~r, this procedure is quite inefficient, ~nd the paper concludes with a discussion of several principles (called search principles) which are applicable to the design of efficient proof-procedures employing resolution as the basle logical process."

A model of such a system is given, based on aspects of neurobiology but readily adapted to integrated circuits. The collective properties of this model produce a content-addressable memory which correctly yields an entire memory from any subpart of sufficient size. The algorithm for the time evolution of the state of the system is based on asynchronous parallel processing. Additional emergent collective properties include some capacity for generalization, familiarity recognition, categorization, error correction, and time sequence retention. The collective properties are only weakly sensitive to details of the modeling or the failure of individual devices."

                "text": "Introduction Few of those who have seen a modern high-speed digital computer digest and transform a mass of data in less time than it takes to follow the process in the mind can suppress a certain amount of speculation concerning the future of such machines. Under the assumption that the computer is operating at the mere threshhold of its capacity in performing the tasks we have thus far delegated to it, a long-range program directed at the problem of \"intelligent\" behavior and learning in machines has been established at the IBM Research Center in New York (Gelernter and Rochester, 1958). In particular the technique of heuristic programming is under detailed investigation as a means to the end of applying large-scale digital computers to the solution of a difficult class of problems currently considered to be beyond their capabilities; namely those problems that seem to require the agent of human intelligence and ingenuity for their solution. It is difficult to characterize such problems further, except, perhaps, to remark rather vaguely that they generally involve complex decision processes in a potentially infinite and uncontrollable environment. If, however, we should restrict the universe of problems to those that amount to the discovery of a proof for a theorem in some well-defined formal system, then the distinguishing characteristics of those problems of special interest to us are brought clearly into focus. We should like our machine to be able to prove many of the theorems presented to it in a formal system that is manifestly undecidable. Further, as the machine 134 gains \"experience\" in proving theorems, we should expect it to be able to solve problems that were earlier beyond its capabilities. The requirement that a machine should deal with undecidable systems places a fundamental restriction on its modus operandi. Finding a suitable algorithm, the obvious technique for the solution of problems on a digital computer, is no longer acceptable for the simple reason that no such algorithm exists. An exhaustive search for the initial axioms and theorems of the proof, combined with exhaustive development of the proof sequence by systematically applying the rules of transformation until the required proof has been produced, has been shown to be much too time-consuming for so simple a logic as propositional calculus (Newell, Shaw and Simon, 1957 a). It is a fortiori out of the question for any of the more interesting logics. A remaining alternative is \u2026"
