The features are incorporated into a probabilistic framework, which combines the outputs of several components. Components differ in the information they encode. Some focus on the image-label mapping, while others focus solely on patterns within the label field. Components also differ in their scale, as some focus on fine-resolution patterns while others on coarser, more global structure. A supervised version of the contrastive divergence algorithm is applied to learn these features from labeled image data. We demonstrate performance on two real-world image databases and compare it to a classifier and a Markov random field."

When multiple detectors of objects and parts are trained in parallel using AdaBoost [1], object detectors might use the remaining intermediate detectors to enrich the weak learner set. This method generalizes the efficient features suggested by Viola and Jones [2] thus enabling information inference between parts and objects in a compositional hierarchy. In our experiments eye-, nose-, mouth- and face detectors are trained using the Mutual Boosting framework. Results show that the method outperforms applications overlooking contextual information. We suggest that achieving contextual integration is a step toward human-like detection capabilities."

The discriminative random fields offer several advantages over the conventional Markov random field (MRF) framework. First, the DRFs allow to relax the strong assumption of conditional independence of the observed data generally used in the MRF framework for tractability. This assumption is too restrictive for a large number of applications in vision. Second, the DRFs derive their classification power by exploiting the probabilistic discriminative models instead of the generative models used in the MRF framework. Finally, all the parameters in the DRF model are estimated simultaneously from the training data unlike the MRF framework where likelihood parameters are usually learned separately from the field parameters. We illustrate the advantages of the DRFs over the MRF framework in an application of man-made structure detection in natural images taken from the Corel database."

There are three key contributions. The first is the introduction of a new image representation called the \u201cIntegral Image\u201d which allows the features used by our detector to be computed very quickly. The second is a learning algorithm, based on AdaBoost, which selects a small number of critical visual features and yields extremely efficient classifiers [4]. The third contribution is a method for combining classifiers in a \u201ccascade\u201d which allows background regions of the image to be quickly discarded while spending more computation on promising object-like regions. A set of experiments in the domain of face detection are presented. The system yields face detection performance comparable to the best previous systems [16, 11, 14, 10, 1]. Implemented on a conventional desktop, face detection proceeds at 15 frames per second.

We show that the method leads to markedly improved segmentation results and can deal with significant variation in shape and varying backgrounds. We discuss the relative merits of class-specific and general image-based segmentation methods and suggest how they can be usefully combined."

Conditional random fields also avoid a fundamental limitation of maximum entropy Markov models (MEMMs) and other discriminative Markov models based on directed graphical models, which can be biased towards states with few successor states. We present iterative parameter estimation algorithms for conditional random fields and compare the performance of the resulting models to HMMs and MEMMs on synthetic and natural-language data."

However, existing learning algorithms are slow, particularly in problems with large numbers of potential input features. This paper describes a new method for training CRFs by applying Friedman's (1999) gradient tree boosting method. In tree boosting, the CRF potential functions are represented as weighted sums of regression trees. Regression trees are learned by stage-wise optimizations similar to Adaboost, but with the objective of maximizing the conditional likelihood P(Y|X) of the CRF model. By growing regression trees, interactions among features are introduced only as needed, so although the parameter space is potentially immense, the search algorithm does not explicitly consider the large space. As a result, gradient tree boosting scales linearly in the order of the Markov model and in the order of the feature interactions, rather than exponentially like previous algorithms based on iterative scaling and gradient descent."

Kernel-based approaches, such as support vector machines (SVMs), which maximize the margin of confidence of the classifier, are the method of choice for many such tasks. Their popularity stems both from the ability to use high-dimensional feature spaces, and from their strong theoretical guarantees. However, many real-world tasks involve sequential, spatial, or structured data, where multiple labels must be assigned. Existing kernel-based methods ignore structure in the problem, assigning labels independently to each object, losing much useful information. Conversely, probabilistic graphical models, such as Markov networks, can represent correlations between labels, by exploiting problem structure, but cannot handle high-dimensional feature spaces, and lack strong theoretical generalization guarantees. In this paper, we present a new framework that combines the advantages of both approaches: Maximum margin Markov (M3) networks incorporate both kernels, which efficiently deal with high-dimensional features, and the ability to capture correlations in structured data. We present an efficient algorithm for learning M3 networks based on a compact quadratic program formulation. We provide a new theoretical bound for generalization in structured domains. Experiments on the task of handwritten character recognition and collective hypertext classification demonstrate very significant gains over previous approaches."

There are three key contributions. The first is the introduction of a new image representation called the \u201cIntegral Image\u201d which allows the features used by our detector to be computed very quickly. The second is a simple and efficient classifier which is built using the AdaBoost learning algorithm (Freund and Schapire, 1995) to select a small number of critical visual features from a very large set of potential features. The third contribution is a method for combining classifiers in a \u201ccascade\u201d which allows background regions of the image to be quickly discarded while spending more computation on promising face-like regions. A set of experiments in the domain of face detection is presented. The system yields face detection performance comparable to the best previous systems (Sung and Poggio, 1998; Rowley et al., 1998; Schneiderman and Kanade, 2000; Roth et al., 2000). Implemented on a conventional desktop, face detection proceeds at 15 frames per second."

This is surprising given how important materials are for humans, and how important they must become for intelligent robots. We may learn something by looking at other fields in which material appearance is recognized as important. Classical artists were highly skilled at generating convincing materials. The simulation of material appearance is a topic of great importance in 3D computer graphics. Some fields, such as mineralogy, use the concept of a 'habit' which is a combination of shape and texture, and which may be used for characterizing certain objects or materials. We have recently taken steps toward material recognition by machines, using techniques derived from the domain of texture analysis."

Boosting works by sequentially applying a classification algorithm to reweighted versions of the training data and then taking a weighted majority vote of the sequence of classifiers thus produced. For many classification algorithms, this simple strategy results in dramatic improvements in performance. We show that this seemingly mysterious phenomenon can be understood in terms of well-known statistical principles, namely additive modeling and maximum likelihood. For the two-class problem, boosting can be viewed as an approximation to additive modeling on the logistic scale using maximum Bernoulli likelihood as a criterion. We develop more direct approximations and show that they exhibit nearly identical results to boosting. Direct multiclass generalizations based on multinomial likelihood are derived that exhibit performance comparable to other recently proposed multiclass generalizations of boosting in most situations, and far superior in some. We suggest a minor modification to boosting that can reduce computation, often by factors of 10 to 50. Finally, we apply these insights to produce an alternative formulation of boosting decision trees. This approach, based on best-first truncated tree induction, often leads to better performance, and can provide interpretable descriptions of the aggregate decision rule. It is also much faster computationally, making it more suitable to large-scale data mining applications."
