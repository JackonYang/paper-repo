                "text": "In this paper, we propose a method of character extraction for scene images based on identification of a local target area and adaptive thresholding. The proposed extraction method is performed as follows: A scene image is resolved into a lightness image and a saturation image using a HSL transform. Vertical and horizontal edge images are made from these two images, and these edge images are binarized and thinned. The corresponding prominent features in the saturation and lightness images are detected using the Hough transform. A region between straight vertical lines is then extracted as a signboard region candidate in reference to the edge histogram. The extracted signboard region candidate is binarized using a threshold value determined by adaptive thresholding for each character region in the signboard region. The binary image containing extracted characters is then analyzed and the linear region containing the most character strings is identified as the character string region. This technique was applied to 100 scene images in order to verify the reliability of character extraction. Of the 450 characters in all the images, 438 were extracted correctly, representing a 97.3% successful recognition rate. Correct character strings were extracted in 98 of the 100 strings examined."

Digital cameras attached to cellular phones, PDAs, or as standalone still or video devices are highly mobile and easy to use; they can capture images of any kind of document including very thick books, historical pages too fragile to touch, and text in scenes; and they are much more versatile than desktop scanners. Should robust solutions to the analysis of documents captured with such devices become available, there is clearly a demand from many domains. Traditional scanner-based document analysis techniques provide us with a good reference and starting point, but they cannot be used directly on camera-captured images. Camera captured images can suffer from low resolution, blur, and perspective distortion, as well as complex layout and interaction of the content and background. In this paper we present a survey of application domains, technical challenges and solutions for recognizing documents captured by digital cameras. We begin by describing typical imaging devices and the imaging process. We discuss document analysis from a single camera-captured image as well as multiple frames and highlight some sample applications under development and feasible ideas for future development."

With the rapid growth in research over thelast few years on recognizing text in natural scenes, thereis an urgent need to establish some common benchmarkdatasets, and gain a clear understanding of the current stateof the art. We use the term robust reading to refer to text imagesthat are beyond the capabilities of current commercialOCR packages. We chose to break down the robust readingproblem into three sub-problems, and run competitionsfor each stage, and also a competition for the best overallsystem. The sub-problems we chose were text locating,character recognition and word recognition.By breaking down the problem in this way, we hope togain a better understanding of the state of the art in eachof the sub-problems. Furthermore, our methodology involvesstoring detailed results of applying each algorithm toeach image in the data sets, allowing researchers to study indepth the strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm. Thetext locating contest was the only one to have any entries.We report the results of this contest, and show cases wherethe leading algorithms succeed and fail."

But sometimes they pose problems. For example, a tourist might not be able to understand signs in a foreign country. This paper discusses problems of automatic sign recognition and translation. We present a system capable of capturing images, detecting and recognizing signs, and translating them into a target language. We describe methods for automatic sign extraction and translation. We use a user-centered approach in system development. The approach takes advantage of human intelligence if needed and leverage human capabilities. We are currently working on Chinese sign translation. We have developed a prototype system that can recognize Chinese sign input from a video camera that is a common gadget for a tourist, and translate the signs into English or voice stream. The sign translation, in conjunction with spoken language translation, can help international tourists to overcome language barriers. The technology can also help a visually handicapped person to increase environmental awareness."

Candidate regions of digits are extracted from an image through edge extraction, enhancement and labeling. Since the digits in the images often have skew and slant, the digits are recognized after the skew and slant correction. To correct the skew, Hough transform is used, and the slant is corrected using the method of circumscribing digits with tilted rectangles. In experiments, we tested a total of 1332 images of signboards with 11939 digits. We obtained a digit extraction rate of 99.2% and a correct digit recognition rate of 98.8%."

An optimal threshold is selected by the discriminant criterion, namely, so as to maximize the separability of the resultant classes in gray levels. The procedure is very simple, utilizing only the zerothand the first-order cumulative moments of the gray-level histogram. It is straightforward to extend the method to multithreshold problems. Several experimental results are also presented to support the validity of the method."
