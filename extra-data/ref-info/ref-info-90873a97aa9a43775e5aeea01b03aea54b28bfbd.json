However, it has been shown that these models are heavily driven by superficial correlations in the training data and lack compositionality -- the ability to answer questions about unseen compositions of seen concepts. This compositionality is desirable and central to intelligence. In this paper, we propose a new setting for Visual Question Answering where the test question-answer pairs are compositionally novel compared to training question-answer pairs. To facilitate developing models under this setting, we present a new compositional split of the VQA v1.0 dataset, which we call Compositional VQA (C-VQA). We analyze the distribution of questions and answers in the C-VQA splits. Finally, we evaluate several existing VQA models under this new setting and show that the performances of these models degrade by a significant amount compared to the original VQA setting."

In this context, however, inherent structure in our world and bias in our language tend to be a simpler signal for learning than visual modalities, resulting in VQA models that ignore visual information, leading to an inflated sense of their capability. We propose to counter these language priors for the task of VQA and make vision (the V in VQA) matter! Specifically, we balance the popular VQA dataset (Antol et al., in: ICCV, 2015) by collecting complementary images such that every question in our balanced dataset is associated with not just a single image, but rather a pair of similar images that result in two different answers to the question. Our dataset is by construction more balanced than the original VQA dataset and has approximately twice the number of image-question pairs. Our complete balanced dataset is publicly available at http://visualqa.org/ as part of the 2nd iteration of the VQA Dataset and Challenge (VQA v2.0). We further benchmark a number of state-of-art VQA models on our balanced dataset. All models perform significantly worse on our balanced dataset, suggesting that these models have indeed learned to exploit language priors. This finding provides the first concrete empirical evidence for what seems to be a qualitative sense among practitioners. We also present interesting insights from analysis of the participant entries in VQA Challenge 2017, organized by us on the proposed VQA v2.0 dataset. The results of the challenge were announced in the 2nd VQA Challenge Workshop at the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) 2017. Finally, our data collection protocol for identifying complementary images enables us to develop a novel interpretable model, which in addition to providing an answer to the given (image, question) pair, also provides a counter-example based explanation. Specifically, it identifies an image that is similar to the original image, but it believes has a different answer to the same question. This can help in building trust for machines among their users."

Most current methods demand training questions that illustrate every possible concept, and will therefore never achieve this capability, since the volume of required training data would be prohibitive. Answering general questions about images requires methods capable of Zero-Shot VQA, that is, methods able to answer questions beyond the scope of the training questions. We propose a new evaluation protocol for VQA methods which measures their ability to perform Zero-Shot VQA, and in doing so highlights significant practical deficiencies of current approaches, some of which are masked by the biases in current datasets. We propose and evaluate several strategies for achieving Zero-Shot VQA, including methods based on pretrained word embeddings, object classifiers with semantic embeddings, and test-time retrieval of example images. Our extensive experiments are intended to serve as baselines for Zero-Shot VQA, and they also achieve state-of-the-art performance in the standard VQA evaluation setting."

In this paper, we study a crucial component of this task: how can we design good datasets for the task? We focus on the design of multiple-choice based datasets where the learner has to select the right answer from a set of candidate ones including the target (i.e., the correct one) and the decoys (i.e., the incorrect ones). Through careful analysis of the results attained by state-of-the-art learning models and human annotators on existing datasets, we show that the design of the decoy answers has a significant impact on how and what the learning models learn from the datasets. In particular, the resulting learner can ignore the visual information, the question, or both while still doing well on the task. Inspired by this, we propose automatic procedures to remedy such design deficiencies. We apply the procedures to re-construct decoy answers for two popular Visual QA datasets as well as to create a new Visual QA dataset from the Visual Genome project, resulting in the largest dataset for this task. Extensive empirical studies show that the design deficiencies have been alleviated in the remedied datasets and the performance on them is likely a more faithful indicator of the difference among learning models. The datasets are released and publicly available via http://www.teds.usc.edu/website_vqa/."

While multiple datasets for VQA have been created since late 2014, they all have flaws in both their content and the way algorithms are evaluated on them. As a result, evaluation scores are inflated and predominantly determined by answering easier questions, making it difficult to compare different methods. In this paper, we analyze existing VQA algorithms using a new dataset called the Task Driven Image Understanding Challenge (TDIUC), which has over 1.6 million questions organized into 12 different categories. We also introduce questions that are meaningless for a given image to force a VQA system to reason about image content. We propose new evaluation schemes that compensate for over-represented question-types and make it easier to study the strengths and weaknesses of algorithms. We analyze the performance of both baseline and state-of-the-art VQA models, including multi-modal compact bilinear pooling (MCB), neural module networks, and recurrent answering units. Our experiments establish how attention helps certain categories more than others, determine which models work better than others, and explain how simple models (e.g. MLP) can surpass more complex models (MCB) by simply learning to answer large, easy question categories."

The performance of most models is clustered around 60-70%. In this paper we propose systematic methods to analyze the behavior of these models as a first step towards recognizing their strengths and weaknesses, and identifying the most fruitful directions for progress. We analyze two models, one each from two major classes of VQA models -- with-attention and without-attention and show the similarities and differences in the behavior of these models. We also analyze the winning entry of the VQA Challenge 2016. \nOur behavior analysis reveals that despite recent progress, today's VQA models are \"myopic\" (tend to fail on sufficiently novel instances), often \"jump to conclusions\" (converge on a predicted answer after 'listening' to just half the question), and are \"stubborn\" (do not change their answers across images)."

Such setting is inevitable in real world&#x2013;owing to the heavy tailed distribution of the visual categories, there would be some objects which would not be annotated in the train set. We show that the performance of two popular existing methods drop significantly (21&#x2013;28%) when evaluated on novel objects cf. known objects. We propose methods which use large existing external corpora of (i) unlabeled text, i.e. books, and (ii) images tagged with classes, to achieve novel object based visual question answering. We systematically study both, an oracle case where the novel objects are known textually, as well as a fully automatic case without any explicit knowledge of the novel objects, but with the minimal assumption that the novel objects are semantically related to the existing objects in training. The proposed methods for novel object based visual question answering are modular and can potentially be used with many visual question answering architectures. We show consistent improvements with the two popular architectures and give qualitative analysis of the cases where the model does well and of those where it fails to bring improvements."

Our goal is to train a Visual QA model on a source dataset but apply it to another target one. Analogous to domain adaptation for visual recognition, this setting is appealing when the target dataset does not have a sufficient amount of labeled data to learn an \"in-domain\" model. The key challenge is that the two datasets are constructed differently, resulting in the cross-dataset mismatch on images, questions, or answers. We overcome this difficulty by proposing a novel domain adaptation algorithm. Our method reduces the difference in statistical distributions by transforming the feature representation of the data in the target dataset. Moreover, it maximizes the likelihood of answering questions (in the target dataset) correctly using the Visual QA model trained on the source dataset. We empirically studied the effectiveness of the proposed approach on adapting among several popular Visual QA datasets. We show that the proposed method improves over baselines where there is no adaptation and several other adaptation methods. We both quantitatively and qualitatively analyze when the adaptation can be mostly effective."

However, AI models still fail to match humans in high-level vision tasks due to the lack of capacities for deeper reasoning. Recently the new task of visual question answering (QA) has been proposed to evaluate a model's capacity for deep image understanding. Previous works have established a loose, global association between QA sentences and images. However, many questions and answers, in practice, relate to local regions in the images. We establish a semantic link between textual descriptions and image regions by object-level grounding. It enables a new type of QA with visual answers, in addition to textual answers used in previous work. We study the visual QA tasks in a grounded setting with a large collection of 7W multiple-choice QA pairs. Furthermore, we evaluate human performance and several baseline models on the QA tasks. Finally, we propose a novel LSTM model with spatial attention to tackle the 7W QA tasks."

Given an image and a natural language question about the image, the task is to provide an accurate natural language answer. Mirroring real-world scenarios, such as helping the visually impaired, both the questions and answers are open-ended. Visual questions selectively target different areas of an image, including background details and underlying context. As a result, a system that succeeds at VQA typically needs a more detailed understanding of the image and complex reasoning than a system producing generic image captions. Moreover, VQA is amenable to automatic evaluation, since many open-ended answers contain only a few words or a closed set of answers that can be provided in a multiple-choice format. We provide a dataset containing $$\\sim $$\u223c0.25\u00a0M images, $$\\sim $$\u223c0.76\u00a0M questions, and $$\\sim $$\u223c10\u00a0M answers (www.visualqa.org), and discuss the information it provides. Numerous baselines and methods for VQA are provided and compared with human performance. Our VQA demo is available on CloudCV (http://cloudcv.org/vqa)."

But language also provides a strong prior that can result in good superficial performance, without the underlying models truly understanding the visual content. This can hinder progress in pushing state of art in the computer vision aspects of multi-modal AI. In this paper, we address binary Visual Question Answering (VQA) on abstract scenes. We formulate this problem as visual verification of concepts inquired in the questions. Specifically, we convert the question to a tuple that concisely summarizes the visual concept to be detected in the image. If the concept can be found in the image, the answer to the question is \"yes\", and otherwise \"no\". Abstract scenes play two roles (1) They allow us to focus on the highlevel semantics of the VQA task as opposed to the low-level recognition problems, and perhaps more importantly, (2) They provide us the modality to balance the dataset such that language priors are controlled, and the role of vision is essential. In particular, we collect fine-grained pairs of scenes for every question, such that the answer to the question is \"yes\" for one scene, and \"no\" for the other for the exact same question. Indeed, language priors alone do not perform better than chance on our balanced dataset. Moreover, our proposed approach matches the performance of a state-of-the-art VQA approach on the unbalanced dataset, and outperforms it on the balanced dataset."

This allows more complex questions to be answered using the predominant neural network-based approach than has previously been possible. It particularly allows questions to be asked about the contents of an image, even when the image itself does not contain the whole answer. The method constructs a textual representation of the semantic content of an image, and merges it with textual information sourced from a knowledge base, to develop a deeper understanding of the scene viewed. Priming a recurrent neural network with this combined information, and the submitted question, leads to a very flexible visual question answering approach. We are specifically able to answer questions posed in natural language, that refer to information not contained in the image. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on two publicly available datasets, Toronto COCO-QA [23] and VQA [1] and show that it produces the best reported results in both cases."

                "text": "Visual Question Answering (VQA) emerges as one of the most fascinating topics in computer vision recently. Many state of the art methods naively use holistic visual features with language features into a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) module, neglecting the sophisticated interaction between them. This coarse modeling also blocks the possibilities of exploring finer-grained local features that contribute to the question answering dynamically over time. \nThis paper addresses this fundamental problem by directly modeling the temporal dynamics between language and all possible local image patches. When traversing the question words sequentially, our end-to-end approach explicitly fuses the features associated to the words and the ones available at multiple local patches in an attention mechanism, and further combines the fused information to generate dynamic messages, which we call episode. We then feed the episodes to a standard question answering module together with the contextual visual information and linguistic information. Motivated by recent practices in deep learning, we use auxiliary loss functions during training to improve the performance. Our experiments on two latest public datasets suggest that our method has a superior performance. Notably, on the DARQUAR dataset we advanced the state of the art by 6$\\%$, and we also evaluated our approach on the most recent MSCOCO-VQA dataset."

                "text": "Visual Question and Answering (VQA) problems are attracting increasing interest from multiple research disciplines. Solving VQA problems requires techniques from both computer vision for understanding the visual contents of a presented image or video, as well as the ones from natural language processing for understanding semantics of the question and generating the answers. Regarding visual content modeling, most of existing VQA methods adopt the strategy of extracting global features from the image or video, which inevitably fails in capturing fine-grained information such as spatial configuration of multiple objects. Extracting features from auto-generated regions -- as some region-based image recognition methods do -- cannot essentially address this problem and may introduce some overwhelming irrelevant features with the question. In this work, we propose a novel Focused Dynamic Attention (FDA) model to provide better aligned image content representation with proposed questions. Being aware of the key words in the question, FDA employs off-the-shelf object detector to identify important regions and fuse the information from the regions and global features via an LSTM unit. Such question-driven representations are then combined with question representation and fed into a reasoning unit for generating the answers. Extensive evaluation on a large-scale benchmark dataset, VQA, clearly demonstrate the superior performance of FDA over well-established baselines."

Recent approaches have applied deep image captioning methods based on convolutional-recurrent networks to this problem, but have failed to model spatial inference. To remedy this, we propose a model we call the Spatial Memory Network and apply it to the VQA task. Memory networks are recurrent neural networks with an explicit attention mechanism that selects certain parts of the information stored in memory. Our Spatial Memory Network stores neuron activations from different spatial regions of the image in its memory, and uses the question to choose relevant regions for computing the answer, a process of which constitutes a single \"hop\" in the network. We propose a novel spatial attention architecture that aligns words with image patches in the first hop, and obtain improved results by adding a second attention hop which considers the whole question to choose visual evidence based on the results of the first hop. To better understand the inference process learned by the network, we design synthetic questions that specifically require spatial inference and visualize the attention weights. We evaluate our model on two published visual question answering datasets, DAQUAR [1] and VQA [2], and obtain improved results compared to a strong deep baseline model (iBOWIMG) which concatenates image and question features to predict the answer [3]."

However, tasks such as visual question answering require combining these vector representations with each other. Approaches to multimodal pooling include element-wise product or sum, as well as concatenation of the visual and textual representations. We hypothesize that these methods are not as expressive as an outer product of the visual and textual vectors. As the outer product is typically infeasible due to its high dimensionality, we instead propose utilizing Multimodal Compact Bilinear pooling (MCB) to efficiently and expressively combine multimodal features. We extensively evaluate MCB on the visual question answering and grounding tasks. We consistently show the benefit of MCB over ablations without MCB. For visual question answering, we present an architecture which uses MCB twice, once for predicting attention over spatial features and again to combine the attended representation with the question representation. This model outperforms the state-of-the-art on the Visual7W dataset and the VQA challenge."

We present a novel co-attention model for VQA that jointly reasons about image and question attention. In addition, our model reasons about the question (and consequently the image via the co-attention mechanism) in a hierarchical fashion via a novel 1-dimensional convolution neural networks (CNN). Our model improves the state-of-the-art on the VQA dataset from 60.3% to 60.5%, and from 61.6% to 63.3% on the COCO-QA dataset.

Our model contains four components: a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to extract the question representation, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to extract the visual representation, an LSTM for storing the linguistic context in an answer, and a fusing component to combine the information from the first three components and generate the answer. We construct a Freestyle Multilingual Image Question Answering (FM-IQA) dataset to train and evaluate our mQA model. It contains over 150,000 images and 310,000 freestyle Chinese question-answer pairs and their English translations. The quality of the generated answers of our mQA model on this dataset is evaluated by human judges through a Turing Test. Specifically, we mix the answers provided by humans and our model. The human judges need to distinguish our model from the human. They will also provide a score (i.e. 0, 1, 2, the larger the better) indicating the quality of the answer. We propose strategies to monitor the quality of this evaluation process. The experiments show that in 64.7% of cases, the human judges cannot distinguish our model from humans. The average score is 1.454 (1.918 for human). The details of this work, including the FM-IQA dataset, can be found on the project page: this http URL"

In our work, we propose to use neural networks and visual semantic embeddings, without intermediate stages such as object detection and image segmentation, to predict answers to simple questions about images. Our model performs 1.8 times better than the only published results on an existing image QA dataset. We also present a question generation algorithm that converts image descriptions, which are widely available, into QA form. We used this algorithm to produce an order-of-magnitude larger dataset, with more evenly distributed answers. A suite of baseline results on this new dataset are also presented."

Given an image and an image related natural language question, VQA generates the natural language answer for the question. Generating the correct answers requires the model's attention to focus on the regions corresponding to the question, because different questions inquire about the attributes of different image regions. We introduce an attention based configurable convolutional neural network (ABC-CNN) to learn such question-guided attention. ABC-CNN determines an attention map for an image-question pair by convolving the image feature map with configurable convolutional kernels derived from the question's semantics. We evaluate the ABC-CNN architecture on three benchmark VQA datasets: Toronto COCO-QA, DAQUAR, and VQA dataset. ABC-CNN model achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods on these datasets. The question-guided attention generated by ABC-CNN is also shown to reflect the regions that are highly relevant to the questions."

We describe a procedure for constructing and learning *neural module networks*, which compose collections of jointly-trained neural \"modules\" into deep networks for question answering. Our approach decomposes questions into their linguistic substructures, and uses these structures to dynamically instantiate modular networks (with reusable components for recognizing dogs, classifying colors, etc.). The resulting compound networks are jointly trained. We evaluate our approach on two challenging datasets for visual question answering, achieving state-of-the-art results on both the VQA natural image dataset and a new dataset of complex questions about abstract shapes."

Domain-specific differences exist between the two types of images with respect to \u201cobjectness,\u201d \u201ctexture,\u201d and \u201ccolor.\u201d Therefore, achieving similar performance by applying methods developed for real images to abstract images, and vice versa, is difficult. This is a critical problem in VQA, because image features are crucial clues for correctly answering the questions about the images. However, an effective, domain-invariant method can provide insight into the high-level reasoning required for VQA. We thus propose a method called DualNet that demonstrates performance that is invariant to the differences in real and abstract scene domains. Experimental results show that DualNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially for the abstract images category."

SANs use semantic representation of a question as query to search for the regions in an image that are related to the answer. We argue that image question answering (QA) often requires multiple steps of reasoning. Thus, we develop a multiple-layer SAN in which we query an image multiple times to infer the answer progressively. Experiments conducted on four image QA data sets demonstrate that the proposed SANs significantly outperform previous state-of-the-art approaches. The visualization of the attention layers illustrates the progress that the SAN locates the relevant visual clues that lead to the answer of the question layer-by-layer."

The network is optimized by minimizing loss aggregated from all the units, which share model parameters while receiving different information to compute attention probability. For training, our model attends to a region within image feature map, updates its memory based on the question and attended image feature, and answers the question based on its memory state. This procedure is performed to compute loss in each step. The motivation of this approach is our observation that multi-step inferences are often required to answer questions while each problem may have a unique desirable number of steps, which is difficult to identify in practice. Hence, we always make the first unit in the network solve problems, but allow it to learn the knowledge from the rest of units by backpropagation unless it degrades the model. To implement this idea, we early-stop training each unit as soon as it starts to overfit. Note that, since more complex models tend to overfit on easier questions quickly, the last answering unit in the unfolded recurrent neural network is typically killed first while the first one remains last. We make a single-step prediction for a new question using the shared model. This strategy works better than the other options within our framework since the selected model is trained effectively from all units without overfitting. The proposed algorithm outperforms other multi-step attention based approaches using a single step prediction in VQA dataset."

One such architecture, the dynamic memory network (DMN), obtained high accuracy on a variety of language tasks. However, it was not shown whether the architecture achieves strong results for question answering when supporting facts are not marked during training or whether it could be applied to other modalities such as images. Based on an analysis of the DMN, we propose several improvements to its memory and input modules. Together with these changes we introduce a novel input module for images in order to be able to answer visual questions. Our new DMN+ model improves the state of the art on both the Visual Question Answering dataset and the \\babi-10k text question-answering dataset without supporting fact supervision."

The method not only answers natural language questions using concepts not contained in the image, but can provide an explanation of the reasoning by which it developed its answer. The method is capable of answering far more complex questions than the predominant long short-term memory-based approach, and outperforms it significantly in the testing. We also provide a dataset and a protocol by which to evaluate such methods, thus addressing one of the key issues in general visual ques- tion answering."

Cognition is core to tasks that involve not just recognizing, but reasoning about our visual world. However, models used to tackle the rich content in images for cognitive tasks are still being trained using the same datasets designed for perceptual tasks. To achieve success at cognitive tasks, models need to understand the interactions and relationships between objects in an image. When asked \u201cWhat vehicle is the person riding?\u201d, computers will need to identify the objects in an image as well as the relationships riding(man, carriage) and pulling(horse, carriage) to answer correctly that \u201cthe person is riding a horse-drawn carriage.\u201d In this paper, we present the Visual Genome dataset to enable the modeling of such relationships. We collect dense annotations of objects, attributes, and relationships within each image to learn these models. Specifically, our dataset contains over 108K images where each image has an average of $$35$$35 objects, $$26$$26 attributes, and $$21$$21 pairwise relationships between objects. We canonicalize the objects, attributes, relationships, and noun phrases in region descriptions and questions answer pairs to WordNet synsets. Together, these annotations represent the densest and largest dataset of image descriptions, objects, attributes, relationships, and question answer pairs."

The system is directly trained from question-answer pairs. We establish a first benchmark for this task that can be seen as a modern attempt at a visual turing test."

Most current evaluations measure detection accuracy, emphasizing the classification of regions according to objects from a predefined library. But detection is not the same as understanding. We present here a different evaluation system, in which a query engine prepares a written test (\u201cvisual Turing test\u201d) that uses binary questions to probe a system\u2019s ability to identify attributes and relationships in addition to recognizing objects. Today, computer vision systems are tested by their accuracy in detecting and localizing instances of objects. As an alternative, and motivated by the ability of humans to provide far richer descriptions and even tell a story about an image, we construct a \u201cvisual Turing test\u201d: an operator-assisted device that produces a stochastic sequence of binary questions from a given test image. The query engine proposes a question; the operator either provides the correct answer or rejects the question as ambiguous; the engine proposes the next question (\u201cjust-in-time truthing\u201d). The test is then administered to the computer-vision system, one question at a time. After the system\u2019s answer is recorded, the system is provided the correct answer and the next question. Parsing is trivial and deterministic; the system being tested requires no natural language processing. The query engine employs statistical constraints, learned from a training set, to produce questions with essentially unpredictable answers\u2014the answer to a question, given the history of questions and their correct answers, is nearly equally likely to be positive or negative. In this sense, the test is only about vision. The system is designed to produce streams of questions that follow natural story lines, from the instantiation of a unique object, through an exploration of its properties, and on to its relationships with other uniquely instantiated objects."

However, applications of these methods to multimodality remain limited. We present Multimodal Residual Networks (MRN) for the multimodal residual learning of visual question-answering, which extends the idea of the deep residual learning. Unlike the deep residual learning, MRN effectively learns the joint representation from vision and language information. The main idea is to use element-wise multiplication for the joint residual mappings exploiting the residual learning of the attentional models in recent studies. Various alternative models introduced by multimodality are explored based on our study. We achieve the state-of-the-art results on the Visual QA dataset for both Open-Ended and Multiple-Choice tasks. Moreover, we introduce a novel method to visualize the attention effect of the joint representations for each learning block using back-propagation algorithm, even though the visual features are collapsed without spatial information."

However, it has been observed that these models generalize poorly to scenes that were not observed during training, possibly depending too strongly on the statistics of the text in the training data. Here we propose to describe images using short structured representations, aiming to capture the crux of a description. These structured representations allow us to tease-out and evaluate separately two types of generalization: standard generalization to new images with similar scenes, and generalization to new combinations of known entities. We compare two learning approaches on the MS-COCO dataset: a state-of-the-art recurrent network based on an LSTM (Show, Attend and Tell), and a simple structured prediction model on top of a deep network. We find that the structured model generalizes to new compositions substantially better than the LSTM, ~7 times the accuracy of predicting structured representations. By providing a concrete method to quantify generalization for unseen combinations, we argue that structured representations and compositional splits are a useful benchmark for image captioning, and advocate compositional models that capture linguistic and visual structure."

Yet, many proposed applications of attributes rely on being able to learn the correct semantic concept corresponding to each attribute. We propose to resolve such confusions by jointly learning decorrelated, discriminative attribute models. Leveraging side information about semantic relatedness, we develop a multi-task learning approach that uses structured sparsity to encourage feature competition among unrelated attributes and feature sharing among related attributes. On three challenging datasets, we show that accounting for structure in the visual attribute space is key to learning attribute models that preserve semantics, yielding improved generalizability that helps in the recognition and discovery of unseen object categories."

This setup has hardly been studied in computer vision research, but it is the rule rather than the exception, because the world contains tens of thousands of different object classes and for only a very few of them image, collections have been formed and annotated with suitable class labels. In this paper, we tackle the problem by introducing attribute-based classification. It performs object detection based on a human-specified high-level description of the target objects instead of training images. The description consists of arbitrary semantic attributes, like shape, color or even geographic information. Because such properties transcend the specific learning task at hand, they can be pre-learned, e.g. from image datasets unrelated to the current task. Afterwards, new classes can be detected based on their attribute representation, without the need for a new training phase. In order to evaluate our method and to facilitate research in this area, we have assembled a new large-scale dataset, \u201cAnimals with Attributes\u201d, of over 30,000 animal images that match the 50 classes in Osherson's classic table of how strongly humans associate 85 semantic attributes with animal classes. Our experiments show that by using an attribute layer it is indeed possible to build a learning object detection system that does not require any training images of the target classes."

We analyze and make explicit the model properties needed for such regularities to emerge in word vectors. The result is a new global logbilinear regression model that combines the advantages of the two major model families in the literature: global matrix factorization and local context window methods. Our model efficiently leverages statistical information by training only on the nonzero elements in a word-word cooccurrence matrix, rather than on the entire sparse matrix or on individual context windows in a large corpus. The model produces a vector space with meaningful substructure, as evidenced by its performance of 75% on a recent word analogy task. It also outperforms related models on similarity tasks and named entity recognition."

These findings were the basis of our ImageNet Challenge 2014 submission, where our team secured the first and the second places in the localisation and classification tracks respectively. We also show that our representations generalise well to other datasets, where they achieve state-of-the-art results.
