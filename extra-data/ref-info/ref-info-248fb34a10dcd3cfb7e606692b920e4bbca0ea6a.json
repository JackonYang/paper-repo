The image-based model is built using example views of the face, bypassing the need for any three-dimensional computer graphics models. A learning network is trained to associate each of the example images with a set of pose and expression parameters. For a novel set of parameters, the network synthesizes a novel, intermediate view using a morphing approach. This image-based synthesis paradigm can adequately model both rigid and non-rigid facial movements. We also describe an analysis-by-synthesis algorithm, which is capable of extracting a set of high-level parameters from an image sequence involving facial movement using embedded image-based models. The parameters of the models are perturbed in a local and independent manner for each image until a correspondence-based error metric is minimized. A small sample of experimental results is presented."

It is more problematic to apply modelbased methods to images of objects whose appearance can vary, though a number of approaches based on the use of flexible templates have been proposed. The problem with existing methods is that they sacrifice model specificity in order to accommodate variability, thereby compromising robustness during image interpretation. We argue that a model should only be able to deform in ways characteristic of the class of objects it represents. We describe a method for building models by learning patterns of variability from a training set of correctly annotated images. These models can be used for image search in an iterative refinement algorithm analogous to that employed by Active Contour Models (Snakes). The key difference is that our Active Shape Models can only deform to fit the data in ways consistent with the training set. We show several practical examples where we have built such models and used them to locate partially occluded objects in noisy, cluttered images. Q 199s A&& prrss, IN."

We can represent the shape of this surface by planting landmark points across it. By examining the way such collections of points vary across different examples we can build a statistical model of the shape, which can be used to generate new examples, and to locate examples of the modelled structure in new images. We show examples of these composite appearance models and demonstrate their use in image interpretation."

The computational approach taken in this system is motivated by both physiology and information theory, as well as by the practical requirements of near-real-time performance and accuracy. Our approach treats the face recognition problem as an intrinsically two-dimensional (2-D) recognition problem rather than requiring recovery of three-dimensional geometry, taking advantage of the fact that faces are normally upright and thus may be described by a small set of 2-D characteristic views. The system functions by projecting face images onto a feature space that spans the significant variations among known face images. The significant features are known as \"eigenfaces,\" because they are the eigenvectors (principal components) of the set of faces; they do not necessarily correspond to features such as eyes, ears, and noses. The projection operation characterizes an individual face by a weighted sum of the eigenface features, and so to recognize a particular face it is necessary only to compare these weights to those of known individuals. Some particular advantages of our approach are that it provides for the ability to learn and later recognize new faces in an unsupervised manner, and that it is easy to implement using a neural network architecture."

                "text": "The analysis and automatic interpretation of images containing moving non-rigid objects, such as walking people, has been the subject of considerable research in the field of computer vision and pattern recognition. In order to build fast and reliable systems some kind of prior model is generally required. A model enables the system to cope with situations where there is considerable background clutter or where information is missing from the image data. This may be due to imaging errors (e.g. blurring due to motion) or due to part of an object becoming hidden from view. \n \nConventional approaches to the problem of tracking non-rigid objects require complex hand-crafted models which are not easily adapted to different problems. A more recent approach uses training information to build models for image analysis. This thesis extends this approach by building flexible 2D models, automatically, from sequences of training images. Efficient methods are described for using the resulting models for real time contour tracking using optimal linear filtering techniques. The method is further extended by incorporating a feedback scheme to generate a more compact linear model which is shown to be more robust and accurate for tracking. \n \nModels of the shape of an object do not utilise the temporal information contained within the training sequences. A novel method is described for automatically learning a spatiotemporal, physically-based model that allows the system to accurately predict the expected change in object shape over time. This approach is shown to increase the reliability of the system, requiring only a modest increase in computational processing. \n \nThe system can be automatically trained on video sequences to learn constraints on the apparent shape and motion of a particular non-rigid object in a particular environment. Results show the system is capable of tracking several walking pedestrians in real time without the use of expensive dedicated hardware. The output from this system has potential uses in the areas of surveillance, animation and gait analysis."

In this approach, the intensity surface of the image is modeled as a deformable 3D mesh in the (x,y,I(x,y)) space. Each surface point has 3 degrees of freedom, thus capturing fine surface changes. A set of representative deformations within a class of objects (e.g. faces) are statistically learned through a Principal Components Analysis, thus providing a priori knowledge about object-specific deformations. We demonstrate the power of the approach by examples such as image matching and interpolation of missing data. Moreover this approach dramatically reduces the computational cost of solving the governing equation for the physically based system by approximately three orders of magnitude."

The dynamic link architecture exploits correlations in the fine-scale temporal structure of cellular signals to group neurons dynamically into higher-order entities. These entities represent a rich structure and can code for high-level objects. To demonstrate the capabilities of the dynamic link architecture, a program was implemented that can recognize human faces and other objects from video images. Memorized objects are represented by sparse graphs, whose vertices are labeled by a multiresolution description in terms of a local power spectrum, and whose edges are labeled by geometrical distance vectors. Object recognition can be formulated as elastic graph matching, which is performed here by stochastic optimization of a matching cost function. The implementation on a transputer network achieved recognition of human faces and office objects from gray-level camera images. The performance of the program is evaluated by a statistical analysis of recognition results from a portrait gallery comprising images of 87 persons. >"

By estimating multiple locations simultaneously, eigen-points exploits the interdependence between these locations. This is done by associating neighboring, inter-dependent control-points with a model of the local appearance. The model of local appearance is used to find the feature in new unlabeled images. Control-point locations are then estimated from the appearance of this feature in the unlabeled image. The estimation is done using an affine manifold model of the coupling between the local appearance and the local shape. Eigen-points uses models aimed specifically at recovering shape from image appearance. The estimation equations are solved non-iteratively, in a way that accounts for noise in the training data and the unlabeled images and that accounts for uncertainty in the distribution and dependencies within these noise sources."
