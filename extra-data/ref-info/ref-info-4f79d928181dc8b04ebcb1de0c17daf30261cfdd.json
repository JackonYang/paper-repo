                "text": "Text information in natural scene images serves as important clues for many image-based applications such as scene understanding, content-based image retrieval, assistive navigation, and automatic geocoding. However, locating text from a complex background with multiple colors is a challenging task. In this paper, we explore a new framework to detect text strings with arbitrary orientations in complex natural scene images. Our proposed framework of text string detection consists of two steps: 1) image partition to find text character candidates based on local gradient features and color uniformity of character components and 2) character candidate grouping to detect text strings based on joint structural features of text characters in each text string such as character size differences, distances between neighboring characters, and character alignment. By assuming that a text string has at least three characters, we propose two algorithms of text string detection: 1) adjacent character grouping method and 2) text line grouping method. The adjacent character grouping method calculates the sibling groups of each character candidate as string segments and then merges the intersecting sibling groups into text string. The text line grouping method performs Hough transform to fit text line among the centroids of text candidates. Each fitted text line describes the orientation of a potential text string. The detected text string is presented by a rectangle region covering all characters whose centroids are cascaded in its text line. To improve efficiency and accuracy, our algorithms are carried out in multi-scales. The proposed methods outperform the state-of-the-art results on the public Robust Reading Dataset, which contains text only in horizontal orientation. Furthermore, the effectiveness of our methods to detect text strings with arbitrary orientations is evaluated on the Oriented Scene Text Dataset collected by ourselves containing text strings in nonhorizontal orientations."

Low image quality, complex background and variations of text make these problems challenging. Our approach includes the following stages: (1) Template images are generated automatically; (2) SIFT features are extracted and matched to template images; (3) Multiple single-character-areas are located using segmentation algorithm based upon multiple-size sliding subwindows; (4) An voting and geometric verification algorithm is used to identify final results. This framework thus is essentially simple by skipping many steps, such as normalization, binarization and OCR, which are required in previous methods. Moreover, this framework is robust as only SIFT feature is used. We evaluated our method using 200,000+ images in 3 scripts (Chinese, Japanese and Korean). We obtained average single-character success rate of 77.3% (highest 94.1%), average multiplecharacter success rate of 63.9% (highest 89.6%)."

We present an annotated database of images containing English and Kannada characters. The database comprises of images of street scenes taken in Bangalore, India using a standard camera. The problem is addressed in an object cateogorization framework based on a bag-of-visual-words representation. We assess the performance of various features based on nearest neighbour and SVM classification. It is demonstrated that the performance of the proposed method, using as few as 15 training images, can be far superior to that of commercial OCR systems. Furthermore, the method can benefit from synthetically generated training data obviating the need for expensive data collection and annotation."

The problem is significantly more challenging than reading text in scanned documents, and has only recently gained attention from the computer vision community. Sub-components of the problem, such as text detection and cropped image word recognition, have been studied in isolation [7, 4, 20]. However, what is unclear is how these recent approaches contribute to solving the end-to-end problem of word recognition. We fill this gap by constructing and evaluating two systems. The first, representing the de facto state-of-the-art, is a two stage pipeline consisting of text detection followed by a leading OCR engine. The second is a system rooted in generic object recognition, an extension of our previous work in [20]. We show that the latter approach achieves superior performance. While scene text recognition has generally been treated with highly domain-specific methods, our results demonstrate the suitability of applying generic computer vision methods.

Relative to document recognition, it is challenging because of font variability, minimal language context, and uncontrolled conditions. Much information available to solve this problem is frequently ignored or used sequentially. Similarity between character images is often overlooked as useful information. Because of language priors, a recognizer may assign different labels to identical characters. Directly comparing characters to each other, rather than only a model, helps ensure that similar instances receive the same label. Lexicons improve recognition accuracy but are used post hoc. We introduce a probabilistic model for STR that integrates similarity, language properties, and lexical decision. Inference is accelerated with sparse belief propagation, a bottom-up method for shortening messages by reducing the dependency between weakly supported hypotheses. By fusing information sources in one model, we eliminate unrecoverable errors that result from sequential processing, improving accuracy. In experimental results recognizing text from images of signs in outdoor scenes, incorporating similarity reduces character recognition error by 19 percent, the lexicon reduces word recognition error by 35 percent, and sparse belief propagation reduces the lexicon words considered by 99.9 percent with a 12X speedup and no loss in accuracy."

Recognizing such text is a challenging problem, even more so than the recognition of scanned documents. In this work, we focus on the problem of recognizing text extracted from street images. We present a framework that exploits both bottom-up and top-down cues. The bottom-up cues are derived from individual character detections from the image. We build a Conditional Random Field model on these detections to jointly model the strength of the detections and the interactions between them. We impose top-down cues obtained from a lexicon-based prior, i.e. language statistics, on the model. The optimal word represented by the text image is obtained by minimizing the energy function corresponding to the random field model. We show significant improvements in accuracies on two challenging public datasets, namely Street View Text (over 15%) and ICDAR 2003 (nearly 10%)."

Most methods integrate a priori appearance information and some sort of hard or soft constraint on the allowable strings. Weinman and Learned-Miller [14] showed that the similarity among characters, as a supplement to the appearance of the characters with respect to a model, could be used to improve scene text recognition. In this work, we make further improvements to scene text recognition by taking a novel approach to the incorporation of similarity. In particular, we train a similarity expert that learns to classify each pair of characters as equivalent or not. After removing logical inconsistencies in an equivalence graph, we formulate the search for the maximum likelihood interpretation of a sign as an integer program. We incorporate the equivalence information as constraints in the integer program and build an optimization criterion out of appearance features and character bigrams. Finally, we take the optimal solution from the integer program, and compare all \u201cnearby\u201d solutions using a probability model for strings derived from search engine queries. We demonstrate word error reductions of more than 30% relative to previous methods on the same data set."

The higher recognition rates for isolated characters vs. those obtained for words and connected character strings well illustrate this fact. A good part of recent progress in reading unconstrained printed and written text may be ascribed to more insightful handling of segmentation. This paper provides a review of these advances. The aim is to provide an appreciation for the range of techniques that have been developed, rather than to simply list sources. Segmentation methods are listed under four main headings. What may be termed the \"classical\" approach consists of methods that partition the input image into subimages, which are then classified. The operation of attempting to decompose the image into classifiable units is called \"dissection.\" The second class of methods avoids dissection, and segments the image either explicitly, by classification of prespecified windows, or implicitly by classification of subsets of spatial features collected from the image as a whole. The third strategy is a hybrid of the first two, employing dissection together with recombination rules to define potential segments, but using classification to select from the range of admissible segmentation possibilities offered by these subimages. Finally, holistic approaches that avoid segmentation by recognizing entire character strings as units are described."

Despite its popularity, these nonlinear SVMs have a complexity O(n2 ~ n3) in training and O(n) in testing, where n is the training size, implying that it is nontrivial to scaleup the algorithms to handle more than thousands of training images. In this paper we develop an extension of the SPM method, by generalizing vector quantization to sparse coding followed by multi-scale spatial max pooling, and propose a linear SPM kernel based on SIFT sparse codes. This new approach remarkably reduces the complexity of SVMs to O(n) in training and a constant in testing. In a number of image categorization experiments, we find that, in terms of classification accuracy, the suggested linear SPM based on sparse coding of SIFT descriptors always significantly outperforms the linear SPM kernel on histograms, and is even better than the nonlinear SPM kernels, leading to state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks by using a single type of descriptors."

Most existing methods have focused on detecting horizontal or near-horizontal texts. In this paper, we propose a system which detects texts of arbitrary orientations in natural images. Our algorithm is equipped with a two-level classification scheme and two sets of features specially designed for capturing both the intrinsic characteristics of texts. To better evaluate our algorithm and compare it with other competing algorithms, we generate a new dataset, which includes various texts in diverse real-world scenarios; we also propose a protocol for performance evaluation. Experiments on benchmark datasets and the proposed dataset demonstrate that our algorithm compares favorably with the state-of-the-art algorithms when handling horizontal texts and achieves significantly enhanced performance on texts of arbitrary orientations in complex natural scenes."

We study the influence of each stage of the computation on performance, concluding that fine-scale gradients, fine orientation binning, relatively coarse spatial binning, and high-quality local contrast normalization in overlapping descriptor blocks are all important for good results. The new approach gives near-perfect separation on the original MIT pedestrian database, so we introduce a more challenging dataset containing over 1800 annotated human images with a large range of pose variations and backgrounds."

At one end of the spectrum, Optical Character Recognition (OCR) applied to scanned pages of well formatted printed text is one of the most successful applications of computer vision to date. At the other extreme lie visual CAPTCHAs - text that is constructed explicitly to fool computer vision algorithms. Both tasks involve recognizing text, yet one is nearly solved while the other remains extremely challenging. In this work, we argue that the appearance of words in the wild spans this range of difficulties and propose a new word recognition approach based on state-of-the-art methods from generic object recognition, in which we consider object categories to be the words themselves. We compare performance of leading OCR engines - one open source and one proprietary - with our new approach on the ICDAR Robust Reading data set and a new word spotting data set we introduce in this paper: the Street View Text data set. We show improvements of up to 16% on the data sets, demonstrating the feasibility of a new approach to a seemingly old problem."

The system is able to read text from complex backgrounds and then communicate this information aurally. To localize text regions in images with complex backgrounds, we design a novel text localization algorithm by learning gradient features of stroke orientations and distributions of edge pixels in an Adaboost model. Text characters in the localized regions are recognized by off-the-shelf optical character recognition (OCR) software and transformed into speech outputs. The performance of the proposed system is evaluated on ICDAR 2003 Robust Reading Dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms previous algorithms on some measures.

With the rapid growth in research over thelast few years on recognizing text in natural scenes, thereis an urgent need to establish some common benchmarkdatasets, and gain a clear understanding of the current stateof the art. We use the term robust reading to refer to text imagesthat are beyond the capabilities of current commercialOCR packages. We chose to break down the robust readingproblem into three sub-problems, and run competitionsfor each stage, and also a competition for the best overallsystem. The sub-problems we chose were text locating,character recognition and word recognition.By breaking down the problem in this way, we hope togain a better understanding of the state of the art in eachof the sub-problems. Furthermore, our methodology involvesstoring detailed results of applying each algorithm toeach image in the data sets, allowing researchers to study indepth the strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm. Thetext locating contest was the only one to have any entries.We report the results of this contest, and show cases wherethe leading algorithms succeed and fail."

Extensive testing shows that the suggested scheme outperforms the latest published algorithms. Its simplicity allows the algorithm to detect texts in many fonts and languages."

However, its classification performance is inferior to the newly developed sparse or local coding schemes. It would be highly desirable if its classification performance could become comparable to the state-of-the-art, leading to a coding scheme which perfectly combines computational efficiency and classification performance. To achieve this, we revisit soft-assignment coding from two key aspects: classification performance and probabilistic interpretation. For the first aspect, we argue that the inferiority of soft-assignment coding is due to its neglect of the underlying manifold structure of local features. To remedy this, we propose a simple modification to localize the soft-assignment coding, which surprisingly achieves comparable or even better performance than existing sparse or local coding schemes while maintaining its computational advantage. For the second aspect, based on our probabilistic interpretation of the soft-assignment coding, we give a probabilistic explanation to the magic max-pooling operation, which has successfully been used by sparse or local coding schemes but still poorly understood. This probability explanation motivates us to develop a new mix-order max-pooling operation which further improves the classification performance of the proposed coding scheme. As experimentally demonstrated, the localized soft-assignment coding achieves the state-of-the-art classification performance with the highest computational efficiency among the existing coding schemes."

The typical approach to creating them is to first compute floating-point ones, using an algorithm such as SIFT, and then to binarize them. In this paper, we show that we can directly compute a binary descriptor, which we call BRIEF, on the basis of simple intensity difference tests. As a result, BRIEF is very fast both to build and to match. We compare it against SURF and SIFT on standard benchmarks and show that it yields comparable recognition accuracy, while running in an almost vanishing fraction of the time required by either."

This enables efficient learning methods for linear kernels to be applied to the non-linear intersection kernel, expanding the applicability of this model to much larger problems. In this paper we generalize this idea, and analyse a large family of additive kernels, called homogeneous, in a unified framework. The family includes the intersection, Hellinger's, and \u03c72 kernels commonly employed in computer vision. Using the framework we are able to: (i) provide explicit feature maps for all homogeneous additive kernels along with closed form expression for all common kernels; (ii) derive corresponding approximate finite-dimensional feature maps based on the Fourier sampling theorem; and (iii) quantify the extent of the approximation. We demonstrate that the approximations have indistinguishable performance from the full kernel on a number of standard datasets, yet greatly reduce the train/test times of SVM implementations. We show that the \u03c72 kernel, which has been found to yield the best performance in most applications, also has the most compact feature representation. Given these train/test advantages we are able to obtain a significant performance improvement over current state of the art results based on the intersection kernel."

We demonstrate through experiments how ORB is at two orders of magnitude faster than SIFT, while performing as well in many situations.

In this paper, we propose a computer vision-based indoor wayfinding system for assisting blind people to independently access unfamiliar buildings. In order to find different rooms (i.e. an office, a lab, or a bathroom) and other building amenities (i.e. an exit or an elevator), we incorporate door detection with text recognition. First we develop a robust and efficient algorithm to detect doors and elevators based on general geometric shape, by combining edges and corners. The algorithm is generic enough to handle large intra-class variations of the object model among different indoor environments, as well as small inter-class differences between different objects such as doors and elevators. Next, to distinguish an office door from a bathroom door, we extract and recognize the text information associated with the detected objects. We first extract text regions from indoor signs with multiple colors. Then text character localization and layout analysis of text strings are applied to filter out background interference. The extracted text is recognized by using off-the-shelf optical character recognition (OCR) software products. The object type, orientation, and location can be displayed as speech for blind travelers."

A traditional approach to this problem is to introduce a global optimization scheme to fill-in the missing information by enforcing spatial-consistency, which usually means introducing a geometric regularization term that promotes smoothness. The world, however, is not necessarily smooth and we argue that a better approach is to monocularly estimate the surface normals and to use them to supply the required constraints. We will show that, even though the estimates are very rough, we nevertheless obtain more accurate depth-maps than by enforcing smoothness. Furthermore, this can be done effectively by solving large but sparse linear systems."
