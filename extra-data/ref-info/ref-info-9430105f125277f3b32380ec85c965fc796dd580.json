These volumes by a pioneering neurocomputing group suggest that the answer lies in the massively parallel architecture of the human mind. They describe a new theory of cognition called connectionism that is challenging the idea of symbolic computation that has traditionally been at the center of debate in theoretical discussions about the mind. The authors' theory assumes the mind is composed of a great number of elementary units connected in a neural network. Mental processes are interactions between these units which excite and inhibit each other in parallel rather than sequential operations. In this context, knowledge can no longer be thought of as stored in localized structures; instead, it consists of the connections between pairs of units that are distributed throughout the network. Volume 1 lays the foundations of this exciting theory of parallel distributed processing, while Volume 2 applies it to a number of specific issues in cognitive science and neuroscience, with chapters describing models of aspects of perception, memory, language, and thought.

                "text": "computational devices are required to comprehend the behaviors of actual computers or the analogy will not go through; and as a consequence the computationalist hypothesis in so far forth will have no support. Likewise, the other analogies may be understood as specifying features models must satisfy. In all cases it is fairly easy to see that Turing machines are adequate to the analogies. They seem to be inadequate, however, for other reasons I will mention later in section 6. Given this background, the gist of Pylyshyn's argument is that machine operations count as computations, of which cognitive processes are a subclass, only if they are transformations over symbolic expressions that are semantically interpretable. Inasmuch as this condition (5) does not hold of FSA (in a special sense introduced by Pylyshyn and detailed below), they are not adequate for describing any kind of computational process. The question of semantical interpretability is closely related to one of automaton structure ((3) and (4) above). FSA are structurally wrong for modeling cognitive processes. Pylyshyn's point here is that input strings of basic symbols are bound-up with state-to-state transitions. Input symbols are not literally processed by FSA but merely serve to drive its operation from state to state. Moreover a model must, in effect, separate programs from data. What is required for semantical interpretations is that the processing of symbols be factorable out of the transition process-as is true in the case with Turing machines. FSA fail to satisfy processing and separability requirements. Third, even if we count FSA as computers, the class of FSA computable functions is a very small class of the functions programmable on a full digital computer (item (1) above). Theoretically, FSA can add, compute the successor function, and compute compositions of functions. Multiplication, and a fortiori mathematical algorithms that arise in science as well as string operations in data processing and artificial intelligence are beyond their range. They fail to meet a universality requirement. So although in a certain formal sense FSA do compute finitely specifiable functions (2), they fail to support analogies (1), (3), (4) and (5); therefore they are not suitable for cognitive science. In other words, they do not capture the relevant properties of computers. It is somewhat tempting to ignore all of this, even after having gone through the tedious exercise of displaying the analogical underpinnings. For as we shall see, Pylyshyn's argument depends on a gratuitous redefinition of \"finite state automaton\" and fails to do justice to the scope of the FSA concept. Moreover, the redefinition is not used consistently MACHINE MODELS FOR COGNITIVE SCIENCE 395 in Pylyshyn's argument itself. So in my opinion the issues raised result from misinterpretations of the model and unless they are brought forward and thoroughly reviewed the unwary reader might take them to be relevant to the very kind of automaton concept used by computationalists from Turing's classical paper (Turing 1950) to the present.5 I doubt this is what Pylyshyn intends. At any rate the issues are serious ones. FSA models should be put in the proper perspective. In the following I propose to clarify the complex issues raised by Pylyshyn's treatment of FSA, given the background just sketched, and to show where I think he goes wrong. I begin with (5) and then work through the conditions backwards to the universality requirement (1). 3. Interpretability. The standard definition of \"finite state automaton\" (Hopcroft and Ulman 1979, p. 18) is the following: (I) A finite state automaton is a system consisting of two disjoint finite, nonempty sets S and X; a distinguished element s, of S; a nonempty subset S' of S; a function M defined on the Cartesian product S X X with domain S. S is the set of states; X is the set of inputs or vocabulary; s, is the initial state; S' is the set of final or accepting states; and M is the transition function. An FSA is essentially a device for implementing a decision procedure on sets of sequences of elements, i.e. strings of X. Rather than load up the reader with more definitions, let us proceed by examples and introduce the necessary formalities as we go along. Pylyshyn's own example (1984, p. 68) of an FSA appears in Figure 1 in the form of a directed graph, where directed edges represent state transitions. In the example the FSA in initial state s, transits to state s, under input x, or to 52 under y; and then to S3 from S2 under x, and so forth. This graph is simply a way of displaying the transition function M considered as a finite machine table in the usual sense. We will indicate the set of 5Contrary to what seems to be the popular view, in his 1950 paper Turing does not explicitly appeal to Turing machines, but to \"discrete state machines\", which are finite state automata with output (sequential machines) in the present day technical sense (defined below). He makes no reference to unbounded two-way tape machines. He does allude to digital computers as \"universal\" machines; but they are universal only if one thinks of them as having been supplied with potentially infinite memories. The facts are, a stored program digital computer is a finite state automaton with output (See section 3). Moreover, although a standard minicomputer or mainframe usually has two-way tape (or virtually two-way tape on discs or drums) as auxiliary memory, the tape is bounded. And every two-way bounded tape machine is equivalent to a finite state automaton (Nelson 1978)."

                "text": "Abstract : Mind and brain provide two quite different perspectives for viewing cognition. Yet both perspectives are informed by the study of parallel distributed processing. This duality creates a certain ambiguity about the interpretation of a particular PDP model of a cognitive process: Is each processing unit to be interpreted as a neuron? Is the model supposed to relate to the neural implementation of the process in some less direct way? A closely related set of questions arises when it is observed that PDP models of cognitive processing divide broadly into two classes. In local models, the activity of a single unit represents the degree of participation in the processing of a known conceptual entity a word, a word sense, a phoneme, a motor program. In distributed models, the strength of patterns of activity over many units determine the degree of participation of these conceptual entities. In some models, these patterns are chosen in a deliberately arbitrary way, so that the activity of a single unit has no apparent \"meaning\" whatever -- no discernible relation to the conceptual entities involved in the cognitive process. On the surface, at least, these two types of models seem quite different. Are they as different as they seem? How are they related? This chapter begins with a brief consideration of the neural interpretation of PDP models of cognition. These considerations serve mostly to lay out a certain perspective on the PDP modeling world, to make some distinctions I have found to be valuable, to introduce some terminology and to lead into the main question of this chapter: How are distributed and local PDP models related? The chapter ends with a discussion of how, using the framework of PDP models, we might forge a mathematical relationship between the principles of mind and brain."

Chomsky, Rules and Representations, Columbia University Press, 1980) is concerned with the prospects for assimilating the study of human intelligence and its products to the natural sciences through the investigation of cognitive structures, understood as systems of rules and representations that can be regarded as \u201cmental organs.\u201d These mental structui\u2032es serve as the vehicles for the exercise of various capacities. They develop in the mind on the basis of an innate endowment that permits the growth of rich and highly articulated structures along an intrinsically determined course under the triggering and partially shaping effect of experience, which fixes parameters in an intricate system of predetermined form. It is argued that the mind is modular in character, with a diversity of cognitive structures, each with its specific properties arid principles. Knowledge of language, of the behavior of objects, and much else crucially involves these mental structures, and is thus not characterizable in terms of capacities, dispositions, or practical abilities, nor is it necessarily grounded in experience in the standard sense of this term. Various types of knowledge and modes of knowledge acquisition are discussed in these terms. Some of the properties of the language faculty are investigated. The basic cognitive relation is \u201cknowing a grammar\u201d; knowledge of language is derivative and, correspondingly, raises further problems. Language as commonly understood is not a unitary phenomenon but involves a number of interacting systems: the \u201ccomputational\u201d system of grammar, which provides the representations of sound and meaning that permit a rich range of expressive potential, is distinct from a conceptual system with its own properties; knowledge of language must be distinguished from knowledge of how to use a language; and the various systems that enter into the knowledge and use of language must be further analyzed into their specific subcomponents."

The direct reply to their critique comprises Section 2 of this paper. In short, I argue that Fodor and Pylyshyn are simply mistaken in their claim that connectionist mental states lack the necessary constituent structure, and that the basis of this mistake is a failure to appreciate the significance of distributed representations in connectionist models. Section 3 is a broader response to the bottom line of their critique, which is that connectionists should re-orient their work towards implementation of the classical symbolic cognitive architecture. I argue instead that connectionist research should develop new formalizations of the fundamental computational notions that have been given one particular formal shape in the traditional symbolic paradigm."

A key part of the proposed system, now under development, is its dependence on statistically emergent properties of stochastically interacting 'codelets' (small pieces of ready-to-run code created by the system, and selected at random to run with probability proportional to heuristically assigned 'urgencies'). Another key element is a network of linked concepts of varying levels of 'semanticity', in which activation spreads and indirectly controls the urgencies of new codelets. There is pressure in the system toward maximizing the degree of 'semanticity' or 'intensionality' of descriptions of structures, but many such pressures, often conflicting, must interact with one another, and compromises must be made."

Sections 1 to 5 attempt to explicate in detail the nature of the scientific enterprise that this intuition has inspired. That enterprise is distinctive in at least three ways: It relies on a style of explanation which is different from that of mathematical physics, in such a way that it is not basically concerned with quantitative equational laws; the states and processes with which it deals are \u201cinterpreted,\u201d in the sense that they are regarded as meaningful or representational; and it is not committed to reductionism, but is open to reduction in a form different from that encountered in other sciences. Spelling these points out makes it clear that the Cognitivist study of the mind can be rigorous and empirical, despite its unprecedented theoretical form. The philosophical explication has another advantage as well: It provides a much needed framework for articulating questions about whether the Cognitivist approach is right or wrong. The last three sections take that advantage of the account, and address several such questions, pro and con."

One of the deepest mysteries of the function of cortex is that neural processing times are only about one hundred times as fast as the fastest response times for complex behavior. At the very least, this would seem to indicate that the cortex does massive amounts of parallel computation. This paper explores the hypothesis that an important part of the cortex can be modeled as a connectionist computer that is especially suited for parallel problem solving. The connectionist computer uses a special representation, termed value unit encoding, that represents small subsets of parameters in a way that allows parallel access to many different parameter values. This computer can be thought of as computing hierarchies of sensorimotor invariants. The neural substrate can be interpreted as a commitment to data structures and algorithms that compute invariants fast enough to explain the behavioral response times. A detailed consideration of this model has several implications for the underlying anatomy and physiology."

In my estimate, the most fundamental contribution so far of artificial intelligence and computer science to the joint enterprise of cognitive science has been the notion of a physical symbol system, i.e., the concept of a broad class of systems capable of having and manipulating symbols, yet realizable in the physical universe. The notion of symbol so defined is internal to this concept, so it becomes a hypothesis that this notion of symbols includes the symbols that we humans use every day of our lives. In this paper we attempt systematically, but plainly, to lay out the nature of physical symbol systems. Such a review is in ways familiar, but not thereby useless. Restatement of fundamentals is an important exercise.The views and conclusions contained in this document are those of the author and should not be interpreted as representing the official policies, either expressed or implied, of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or the U.S. Government.Herb Simon would be a co-author of this paper, except that he is giving his own paper at this conference.

In this framework a set of necessary and sufficient features is taken to define a category. Such definitions are not functionally justified, are not used by people, and are not inducible by a learning system. Inductive theories depend on having access to all and only relevant features, which is not only impossible but begs a key question in learning. The crucial roles of other cognitive processes (such as explanation and credit assignment) are ignored or oversimplified. Learning necessarily involves pragmatic considerations that can only be handled by complex cognitive processes. We provide an alternative framework for learning according to which category definitions must be based on category function. The learning system invokes other cognitive processes to accomplish difficult tasks, makes inferences, analyses and decides among potential features, and specifies how and when categories are to be generated and modified. We also examine the methodological underpinnings of the two approaches and compare their motivations."

Evidence from our EEG research on the olfactory bulb suggests that the brain may indeed use computational mechanisms like those found in connectionist models. In the present paper we discuss our data and develop a model to describe the neural dynamics responsible for odor recognition and discrimination. The results indicate the existence of sensory- and motor-specific information in the spatial dimension of EEG activity and call for new physiological metaphors and techniques of analysis. Special emphasis is placed in our model on chaotic neural activity. We hypothesize that chaotic behavior serves as the essential ground state for the neural perceptual apparatus, and we propose a mechanism for acquiring new forms of patterned activity corresponding to new learned odors. Finally, some of the implications of our neural model for behavioral theories are briefly discussed. Our research, in concert with the connectionist work, encourages a reevaluation of explanatory models that are based only on the digital computer metaphor."

                "text": "Abstract This article can be viewed as an attempt to explore the consequences of two propositions. (1) Intentionality in human beings (and animals) is a product of causal features of the brain. I assume this is an empirical fact about the actual causal relations between mental processes and brains. It says simply that certain brain processes are sufficient for intentionality. (2) Instantiating a computer program is never by itself a sufficient condition of intentionality. The main argument of this paper is directed at establishing this claim. The form of the argument is to show how a human agent could instantiate the program and still not have the relevant intentionality. These two propositions have the following consequences: (3) The explanation of how the brain produces intentionality cannot be that it does it by instantiating a computer program. This is a strict logical consequence of 1 and 2. (4) Any mechanism capable of producing intentionality must have causal powers equal to those of the brain. This is meant to be a trivial consequence of 1. (5) Any attempt literally to create intentionality artificially (strong AI) could not succeed just by designing programs but would have to duplicate the causal powers of the human brain. This follows from 2 and 4. \u201cCould a machine think?\u201d On the argument advanced here only a machine could think, and only very special kinds of machines, namely brains and machines with internal causal powers equivalent to those of brains. And that is why strong AI has little to tell us about thinking, since it is not about machines but about programs, and no program by itself is sufficient for thinking."

                "text": "An information processing model of elementary human symbolic learning is given a precise statement as a computer program, called Elementary Perceiver and Memorizer (EPAM). The program simulates the behavior of subjects in experiments involving the rote learning of nonsense syllables. A discrimination net which grows is the basis of EPAM's associative memory. Fundamental information processes include processes for discrimination, discrimination learning, memorization, association using cues, and response retrieval with cues. Many well-known phenomena of rote learning are to be found in EPAM's experimental behavior, including some rather complex forgetting phenomena. EPAM is programmed in Information Processing Language V.\n H. A. Simon has described some current research in the simulation of human higher mental processes and has discussed some of the techniques and problems which have emerged from this research. The purpose of this paper is to place these general issues in the context of a particular problem by describing in detail a simulation of elementary human symbolic learning processes.\n The information processing model of mental functions employed is realized by a computer program called Elementary Perceiver and Memorizer (EPAM). The EPAM program is the precise statement of an information processing theory of verbal learning that provides an alternative to other verbal learning theories which have been proposed. It is the result of an attempt to state quite precisely a parsimonious and plausible mechanism sufficient to account for the rote learning of nonsense syllables. The critical evaluation of EPAM must ultimately depend not upon the interest which it may have as a learning machine, but upon its ability to explain and predict the phenomena of verbal learning.\n I should like to preface my discussion of the simulation of verbal learning with some brief remarks about the class of information processing models of which EPAM is a member.\n a. These are models of mental processes, not brain hardware. They are <u>psychological</u> models of mental function. No physiological or neurological assumptions are made, nor is any attempt made to explain information processes in terms of more elementary neural processes.\n b. These models conceive of the brain as an <u>information processor</u> with sense organs as input channels, effector organs as output devices, and with internal programs for testing, comparing, analyzing, rearranging, and storing information.\n c. The central processing mechanism is assumed to be serial; i.e., capable of doing only one (or a very few) things at a time.\n d. These models use as a basic unit the <u>information symbol</u>; i.e., a pattern of bits which is assumed to be the brain's internal representation of environmental data.\n e. These models are essentially <u>deterministic</u>, not probabilistic. Random variables play no fundamental role in them."

In a distributed neural network architecture each symbol is represented by activity in many units and each unit contributes to the representation of many symbols. Manipulating symbols using this type of distributed representation is not as easy as with a local representation whore each unit denotes one symbol, but there is evidence that the distributed approach is the one chosen by nature. We describe a working implementation of a production system interpreter in a neural network using distributed representations for both symbols and rules. The research provides a detailed account of two important symbolic reasoning operations, pattern matching and variable binding, as emergent properties of collections of neuron-like elements. The success of our production system implementation goes some way towards answering a common criticism of connectionist theories: that they aren't powerful enough to do symbolic reasoning."

Major advances in the behavioral, biological and computational sciences have greatly increased our understanding of the question and its potential answers. There is now good reason to reject both extreme views, but a compact encoding that derives from the punctate model appears to fit well with all the facts. Much of the work espousing holographic models is reinterpreted as studying system properties of neural networks and, as such, considered to be of great importance.

Part of the reason for this may be akin to the motivation of the besotted gentleman on his hands and knees beneath a streetlamp, who, when queried as to why he is looking on the sidewalk for the keys he lost in the alley, replies: \"Because the light is better here!\" I believe it is time to start mucking about in the alley; the keys are there. I also think we have a new flashlight: Parallel Distributed Processing 2. PDP mechanisms allow us to build machines whose fundamental operations include best fit search, constraint relaxation and automatic generalization. These are useful properties for processing language. I think the application of these models to NLP will change our view of what constitutes \"semantics'. I will argue that in order to deal with meaning seriously, we have to move beyond the folkpsychological level of symbols, and represent the microstructure of symbols. This is more than a granularity issue. It also has to do with the grounding of meaning in perception. It is on the level of microfeatures that I believe this grounding occurs, and PDP gives us a way to express this interface between language and perception. My discussion of these issues will take the following course 3. First I describe my previous work on word sense disambiguation in a PDP framework as a springboard for the rest of the discussion, and to give a sense of how lexical semantics might fit into an overall parsing model. Next I motivate a new model of word meanings through an example. I try to show that PDP has a natural way of expressing these meanings, and I give a sketch of how connectionist semantics could be learned. Finally, I briefly discuss metaphor."

There may have been times when developments in neuroscience, artificial intelligence, or cognitive psychology seduced researchers into believing that their discipline was on the verge of discovering the secret of intelligence. But a humbling history of hopes disappointed has produced the realization that understanding the mind will challenge the power of all these methodologies combined. The work reported in this chapter rests on the conviction that a methodology that has a crucial role to play in the development of cognitive science is mathematical analysis. The success of cognitive science, like that of many other sciences, will, I believe, depend upon the construction of a solid body of theoretical results: results that express in a mathematical language the conceptual insights of the field; results that squeeze all possible implications out of those insights by exploiting powerful mathematical techniques. This body of results, which I will call the theory of information processing, exists because information is a concept that lends itself to mathematical formalization. One part of the theory of information processing is already well-developed. The classical theory of computation provides powerful and elegant results about the notion of effective procedure, including languages for precisely expressing them and theoretical machines for realizing them."

This model exploits a new type of parallel distributed processing that employs stochastic processors and is based on a formal mapping between parallel computation and thermal physics.

We assume that (a) nervous system activity is usefully represented as the set of simultaneous individual neuron activities in a group of neurons; (b) different memory traces make use of the same synapses; and (c) synapses associate two patterns of neural activity by incrementing synaptic connectivity proportionally to the product of pre- and postsynaptic activity, forming a matrix of synaptic connectivities. We extend this model by (a) introducing positive feedback of a set of neurons onto itself and (b) allowing the individual neurons to saturate. A hybrid model, partly analog and partly binary, arises. The system has certain characteristics reminiscent of analysis by distinctive features. Next, we apply the model to \"categorical perception.\" Finally, we discuss probability learning. The model can predict overshooting, recency data, and probabilities occurring in systems with more than two events with reasonably good accuracy."

In the first part of this article, a theory of some of these subsystems is formulated. This theory is developed in light of an analysis of problems that must be solved by the visual system and the constraints on the solutions to these problems; computational, neurological, and behavioral constraints are considered. In the second part, inferences about perceptual subsystems are used to develop a theory of how mental images are generated. Support for this theory is adduced from studies of split-brain patients and a review of relevant neuropsychological findings. In the third part, a computational mechanism is developed to account for how visual function becomes lateralized in the brain; this mechanism is used to predict how the hypothesized processing subsystems become lateralized. In the fourth part, some critical tests of the theory of lateralization of perceptual processing subsystems are reported, and in the fifth part the theory is extended to account for the lateralization of image-transformation subsystems. In the sixth part, the theory is used to account for the almost ubiquitous variability (both between subjects and within subjects) evident in the neuropsychological literature on lateralization. Finally, in the concluding part of the article, the computational-neuropsychological approach is discussed and evaluated."

The approach is broadly mentalistic in that it involves the attribution of states, processes and events that are intentional, in the sense of \u2018representational\u2019. Many of these events and states are unconscious and inaccessible to mere reflection. Computer jargon is prominent in labeling them. But they bear comparison to thoughts, wants, memories, perceptions, plans, mental sets and the like \u2014 ordinarily so-called. Like ordinary propositional attitudes, some are described by means of that-clauses and may be evaluated as true or false. All are involved in a system by means of which a person knows, represents, and utilizes information about his or her surroundings."

Implications of these findings for theories of categorization are discussed, and it is concluded that graded structures do not represent invariant structural characteristics of Categories. Instead it is proposed that in stability in graded structure occurs because different concept temporarily represent the same categoy in working memory on different occasions.Rather than being retrieved as static units from memory to represent categories, concepts originate in a highly flexible process that retrieves generic and episodic information from long-term memory to construct temporary concepts in Work-ing memor\u0443. Because this concept construction process is highly constrained by goals, context, and jecent experience, the same concept is rarely if ever constructed for a category. A theory of concept construction is presented, and the relations of this theory to dreaming (Foulkes 1985), conceptual combination (Hampton in press a,b; Smith & Osherson 1984), exemplar theories (Brooks 1978; Jacoby & Brooks .1984; Media & Schaeffer 1978), norm theory (Kaimeman &: Miller, 1986), and parallel distributed processing (McClelland & Rumelhart 1986; Rumelhart & McClelland, 1986) are discussed."

The reports of simulation of cognitive processes include computer models of human behavior in logic problems, deciding on common stock portfolios, and carrying out social interaction.

The model tries to cover the entire range from behavior and phenomenological experience to detailed neural encodings in crude but computationally plausible reductive steps. The problems addressed include perceptual constancies, eye movements and the stable visual world, object descriptions, perceptual generalizations, and the representation of extrapersonal space. The entire development is based on an action-oriented notion of perception. The observer is assumed to be continuously sampling the ambient light for information of current value. The central problem of vision is taken to be categorizing and locating objects in the environment. The critical step in this process is the linking of visual information to symbolic object descriptions; this is called indexing, from the analogy of identifying a book from index terms. The system must also identify situations and use this knowledge to guide movement and other actions in the environment. The treatment focuses on the different representations of information used in the visual system. The four representational frames capture information in the following forms: retinotopic, head-based, symbolic, and allocentric. The functional roles of the four frames, the communication among them, and their suggested neurophysiological realization constitute the core of the paper. The model is perforce crude, but appears to be consistent with all relevant findings."

                "text": "/ Introduction Although Church's Thesis (CT) has been central to the theory of effective decidability for fifty years, the question of its epistemological status is still an open one. My own view, which is prompted by a naturalistic attitude toward such questions in mathematics as elsewhere, is that the thesis is an empirical statement of cognitive science, which is open to confirmation, amendment, or discard, and which, on the current evidence, appears to be true. Naturalism, although not to be identified with any of the classical schools of philosophy of mathematics, including the historicism of Webb [65], is hardly new; and if pushed to its Quinean limits would have to insist that mathematical epistemology is in principle a part of psychology. However in this paper I wish only to advocate the limited metathesis that CT is empirical, yet mathematical. I leave defense of the wider claim to others. This interpretation of CT is quite naturally suggested by one of the standard arguments for a mechanist theory of the mind, which CT supports. That argument, which I will review in more detail below, is this: Human cognitive processes are effective; by the thesis it follows they are recursive relations. This justifies defining the mind qua cognizing as a system of recursive rules, i.e., as a machine of some kind. Considerations in defense of mechanism thus tend to support CT much as empirical findings and low level laws in the physical and biological sciences tend to confirm or disconfirm relevant hypothetical generalizations. In my opinion much of this support is likely to come from cognitive science. Likewise, putative refutations of mechanism threaten CT and are likely to stem from empirical findings."

Making the case for the relevance of theoretical and experimental results in neuroscience, cognitive science, and artificial intelligence for the philosophy of mind, Churchland reviews current developments in the cognitive sciences and offers a clear and accessible account of the connections to philosophy of mind. For this third edition, the text has been updated and revised throughout. The changes range from references to the iPhone's \"Siri\" to expanded discussions of the work of such contemporary philosophers as David Chalmers, John Searle, and Thomas Nagel. Churchland describes new research in evolution, genetics, and visual neuroscience, among other areas, arguing that the philosophical significance of these new findings lies in the support they tend to give to the reductive and eliminative versions of materialism. Matter and Consciousness, written by the most distinguished theorist and commentator in the field, offers an authoritative summary and sourcebook for issues in philosophy of mind. It is suitable for use as an introductory undergraduate text."

The physical meaning of content-addressable memory is described by an appropriate phase space flow of the state of a system. A model of such a system is given, based on aspects of neurobiology but readily adapted to integrated circuits. The collective properties of this model produce a content-addressable memory which correctly yields an entire memory from any subpart of sufficient size. The algorithm for the time evolution of the state of the system is based on asynchronous parallel processing. Additional emergent collective properties include some capacity for generalization, familiarity recognition, categorization, error correction, and time sequence retention. The collective properties are only weakly sensitive to details of the modeling or the failure of individual devices."

The first six chapters, originally published in the 1960s, made a groundbreaking contribution to linguistic theory. This edition complements them with an additional chapter and a new preface, bringing Chomsky's influential approach into the twenty-first century. Chapters 1-6 present Chomsky's early work on the nature and acquisition of language as a genetically endowed, biological system (Universal Grammar), through the rules and principles of which we acquire an internalized knowledge (I-language). Over the past fifty years, this framework has sparked an explosion of inquiry into a wide range of languages, and has yielded some major theoretical questions. The final chapter revisits the key issues, reviewing the 'biolinguistic' approach that has guided Chomsky's work from its origins to the present day, and raising some novel and exciting challenges for the study of language and mind."

This deterministic system has collective properties in very close correspondence with the earlier stochastic model based on McCulloch - Pitts neurons. The content- addressable memory and other emergent collective properties of the original model also are present in the graded response model. The idea that such collective properties are used in biological systems is given added credence by the continued presence of such properties for more nearly biological \"neurons.\" Collective analog electrical circuits of the kind described will certainly function. The collective states of the two models have a simple correspondence. The original model will continue to be useful for simulations, because its connection to graded response systems is established. Equations that include the effect of action potentials in the graded response system are also developed."

The starting point of this comparison is the article of Rumelhart and Zipser (1985) on feature discovery through competitive learning. All the models which Rumelhart and Zipser (1985) have described were shown in Grossberg (1976b) to exhibit a type of learning which is temporally unstable. Competitive learning mechanisms can be stabilized in response to an arbitrary input environment by being supplemented with mechanisms for learning top-down expectancies, or templates; for matching bottom-up input patterns with the top-down expectancies; and for releasing orienting reactions in a mismatch situation, thereby updating short-term memory and searching for another internal representation. Network architectures which embody all of these mechanisms were called adaptive resonance models by Grossberg (1976c) . Self-stabilizing learning models are candidates for use in real-world applications where unpredictable changes can occur in complex input environments. Competitive learning postulates are inconsistent with the postulates of the interactive activation model of McClelland and Rumelhart (1981) , and suggest different levels of processing and interaction rules for the analysis of word recognition. Adaptive resonance models use these alternative levels and interaction rules. The selforganizing learning of an adaptive resonance model is compared and contrasted with the teacher-directed learning of a back propagation model. A number of criteria for evaluating real-time network models of cognitive processing are described and applied."

Slot names and slot fillers are diffuse patterns of activation spread over a collection of units. Our choice of a distributed representation gives rise to certain useful properties not shared by conventional frame systems. One of these is the ability to encode fine semantic distinctions as subtle variations on the canonical pattern for a slot. DUCS typically maintains several concepts simultaneously in its concept memory; it can retrieve a concept given one or more slots as cues. We show how Hinton's notion of a 'reduced description' can be used to make one concept fill a slot in another.

                "text": "ness of Internalized Perceptual Constraints The two-dimensional case of Chasles's theorem provides the simplest illustration of the abstractness of the internalized constraints. From considerations of physical dynamics, one might guess that two planar figures alternately presented in positions that differ arbitrarily (and hence by both a translation and a rotation, as in Panel f of Figure 2) would give rise to an apparent motion in which the center of mass of the apparently moving body traverses the shortest, straight line between its two terminal positions. Because the two views also differ by a rotation, such a motion would have to be accompanied by an additional, apparent rotational transformation, as illustrated for two rectangles in Figure 3, Part a. Instead of such a double transformation, however, Foster (1975) found Figure 3. Intermediate positions of a rectangle (drawn in thin lines) between the same two rectangles (drawn in heavy lines), which differ arbitrarily in both position and orientation, along a path consisting of a combined rectilinear translation and a rotation (Part a), and the path (which Foster, 1975, found to be preferred in apparent motion) consisting of a rotation only (Part b). (From Mental Images and Their Transformations by R. N. Shepard and L. A. Cooper, 1982, p. 316. Copyright 1982 by The Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Adapted by permission.) that the motion is generally experienced over a curved path. By having observers adjust the variable intermediate rectangle (indicated in Figure 3 by thinner lines) so that it appeared to fall on the path of motion, he found that (under conducive conditions) the motion tended to be experienced over that unique circular path that rigidly carries the one figure into the other by a single rotation about a fixed point, P, in the plane, as shown in Figure 3, Part b. It seems that here, as in the case of the moire pattern of Glass (1969; an example of which is shown in Figure 4, Part b), the visual system picks out the fixed point implied by the two presented positions of a rigid configuration in the plane and, hence, identifies the two configurations with each other by means of a simple rotation. (See Foster, 1975, 1978; Shepard, 1981b; and for a review and theoretical discussion, Shepard & Cooper, 4 In an investigation of apparent motion motivated by similar objectives, Warren (1977) reported that alternation between two-dimensional shapes differing by an affine transformation did not yield rigid apparent motion. However his allegedly affine pair (Panel g) was not affine, and his instructions and resulting subjective reports are open to questions of interpretation, choice of criterion, and effects of perceptual set or expectancy. 426 ROGER N. SHEPARD Figure 4. Moire pattern described by Glass (1969), in which two identical transparencies of a random texture (Part a), when superimposed in an arbitrary misalignment, give rise to the appearance of concentric circles (Part b). (As one transparency is shifted with respect to the other, the center of the concentric circles moves in an orthogonal direction.) 1982.) Incidentally, the visual system also extracts fixed points in the case of nonrigid transformations, as has been demonstrated by Johansson (1950, 1973), Wallach (1965/ 1976), and most extensively by Cutting and his associates (see Cutting, 1981; Cutting & Proffitt, 1982). There are good reasons why the automatic operations of the perceptual system should be guided more by general principles of kinematic geometry than by specific principles governing the different probable behaviors of particular objects. Chasles's theorem constrains the motion of each semirigid part of a body, during each moment of time, to a simple, six-degrees-of-freedom twisting motion, including the limiting cases of pure rotations or translations. By contrast, the more protracted motions of particular objects (a falling leaf, floating stick, diving bird, or pouncing cat) have vastly more degrees of freedom that respond quite differently to many unknowable factors (breezes, currents, memories, or intentions). Moreover, relative to a rapidly moving observer, the spatial transformations of even nonrigid, insubstantial, or transient objects (snakes, bushes, waves, clouds, or wisps of smoke) behave like the transformations of rigid objects (Shepard & Cooper, 1982). It is not surprising then that the automatic perceptual impletion that is revealed in apparent motion does not attempt either the impossible prediction or the arbitrary selection of one natural motion out of the many appropriate to the particular object. Rather, it simply instantiates the continuing existence of the object by means of the unique, simplest rigid motion that will carry the one view into the other, and it does so in a way that is compatible with a movement either of the observer or of the object observed. Possibly some pervasive principles of physical dynamics (such as a principle of momentum), in addition to the more abstract principles of purely kinematic geometry, have been internalized to the extent that they influence apparent motion (Foster & Gravano, 1982; Freyd, 1983a,. 1983c, 1983d, 1983e; Freyd & Finke, 1984; Ramachandran & Anstis, 1983). But there evidently is little or no effect of the particular object presented. The motion we involuntarily experience when a picture of an object is presented first in one place and then in another, whether the picture is of a leaf or of a cat, is neither a fluttering drift nor a pounce; it is, in both cases, the same simplest, rigid displacement. True, we may imagine a leaf fluttering down or a cat pouncing, but in doing so we voluntarily undertake a more complex simulation (just as we might in imagining a leaf pouncing or a cat fluttering down). Such mental simulations may be guided by internalizations of more specific principles of physical dynamics and even perhaps of animal behavior. Pervasive Constraints of Time and Distance I have taken the sources of the perceptual constraints considered so far to be corresponding constraints in the world, for example, the 24-hour diurnal cycle and principles of kinematic geometry and perhaps of physical dynamics. However, there are other highly orderly perceptual regularities that may not be reflections of constraints that happened to prevail in our world so much as manifestations of constraints that are unavoidable in any system that could exist in this world. Thus, much as the velocity of light limits the speed of communication between distant bodies, the necessarily finite velocity of signal ECOLOGICAL CONSTRAINTS ON INTERNAL REPRESENTATION 427"

Tille gating phenomena that result lead to dynamically maintained critical peri(Jlds, and to attentional phenomena such as overshadowing in the adult. The fuillctional unit of cognitive coding is suggested to be an adaptive resonance, or amplification and ,prolongation of neural activity, that occurs when afferent data and efferent expectancies reach consensus through a matching process. The resonant state embodies the perceptual event, or attentional focus, and its amplified and sustained activities are capable of driving slow changes of long-term memor:r\"' Mismatch between afferent data and efferent expectancies yields a global sulppression of activity and triggers a reset of short-term memory, as well as raJ~id parallel search and hypothesis testing for uncommitted cells.

                "text": "This paper describes NETtalk, a class of massively-parallel network systems that learn to convert English text to speech. The memory representations for pronunciations are learned by practice and are shared among many processing units. The performance of NETtalk has some similarities with observed human performance. (i) The learning follows a power law. (ii) The more words the network learns, the better it is at generalizing and correctly pronouncing new words, (iii) The performance of the network degrades very slowly as connections in the network are damaged: no single link or processing unit is essential. (iv) Relearning after damage is much faster than learning during the original training. (v) Distributed or spaced practice is more effective for long-term retention than massed practice. Network models can be constructed that have the same performance and learning characteristics on a particular task, but differ completely at the levels of synaptic strengths and single-unit responses. However, hierarchical clustering techniques applied to NETtalk reveal that these different networks have similar internal representations of letter-to-sound correspondences within groups of processing units. This suggests that invariant internal representations may be found in assemblies of neurons intermediate in size between highly localized and completely distributed representations."

On first reading, however, we were shocked by what seemed to be an attempt to defend a two-level mpresentationalist account of connectionism. At one level - call it the macrolevcl - Smolensky seemed to be saying that whenever a net is processing infurmation the representational symbols of conventional cognitive science are instantiated by patterns of activities of units. His disagl\"ecment with cognitive science is simply that the generation of intelligent behavior could not be exhaustively explained by formal operations on these \"conceptual\" symbols. Moreover, Smolensky seemed to hold that on a second, deeper microlevel, one could carry out the conventional cognitive science program by explaining intelligent behavior using finergrained (subconceptual) symbols which picked out context-free microfeatures of the task domain. That this was not only our interpretation was brought home to us when we found that Fodor & Pylyshyn (1988) quote this very target article as clearly placing Smolensky and the connectionists in the representationalist camp."

                "text": "intellectual activity may be largely preserved In lesions oCthefeft temporal region. However, the patient with a disturbance of the phonemic and conceptual structure of the speech processes always experiences considerable difficulty notwithstanding the adequate preservation of the ability to engage in certain forms of abstract intellectual activity, when he attempts to carry out systematic, successive operations with relationships requiring the constant participation of speech associations as mediators. In such circumstances the ability to discriminate between relationships becomes manifestly inadequate and the patient'S intellectual operations begin to suffer. The intellectual defects of a patient with temporal aphasia become apparent in nonspeech operations in which an essential part of the process entails the use of systems of speech associations retained in the memory. For instance, a patient who could still sort out a series of pictures telling a story, provided he was allowed to mix them up himself, found the process very difficult if he was not allowed to touch the pictures and was asked to put them in the proper order as indicated by the appropriate numbers (Ombredane, 1951). These patients experience similar difficulties with series of geometrical operations. The defects were found to be particularly serious when such patients attempted to do mental arithmetical calculations. They had no difficulty in grasping numerical relationships but, although usually preserving the general plan of the necessary actions, they became helpless when given problems requiring a series of successive operations with some of the results to be kept in mind. An attempt to assist the process by allowing them to speak out loud was unsuccessful, and without the support of a well-established and differentiated system of word associations it was seriously impaired. It should be noted that the operations of discursive intellectual activity, which are wholly dependent on speech, for example, the solution of logical problems as in Burt's tests on the establishment of multiple relationships (Part III, Section 8E), remained completely beyond these patients' ability. They \u2022 Among our patients was a bookkeeper with a severe form of sensory aphasia who could still draw up the annual balance sheet in spite of severe disturbances of speech and although he was unable to remember the names of his subordinates and used to refer to them incorrectly."

During the past twenty years, research in the behavioral sciences has become increasingly sophisticated. New findings concerning the brain and behavior have forced upon us the unpleasant necessity of reexamining our models. Concepts, once useful, such as \"the unconscious,\" \"regression,\" \"motivation,\" no longer serve to adequately encompass the data. William Malamud, in his 1960 A.P.A. presidential address again brings this problem to our attention in discussing \". . . the emergence of order out of disorder. The most striking is that manifested by the living organism, where we find that from a random collection of atoms there is a synthesis of cells which in turn arrange themselves in the most intricate orderly system of an organism. . ."

Four biologically relevant aspects are treated--initial state before learning, synaptic sign changes, hierarchical categorization of stored patterns, and synaptic learning rule. Several of the hypotheses are tested numerically. Starting from the limit case of random connections (spin glass), selection is viewed as pruning of a complex tree of states generated with maximal parsimony of genetic information."

According to the model context aids the perception of target letters as they are processed in the perceptual system. The implication that the duration and timing of the context in which a letter occurs should greatly influence the perceptibility of the target is confirmed by a series of experiments demonstrating that early or enhanced presentations of word and pronounceablepseudoword contexts greatly increase the perceptibility of target letters. Also according to the model, letters in strings that share several letters with words should be equally perceptible whether they are orthographically regular and pronounceable (SLET) or irregular (SLNT) and should be much more perceptible than letters in contexts that share few letters with any word (XLQJ). This prediction is tested and confirmed. The basic results of all the experiments are accounted for, with some modification of parameters, although there are some discrepancies in detail. Several recent findings that seem to challenge the model are considered and a number of extensions are proposed."

Instead of rcprcscnting probabilitics with realnumbers, we usc a more dircct encoding in which thc probability \\ associated with a hypotlmis is rcprcscntcd by the probability hat it is in one of two states, true or false. Wc give a particular nondeterministic operator, based on statistical mechanics, for updating the truth values of hypothcses. The operator ensures that the probability of discovering a particular combination of hypothcscs is a simplc function of how good that combination is. Wc show that thcrc is a simple relationship bctween this operator and Bayesian inference, and we describe a learning rule which allows a parallel system to converge on a set ofweights that optimizes its perccptt~al inferences."

She is, however, prepared to make certain concessions in the present case. First, she concedes that there are beliefs and desires and that there is a matter of fact about their intentional contents; there\u2019s a matter of fact, that is to say, about which proposition the intentional object of a belief or a desire is. Second, Auntie accepts the coherence of physicalism. It may be that believing and desiring will prove to be states of the brain, and if they do that\u2019s OK with Auntie. Third, she is prepared to concede that beliefs and desires have causal roles, and that overt behavior is typically the effect of complex interactions among these mental causes. (That Auntie was raised as a strict behaviorist goes without saying. But she hasn\u2019t been quite the same since the 60\u2019s. Come to think of it, which of us has?) In short, Auntie recognizes that psychological explanations need to postulate a network of causally related intentional states. \u201cBut why\u201d, she asks with perceptible asperity, \u201cdoes it have to be a language?\u201d Or, to put it more succinctly than Auntie often does, what \u2014 over and above mere Intentional Realism \u2014 does the Language of Thought Hypothesis buy? That is what this paper is about.1"

                "text": "Given a \u0302 network of simple computing elements and some entities to be represented, the most straightforward scheme is to use one computing element for each entity. This is called a local representation. It is easy to understand and easy to implement because the structure of the physical network mirrors the structure of the knowledge it contains. This report describes a different type of representation that is less familiar and harder to think about than local representations. Each entity is represented by a pattern of activity distributed over many computing elements, and each computing element is involved in representing many different entities. The strength of this more complicated kind of representation does not lie in its notational convenience or its ease of implementation in a conventional computer, but rather in the efficiency with which it makes use of the processing abilities of networks of simple, neuron-like computing elements. Every representational scheme has its good and bad points. Distributed representations are no exception. Some desirable properties like content-addressable memory and automatic generalization arise very naturally from the use of patterns of activity as representations. Other properties, like the ability to temporarily store a large set of arbitrary associations, are much harder to achieve. The best psychological evidence for distributed representations is the degree to which their strengths and weaknesses match those of the human mind. ^This research was supported by a grant from the System Development Foundation.

Case-based planning requires a machine planner that makes use of its own past experience in developing new plans. A case-based planner relies on memory instead of a base of rules. Memories of past successes are accessed and modified to create new plans. Memories of past failures are used to warn the planner of impending problems, and memories of past repairs are called upon to tell the planner how to how to deal with them. This view of planning from experience is supported by a learning system that incorporates new experiences into the planner's episodic memory. This learning algorithm gains from the planner's failures as well as its successes. Successful plans are stored in memory, indexed by the goals they satisfy and the problems they avoid. Failures are also stored, indexed by the features in the world that predict them. By storing failures as well as successes, the planner is able to anticipate and avoid future plan failures. A process of plan repair is also presented in which plan failures are diagnosed through a causal analysis of the steps and states that led to their occurrence. This causal analysis is used to access repair strategies for the general situation. These strategies are then transformed into specific alterations for the faulty plan at hand. This theory improves on past planning models in three areas: failure avoidance, plan repair and plan reuse."

The present article suggests that attention switching influences initial storage of items in STM, but that competitive interactions among the STM representations of stored items control the further evolution of temporal-order information as new items are processed. The laws governing these competitive interactions, called the long-term memory (LTM) invariance principle and the STM normalization rule, were originally derived from postulates that ensure that STM is updated in a way that enables temporally stable list learning in LTM to occur. Despite these adaptive constraints, and often because of them, temporal-order information is not always stored veridically. Both feedforward and feedback STM processes, with different invariant properties, are identified in the storage of temporal-order information."

There cannot be an audience anywhere in the world more deeply devoted to science, and to the play of the human mind in experiment and invention, in logic and imagination, than this great gathering.

                "text": "From Galileo's analysis of motion to the theories of evolution and relativity, Charles Gillispie takes us on a masterly tour of the world of scientific ideas. The history of modern science is portrayed here as the development of objectivity through the study of nature. In the mid-1950s, a young professor at Princeton named Charles Gillispie began teaching Humanities 304, one of the first undergraduate courses offered anywhere in the world on the history of science. From start to finish--Galileo to Einstein--Gillispie introduced the students to the key ideas and individuals in science. The Edge of Objectivity arose out of this course. It must have been a lively class. The Edge of Objectivity is pointed, opinionated, and selective. Even at six hundred pages, the book is, as the title suggests, an essay. Gillispie is unafraid to rate Mendel higher than Darwin, Maxwell above Faraday. Full of wry turns of phrase, the book effectively captures people and places. And throughout the book, Gillispie pushes an argument. He views science as the progressive development of more objective, detached, mathematical ways of viewing the world, and he orchestrates his characters and ideas around this theme. In the forty-five years since the publication of The Edge of Objectivity, historians of science have established a full-fledged discipline. They have focused increasingly on the social context of science rather than its internal dynamics, and they have frequently viewed science more as a threatening instance of power than as an accumulation of knowledge. Nevertheless, Gillispie's book remains a sophisticated, fast-moving, idiosyncratic account of the development of scientific ideas over four hundred years, by one of the founding intellects in the history of science."

In order to make such decisions rationally, and hence avoid the need for backtracking that inevitably results if they are made arbitrarily, relevant contextual information must be brought to bear. An integrated model of planning or understanding is one that attempts to take such contextual information into account as early as possible. \nAn integrated model of understanding must take the understander's goals and hypotheses into account in making decisions about how to interpret an input. The relationship between syntax and semantics in language understanding is analyzed from such an integrated point of view. Next, the problems of lexical ambiguity and vagueness are addressed, previous attempts to solve these problems are analyzed, and their shortcomings are used to motivate requirements for a more complete solution. Finally, an integrated approach to inference in explanation-based understanding is presented. \nAn integrated model of planning must take the situation in which the planner finds itself into account early in the construction of plans. Such an integrated approach leads to a conception of planning in which goals are set, in part, on the basis of opportunities for their pursuit. This model of opportunistic planning is applied to the problem of response formation in arguments. The problems involved in recognizing opportunities are uncovered, and several possible solutions are presented. These solutions lead to a conception of unsatisfied goals as active mental entities. In this context, I analyze the planning architecture which is presupposed by Freud's intentional explanations for errors, particularly slips of the tongue, and show that it can be functionally justified on the grounds that it fulfills the requirements for opportunistic planning."

Frequently, processes are needed which reduce ambiguity and noise, and select the best label among several possible choices. Relaxation labeling processes are just such a class of algorithms. They are based on the parallel use of local constraints between labels. This paper develops a theory to characterize the goal of relaxation labeling. The theory is founded on a definition of con-sistency in labelings, extending the notion of constraint satisfaction. In certain restricted circumstances, an explicit functional exists that can be maximized to guide the search for consistent labelings. This functional is used to derive a new relaxation labeling operator. When the restrictions are not satisfied, the theory relies on variational cal-culus. It is shown that the problem of finding consistent labelings is equivalent to solving a variational inequality. A procedure nearly identical to the relaxation operator derived under restricted circum-stances serves in the more general setting. Further, a local convergence result is established for this operator. The standard relaxation labeling formulas are shown to approximate our new operator, which leads us to conjecture that successful applications of the standard methods are explainable by the theory developed here. Observations about con-vergence and generalizations to higher order compatibility relations are described."

The theory also physically interprets and generalizes Land's retinex theory. These phenomena are traced to adaptive processes that overcome limitations of visual uptake to synthesize informative visual representations of the external world. Two parallel contour sensitive processes interact to generate the theory's brightness, color, and form estimates. A boundary contour process is sensitive to orientation and amount of contrast but not to direction of contrast in scenic edges. It synthesizes boundaries sensitive to the global configuration of scenic elements. A feature contour process is insensitive to orientation but sensitive to both amount of contrast and to direction of contrast in scenic edges. It triggers a diffusive filling-in of featural quality within perceptual domains whose boundaries are determined by completed boundary contours. The boundary contour process is hypothesized to include cortical interactions initiated by hypercolumns in Area 17 of the visual cortex. The feature contour process is hypothesized to include cortical interactions initiated by the cytochrome oxydase staining blobs in Area 17. Relevant data from striate and prestriate visual cortex, including data that support two predictions, are reviewed. Implications for other perceptual theories and axioms of geometry are discussed."

They attempted to report, in order, the four earliest occurring numerals after the target. Numerals appeared at rates of 4.6,6.9,9.2, and 13.4/s. Scaling analyses were made of (a) item scores, P,(r), the probability of a numeral from stimulus position i appearing in response position r,r = (l,2,3, 4), and (b) order scores, PiBj, the probability that a numeral from stimulus position /' appeared earlier in the response than one from stimulus position;'. For all subjects, targets, and numeral rates, the relative position of numerals in the response sequence showed clustering, disorder, and folding. Reported numerals tended to cluster around a stimulus position 400 ms after the target. The numerals were reported in an apparently haphazard order\u2014at high numeral rates, inverted iBj pairs were as frequent as correct pairs. The actual order of report resulted from a mixture of correctly ordered numerals with numerals ordered in the direction opposite to their order of presentation (folding around the cluster center). These results are quantitatively described by a strength theory of order (precedence) and are efficiently predicted by a computational attention gating model (AGM). The AGM makes quantitatively correct predictions of over 500 values ofPt(r), PIBj in 12 conditions with two attention and three to six detection parameters estimated for each subject. The AGM may be derived from a more general attention model that assumes (a) after detection of the target an attention gate opens briefly (with a bell-shaped time course) to allow numerals to enter a visual short-term memory, and (b) subsequent order of report depends on both item strength (how wide the gate was open during the numeral's entry) and on order information (item strength times cumulative strength of prior numerals)."

                "text": "The problems of heuristic programming-of making computers solve really difficult problems-are divided into five main areas: Search, Pattern-Recognition, Learning, Planning, and Induction. A computer can do, in a sense, only what it is told to do. But even when we do not know how to solve a certain problem, we may program a machine (computer) to Search through some large space of solution attempts. Unfortunately, this usually leads to an enormously inefficient process. With Pattern-Recognition techniques, efficiency can often be improved, by restricting the application of the machine's methods to appropriate problems. Pattern-Recognition, together with Learning, can be used to exploit generalizations based on accumulated experience, further reducing search. By analyzing the situation, using Planning methods, we may obtain a fundamental improvement by replacing the given search with a much smaller, more appropriate exploration. To manage broad classes of problems, machines will need to construct models of their environments, using some scheme for Induction. Wherever appropriate, the discussion is supported by extensive citation of the literature and by descriptions of a few of the most successful heuristic (problem-solving) programs constructed to date."

We believe that all arguments are composed of a fixed number of abstract argument structures, which we call Argument Units (AUs). Thus, argument comprehension is viewed in OpEd fundamentally as the process of recognizing, instantiating, and applying argument units. Here we discuss: (a) the knowledge and processes necessary to understand opinions, arguments, and issues which arise in politico-economic editorials; and (b) the relation of this research to previous work in natural language understanding.

At some point during the mental rotation, a test shape was presented at one of 12 picture-plane orientations, and the subject was required to determine as rapidly as possible whether the test shape was the same as the originally designated shape or was its mirror image. When the test shape was presented in the expected orientation (the orientation assumed to correspond to the current orientation of the rotating internal representation), reaction time was short and constant, regardless of the angular departure of that orientation from a previously trained position. This was true even when the test shape was presented in an orientation which had not previously been tested. When the test shape was presented at some other, unexpected orientation, reaction time increased linearly with the angular difference between the expected orientation and the orientation of the test shape. It is argued that these results provide a demonstration of the \\ldanalog\\rd nature of mental rotation."

Pixel gray levels and the presence and orientation of edges are viewed as states of atoms or molecules in a lattice-like physical system. The assignment of an energy function in the physical system determines its Gibbs distribution. Because of the Gibbs distribution, Markov random field (MRF) equivalence, this assignment also determines an MRF image model. The energy function is a more convenient and natural mechanism for embodying picture attributes than are the local characteristics of the MRF. For a range of degradation mechanisms, including blurring, nonlinear deformations, and multiplicative or additive noise, the posterior distribution is an MRF with a structure akin to the image model. By the analogy, the posterior distribution defines another (imaginary) physical system. Gradual temperature reduction in the physical system isolates low energy states (``annealing''), or what is the same thing, the most probable states under the Gibbs distribution. The analogous operation under the posterior distribution yields the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the image given the degraded observations. The result is a highly parallel ``relaxation'' algorithm for MAP estimation. We establish convergence properties of the algorithm and we experiment with some simple pictures, for which good restorations are obtained at low signal-to-noise ratios."

The design and implementation of this system is described and illustrated with detailed examples of the operation of system components and examples of overall system operation. The language processing portion of the system uses a number of augmented transition networks, each of which matches phrases with a specific meaning, along with context registers (history keepers) and concept case frames; these are used for judging meaningfulness of questions, generating dialogue for clarifying partially understood questions, and resolving ellipsis and pronoun reference problems. Other system components construct a formal query for the relational database, and optimize the order of searching relations. Methods are discussed for handling vague or complex questions and for providing browsing ability. Also included are discussions of important issues in programming natural language systems for limited domains, and the relationship of this system to others."

Coupled-mode equations are derived for the time evolution of a wave scattered off these gratings; eigenmodes of the coupling matrix \u03ba saturate preferentially, implementing stable reconstruction of a stored memory from partial input and associative reconstruction of a set of stored memories. Multiple scattering in the volume reconstructs cycles of associations that compete for saturation. Input of a new pattern switches all the energy into the cycle containing a representative of that pattern; the system thus acts as an abstract categorizer with multiple basins of stability. The advantages that an imprintable medium with gain biased near the critical point has over either the holographic or the adaptive matrix associative paradigms are (1) images may be input as noncoherent distributions which nucleate long-range critical modes within the medium, and (2) the interaction matrix \u03ba of critical modes is full, thus implementing the sort of full connectivity needed for associative reconstruction in a physical medium that is only locally connected, such as a nonlinear crystal."

In addition, they accomplish his purpose of presenting and criticizing a number of this century's most prominent and plausible attempts to establish communication between secular rationality and religious faith. This survey of philosophical theology in the twentieth century elicits the melancholy reflection that no such attempt was an unqualified success. Not even the most respected of these scholars could win wide acceptance of their theological views from their peers in professional philosophy. On the other hand, ongoing events in both the practical and the intellectual world suggest that if the \"religious ground\" has not been convincingly explained, neither has it been explained away."

When both locations were within the receptive field of a cell in prestriate area V4 or the inferior temporal cortex, the response to the unattended stimulus was dramatically reduced. Cells in the striate cortex were unaffected by attention. The filtering of irrelevant information from the receptive fields of extrastriate neurons may underlie the ability to identify and remember the properties of a particular object out of the many that may be represented on the retina."

Given p and p-7 q. we can conclude q with certainty, without giving any consideration to whatever other rules may be in the system. By contrast. ifwe know that node i is active. and that there is a positive connection from i to j. we can't conclude anything about the activity of node j nntil we know what all the other connections and activities are. This difference has important implications for penorming inferences with hard and soft constraints, and is true despite the obvious fact that the total set ofinferences nsing hard rules depends on the total set of rules. Prince & Pinker go Oil to ellumerate what they take to be several problems for connectionist systems. The first is that an \u00abentity is nothing but its features\"; they base this on the Rnmelliart and McClelland (1986) model of pasttense acquisition."

This method is based on activity-dependent intrinsic signals and does not use voltage-sensitive dyes. Images of the living monkey striate (VI) and extrastriate (V2) visual cortex, taken during visual stimulation, were analyzed to yield maps of the distribution of cells with various functional properties. The cytochrome oxidase--rich blobs of V1 and the stripes of V2 were imaged in the living brain. In V2, no ocular dominance organization was seen, while regions of poor orientation tuning colocalized to every other cytochrome oxidase stripe. The orientation tuning of other regions of V2 appeared organized as modules that are larger and more uniform than those in V1."

The stored information is accessed by injecting partial information (e.g., an image of the cat\u2019s ear) into the resonator. A gain medium internal to the resonator amplifies the field belonging to the eigenmode that most resembles the injected field; the other eigenmodes are suppressed through a competition for the gain.

Table 2 indicates these relationships and also the degree of exactness to which each system can be described at each level - the degree of precision to which each virtual machine is defined. 'The levels included in Table 2 are those relevant to predicting high-level behavior. Of course each system can also be described at lower levels, all the way down to elementary particles. However, levels below an exactly describable level can be ignored from the point of view of predicting high-level behavior, since it is possible (in principle) to do the prediction at the highest level that can be exactly described (it is presumably much harder to do the same at lower levels). This is why in the symbolic paradigm aoy descriptions below the conceptual level are not viewed as significant. For modeling high-level behavior, how the symbol manipulation happens to be implemented can be ignored - it is not a relevant part of the cognitive model. In a subsymbolic model, exact behavioral prediction must be performed at the subconceptuallevel, but how the units happen to be implemented is not relevant. The relation between the conceptual level and lower levels is fundamentally different in the subsymbolic and symbolic paradigms. This leads to important differences in the kind of explanations the paradigms offer of conceptual-level behavior, and the kind of reduction used in these explanations. A symbolic model is a system of interacting processes, all with the same conceptual-level semantics as the task behaviof bcing explained. Adopting the terminology of Haugeland (1978), this systerrultic explanation relies on a systematic reduction ofthe behavior that involves no shift of semantic domain or dimension."

Let me be precise about a simpler alternative to Smolensky's PTC (proper treatment of connectionism); let me call it OTC (the obvious treatment of connectionism). In Figure I, I have displayed the possible kinds of network configurations as a function of input or output unit representation and the hidden unit representation adopted through learning (local or distributed). The first case shown in Figure 1 is what we might associate with the usual symbolic or rule-based approach; it is ofcourse quite \"localist\" (i.e., a single unit constitutes a single symbol). Here the tokens \"dog1,\" \"dog2,\" and \"dog3\" are being mapped to the \"dog\" concept. This type ofprocess is the assignment ofa set of tokens to a type. It is up to other operations to associate the tokens with other tokens or featural representations of the same type as in, for example, an inheritance process. The second case shown is still a kind ofsymholist representation as well as a case of local representation. In this case, however, tokens are first decomposed into a set of primitive features or composite types which cover all the possible tokens . in the domain. So in the present case, \"barks,\" \"has fur,\" \"breathes,\" and \"has spots\" are examples ofa set offeatures that might be used to describe dogs and other animals. Schank's (1975) Conceptual Dependency approach is an example, with the tokens in the domain first mapped onto a set ofgeneral types or features (P-TRANS, a physical transfer of information)."

Gone is the fluidity that flavors the human cognitive functioning observed in life and laboratory. This is not to say, however, that symbolic models ofcognition are worthless Or simply false. Indeed, Smolensky is, I believe, right on target when he states that connectionist models stand to symbolic ones as quantum mechanics stands to classical mechanics. Just as the behavior of a physical system can be described using both classical and quantum tenns, so too can the behavior of a cognitive system be described by both symbolic and connectionist models. In neither case, however, is the lower-level description a mere expansion of the higher, nor can a one-to-one mapping of constructs between the two be made. Moreover, just as quantum th~ory changed our thinking about the nature ofphysical systems and their fimdamental processes, so too, I believe, are connectionist models challenging and changing our ideas about the nature of fundamental cognitive mechanisms. The most telling example is the treatment of inference by the two frameworks. It is a beliefofmany cognitive scientists (most notably, Fodor 1975) that the fundamental process of cognition is inference, a process to which symbolic modelling is particularly well suited. \u00b7While Smolensky points out that statistical inference replaces logical inference in connectionist systems, he too continues to place inference at the heart of all cognitive activity. I believe that something more fundamental is taking place. In most Connectionist models, the fundamental process of cognition is not inference, but is instead the (dear to the Ilearts of psychologists) activation of associated units in a network. Inference \"emerges\" as a system-level interpretation of this microleve! activity, but ~ when representations are distributed - no simple one-to-one mapping of activity patterns to symboIs and inferences can be made. From this viewpoint, the fundamental process of cognition is the activation of associated units, and inference is a second-order process. Certain connectionist models also challenge our understanding of cognition by representing symbols not as static data structures, but as activation patterns that OCCur momentarily at run time. Such dyn:.unic, distributed instantiations of symbols hold great promise for the much~hopecl-formarriage of cognitive science to neuroscience. For, although Smolensky takes great pains to explain that connectionist networks, as they presently stand, do not represent neural networks, it is exactly this type of distributed representation scheme that may be needed to explain how, for example, the same groups ofneurons can be used to store a variety of memories in the brain. Smolensky also discusses the r:.unifications of representing symbols in a distributed fashion in his reply to Pylyshyn (1984), suggesting that dccontextualized symbols are a rarity - or impossibility - in connectionist models."

                "text": "This new edition covers the central concepts of practical optimization techniques, with an emphasis on methods that are both state-of-the-art and popular. One major insight is the connection between the purely analytical character of an optimization problem and the behavior of algorithms used to solve a problem. This was a major theme of the first edition of this book and the fourth edition expands and further illustrates this relationship. As in the earlier editions, the material in this fourth edition is organized into three separate parts. Part I is a self-contained introduction to linear programming. The presentation in this part is fairly conventional, covering the main elements of the underlying theory of linear programming, many of the most effective numerical algorithms, and many of its important special applications. Part II, which is independent of Part I, covers the theory of unconstrained optimization, including both derivations of the appropriate optimality conditions and an introduction to basic algorithms. This part of the book explores the general properties of algorithms and defines various notions of convergence. Part III extends the concepts developed in the second part to constrained optimization problems. Except for a few isolated sections, this part is also independent of Part I. It is possible to go directly into Parts II and III omitting Part I, and, in fact, the book has been used in this way in many universities.New to this edition is a chapter devoted to Conic Linear Programming, a powerful generalization of Linear Programming. Indeed, many conic structures are possible and useful in a variety of applications. It must be recognized, however, that conic linear programming is an advanced topic, requiring special study. Another important topic is an accelerated steepest descent method that exhibits superior convergence properties, and for this reason, has become quite popular. The proof of the convergence property for both standard and accelerated steepest descent methods are presented in Chapter 8. As in previous editions, end-of-chapter exercises appear for all chapters.From the reviews of the Third Edition: this very well-written book is a classic textbook in Optimization. It should be present in the bookcase of each student, researcher, and specialist from the host of disciplines from which practical optimization applications are drawn.

He is therefore proposing a connectionist model of linguistic performance (not to be confused with linguistic competence - Chomsky's technical term for a speaker's knowledge oflanguage). There is no reason to believe that such a model will succeed, The most difficult problem a model of language use must address is what is called the creative aspect oflanguage use - the fact that nonnal language use is innovative, potentially unbounded in scope, and free from the control of detectable stimuli. As Chomsky notes in Language and Mind (1972), the latter two properties could be accommodated within mechanical explanation."
