In recent literature, a certain successive-approxi- mations procedure, based on the likelihood equations, was shown empirically to be effective in numerically approximating such maximum-likelihood estimates; however, the reliability of this procedure was not established theoretically. Here, we introduce a general iterative procedure, of the generalized steepest- ascent (deflected-gradient) type, which is just the procedure known in the literature when the step-size is taken to be 1. We show that, with probability as the sample size grows large, this procedure converges locally to the strongly consistent maximum-likelihood estimate whenever the step-size lies between 0 and 2. We also show that the step-size which yields optimal local convergence rates for large samples is determined in a sense by the \"separation\" of the component normal densities and is bounded below by a number between and 2."

It is shown that, with probability 1 for large samples, this procedure converges locally to the maximum- likelihood estimate whenever a certain step-size lies between 0 and 2. Furthermore, optimal rates of local convergence are obtained for a step-size which is bounded below by a number between 1 and 2. 1. Introduction. Let x be an n-dimensional random variable whose density function is a convex combination of density functions po, P1,i.., Pm on Ri. In parti- cular, suppose that the density function of x is p(x, do), a member of the parametric family of density functions m p (x, a)= aipi (x) + (1 - j)po(x) i=l The results given here generalize those of (2), in which a restricted iterative procedure is considered in the special case /3 = 1. We also remark that our results apply to the problem of numerically evaluating a maximum-likelihood estimate of a"

The solution to the maximum likelihood (ML) equations was obtained using Newton's iterative method. Some interesting results for the moment estimates were obtained for the case when independent sample observations are available from one population. Extensive Monte Carlo simulation was employed to obtain the sample variances of the estimates as well as the estimated asymptotic variances. The variances of the estimates are influenced by the separation of the two means with respect to the variances, the mixture proportion (p), and, of course, the size of the sample. When the number of observations is small and the means are not well separated, the sample variance of the estimates can be as much as three times greater than the estimated asymptotic variances."

Two alternative methods, (i) moment estimates and (ii) multinomial maximum likelihood and minimum x2 estimates obtained by grouping the underlying variable, are compared both for bias to n-1, and mean squared error to n-2 for a variety of mixed distributions. The methods do not differ essentially with regard to bias but for the mean squared error, the grouped estimates are shown to be more accurate than the moment estimates for most distributions, though the moment estimates seem preferable for distributions which are particularly difficult to estimate. It is also found that the accuracy levels of the grouped maximum likelihood and minimum x2 estimates do not differ greatly."

The maximum likelihood equations are shown to be not unduly laborious to solve and the sampling properties of the resulting estimates are investigated, mainly by simulation. Moment estimators, minimum x2 and Bayes estimators are discussed but they appear greatly inferior to maximum likelihood except in the univariate case, the inferiority lying either in the sampling properties of the estimates or in the complexity of the computation. The wider problems obtained by allowing the components in the mixture to have different covariance matrices, or by having more than two components in the mixture, are briefly discussed, as is the relevance of this problem to cluster analysis."

In the general case, with two means, two standard deviations, and a proportionality factor to be estimated, the first five sample moments are required, and it becomes necessary to find a particular solution of a ninth degree polynomial equation that was originally derived by Karl Pearson [10]. A procedure which circumvents solution of the nonic equation and thereby considerably reduces the total computational effort otherwise required, is presented. Estimates obtained in the simpler special case in which the two standard deviations are assumed to be equal, are employed as first approximations in an iterative method for simultaneously solving the basic system of moment equations applicable in the more general case in which the two standard deviations are unequal. Conditional maximum likelihood and conditional minimum chi-square estimation subject to having the first four sample moments equated ..."

These, in general, correspond to relative maximums of the likelihood function. It is assumed that the number of distributions is known, and that the mixtures are from distributions of the same type, but with different parameter values. The particular equations for the Poisson, binomial, and exponential distributions are given, as well as examples of the results of the procedure for each distribution. From the examples tried, it was observed that the likelihood function increased at each iteration. Graphs of the asymptotic variances of the estimates are given, and two sampling experiments comparing estimates obtained by this scheme with moment estimates are also given."

Illustrative examples especially studied in this paper concern grouped and censored normal samples and normal mixtures. A simple iterative method of solution is proposed and studied. It is shown that the sequence of iterates converges to a relative maximum of the likelihood function, and that the convergence is geometric with a factor of convergence which for large samples equals the maxi-mal relative loss of Fisher information due to the incompleteness of data. This large sample factor of convergence is illustrated diagrammaticaily for the examples mentioned above. Experiences of practical application are mentioned."

A series of ad hoc methods that produce initial guesses for parameter values is also presented. Two methods of global estimation given initial parameter guesses are presented and compared. These methods are the maximum likelihood and a least squares procedure that fits the sample quantiles to the inverse distribution function of the mixture. The sensitivity of the methods to poor choices for initial guesses is also considered."

The only distributional assumption is that the log likelihood ratio is linear in the observations and hence the method is robust and applicable to a number of families of distributions. Sample points are required from each component distribution and from the compound. In particular, the method handles continuous and discrete data with equal facility. Only a moderate number of parameters need estimation so that problems in quite high dimensions can be solved. The method can be used to update logistic discriminant functions using data points whose parent populations are unknown."

Beginning with a standard definition of an abstract pattern-recognition machine, \"learning\" is given a mathematical meaning and the distinction is made between supervised and unsupervised learning. The bibliography will help the interested reader retrace the history of learning in pattern recognition. The exposition now focuses attention on unsupervised learning. Carefully, it is explained how problems in this subject can be viewed as problems in the identification of finite mixtures, a statistical theory that has achieved some maturity. From this vantage point, it is demonstrated that identification theory implies unsupervised learning is possible in many important cases. The remaining sections present a general method for achieving unsupervised learning. Other authors have proposed schemes having greater computational convenience, but no method previously published is as inclusive as the one revealed here, which we demonstrate to be effective for all the many cases wherein unsupervised learning is known to be possible."

The consistency and asymptotic normality of the estimator are proved and its finite sample behavior is compared to that of the standard method of moments estimator by Monte Carlo experiments.

Efficient estimators for any n \u22672r \u2212 1 are obtained as functions of the moment estimators by two procedures, one involving expansion of a \u03c72 about the moment estimators to obtain BAN estimators, the other using Fisher's \u201cinformation\u201d to compute a correction factor for the moment estimators.

As with mixtures of normals, Pearson (1915) appears to have been the first to study such distributions in any detail, deriving moment estimators for the parameters in a mixture of binomial density functions. A large part of this chapter will involve mixtures in which the components are binomial or Poisson distributions, since these have been extensively studied in the literature. However, mixtures of other discrete distributions will be considered briefly, in particular the multivariate Bernoulli distribution which, as noted by Wolfe (1969), may be used as the basis of latent class analysis (see Lazarsfeld, 1968). We begin by considering mixtures of binomial distributions."

A general power series expansion is obtained, which is then explored in detail for the case of two exponential densities, and for the case of two normal densities with equal scale. Simple approximations are obtained, for example when (\u03bc1 \u2212 \u03bc2/\u03c3) is near zero in a mixture of two normal distributions with means \u03bc1 and \u03bc2 and common variance \u03c32, and when \u03b1/\u03b2 is near unity in a mixture of two exponential distributions with mean lives (\u03b1)\u22121 and (\u03b2)\u22121, \u03b1 < \u03b2. Brief tables based on the various approximations are presented, giving an overall picture of the information. The main qualitative conclusion is that extremely large, and often impractical, sample sizes are required to obtain even moderate precision in estimating p unless the mixed distributions are very well separated."

In contradistinction to most clustering methods, this procedure does not require selection of a metric or distance function with sample element arguments. Instead, estimates of population bivariate contours are examined graphically to yield estimates of subpopulation parameters. This approach is based on properties of the underlying population rather than on heuristic measures of distance between elements of a sample. Besides discussing the theory underlying this new class of procedures, several examples involving real and simulated data are presented."

It is shown, by using a simple transformation which reduces the number of parameters from five to three, that the computation of the whole information matrix leads to the numerical evaluation of a particular integral. The Hermite-Gauss quadrature formula, Romberg's algorithm, a power series, and Taylor's expansion are applied for the evaluation of this integral and the results are compared with each other. A short table has been provided from which the approximate information matrix can be obtained in practice."

Karl Pearson (1894) investigated the problem and developed equations for the purpose; but found them unsolvable as the \u2018majority [of the relations] lead to exponential equations the solution of which seems more beyond the wit of man than that of a numerical equation even of the ninth order\u2019. He did indeed evolve an equation of this order and used it to analyse a few bimodal distributions, but the arithmetic involved was very laborious. Later he (Pearson, 1914) gives a table for \u2018Constants of normal curve from moments of tail about stump \u2019which, as he describes in the introduction, occasionally permits a rough analysis of a distribution which is known to be bimodal. This method is much more rapid than the solution of the nonic equation, but \u2018owing to the paucity of material in tails and corresponding irregularity there will be large probable errors\u2019. Gottschalk (1948) discusses the question and shows that inthe special case where the bimodal distribution is symmetrical comparatively simple solutions can be found."

Persons3 employs the median of link relatives of monthly items, since by this device the influence of large non-seasonal variations may be greatly moderated.

The frequency distribution of any such component is usually assumed to be normal: hence the problem is one of resolution of a distribution into Gaussiain components. For a population of fish such an analysis has been found to be very helpful for population studies, particularly when determination of age of a fish is difficult. The frequency distribution of length obtained from a sample of fish is usually skew and polymnodal: in many cases, the modes correspond to individual age-groups and are very helpful for separating them. Buchanan-Wollaston and Hodgeson [1929] disapproved of the smoothing out of 'bumpy' distributions, as practiced by the early fishery biologists, even for small samples. They suggested that the individual 'humps' indicate meaningful modes around which normal curves ought to be fitted.

They suffer from aberrations due to rounding or truncation of the measurements, and their construction involves the crucial choice of the \"window size\", or smoothing parameter. In many circumstances estimators based on the empiric distribution function would be more suitable, and in this paper we investigate their properties. The estimators we introduce lead in a natural way to non-parametric forms of well-known parametric estimators. Their efficiency approaches 100 per cent as the distances between the component distributions increase."

For example, the sample space might be the outcomes of the roll of a die, or flips of a coin. To each element x of the sample space, we assign a probability, which will be a non-negative number between 0 and 1, which we will denote by p(x). We require that x\u2208S p(x) = 1, so the total probability of the elements of our sample space is 1. What this means intuitively is that when we perform our process, exactly one of the things in our sample space will happen. Example. The sample space could be S = {a, b, c}, and the probabilities could be p(a) = 1/2, p(b) = 1/3, p(c) = 1/6. If all elements of our sample space have equal probabilities, we call this the uniform probability distribution on our sample space. For example, if our sample space was the outcomes of a die roll, the sample space could be denoted S = {x 1 , x 2 ,. .. , x 6 }, where the event x i correspond to rolling i. The uniform distribution, in which every outcome x i has probability 1/6 describes the situation for a fair die. Similarly, if we consider tossing a fair coin, the outcomes would be H (heads) and T (tails), each with probability 1/2. In this situation we have the uniform probability distribution on the sample space S = {H, T }. We define an event A to be a subset of the sample space. For example, in the roll of a die, if the event A was rolling an even number, then A = {x 2 , x 4 , x 6 }. The probability of an event A, denoted by P(A), is the sum of the probabilities of the corresponding elements in the sample space. For rolling an even number, we have P(A) = p(x 2) + p(x 4) + p(x 6) = 1 2 Given an event A of our sample space, there is a complementary event which consists of all points in our sample space that are not \u2026"

Using the expressions for the moments of a sum of two typical laws of errors he arrived at a method of determining the constants of the two typical laws of errors. The method involved, however, the solution of a certain complicated algebraic equation of the ninth degree. Charlier 1 calls the carrying out of the solution according to Pearson's method \u201can heroic task\u201d. Charlier recommends (loc. cit.) a modified method of elimination which leads to two equations with two unknowns to be solved simultaneously. These equations involve one polynomial of the third degree in one unknown and the quotient of two other similar polynomials. Also this procedure is very laborious. Charlier remarks: \u201cthere is enough labour left to discourage an inquirer from operating a mathematical dissection of a given frequency curve\u201d."

                "text": "(1.) If measurements be made of the same part or organ in several hundred or thousand specimens of the same type or family, and a curve be constructed of which the abscissa x represents the size of the organ and the ordinate y the number of specimens falling within a definite small range \u03b4x of organ, this curve may be termed a frequency-curve . The centre or origin for measurement of the organ may, if we please, be taken at the mean of all the specimens measured. In this case the frequency-curve may be looked upon as one in which the frequency\u2014per thousand or per ten thousand, as the case may be\u2014of a given small range of deviations from the mean, is plotted up to the mean of that range. Such frequency-curves play a large part in the mathematical theory of evolution, and have been dealt with by Mr. F. Galton, Professor Weldon, and others. In most cases, as in the case of errors of observation, they have a fairly definite symmetrical shape and one that approaches with a close degree of approximation to the well-known error or probability-curve. A frequency-curve, which, for practical purposes, can be represented by the error curve, will for the remainder of this paper be termed a normal curve . When a series of measurements gives rise to a normal curve, we may probably assume something approaching a stable condition; there is production and destruction impartially round the mean. In the case of certain biological, sociological, and economic measurements there is, however, a well-marked deviation from this normal shape, and it becomes important to determine the direction and amount of such deviation. The asymmetry may arise from the fact that the units grouped together in the measured material are not really homogeneous. It may happen that we have a mixture of 2, 3, . . . n homogeneous groups, each of which deviates about its own mean symmetrically and in a manner represented with sufficient accuracy by the normal curve. Thus an abnormal frequency-curve may be really built up of normal curves having parallel but not necessarily coincident axes and different parameters. Even where the material is really homogeneous, but gives an abnormal frequency-curve the amount and direction of the abnormality will be indicated if this frequency-curve can be split up into normal curves. The object of the present paper is to discuss the dissection of abnormal frequency-curves into normal curves. The equations for the dissection of a frequency-curve into n normal curves can be written down in the same manner as for the special case of n = 2 treated in this paper; they require us only to calculate higher moments. But the analytical difficulties, even for the case of n = 2, are so considerable, that it may be questioned whether the general theory could ever be applied in practice to any numerical case. There are reasons, indeed, why the resolution into two is of special importance. A family probably breaks up first into two species, rather than three or more, owing to the pressure at a given time of some particular form of natural selection; in attempting to procure an absolutely homogeneous material, we are less likely to have got a mixture of three or more heterogeneous groups than of two only. Lastly, even where the heterogeneity may be threefold or more, the dissection into two is likely to give us, at any rate, an approximation to the two chief groups. In the case of homogeneous material, with an abnormal frequency-curve, dissection into two normal curves will generally give us the amount and direction of the chief abnormality. So much, then, may be said of the value of the special case dealt with here."

                "text": "1. The estimation of gene frequencies in a population is an important problem in human genetics and anthropology, especially where blood groups are concerned. Much work has already been done on this problem, notably by W. L. Stevens (1938), R. A. Fisher (1940, 1946), C. W. Cotterman (1947), D. J. Finney (1948a, b), W. C. Boyd (1954a, b ) , and others. Here we give a general procedure applicable (under very general conditions) both to samples of unrelated individuals and to families. This method is applied to data on blood groups collected from villages near the mouth of the River Po, in northern Italy, in the course of an investigation on microcythaemia (Bianco, Ceppellini, Silvestroni & Siniscalco, 1954). Experience shows that this new method of computation is reasonably rapid, except in the case of a rare, or fairly rare, recessive gene, or when such a gene is present in a series of alleles. It may also become laborious when there are complicated families and a system of several alleles; in this case, however, it seems possible to simplify the calculations, though with some sacrifice of information. Of course, in particular cases it may not be so rapid as methods specially designed for the case in question, as for example, Finney\u2019s (1948a, b ) methods when there are only two alleles concerned and the families contain at most two generations. The new method will be shown to be equivalent to maximum likelihood, and therefore fully efficient in the statistical sense. 2. We assume that the population under investigation is large, with random mating, and without difference of fitness between the different genotypes, or any other form of selection. Thus the Hardy-Weinberg rule will hold, and the gene frequencies will not change from one generation to the next. There is assumed to be complete manifestation, so that the observed phenotypes depend only on the genotypes, and not on environmental conditions. It is well known that these assumptions hold remarkably well for most blood groups and most populations, though slight deviations will be introduced by inbreeding and by incompatibility between foetus and mother. We must also assume that. the sample chosen is not biased with regard to the character whose frequency is to be estimated. Thus the families from the Po delta were selected by the presence of microcythaemia in one or both parents. Since so far no association has been found between microcythaemia and the blood groups, except possibly for a linkage with Lewis, and also possibly with the secretor character (Bianco et al. 1954), it seems reasonable to consider this as a random sample in so far as the blood groups are concerned. Of course a linkage will not of itself introduce any bias in a sample of completely unrelated families. In the case of the Italian data the populations concerned are small, and the families are accordingly related in a complicated manner. This will accordingly influence the estimates, though it will have the effect rather of slightly increasing their standard error than of introducing a bias in the estimated frequencies themselves; this caution must be borne in mind in interpreting the results given below."

                "text": "SUMMARY A NUMBER of alternative probability models are considered for the interpretation of failure data when there are two or more types of failure. Some of the statistical techniques that can be used for such data are illustrated on an example discussed recently by Mendenhall and Hader. Mendenhall and Hader (1958) have recently given an interesting account of a model for the analysis of failure-time distributions when there are two, or more, types of failure. They illustrate their theory by analysing some data on the failure-times of radio transmitter receivers; the failures were classed into two types, those confirmed on arrival at the maintenance centre and those unconfirmed. In the present paper their example is used to illustrate and distinguish between a number of models that can be used for this type of data. The essential feature of the problem is that we have independent individuals exposed to risk, and that on failure an individual is withdrawn from risk. We observe, for example, that individual number one fails after life-time t, and that the failure is say of the first type: this means that we know the time at which failure of the first type occurs, but only that failure of the second and other types had not occurred by time t. In many applications, including Mendenhall and Hader's, the sample contains individuals that have not failed at the end of the period of the observation. Thus in their example no receivers were operated after 630 hr. Data like this arise in several fields in addition to industrial life-testing. For example, in medical and actuarial work the estimation and comparison of death rates from a particular cause requires corrections for deaths from other causes. In particular Seal (1954) and Elveback (1958) have discussed the more theoretical aspects of this in connection with actuarial work and given numerous references. Sampford (1954) has dealt with similar problems in bioassays. In tensile strength testing there may be two or more types of failure, for example jaw breaks and fractures in the centre of the test specimen; here the observation is load on failure, not life on failure. A further interesting application is in experimental psychology. Audley (1957) has interpreted latency measurements in learning experiments by postulating independent Poisson processes of A-responses and B-responses; the first process for which an event occurs is considered to determine the nature (A or B) of the response and the time at which it occurs."

This article approaches this problem by assuming that nature chooses between regimes with probabilities \u03bb and 1 \u2014 \u03bb. This allows formulation of the appropriate likelihood function maximized with respect to the parameters in the regression equations and \u03bb. The method is compared to another recent procedure in some sampling experiments and in a realistic economic problem and is found satisfactory."

Thiele are particularly suited for solving the problem of dissecting a given frequency curve into components. Burrau loc. cit. p. 3 gives the relations between the five first half-invariants and the constants of the component typical error laws. The problem with which we shall be concerned in the present paper is to find a convenient way of solving Burrau's equations for the unknown constants. A procedure for solving the equations is worked out in sections 2, 3, 4 and 5. The formulae necessary for practical applications are collected in section 6. In section 7 a few examples are given to illustrate the method. The possibilities of application and the limitation of the moment and half-invariant methods are discussed in section 8. Section 9 contains a number of diagrams and tables referred to in the text."

We shall show how to estimate the magnitude of the various effects represented in pathdiagram models that include both the manifestand latent variables, and also how to test whether this kind of path-diagram model is congruent with the observed data. These methods can be applied in order to analyze data obtained in various kinds of surveys (including panel studies), and also in order to construct tests and indices for purposes of measurement and prediction. To illustrate their wide applicability and flexibility, we shall use these methods to reanalyze several different sets of data which were analyzed earlier by Coleman (1964), Lazarsfeld (1948, 1970), Goodman (1973a), and others. Except for some related conclusions in Goodman (1973a), the methods introduced herein lead to conclusions that are very different from those presented by the other researchers who had analyzed these data earlier."

Utilizing these distribution results, some efficient statistical procedures such as the maximum likelihood (ML) method are introduced for estimating the number of genes and the effects of genes. The methods and the techniques developed are then applied to analyze Shakudo's data of panicle length of rice and Goodwin's data of flowering time of Solidag sempervirens L. These numerical examples seem to indicate that the present approach is useful and desirable; it extracts more information from limited data than by using the classical approaches."
