                "text": "Iterative alignment is one method for feature-based matching of an image and a model for the purpose of object recognition. The method alternately hypothesizes feature pairings and estimates a viewpoint transformation from those pairings; at each stage a refined transformation estimate is used to suggest additional pairings. This paper extends iterative alignment in the domain of 2D similarity transformations so that it represents the uncertainty in the position of each model and image feature, and that of the transformation estimate. A model describes probabilistically the significance, position, and intrinsic attributes of each feature, plus topological relations among features. A measure of the match between a model and an image integrates all four of these, and leads to an efficient matching procedure called probabilistic alignment. That procedure supports both recognition and a learning procedure for acquiring models from training images. By explicitly representing uncertainty, one model can satisfactorily describe appearance over a wider range of viewing conditions. Thus, when models represent 2D characteristic views of a 3D object, fewer models are needed. Experiments demonstrating the effectiveness of this approach are reported."

The approach adopted owes much to the work of Grenander and colleagues at Brown University on pattern analysis and involves designing stochastic deformable templates for objects in the underlying image scenes. A wide range of realistic object poses can be captured by imposing a prior probability distribution over the space of allowable deformations. We show how hierarchical models can be used to organize the prior information into a coherent structure. Markov chain Monte Carlo methods are exploited to recover the deformation given observed image data."

The scenes are analyzed by the recognition of the objects present and by the determination of their occlusion relations. Objects are internally represented by stored model graphs. These are formed in a semi-automatic way by showing objects against a varying background. Objects are recognized by dynamic link matching. Our experiments show that our system is very successful in analyzing cluttered scenes. The system architecture goes beyond classical neural networks by making extensive use of flexible links between units, as proposed in the dynamic link architecture. The present implementation is, however, rather algorithmic in style and is to be regarded as a pilot study that is preparing the way for a detailed implementation of the architecture."

The dynamic link architecture exploits correlations in the fine-scale temporal structure of cellular signals to group neurons dynamically into higher-order entities. These entities represent a rich structure and can code for high-level objects. To demonstrate the capabilities of the dynamic link architecture, a program was implemented that can recognize human faces and other objects from video images. Memorized objects are represented by sparse graphs, whose vertices are labeled by a multiresolution description in terms of a local power spectrum, and whose edges are labeled by geometrical distance vectors. Object recognition can be formulated as elastic graph matching, which is performed here by stochastic optimization of a matching cost function. The implementation on a transputer network achieved recognition of human faces and office objects from gray-level camera images. The performance of the program is evaluated by a statistical analysis of recognition results from a portrait gallery comprising images of 87 persons. >"

This approach goes beyond edge-based and area-based approaches by using a richer image description and incorporating several stereo cues that previously have been neglected in the computer vision literature. A technique based on using the pseudo-inverse is presented for characterizing the information present in a vector of filter responses. We show how in our framework viewing geometry can be recovered to determine the locations of epipolar lines. An assumption that visible surfaces in the scene are piecewise smooth leads to differential treatment of image regions corresponding to binocularly visible surfaces, surface boundaries, and occluded regions that are only monocularly visible. The constraints imposed by viewing geometry and piecewise smoothness are incorporated into an iterative algorithm that gives good results on random-dot stereograms, artificially generated scenes, and natural grey-level images."

The computational approach taken in this system is motivated by both physiology and information theory, as well as by the practical requirements of near-real-time performance and accuracy. Our approach treats the face recognition problem as an intrinsically two-dimensional (2-D) recognition problem rather than requiring recovery of three-dimensional geometry, taking advantage of the fact that faces are normally upright and thus may be described by a small set of 2-D characteristic views. The system functions by projecting face images onto a feature space that spans the significant variations among known face images. The significant features are known as \"eigenfaces,\" because they are the eigenvectors (principal components) of the set of faces; they do not necessarily correspond to features such as eyes, ears, and noses. The projection operation characterizes an individual face by a weighted sum of the eigenface features, and so to recognize a particular face it is necessary only to compare these weights to those of known individuals. Some particular advantages of our approach are that it provides for the ability to learn and later recognize new faces in an unsupervised manner, and that it is easy to implement using a neural network architecture."

A retinally connected neural network examines small windows of an image, and decides whether each window contains a face. The system arbitrates between multiple networks to improve performance over a single network. We use a bootstrap algorithm for training, which adds false detections into the training set as training progresses. This eliminates the difficult task of manually selecting non-face training examples, which must be chosen to span the entire space of non-face images. Comparisons with another state-of-the-art face detection system are presented; our system has better performance in terms of detection and false-positive rates."

Multivariate analyses of samples for all the usual scientific purposes - description of mean shapes, of shape variation, and of the covariation of shape with size, group, or other causes or effects - may be carried out very effectively in the tangent space to David Kendall's shape space at the Procrustes average shape. For biometric interpretation of such analyses, we need a basis for the tangent space that is Procrustes-orthonormal, and we need graphics for visualizing mean shape differences and other segments and vectors there; both of these needs are managed by the thin-plate spline. The spline also links the biometrics of landmarks to deformation analysis of curves in the images from which the landmarks originally arose. This article reviews the principal tools of this synthesis in a typical study design involving landmarks and edge information from a microfossil."

It starts with a definition of \"shape\" for a set of k points in m dimensions. The first task is to identify the shape spaces in which such objects naturally live, and then to examine the probability structures induced on such a shape space by corresponding structures in Rm. Against this theoretical background one formulates and solves statistical problems concerned with shape characteristics of empirical sets of points. Some applications (briefly sketched here) are to archeology, astronomy, geography and physical chemistry. We also outline more recent work on \"size-and-shape,\" on shapes of sets of points in riemannian spaces, and on shape-theoretic aspects of random Delaunay tessellations."

                "text": "Biometric studies of the forms of organisms usually consider size and shape variations in the geometric configuration of landmarks, points that correspond biologically from form to form. The size variables may be usefully considered the linear vector space spanned by the set of all distances between pairs of landmarks. The shape of a single triangle AABC of landmarks may be reduced to a single pair of shape coordinates locating the vertex C in the coordinate system with landmark A sent to (0,O) and landmark B to (1,O). A useful space of shape variables is the span of all such shape coordinate pairs for various triples of landmarks. On a convenient null model of identical circular normal perturbations at each landmark independently, one size variable S , which may be taken as the mean square of all the interlandmark distances, has covariance zero with every shape variable. Then associations between shape and size may be tested by the F ratio for multiple regression of S on any basis for shape space. For a single triangle of landmarks, the existence of any mean difference or mean change in shape may be tested by Hotelling's T 2 applied to any pair of shape coordinates for that triangle. When such a difference is statistically significant, it may be interpreted as the ratio of a pair of size variables measured along directions a t an angle averaging 90\" in the samples of forms. One size variable will bear the greatest mean rate or ratio of change between the forms, the other the least. Analysis of configurations of more than three landmarks reduces to consideration of size variables involving at most three landmarks. These techniques are demonstrated in a study of the growth of the head in 62 normal Ann Arbor youth. Each comparison of interest is summarized in its own orthogonal coordinate system, the biorthogonal grid pair."

When m = 1, we find that Y\\ = S k ~ 2 ; when m ^ 3, the shape-space contains singularities. This paper deals mainly with the case m = 2, when the shape-space I* ca n be identified with a version of CP*~ 2 . Of special importance are the shape-measures induced on CP k ~ 2 by any assigned diffuse law of distribution for the k vertices. We determine several such shape-measures, we resolve some of the technical problems associated with the graphic presentation and statistical analysis of empirical shape distributions, and among applications we discuss the relevance of these ideas to testing for the presence of non-accidental multiple alignments in collections of (i) neolithic stone monuments and (ii) quasars. Finally the recently introduced Ambartzumian density is examined from the present point of view, its norming constant is found, and its connexion with random Crofton polygons is established."

The shape density is written in a closed form, in terms of Kendall's or Bookstein's shape variables. The distribution simplifies considerably in certain cases, including the complex normal, isotropic, circular Markov and equal means cases. Various asymptotic properties of the distribution are investigated, including a large variation distribution and the normal approximation for small variations. The triangle case is considered in particular detail, and we compare the density with simulated densities for some examples. Finally, we consider inference problems, with an application in biology."
