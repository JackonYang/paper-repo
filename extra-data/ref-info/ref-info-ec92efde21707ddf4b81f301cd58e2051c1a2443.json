This \"overfitting\" is greatly reduced by randomly omitting half of the feature detectors on each training case. This prevents complex co-adaptations in which a feature detector is only helpful in the context of several other specific feature detectors. Instead, each neuron learns to detect a feature that is generally helpful for producing the correct answer given the combinatorially large variety of internal contexts in which it must operate. Random \"dropout\" gives big improvements on many benchmark tasks and sets new records for speech and object recognition."

Ideally, this is achieved by training on very large (infinite) training data sets that capture all variations in the data distribution. In the case of finite training data, an effective solution is to extend the training set with artificially created examples--which, however, is also computationally costly. We propose to corrupt training examples with noise from known distributions within the exponential family and present a novel learning algorithm, called marginalized corrupted features (MCF), that trains robust predictors by minimizing the expected value of the loss function under the corrupting distribution-- essentially learning with infinitely many (corrupted) training examples. We show empirically on a variety of data sets that MCF classifiers can be trained efficiently, may generalize substantially better to test data, and are more robust to feature deletion at test time."

Previous work has shown that such training with noise is equivalent to a form of regularization in which an extra term is added to the error function. However, the regularization term, which involves second derivatives of the error function, is not bounded below, and so can lead to difficulties if used directly in a learning algorithm based on error minimization. In this paper we show that for the purposes of network training, the regularization term can be reduced to a positive semi-definite form that involves only first derivatives of the network mapping. For a sum-of-squares error function, the regularization term belongs to the class of generalized Tikhonov regularizers. Direct minimization of the regularized error function provides a practical alternative to training with noise."

But training involves complex trade-offs among weights, which can be dangerous: a few highly-indicative features can swamp the contribution of many individually weaker features, causing their weights to be undertrained. Such a model is less robust, for the highly-indicative features may be noisy or missing in the test data. To ameliorate this weight undertraining, we introduce several new feature bagging methods, in which separate models are trained on subsets of the original features, and combined using a mixture model or a product of experts. These methods include the logarithmic opinion pools used by Smith et al. (2005). We evaluate feature bagging on linear-chain conditional random fields for two natural-language tasks. On both tasks, the feature-bagged CRF performs better than simply training a single CRF on all the features."

On the test data, we achieved top-1 and top-5 error rates of 37.5% and 17.0%, respectively, which is considerably better than the previous state-of-the-art. The neural network, which has 60 million parameters and 650,000 neurons, consists of five convolutional layers, some of which are followed by max-pooling layers, and three fully connected layers with a final 1000-way softmax. To make training faster, we used non-saturating neurons and a very efficient GPU implementation of the convolution operation. To reduce overfitting in the fully connected layers we employed a recently developed regularization method called \"dropout\" that proved to be very effective. We also entered a variant of this model in the ILSVRC-2012 competition and achieved a winning top-5 test error rate of 15.3%, compared to 26.2% achieved by the second-best entry."

If the amount of data and computational resources are near infinite, many algorithmes will probably converge to the optimal solution. When this is not the case, one has to introduce regularizers and a-priori knowledge to supplement the available data in order to boost the performance. Invariance (or known dependance) with respect to transformation of the input is a frequent occurrence of such an a-priori knowledge. In this chapter, we introduce the concept of tangent vectors, which compactly represent the essence of these transformation invariances, and two classes of algorithms, \u201cTangent distance\u201d and \u2018Tangent propagation\u201d, which make use of these invariances to improve performance."

First, it is argued that the output of a classifier should be obtained by marginalizing over the posterior distribution of the parameters; a simple approximation to this integral is proposed and demonstrated. This involves a \"moderation\" of the most probable classifier's outputs, and yields improved performance. Second, it is demonstrated that the Bayesian framework for model comparison described for regression models in MacKay (1992a,b) can also be applied to classification problems. This framework successfully chooses the magnitude of weight decay terms, and ranks solutions found using different numbers of hidden units. Third, an information-based data selection criterion is derived and demonstrated within this framework."

Our method learns vector space representations for multi-word phrases. In sentiment prediction tasks these representations outperform other state-of-the-art approaches on commonly used datasets, such as movie reviews, without using any pre-defined sentiment lexica or polarity shifting rules. We also evaluate the model's ability to predict sentiment distributions on a new dataset based on confessions from the experience project. The dataset consists of personal user stories annotated with multiple labels which, when aggregated, form a multinomial distribution that captures emotional reactions. Our algorithm can more accurately predict distributions over such labels compared to several competitive baselines."

The standard approach to regularising CRFs involves a prior distribution over the model parameters, typically requiring search over a hyperparameter space. In this paper we address the overfitting problem from a different perspective, by factoring the CRF distribution into a weighted product of individual \"expert\" CRF distributions. We call this model a logarithmic opinion pool (LOP) of CRFs (LOP-CRFs). We apply the LOP-CRF to two sequencing tasks. Our results show that unregularised expert CRFs with an unregularised CRF under a LOP can outperform the unregularised CRF, and attain a performance level close to the regularised CRF. LOP-CRFs therefore provide a viable alternative to CRF regularisation without the need for hyperparameter search."

Two types of bounding processes are used: perfectly dependent normal variables, and independent normal variables, both with arbitrary mean values. The expected maximum for the perfectly dependent variables can be evaluated in closed form; for the independent variables, a single numerical integration is required. Higher moments are also available. We use mathematical programming to find parameters for the processes, so they will give bounds on the expected maximum, rather than approximations of unknown accuracy. Our original application is to the maximum number of people on-line simultaneously during the day in an infinite-server queue with a time-varying arrival rate. The upper and lower bounds are tighter than previous bounds, and in many of our examples are within 5% or 10% of each other.

We present a model that uses a mix of unsupervised and supervised techniques to learn word vectors capturing semantic term--document information as well as rich sentiment content. The proposed model can leverage both continuous and multi-dimensional sentiment information as well as non-sentiment annotations. We instantiate the model to utilize the document-level sentiment polarity annotations present in many online documents (e.g. star ratings). We evaluate the model using small, widely used sentiment and subjectivity corpora and find it out-performs several previously introduced methods for sentiment classification. We also introduce a large dataset of movie reviews to serve as a more robust benchmark for work in this area."

Subjective sentences often contain words which reverse the sentiment polarities of other words. Therefore, interactions between words need to be considered in sentiment classification, which is difficult to be handled with simple bag-of-words approaches, and the syntactic dependency structures of subjective sentences are exploited in our method. In the method, the sentiment polarity of each dependency subtree in a sentence, which is not observable in training data, is represented by a hidden variable. The polarity of the whole sentence is calculated in consideration of interactions between the hidden variables. Sum-product belief propagation is used for inference. Experimental results of sentiment classification for Japanese and English subjective sentences showed that the method performs better than other methods based on bag-of-features."
