This book examines the measurement of this movement and the use of relative movement to locate the boundaries of physical objects in the environment. It investigates the nature of the computations that are necessary to perform this analysis by any vision system, biological or artificial. \nThe author first defines the goals of these visual tasks, reveals the properties of the physical world that a vision system can rely upon to achieve such goals, and suggests general methods that can be used to carry out the tasks. From the general methods, she designs algorithms specifying a particular sequence of computations that a vision system can execute to perform these visual tasks. These algorithms are implemented on a computer system under a variety of circumstances. Combined with the traditional approaches of psychology and neurophysiology, this computational approach provides an exciting analysis of visual function, raising many new questions about the human vision system for further investigation. \nEllen Catherine Hildreth received her doctorate from MIT. She is a Research Scientist in the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory and associate director of theCenter for Biological Information Processing at the Whitaker College of Health Sciences, Technology, and Management. The Measurement of Visual Motion is an ACM Distinguished Dissertation."

The question addressed is how the three dimensional structure and motion of objects can be inferred from the two dimensional transformations of their projected images when no three dimensional information is conveyed by the individual projections. The following scheme is proposed: (i) divide the image into groups of four elements each; (ii) test each group for a rigid interpretation; (iii) combine the results obtained in (ii). It is shown that this scheme will correctly decompose scenes containing arbitrary rigid objects in motion, recovering their three dimensional structure and motion. The analysis is based primarily on the \u02bbstructure from motion\u2019 theorem which states that the structure of four non-coplanar points is recoverable from three orthographic projections. The interpretation scheme is extended to cover perspective projections, and its psychological relevance is discussed."

The content- addressable memory and other emergent collective properties of the original model also are present in the graded response model. The idea that such collective properties are used in biological systems is given added credence by the continued presence of such properties for more nearly biological \"neurons.\" Collective analog electrical circuits of the kind described will certainly function. The collective states of the two models have a simple correspondence. The original model will continue to be useful for simulations, because its connection to graded response systems is established.
