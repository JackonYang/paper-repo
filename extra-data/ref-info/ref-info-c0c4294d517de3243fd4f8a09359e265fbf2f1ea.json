It is performed by three steps: edge detection, text candidate detection and text refinement detection. Firstly, it applies edge detection to get four edge maps in horizontal, vertical, up-right, and up-left direction. Secondly, the feature is extracted from four edge maps to represent the texture property of text. Then k-means algorithm is applied to detect the initial text candidates. Finally, the text areas are identified by the empirical rules analysis and refined through project profile analysis. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach could efficiently be used as an automatic text detection system, which is robust for font size, font color, background complexity and language."

In this paper, we present a novel technique for detecting both graphic text and scene text in video images by finding segments containing text in an input image and then using statistical features such as vertical and horizontal bars for edges in the segments for detecting true text blocks efficiently. To identify a segment containing text, heuristic rules are formed based on combination of filters and edge analysis. Furthermore, the same rules are extended to grow the boundaries of a candidate segment in order to include complete text in the input image. The experimental results of the proposed method show that the technique performs better than existing methods in terms of a number of metrics."

In the first stage text regions are detected based on the edge map of the image leading in a high recall rate with minimum computation requirements. In the sequel, a refinement stage uses an SVM classifier trained on features obtained by a new local binary pattern based operator which results in diminishing false alarms. Experimental results show the overall performance of the system that proves the discriminating ability of the proposed feature set."

Local energy analysis has been shown to work well in text detection, where remarkable local energy variations of pixels correspond to text region or boundary of other objects and lower local energy variations of pixels correspond to background or the interior of non-text objects. Local energy variation is calculated in a local region based on the wavelet transform coefficients of images. Hybrid Chinese/English text in images and video frames can be detected whether it is aligned horizontally or vertically. The font size of text to be detected may vary in a wide range of values. The proposed method has been tested on 321 frame images obtained from local TV programs and a tested dataset with low missed rate and false alarm rate."

Most video text detection and extraction methods hold assumptions on text color, background contrast, and font style. Moreover, few methods can handle multilingual text well since different languages may have quite different appearances. This paper performs a detailed analysis of multilingual text characteristics, including English and Chinese. Based on the analysis, we propose a comprehensive, efficient video text detection, localization, and extraction method, which emphasizes the multilingual capability over the whole processing. The proposed method is also robust to various background complexities and text appearances. The text detection is carried out by edge detection, local thresholding, and hysteresis edge recovery. The coarse-to-fine localization scheme is then performed to identify text regions accurately. The text extraction consists of adaptive thresholding, dam point labeling, and inward filling. Experimental results on a large number of video images and comparisons with other methods are reported in detail."

No external texture feature extraction module is used, but rather the intensities of the raw pixels that make up the textural pattern are fed directly to the SVM, which works well even in high-dimensional spaces. Next, text regions are identified by applying a continuously adaptive mean shift algorithm (CAMSHIFT) to the results of the texture analysis. The combination of CAMSHIFT and SVMs produces both robust and efficient text detection, as time-consuming texture analyses for less relevant pixels are restricted, leaving only a small part of the input image to be texture-analyzed."

It was observed that when a row of pixels across such a text region is clustered in perceptually uniform L*a*b* color space, the pixels of one of these clusters would belong to the text strokes. These pixels would appeal as a line of short streaks on the row since a typical text region has many vertical and diagonal strokes. The proposed method examines every third row of the the image and checks whether this row passes through a horizontal text region. For a given row R, the pixels of R are hierarchically clustered in L*a*b* space and each cluster is tested whether similar-colored pixels in R's vicinity are possibly part of a text region. Candidate text blocks are marked by heuristics using information about the cluster's line of shell streaks. The detected text blocks are fused with the text regions. The method was tested on key frames of several video sequences and was able to locate a wide variety of text."

However, there is still a lack of performance evaluation protocols for video text detection. In this paper, we propose an objective and comprehensive performance evaluation protocol for video text detection algorithms. The protocol includes a positive set and a negative set of indices at the textbox level, which evaluate the detection quality in terms of both location accuracy and fragmentation of the detected textboxes. In the protocol, we assign a detection difficulty (DD) level to each ground truth textbox. The performance indices can then be normalized with respect to the textbox DD level and are therefore tolerant to different ground-truth difficulties to a certain degree. We also assign a detectability index (DI) value to each ground-truth textbox. The overall detection rate is the DI-weighted average of the detection qualities of all ground-truth textboxes, which makes the detection rate more accurate to reveal the real performance. The automatic performance evaluation scheme has been applied to performance evaluation of a text detection approach to determine the best thresholds that can yield the best detection results. The protocol has also been employed to compare the performances of several text detection systems. Hence, we believe that the proposed protocol can be used to compare the performance of different video/image text detection algorithms/systems and can even help improve, select, and design new text detection methods."
