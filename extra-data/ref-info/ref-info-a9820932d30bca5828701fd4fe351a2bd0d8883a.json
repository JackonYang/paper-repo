The combinatorial optimization literature provides many min-cut/max-flow algorithms with different polynomial time complexity. Their practical efficiency, however, has to date been studied mainly outside the scope of computer vision. The goal of this paper is to provide an experimental comparison of the efficiency of min-cut/max flow algorithms for applications in vision. We compare the running times of several standard algorithms, as well as a new algorithm that we have recently developed. The algorithms we study include both Goldberg-Tarjan style \"push -relabel\" methods and algorithms based on Ford-Fulkerson style \"augmenting paths.\" We benchmark these algorithms on a number of typical graphs in the contexts of image restoration, stereo, and segmentation. In many cases, our new algorithm works several times faster than any of the other methods, making near real-time performance possible. An implementation of our max-flow/min-cut algorithm is available upon request for research purposes."

                "text": "Algorithms for discrete energy minimization play a fundamental role for low-level vision. Known techniques include graph cuts, belief propagation (BP) and recently introduced tree-reweighted message passing (TRW). So far, the standard benchmark for their comparison has been a 4-connected grid-graph arising in pixel-labelling stereo. This minimization problem, however, has been largely solved: recent work shows that for many scenes TRW finds the global optimum. Furthermore, it is known that a 4-connected grid-graph is a poor stereo model since it does not take occlusions into account. \n \nWe propose the problem of stereo with occlusions as a new test bed for minimization algorithms. This is a more challenging graph since it has much larger connectivity, and it also serves as a better stereo model. An attractive feature of this problem is that increased connectivity does not result in increased complexity of message passing algorithms. Indeed, one contribution of this paper is to show that sophisticated implementations of BP and TRW have the same time and memory complexity as that of 4-connected grid-graph stereo. \n \nThe main conclusion of our experimental study is that for our problem graph cut outperforms both TRW and BP considerably. TRW achieves consistently a lower energy than BP. However, as connectivity increases the speed of convergence of TRW becomes slower. Unlike 4-connected grids, the difference between the energy of the best optimization method and the lower bound of TRW appears significant. This shows the hardness of the problem and motivates future research."

A promising graph cut based approach for optimizing such MRFs known as \"roof duality\" was recently introduced into computer vision. We study two methods which extend this approach. First, we discuss an efficient implementation of the \"probing\" technique introduced recently by Bows et al. (2006). It simplifies the MRF while preserving the global optimum. Our code is 400-700 faster on some graphs than the implementation of the work of Bows et al. (2006). Second, we present a new technique which takes an arbitrary input labeling and tries to improve its energy. We give theoretical characterizations of local minima of this procedure. We applied both techniques to many applications, including image segmentation, new view synthesis, super-resolution, diagram recognition, parameter learning, texture restoration, and image deconvolution. For several applications we see that we are able to find the global minimum very efficiently, and considerably outperform the original roof duality approach. In comparison to existing techniques, such as graph cut, TRW, BP, ICM, and simulated annealing, we nearly always find a lower energy."

Perhaps the most successful example is stereo vision. For the stereo problem, it has been shown that finding the global optimum is NP hard but good results have been obtained using a number of approximate optimization algorithms. In this paper, we show that for standard benchmark stereo pairs, the global optimum can be found in about 30 minutes using a variant of the belief propagation (BP) algorithm. We extend previous theoretical results on reweighted belief propagation to account for possible ties in the beliefs and using these results we obtain easily checkable conditions that guarantee that the BP disparities are the global optima. We verify experimentally that these conditions are typically met for the standard benchmark stereo pairs and discuss the implications of our results for further progress in stereo."

(Nov. 2005)- tree-reweighted max-product message passing (TRW). It was inspired by the problem of maximizing a lower bound on the energy. However, the algorithm is not guaranteed to increase this bound - it may actually go down. In addition, TRW does not always converge. We develop a modification of this algorithm which we call sequential tree-reweighted message passing. Its main property is that the bound is guaranteed not to decrease. We also give a weak tree agreement condition which characterizes local maxima of the bound with respect to TRW algorithms. We prove that our algorithm has a limit point that achieves weak tree agreement. Finally, we show that, our algorithm requires half as much memory as traditional message passing approaches. Experimental results demonstrate that on certain synthetic and real problems, our algorithm outperforms both the ordinary belief propagation and tree-reweighted algorithm in (M. J. Wainwright, et al., Nov. 2005). In addition, on stereo problems with Potts interactions, we obtain a lower energy than graph cuts"

In such problems, the objective is to minimize the deviation cost function that depends on the distance between the observed value and the modify value. In Markov random field problems, there is also a pairwise relationship between the objects. The objective in Markov random field problem is to minimize the sum of the deviation cost function and a penalty function that grows with the distance between the values of related pairs---separation function.We discuss Markov random fields problems in the context of a representative application---the image segmentation problem. In this problem, the goal is to modify color shades assigned to pixels of an image so that the penalty function consisting of one term due to the deviation from the initial color shade and a second term that penalizes differences in assigned values to neighboring pixels is minimized. We present here an algorithm that solves the problem in polynomial time when the deviation function is convex and separation function is linear; and in strongly polynomial time when the deviation cost function is linear, quadratic or piecewise linear convex with few pieces (where &quote;few&quote; means a number exponential in a polynomial function of the number of variables and constraints). The complexity of the algorithm for a problem on n pixels or variables, m adjacency relations or constraints, and range of variable values (colors) U, is O(T(n,m) + n log U) where T(n,m) is the complexity of solving the minimum s, t cut problem on a graph with n nodes and m arcs. Furthermore, other algorithms are shown to solve the problem with convex deviation and convex separation in running time O(mn log n log nU) and the problem with nonconvex deviation and convex separation in running time O(T(nU, mU). The nonconvex separation problem is NP-hard even for fixed value of U.For the family of problems with convex deviation functions and linear separation function, the algorithm described here runs in polynomial time which is demonstrated to be fastest possible."

Progress in problems such as stereo correspondence, image segmentation, etc., can be attributed, in part, to the development of efficient graph cut based optimization. Recent evaluation of optimization techniques shows that the popular expansion and swap graph cut algorithms perform extremely well for energies where the underlying MRF has the Potts prior, which corresponds to the assumption that the true labeling is piecewise constant. For more general priors, however, such as corresponding to piece-wise smoothness assumption, both swap and expansion algorithms do not perform as well. We develop several optimization algorithms for truncated convex priors, which imply piecewise smoothness assumption. Both expansion and swap algorithms are based on moves that give each pixel a choice of only two labels. Our insight is that to obtain a good approximation under piecewise smoothness assumption, a pixel should have a choice among more than two labels. We develop new \"range\" moves which act on a larger set of labels than the expansion and swap algorithms. We evaluate our method on problems of image restoration, in-painting, and stereo correspondence. Our results show that we are able to get more accurate answers, both in terms of the energy, which is the direct goal, and in terms of accuracy, which is an indirect, but more important goal."

Numerous applications in computer vision can be naturally interpreted as instanciations of this fundamental problem. Recently, a non-iterative discrete approach, tensor voting, has been introduced to solve this problem and has been applied successfully to various applications. As an alternative, we propose a variational formulation of this problem in the continuous setting and derive an iterative algorithm which approximates its solutions. This method and tensor voting are somewhat the differential and integral form of one another. Although iterative methods are slower in general, the strength of the suggested method is that it can easily be applied when the ambient space is not Euclidean, which is important in many applications. The algorithm consists in solving a partial differential equation that performs a special anisotropic diffusion on an implicit representation of the known set of points. This results in connecting isolated neighbouring points. This approach is very simple, mathematically sound, robust and powerful since it handles in a homogeneous way manifolds of arbitrary dimension and topology, embedded in Euclidean or non-Euclidean spaces, with or without border. We shall present this approach and demonstrate both its benefits and shortcomings in two different contexts: (i) data visual analysis, (ii) skin detection in color images."

For such problems, the Gibbs sampler provides a general solution but is very slow, while other methods, such as Ncut and graph cuts are computationally effective but only work for specific energy forms and are not generally applicable. In this paper, we present a new inference algorithm that generalizes the Swendsen-Wang method to arbitrary probabilities defined on graph partitions. We begin by computing graph edge weights, based on local image features. Then, the algorithm iterates two steps: (1) graph clustering - it forms connected components by cutting the edges probabilistically based on their weights; (2) graph relabeling - it selects one connected component and flips probabilistically, the coloring of all vertices in the component simultaneously. Thus, it realizes the split, merge, and regrouping of a \"chunk\" of the graph, in contrast to Gibbs sampler that flips a single vertex. We prove that this algorithm simulates ergodic and reversible Markov chain jumps in the space of graph partitions and is applicable to arbitrary posterior probabilities or energy functions defined on graphs. We demonstrate the algorithm on two typical problems in computer vision-image segmentation and stereo vision. Experimentally, we show that it is 100-400 times faster in CPU time than the classical Gibbs sampler and 20-40 times faster then the DDMCMC segmentation algorithm. For stereo, we compare performance with graph cuts and belief propagation. We also show that our algorithm can automatically infer generative models and obtain satisfactory results (better than the graphic cuts or belief propagation) in the same amount of time."

Multi-camera scene reconstruction is a natural generalization of the stereo matching problem. However, it is much more difficult than stereo, primarily due to the difficulty of reasoning about visibility. In this paper, we take an approach that has yielded excellent results for stereo, namely energy minimization via graph cuts. We first give an energy minimization formulation of the multi-camera scene reconstruction problem. The energy that we minimize treats the input images symmetrically, handles visibility properly, and imposes spatial smoothness while preserving discontinuities. As the energy function is NP-hard to minimize exactly, we give a graph cut algorithm that computes a local minimum in a strong sense. We handle all camera configurations where voxel coloring can be used, which is a large and natural class. Experimental data demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach."

We show how this algorithm can be used to efficiently compute MAP solutions for certain dynamically changing MRF models in computer vision such as image segmentation. Specifically, given the solution of the max-flow problem on a graph, the dynamic algorithm efficiently computes the maximum flow in a modified version of the graph. The time taken by it is roughly proportional to the total amount of change in the edge weights of the graph. Our experiments show that, when the number of changes in the graph is small, the dynamic algorithm is significantly faster than the best known static graph cut algorithm. We test the performance of our algorithm on one particular problem: the object-background segmentation problem for video. It should be noted that the application of our algorithm is not limited to the above problem, the algorithm is generic and can be used to yield similar improvements in many other cases that involve dynamic change."

An important component of an MRF-based approach is the inference algorithm used to find the most likely setting of each node in the MRF. Algorithms have been proposed which use graph cuts or belief propagation for inference. These stereo algorithms differ in both the inference algorithm used and the formulation of the MRF. It is unknown whether to attribute the responsibility for differences in performance to the MRF or the inference algorithm. We address this through controlled experiments by comparing the belief propagation algorithm and the graph cuts algorithm on the same MRF's, which have been created for calculating stereo disparities. We find that the labellings produced by the two algorithms are comparable. The solutions produced by graph cuts have a lower energy than those produced with belief propagation, but this does not necessarily lead to increased performance relative to the ground truth."

The proposed framework utilizes tools from the duality theory of linear programming in order to provide an alternative and more general view of state-of-the-art techniques like the alpha-expansion algorithm, which is included merely as a special case. Moreover, contrary to alpha-expansion, the derived algorithms generate solutions with guaranteed optimality properties for a much wider class of problems, for example, even for MRFs with nonmetric potentials. In addition, they are capable of providing per-instance suboptimality bounds in all occasions, including discrete MRFs with an arbitrary potential function. These bounds prove to be very tight in practice (that is, very close to 1), which means that the resulting solutions are almost optimal. Our algorithms' effectiveness is demonstrated by presenting experimental results on a variety of low-level vision tasks, such as stereo matching, image restoration, image completion, and optical flow estimation, as well as on synthetic problems."

We show that the maximum a posteriori estimate of such an MRF can be obtained by solving a multiway minimum cut problem on a graph. We develop efficient algorithms for computing good approximations to the minimum multiway, cut. The visual correspondence problem can be formulated as an MRF in our framework; this yields quite promising results on real data with ground truth. We also apply our techniques to MRFs with linear clique potentials."

Unlike conventional correlation matching and feature matching, the method provides a dense array of disparities, eliminating the need for interpolation. First, the stereo-matching problem is defined in terms of finding a disparity map that satisfies two competing constraints: (1) matched points should have similar image intensity, and (2) the disparity map should vary as slowly as possible. These constraints are interpreted as specifying the potential energy of a system of oscillators. Ground states are approximated by a new variant of simulated annealing, which has two important features. First, the microcanonical ensemble is simulated using a new algorithm that is more efficient and more easily implemented than the familiar Metropolis algorithm (which simulates the canonical ensemble). Secondly, it uses a hierarchical, coarse-to-fine control structure employing Gaussian or Laplacian pyramids of the stereo images. In this way, quickly computed results at low resolutions are used to initialize the system at higher resolutions."

We generate a synthetic world of scenes and their corresponding rendered images, modeling their relationships with a Markov network. Bayesian belief propagation allows us to efficiently find a local maximum of the posterior probability for the scene, given an image. We call this approach VISTA\u2014Vision by Image/Scene TrAining.We apply VISTA to the \u201csuper-resolution\u201d problem (estimating high frequency details from a low-resolution image), showing good results. To illustrate the potential breadth of the technique, we also apply it in two other problem domains, both simplified. We learn to distinguish shading from reflectance variations in a single image under particular lighting conditions. For the motion estimation problem in a \u201cblobs world\u201d, we show figure/ground discrimination, solution of the aperture problem, and filling-in arising from application of the same probabilistic machinery."

In our approach, patch regions from a sample image or video are transformed and copied to the output and then stitched together along optimal seams to generate a new (and typically larger) output. In contrast to other techniques, the size of the patch is not chosen a-priori, but instead a graph cut technique is used to determine the optimal patch region for any given offset between the input and output texture. Unlike dynamic programming, our graph cut technique for seam optimization is applicable in any dimension. We specifically explore it in 2D and 3D to perform video texture synthesis in addition to regular image synthesis. We present approximative offset search techniques that work well in conjunction with the presented patch size optimization. We show results for synthesizing regular, random, and natural images and videos. We also demonstrate how this method can be used to interactively merge different images to generate new scenes."

Because of the Gibbs distribution, Markov random field (MRF) equivalence, this assignment also determines an MRF image model. The energy function is a more convenient and natural mechanism for embodying picture attributes than are the local characteristics of the MRF. For a range of degradation mechanisms, including blurring, nonlinear deformations, and multiplicative or additive noise, the posterior distribution is an MRF with a structure akin to the image model. By the analogy, the posterior distribution defines another (imaginary) physical system. Gradual temperature reduction in the physical system isolates low energy states (``annealing''), or what is the same thing, the most probable states under the Gibbs distribution. The analogous operation under the posterior distribution yields the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the image given the degraded observations. The result is a highly parallel ``relaxation'' algorithm for MAP estimation. We establish convergence properties of the algorithm and we experiment with some simple pictures, for which good restorations are obtained at low signal-to-noise ratios."

In voxel occupancy, the task is to produce a binary labeling of a set of voxels, that determines which voxels are filled and which are empty. In this paper, we give an energy minimization formulation of the voxel occupancy problem. The global minimum of this energy can be rapidly computed with a single graph cut, using a result due to D. Greig et al. (1989). The energy function we minimize contains a data term and a smoothness term. The data term is a sum over the individual voxels, where the penalty for a voxel is based on the observed intensities of the pixels that intersect it. The smoothness term is the number of empty voxels adjacent to filled ones. Our formulation can be viewed as a generalization of silhouette intersection, with two advantages: we do not compute silhouettes, which are a major source of errors; and we can naturally incorporate spatial smoothness. We give experimental results showing reconstructions from both real and synthetic imagery. Reconstruction using this smoothed energy function is not much more time consuming than simple silhouette intersection; it takes about 10 seconds to reconstruct a one million voxel volume."

This formulation lends itself to algorithms, based on Bayesian probability theory, that support the combination of disparate sources of information, including prior knowledge.In the approach described here, local visual observations for each entity to be labeled (e.g., edge sites, pixels, elements in a depth array) yield label likelihoods. Likelihoods from several sources are combined consistently in abstraction-hierarchical label structures using a new, computationally simple procedure. The resulting label likelihoods are combined with a priori spatial knowledge encoded in a Markov random field (MRF). From the prior probabilities and the evidence-dependent combined likelihoods, the a posteriori distribution of the labelings is derived using Bayes' theorem.A new inference method, Highest Confidence First (HCF) estimation, is used to infer a unique labeling from the a posteriori distribution that is consistent with both prior knowledge and evidence. HCF compares favorably to previous techniques, all equivalent to some form of energy minimization or optimization, in finding a good MRF labeling. HCF is computationally efficient and predictable and produces better answers (lower energies) while exhibiting graceful degradation under noise and least commitment under inaccurate models. The technique generalizes to higher-level vision problems and other domains, and is demonstrated on problems of intensity edge detection and surface depth reconstruction."

Classical image segmentation tools use either texture (colour) information, e.g. Magic Wand, or edge (contrast) information, e.g. Intelligent Scissors. Recently, an approach based on optimization by graph-cut has been developed which successfully combines both types of information. In this paper we extend the graph-cut approach in three respects. First, we have developed a more powerful, iterative version of the optimisation. Secondly, the power of the iterative algorithm is used to simplify substantially the user interaction needed for a given quality of result. Thirdly, a robust algorithm for \"border matting\" has been developed to estimate simultaneously the alpha-matte around an object boundary and the colours of foreground pixels. We show that for moderately difficult examples the proposed method outperforms competitive tools."

Automatic separation of layers from color/contrast or from stereo alone is known to be error-prone. Here, color, contrast, and stereo matching information are fused to infer layers accurately and efficiently. The first algorithm, layered dynamic programming (LDP), solves stereo in an extended six-state space that represents both foreground/background layers and occluded regions. The stereo-match likelihood is then fused with a contrast-sensitive color model that is learned on-the-fly and stereo disparities are obtained by dynamic programming. The second algorithm, layered graph cut (LGC), does not directly solve stereo. Instead, the stereo match likelihood is marginalized over disparities to evaluate foreground and background hypotheses and then fused with a contrast-sensitive color model like the one used in LDP. Segmentation is solved efficiently by ternary graph cut. Both algorithms are evaluated with respect to ground truth data and found to have similar performance, substantially better than either stereo or color/contrast alone. However, their characteristics with respect to computational efficiency are rather different. The algorithms are demonstrated in the application of background substitution and shown to give good quality composite video output"

The synthesized image, called a digital tapestry, can be viewed as a visual summary or a virtual 'thumbnail' of all the images in the input collection. The problem of creating the tapestry is cast as a multi-class labeling problem such that each region in the tapestry is constructed from input image blocks that are salient and such that neighboring blocks satisfy spatial compatibility. This is formulated using a Markov random field and optimized via the graph cut based expansion move algorithm. The standard expansion move algorithm can only handle energies with metric terms, while our energy contains non-metric (soft and hard) constraints. Therefore we propose two novel contributions. First, we extend the expansion move algorithm for energy functions with non-metric hard constraints. Secondly, we modify it for functions with \"almost\" metric soft terms, and show that it gives good results in practice. The proposed framework was tested on several consumer photograph collections, and the results are presented."

Once formulated, the minimization problems are then solved with a variety of algorithmic approaches. These approaches include techniques such as dynamic programming min-cut and alpha-expansion. In this paper we show how an algorithmic technique that constructs a discrete spatial minimal cost surface can be brought to bear on stereo global minimization problems. This problem can then be reduced to a single min-cut problem. We use this approach to solve a new global minimization problem that naturally arises when solving for three-camera (trinocular) stereo. Our formulation treats the three cameras symmetrically, while imposing a natural occlusion cost and uniqueness constraint."

However, there has been little understanding of the algorithm or the nature of the solutions it finds for general graphs. \n \nWe show that BP can only converge to a stationary point of an approximate free energy, known as the Bethe free energy in statistical physics. This result characterizes BP fixed-points and makes connections with variational approaches to approximate inference. \n \nMore importantly, our analysis lets us build on the progress made in statistical physics since Bethe's approximation was introduced in 1935. Kikuchi and others have shown how to construct more accurate free energy approximations, of which Bethe's approximation is the simplest. Exploiting the insights from our analysis, we derive generalized belief propagation (GBP) versions of these Kikuchi approximations. These new message passing algorithms can be significantly more accurate than ordinary BP, at an adjustable increase in complexity. We illustrate such a new GBP algorithm on a grid Markov network and show that it gives much more accurate marginal probabilities than those found using ordinary BP."

Smith in the Chair] SUMMARY A continuous two-dimensional region is partitioned into a fine rectangular array of sites or \"pixels\", each pixel having a particular \"colour\" belonging to a prescribed finite set. The true colouring of the region is unknown but, associated with each pixel, there is a possibly multivariate record which conveys imperfect information about its colour according to a known statistical model. The aim is to reconstruct the true scene, with the additional knowledge that pixels close together tend to have the same or similar colours. In this paper, it is assumed that the local characteristics of the true scene can be represented by a nondegenerate Markov random field. Such information can be combined with the records by Bayes' theorem and the true scene can be estimated according to standard criteria. However, the computational burden is enormous and the reconstruction may reflect undesirable largescale properties of the random field. Thus, a simple, iterative method of reconstruction is proposed, which does not depend on these large-scale characteristics. The method is illustrated by computer simulations in which the original scene is not directly related to the assumed random field. Some complications, including parameter estimation, are discussed. Potential applications are mentioned briefly."

The key problem in creating a PVT is that although only a portion of the scene has been imaged at any given time, the output must simultaneously portray motion throughout the scene. Like previous work in video textures, our method employs min-cut optimization to select fragments of video that can be stitched together both spatially and temporally. However, it differs from earlier work in that the optimization must take place over a much larger set of data. Thus, to create PVTs, we introduce a dynamic programming step, followed by a novel hierarchical min-cut optimization algorithm. We also use gradient-domain compositing to further smooth boundaries between video fragments. We demonstrate our results with an interactive viewer in which users can interactively pan and zoom on high-resolution PVTs."

While this formulation benefits from a volumetric scene representation, it is amenable to a computationally tractable global optimisation using Graph-cuts. The algorithm proposed uses the visual hull of the scene to infer occlusions and as a constraint on the topology of the scene. A photo consistency-based surface cost functional is defined and discretised with a weighted graph. The optimal surface under this discretised functional is obtained as the minimum cut solution of the weighted graph. Our method provides a viewpoint independent surface regularisation, approximate handling of occlusions and a tractable optimisation scheme. Promising experimental results on real scenes as well as a quantitative evaluation on a synthetic scene are presented."

Graph cuts are used to find the globally optimal segmentation of the N-dimensional image. The obtained solution gives the best balance of boundary and region properties among all segmentations satisfying the constraints. The topology of our segmentation is unrestricted and both \"object\" and \"background\" segments may consist of several isolated parts. Some experimental results are presented in the context of photo/video editing and medical image segmentation. We also demonstrate an interesting Gestalt example.

The max-product \"belief propagation\" algorithm is a local-message-passing algorithm on this graph that is known to converge to a unique fixed point when the graph is a tree. Furthermore, when the graph is a tree, the assignment based on the fixed point yields the most probable values of the unobserved variables given the observed ones. Good empirical performance has been obtained by running the max-product algorithm (or the equivalent min-sum algorithm) on graphs with loops, for applications including the decoding of \"turbo\" codes. Except for two simple graphs (cycle codes and single-loop graphs) there has been little theoretical understanding of the max-product algorithm on graphs with loops. Here we prove a result on the fixed points of max-product on a graph with arbitrary topology and with arbitrary probability distributions (discrete- or continuous-valued nodes). We show that the assignment based on a fixed point is a \"neighborhood maximum\" of the posterior probability: the posterior probability of the max-product assignment is guaranteed to be greater than all other assignments in a particular large region around that assignment. The region includes all assignments that differ from the max-product assignment in any subset of nodes that form no more than a single loop in the graph. In some graphs, this neighborhood is exponentially large. We illustrate the analysis with examples."

By decomposing the original distribution into a convex combination of tree-structured distributions, we obtain an upper bound on the optimal value of the original problem (i.e., the log probability of the MAP assignment) in terms of the combined optimal values of the tree problems. We prove that this upper bound is tight if and only if all the tree distributions share an optimal configuration in common. An important implication is that any such shared configuration must also be a MAP configuration for the original distribution. Next we develop two approaches to attempting to obtain tight upper bounds: a) a tree-relaxed linear program (LP), which is derived from the Lagrangian dual of the upper bounds; and b) a tree-reweighted max-product message-passing algorithm that is related to but distinct from the max-product algorithm. In this way, we establish a connection between a certain LP relaxation of the mode-finding problem and a reweighted form of the max-product (min-sum) message-passing algorithm."

We formulate the problem as a Bayesian MAP problem which leads to an energy minimization method. Hidden visibility variables are used to deal with occlusion, reflections and outliers. The main contributions of this work are: a prior for the visibility variables that treats the geometric occlusions; and a prior for the multiple depth maps model that smoothes and merges the depth maps while enabling discontinuities.

Here we develop a class of local message-passing algorithms, which we call tree-reweighted belief propagation, for efficiently computing the value of these upper bounds, as well as the associated pseudomarginals. We also consider the uses of our bounds for the problem of maximum likelihood (ML) parameter estimation. For a completely observed model, our analysis gives rise to a concave lower bound on the log likelihood of the data. Maximizing this lower bound yields an approximate ML estimate which, in analogy to the moment-matching of exact ML estimation, can be interpreted in terms of pseudo-moment-matching. We present preliminary results illustrating the behavior of this approximate ML estimator."

The max-product algorithm, also known as the max-plus or min-sum algorithm, is an iterative method for (approximately) solving such a problem on graphs with cycles. We provide a novel perspective on the algorithm, which is based on the idea of reparameterizing the distribution in terms of so-called pseudo-max-marginals on nodes and edges of the graph. This viewpoint provides conceptual insight into the max-product algorithm in application to graphs with cycles. First, we prove the existence of max-product fixed points for positive distributions on arbitrary graphs. Next, we show that the approximate max-marginals computed by max-product are guaranteed to be consistent, in a suitable sense to be defined, over every tree of the graph. We then turn to characterizing the nature of the approximation to the MAP assignment computed by max-product. We generalize previous work by showing that for any graph, the max-product assignment satisfies a particular optimality condition with respect to any subgraph containing at most one cycle per connected component. We use this optimality condition to derive upper bounds on the difference between the log probability of the true MAP assignment, and the log probability of a max-product assignment. Finally, we consider extensions of the max-product algorithm that operate over higher-order cliques, and show how our reparameterization analysis extends in a natural manner."

By decomposing the original distribution into a convex combination of tree-structured distributions, we obtain an upper bound on the optimal value of the original problem (i.e., the log probability of the MAP assignment) in terms of the combined optimal values of the tree problems. We prove that this upper bound is tight if and only if all the tree distributions share an optimal configuration in common. An important implication is that any such shared configuration must also be a MAP configuration for the original distribution. Next we develop two approaches to attempting to obtain tight upper bounds: (a) a {\\em tree-relaxed linear program} (LP), which is derived from the Lagrangian dual of the upper bounds; and (b) a {\\em tree-reweighted max-product message-passing algorithm} that is related to but distinct from the max-product algorithm. In this way, we establish a connection between a certain LP relaxation of the mode-finding problem, and a reweighted form of the max-product (min-sum) message-passing algorithm."

Local belief propagation rules of the sort proposed by Pearl (1988) are guaranteed to converge to the correct posterior probabilities in singly connected graphs. Recently, good performance has been obtained by using these same rules on graphs with loops, a method we refer to as loopy belief propagation. Perhaps the most dramatic instance is the near Shannon-limit performance of Turbo codes, whose decoding algorithm is equivalent to loopy propagation. Except for the case of graphs with a single loop, there has been little theoretical understanding of loopy propagation. Here we analyze belief propagation in networks with arbitrary topologies when the nodes in the graph describe jointly gaussian random variables. We give an analytical formula relating the true posterior probabilities with those calculated using loopy propagation. We give sufficient conditions for convergence and show that when belief propagation converges, it gives the correct posterior means for all graph topologies, not just networks with a single loop. These results motivate using the powerful belief propagation algorithm in a broader class of networks and help clarify the empirical performance results."

One of its main advantages is that it offers a substantial speedup over that method, e.g. it can be at least 3-9 times faster than a-expansion. Its efficiency is a result of the fact that Fast-PD exploits information coming not only from the original MRF problem, but also from a dual problem. Furthermore, besides static MRFs, it can also be used for boosting the performance of dynamic MRFs, i.e. MRFs varying over time. On top of that, Fast-PD makes no compromise about the optimality of its solutions: it can compute exactly the same answer as a-expansion, but, unlike that method, it can also guarantee an almost optimal solution for a much wider class of NP-hard MRF problems. Results on static and dynamic MRFs demonstrate the algorithm's efficiency and power. E.g., Fast-PD has been able to compute disparity for stereoscopic sequences in real time, with the resulting disparity coinciding with that of a-expansion."

We call this process image quilting. First, we use quilting as a fast and very simple texture synthesis algorithm which produces surprisingly good results for a wide range of textures. Second, we extend the algorithm to perform texture transfer \u2014 rendering an object with a texture taken from a different object. More generally, we demonstrate how an image can be re-rendered in the style of a different image. The method works directly on the images and does not require 3D information."

For demonstration purposes, we focus on Markov Random Fields (MRFs). By partitioning the MRFs into non-overlapping trees, it is possible to compute the posterior distribution of a particular tree exactly by conditioning on the remaining tree. These exact solutions allow us to construct efficient blocked and Rao-Blackwellised MCMC algorithms. We show empirically that tree sampling is considerably more efficient than other partitioned sampling schemes and the naive Gibbs sampler, even in cases where loopy belief propagation fails to converge. We prove that tree sampling exhibits lower variance than the naive Gibbs sampler and other naive partitioning schemes using the theoretical measure of maximal correlation. We also construct new information theory tools for comparing different MCMC schemes and show that, under these, tree sampling is more efficient."

The series of international congresses was in-augurated at Z\u00fcrich in 1897, and the second congress of this series met in Paris from the sixth to the eleventh of the present month. About 225 mathematicians of various nationalities, with 25 members of their families, were present. It had been expected that the numbers would be very much greater, as many as one thousand provisional acceptances having been received before last December; the diminished attendance was doubtless due partly to the great heat of the preceding month, but probably in greater measure to the fear of exhibition crowds and exhibition extortions. It had been supposed that the Exhibition would attract people to the Congress; on the contrary, it seems to have kept them away. The composition of the Congress was certainly international; the numbers of members from the different countries were approximately as follows:\u2014France, 90; Germany, 25; United States, 17; Italy, 15; Belgium, 12; Russia, 9; Austria and Hungary, 8; Switzerland, 8; England, 7; Sweden, 7; Denmark, 4; the remainder being from South America (4), Holland, Spain, Roumania, Servia, Portugal, Turkey, Armenia, Greece, Canada, Mexico, Japan."

The author provides a coherent explication of probability as a language for reasoning with partial belief and offers a unifying perspective on other AI approaches to uncertainty, such as the Dempster-Shafer formalism, truth maintenance systems, and nonmonotonic logic. The author distinguishes syntactic and semantic approaches to uncertainty\u0097and offers techniques, based on belief networks, that provide a mechanism for making semantics-based systems operational. Specifically, network-propagation techniques serve as a mechanism for combining the theoretical coherence of probability theory with modern demands of reasoning-systems technology: modular declarative inputs, conceptually meaningful inferences, and parallel distributed computation. Application areas include diagnosis, forecasting, image interpretation, multi-sensor fusion, decision support systems, plan recognition, planning, speech recognition\u0097in short, almost every task requiring that conclusions be drawn from uncertain clues and incomplete information. \nProbabilistic Reasoning in Intelligent Systems will be of special interest to scholars and researchers in AI, decision theory, statistics, logic, philosophy, cognitive psychology, and the management sciences. Professionals in the areas of knowledge-based systems, operations research, engineering, and statistics will find theoretical and computational tools of immediate practical use. The book can also be used as an excellent text for graduate-level courses in AI, operations research, or applied probability."

We measure this overhead experimentally for a number of large benchmark programs, using a combination of executable inspection and processor simulation. Our results show that the C++ programs measured spend a median of 5.2% of their time and 3.7% of their instructions in dispatch code. For \"all virtuals\" versions of the programs, the median overhead rises to 13.7% (13% of the instructions). The \"thunk\" variant of the virtual function table implementation reduces the overhead by a median of 21% relative to the standard implementation. On future processors, these overheads are likely to increase moderately."

Each of these techniques constructs a graph such that the minimum cut on the graph also minimizes the energy. Yet, because these graph constructions are complex and highly specific to a particular energy function, graph cuts have seen limited application to date. In this paper, we give a characterization of the energy functions that can be minimized by graph cuts. Our results are restricted to functions of binary variables. However, our work generalizes many previous constructions and is easily applicable to vision problems that involve large numbers of labels, such as stereo, motion, image restoration, and scene reconstruction. We give a precise characterization of what energy functions can be minimized using graph cuts, among the energy functions that can be written as a sum of terms containing three or fewer binary variables. We also provide a general-purpose construction to minimize such an energy function. Finally, we give a necessary condition for any energy function of binary variables to be minimized by graph cuts. Researchers who are considering the use of graph cuts to optimize a particular energy function can use our results to determine if this is possible and then follow our construction to create the appropriate graph. A software implementation is freely available."

Moreover, among the techniques that best localize depth discontinuities, it is common to work only with a discrete set of disparity values, hindering the modeling of smooth, non-fronto-parallel surfaces. We propose to estimate scene structure as a set of smooth surface patches. The disparities within each patch are modeled by a spline, while the extent of each patch is represented by a pixelwise labeling of the source images. Disparities and extents are alternately estimated in an iterative, energy minimization framework. Segmentation is via graph cuts, aided by image gradients. Input images are treated symmetrically, and occlusions are addressed explicitly. Promising experimental results are presented."
