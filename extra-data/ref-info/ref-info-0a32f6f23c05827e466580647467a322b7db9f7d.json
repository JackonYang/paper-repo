At the feature extraction stage, a sparse set of affine Harris and Laplacian regions is found in the image. Each of these regions can be thought of as a texture element having a characteristic elliptic shape and a distinctive appearance pattern. This pattern is captured in an affine-invariant fashion via a process of shape normalization followed by the computation of two novel descriptors, the spin image and the RIFT descriptor. When affine invariance is not required, the original elliptical shape serves as an additional discriminative feature for texture recognition. The proposed approach is evaluated in retrieval and classification tasks using the entire Brodatz database and a publicly available collection of 1,000 photographs of textured surfaces taken from different viewpoints."

Objects are modeled as flexible constellations of parts. A probabilistic representation is used for all aspects of the object: shape, appearance, occlusion and relative scale. An entropy-based feature detector is used to select regions and their scale within the image. In learning the parameters of the scale-invariant object model are estimated. This is done using expectation-maximization in a maximum-likelihood setting. In recognition, this model is used in a Bayesian manner to classify images. The flexible nature of the model is demonstrated by excellent results over a range of datasets including geometrically constrained classes (e.g. faces, cars) and flexible objects (such as animals)."

This approach allows robust pan detection, and it is invariant under scale changes-that is, neither the training images nor the test images have to be normalized. The proposed method is evaluated in car detection tasks with significant variations in viewing conditions, and promising results are demonstrated. Different local regions, classifiers and feature selection methods are quantitatively compared. Our evaluation shows that local invariant descriptors are an appropriate representation for object classes such as cars, and it underlines the importance of feature selection."

This bag of keypoints method is based on vector quantization of affine invariant descriptors of image patches. We propose and compare two alternative implementations using different classifiers: Naive Bayes and SVM. The main advantages of the method are that it is simple, computationally efficient and intrinsically invariant. We present results for simultaneously classifying seven semantic visual categories. These results clearly demonstrate that the method is robust to background clutter and produces good categorization accuracy even without exploiting geometric information."

The regions are used in a similar way to the local interest points extracted from gray-level images, but they capture shape rather than texture. Local convexity is characterized by measuring the extent to which the detected image contours support circle or arc-like local structures at each position and scale in the image. Our saliency measure combines two cost functions defined on the tangential edges near the circle: a tangential-gradient energy term, and an entropy term that ensures local support from a wide range of angular positions around the circle. The detected regions are invariant to scale changes and rotations, and robust against clutter, occlusions and spurious edge detections. Experimental results show very good performance for both shape matching and recognition of object categories."

The approach relies on identifying groups of local affine regions (image features having a characteristic appearance and elliptical shape) that remain approximately affinely rigid across a range of views of an object, and across multiple instances of the same object class. These groups, termed semi-local affine parts, are learned using correspondence search between pairs of unsegmented and cluttered input images, followed by validation against additional training images. The proposed approach is applied to the recognition of butterflies in natural imagery."

Thus, we arrive at a conceptually simple model that allows to estimate a large number of free parameters reliably.

A vocabulary of information-rich object parts is automatically constructed from a set of sample images of the object class of interest. Images are then represented using parts from this vocabulary, along with spatial relations observed among them. Based on this representation, a feature-efficient learning algorithm is used to learn to detect instances of the object class. The framework developed can be applied to any object with distinguishable parts in a relatively fixed spatial configuration. We report experiments on images of side views of cars. Our experiments show that the method achieves high detection accuracy on a difficult test set of real-world images, and is highly robust to partial occlusion and background variation.In addition, we discuss and offer solutions to several methodological issues that are significant for the research community to be able to evaluate object detection approaches."

This theory combines filtering theory and Markov random field modeling through the maximum entropy principle, and interprets and clarifies many previous concepts and methods for texture analysis and synthesis from a unified point of view. Our theory characterizes the ensemble of images I with the same texture appearance by a probability distribution f(I) on a random field, and the objective of texture modeling is to make inference about f(I), given a set of observed texture examples.In our theory, texture modeling consists of two steps. (1) A set of filters is selected from a general filter bank to capture features of the texture, these filters are applied to observed texture images, and the histograms of the filtered images are extracted. These histograms are estimates of the marginal distributions of f( I). This step is called feature extraction. (2) The maximum entropy principle is employed to derive a distribution p(I), which is restricted to have the same marginal distributions as those in (1). This p(I) is considered as an estimate of f( I). This step is called feature fusion. A stepwise algorithm is proposed to choose filters from a general filter bank. The resulting model, called FRAME (Filters, Random fields And Maximum Entropy), is a Markov random field (MRF) model, but with a much enriched vocabulary and hence much stronger descriptive ability than the previous MRF models used for texture modeling. Gibbs sampler is adopted to synthesize texture images by drawing typical samples from p(I), thus the model is verified by seeing whether the synthesized texture images have similar visual appearances to the texture images being modeled. Experiments on a variety of 1D and 2D textures are described to illustrate our theory and to show the performance of our algorithms. These experiments demonstrate that many textures which are previously considered as from different categories can be modeled and synthesized in a common framework."

The temporal continuity of the video within a shot is used to track the regions in order to reject unstable regions and reduce the effects of noise in the descriptors. The analogy with text retrieval is in the implementation where matches on descriptors are pre-computed (using vector quantization), and inverted file systems and document rankings are used. The result is that retrieved is immediate, returning a ranked list of key frames/shots in the manner of Google. The method is illustrated for matching in two full length feature films."

Given labeled training data, Maximum Entropy is a statistical technique which allows one to predict the probability of a label given test data. The techniques allow for relationships between features to be effectively captured. and has been successfully applied to a number of language tasks including machine translation. In our case, we view the image annotation task as one where a training data set of images labeled with keywords is provided and we need to automatically label the test images with keywords. To do this, we first represent the image using a language of visterms and then predict the probability of seeing an English word given the set of visterms forming the image. Maximum Entropy allows us to compute the probability and in addition allows for the relationships between visterms to be incorporated. The experimental results show that Maximum Entropy outperforms one of the classical translation models that has been applied to this task and the Cross Media Relevance Model. Since the Maximum Entropy model allows for the use of a large number of predicates to possibly increase performance even further, Maximum Entropy model is a promising model for the task of automatic image annotation."

                "text": "The fact that objects in the world appear in different ways depending on the scale of observation has important implications if one aims at describing them. It shows that the notion of scale is of utmost importance when processing unknown measurement data by automatic methods. In their seminal works, Witkin (1983) and Koenderink (1984) proposed to approach this problem by representing image structures at different scales in a so-called scale-space representation. Traditional scale-space theory building on this work, however, does not address the problem of how to select local appropriate scales for further analysis. This article proposes a systematic methodology for dealing with this problem. A framework is presented for generating hypotheses about interesting scale levels in image data, based on a general principle stating that local extrema over scales of different combinations of \u03b3-normalized derivatives are likely candidates to correspond to interesting structures. Specifically, it is shown how this idea can be used as a major mechanism in algorithms for automatic scale selection, which adapt the local scales of processing to the local image structure.Support for the proposed approach is given in terms of a general theoretical investigation of the behaviour of the scale selection method under rescalings of the input pattern and by integration with different types of early visual modules, including experiments on real-world and synthetic data. Support is also given by a detailed analysis of how different types of feature detectors perform when integrated with a scale selection mechanism and then applied to characteristic model patterns. Specifically, it is described in detail how the proposed methodology applies to the problems of blob detection, junction detection, edge detection, ridge detection and local frequency estimation.In many computer vision applications, the poor performance of the low-level vision modules constitutes a major bottleneck. It is argued that the inclusion of mechanisms for automatic scale selection is essential if we are to construct vision systems to automatically analyse complex unknown environments."

Maximum entropy is a probability distribution estimation technique widely used for a variety of natural language tasks, such as language modeling, part-of-speech tagging, and text segmentation. The underlying principle of maximum entropy is that without external knowledge, one should prefer distributions that are uniform. Constraints on the distribution, derived from labeled training data, inform the technique where to be minimally non-uniform. The maximum entropy formulation has a unique solution which can be found by the improved iterative scaling algorithm. In this paper, maximum entropy is used for text classification by estimating the conditional distribution of the class variable given the document. In experiments on several text datasets we compare accuracy to naive Bayes and show that maximum entropy is sometimes significantly better, but also sometimes worse. Much future work remains, but the results indicate that maximum entropy is a promising technique for text classification."

Some use a multi-variate Bernoulli model, that is, a Bayesian Network with no dependencies between words and binary word features (e.g. Larkey and Croft 1996; Koller and Sahami 1997). Others use a multinomial model, that is, a uni-gram language model with integer word counts (e.g. Lewis and Gale 1994; Mitchell 1997). This paper aims to clarify the confusion by describing the differences and details of these two models, and by empirically comparing their classification performance on five text corpora. We find that the multi-variate Bernoulli performs well with small vocabulary sizes, but that the multinomial performs usually performs even better at larger vocabulary sizes--providing on average a 27% reduction in error over the multi-variate Bernoulli model at any vocabulary size."
