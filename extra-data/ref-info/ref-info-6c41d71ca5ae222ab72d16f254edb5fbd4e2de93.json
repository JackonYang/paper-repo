However, these approaches are applicable to only the same kind of documents because they are based on the paradigm that specifies the structure definition information in advance so as to be able to analyze a particular class of documents intelligently. In this paper, the authors propose a method to recognize the layout structures of multi-kinds of table-form document images. For this purpose, the authors introduce a classification tree to manage the relationships among different classes of layout structures. The authors' recognition system has two modes: layout knowledge acquisition and layout structure recognition. In the layout knowledge acquisition mode, table-form document images are distinguished according to this. Classification tree and then the structure description trees which specify the logical structures of table-form documents are generated automatically. While, in the layout structure recognition mode, individual item fields in the table-form document images are extracted and classified successfully by searching the classification tree and interpreting the structure description tree. >"

All forms in widespread use contain discrete fields where specific information can be entered. Automatic recognition of these forms could be achieved using existing state-of-the-art OCR algorithms for numerals, alphabetic characters, cursive words, signatures and mark sensing if they could be rapidly configured along with any inter-relationships and dependencies for different forms. This paper describes an initial implementation of an interactive graphical tool to allow the handwritten fields of a form and their inter-relationships to be described and defined for automatic linking with appropriate OCR algorithms. Results indicate that the main requirement is for the operator to have a full understanding of the handwritten form and an ability to describe its contents."

A great deal of time, effort and money will be saved if they can be entered into the computer and processed automatically. According to the specific characteristics of financial documents, it can be concluded that it is possible to build a system for recognizing specific types of financial documents, instead of a complex and general one aiming at different kinds of documents. In this paper, a financial document recognition prototype system which can process bank cheques, payment slips and bills, is presented. It consists of four major parts: (a) document image acquisition including scanning and binarization, (b) fixed document processing subsystem based on the detection of staff lines, (c) flexible document processing subsystem operating in a form description language (FDL), and (d) character recognition. Numerous experimental results are presented and discussed. >"

The generic two-stage multi-network classification scheme decomposes the estimation of a posteriori probabilities into two coarse-to-fine stages. This generic classification scheme is especially suitable for the classification tasks which involve a large number of categories. The two-stage multi-network OCR system consists of a bank of specialized networks, each of which is designed to recognize a subset of whole character set. A soft pre-classifier and a network selector are employed in the two-stage multi-network OCR system for selectively invoking necessary specialized network. The network selector makes decisions based on both the prior case information and the outputs of the pre-classifier. Compared with the system which uses either a single network or one-stage multiple networks, the two-stage multi-network OCR system offers advantages in recognition accuracy, confidence measure, speed, and flexibility."
