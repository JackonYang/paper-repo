The parser, Pearl, is a time-asynchronous bottom-up chart parser with Earley-type top-down prediction which pursues the highest-scoring theory in the chart, where the score of a theory represents the extent to which the context of the sentence predicts that interpretation. This parser differs from previous attempts at stochastic parsers in that it uses a richer form of conditional probabilities based on context to predict likelihood. Pearl also provides a framework for incorporating the results of previous work in part-of-speech assignment, unknown word models, and other probabilistic models of linguistic features into one parsing tool, interleaving these techniques instead of using the traditional pipeline architecture. In preliminary tests, Pearl has been successful at resolving part-of-speech and word (in speech processing) ambiguity, determining categories for unknown words, and selecting correct parses first using a very loosely fitting covering grammar."

Continuous Speech Recognition for natural language raises a lot of difficulties, both for the acoustic processing and the linguistic decoding. Our work specifically concerns the linguistic decoding techniques for a very large (140,000 entries) French dictionary, and a oral open discourse. So the task is to transcribe a continuous string of pseudo-phonemes into written text. This string would be ideally the output of a perfect acoustic processor. We present a grammar designed for automatic transcription and compute probabilities for the rules. We compare its results with those obtained earlier with Markov modeling. We show that it is possible to combine the two approaches and get better results than each model separately."

The book begins with standard formal language material, including a discussion of regular, context-free, context sensitive, and arbitrary phrase stucture languages. This is followed by a discussion of the corresponding families of automata: finite-state, push-down, linear bounded and Turing machines. Important topics introduced along the way include closure properties, normal forms, nondeterminism, basic parsing algorithms, and the theory of computability and undecidability. Special emphasis is given to the role of algebraic techniques in formal language theory through a chapter devoted to the fixed point approach to the analysis of context-free languages. Advanced topics in parsing are also emphasized in an unusually clear and precise presentation. A unique feature of the book is the two chapter introduction to the formal theory of natural languages. Alternative schemes for representing natural language are discussed, in particular ATNs and GPSG. This book is part of the AKM Series in Theoretical Computer Science. \"A Basis for Theoretical Computer Science\", also in the series, should provide the necessary background for this volume intended to serve as a text for upper undergraduate and graduate level students."

If appropriate care is taken, we find that it is possible to make useful estimates of contextual probabilities that improve performance in a spelling correction application. In contrast, less careful estimates are found to be useless. Specifically, we will show that the Good-Turing method makes the use of contextual information practical for a spelling corrector, while attempts to use the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) or expected likelihood estimator (ELE) fail. Spelling correction was selected as an application domain because it is analogous to many important recognition applications based on a noisy channel model (such as speech recognition), though somewhat simpler and therefore possibly more amenable to detailed statistical analysis."

Verbs are detected by a novel technique based on the Case Filter of Rouvret and Vergnaud (1980). The completeness of the output list increases monotonically with the total number of occurrences of each verb in the corpus. False positive rates are one to three percent of observations. Five SFs are currently detected and more are planned. Ultimately, I expect to provide a large SF dictionary to the NLP community and to train dictionaries for specific corpora."
