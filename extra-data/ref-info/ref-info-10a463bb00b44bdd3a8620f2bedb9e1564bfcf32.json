                "text": "\"Parallel Solution of Sparse Simultaneous Equations\" D. A. Caiahan Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering The University of Michigan Ann Arbor, Michigan 48104 The ordering of sparse equations has been used in the past to reduce computation and storage requirements. In this paper, ordering is examined as a mechanism to permit simultaneous (parallel) operations on many rows and columns. This allows a block partitioning of the matrix, where each block can be considered a single entity for the purposes of the division and multiplication operations involved in the solution process. To accomplish this ordering, a combinatorial algorithm that has algebraic growth with N(the matrix size) or a faster heuristic procedure may be used. The latter is adopted, and applied to a number of randomly generated examples. This procedure is also applied to a sparse matrix arising from a mechanical engineering simulation problem. In all cases it is shown that the fill produced by parallelization is not excessive. The pros and cons of the method are considered in view of orary machine architectures. F. G.

With the exception of one instance of the edge-adjacency matrix, these structures determine an unlabelled graph up to isomorphism and are, as a result, natural candidates for computer representations of graphs."

A flow graph which is susceptible to this type of analysis is called reducible. This paper describes an algorithm for testing whether a flow graph is reducible. The algorithm uses depth-first search to reveal the structure of the flow graph and a good method for computing disjoint set unions to determine reducibility from the search information. When the algorithm is implemented on a random access computer, it requires O(E log* E) time to analyze a graph with E edges, where log* x = min{i/logix\u22641}. The time bound compares favorably with the O(E log E) bound of a previously known algorithm."

Since then, many variants of the problem have been considered; depending on two factors: (1) the particular model for registers, and (2) the definition of the term \u201ccomputation of a program\u201d e.g. whether values may be computed more than once. We will show that several variants of the register allocation problem for straight line programs are polynomial complete. In particular we consider, (1) the case when each value is computed exactly once, and (2) the case when values may be recomputed as necessary. The completeness of the third problem considered is surprising. A straight line program starts with a set of initial values, and computes intermediate and final values. Suppose, for each value, the register that value must be computed into is preassigned. Then, (3) the problem of determining if there is a computation of the straight line program, that computes values into the assigned registers, is polynomial complete."

The algorithm induces algorithms for invert ing a matr ix of order n, solving a system of n linear equations in n unknowns, comput ing a determinant of order n etc. all requiring less than const n l\u00b0g 7 arithmetical operations. This fact should be compared with the result of KLYUYEV and KOKOVKINSHCHERBAK [1 ] tha t Gaussian elimination for solving a system of l inearequations is optimal if one restricts oneself to operations upon rows and columns as a whole. We also note tha t WlNOGRAD [21 modifies the usual algorithms for matr ix multiplication and inversion and for solving systems of linear equations, trading roughly half of the multiplications for additions and subtractions. I t is a pleasure to thank D. BRILLINGER for inspiring discussions about the present subject and ST. COOK and B. PARLETT for encouraging me to write this paper. 2. We define algorithms e~, ~ which mult iply matrices of order m2 ~, by induction on k: ~ , 0 is the usual algorithm, for matr ix multiplication (requiring m a multiplications and m 2 ( m t) additions), e~,k already being known, define ~ , ~ +t as follows: If A, B are matrices of order m 2 k ~ to be multiplied, write"

Here \u201creduced\u201d means, roughly speaking, that the first problem can be solved deterministically in polynomial time provided an oracle is available for solving the second. From this notion of reducible, polynomial degrees of difficulty are defined, and it is shown that the problem of determining tautologyhood has the same polynomial degree as the problem of determining whether the first of two given graphs is isomorphic to a subgraph of the second. Other examples are discussed. A method of measuring the complexity of proof procedures for the predicate calculus is introduced and discussed."

FLOW is compared with its best-known competitor, that of Dijkstra and Yen (DFLO). The new algorithm is shown to execute in time of order max (V, E, D), where D is the maximum distance computed in a graph with E edges and V nodes. By counting the number of operands fetched during execution of FLOW and DFLO, an estimate of the running time of each is obtained. This estimate shows that FLOW should execute faster than DFLO when E/V2 = &agr; < .2875, and V \u2265 22 WM/&bgr; + 5/&bgr; + 7.04, where &bgr; = 23 - 80&agr;.

The generaliza- tion to 3' was given by Box et al. (1). Good (2) generalized these methods and gave elegant algorithms for which one class of applications is the calculation of Fourier series. In their full generality, Good's methods are applicable to certain problems in which one must multiply an N-vector by an N X N matrix which can be factored into m sparse matrices, where m is proportional to log N. This results inma procedure requiring a number of operations proportional to N log N rather than N2. These methods are applied here to the calculation of complex Fourier series. They are useful in situations where the number of data points is, or can be chosen to be, a highly composite number. The algorithm is here derived and presented in a rather different form. Attention is given to the choice of N. It is also shown how special advantage can be obtained in the use of a binary computer with N = 2' and how the entire calculation can be performed within the array of N data storage locations used for the given Fourier coefficients. Consider the problem of calculating the complex Fourier series N-1 (1) X(j) = EA(k)-Wjk, j = 0 1, * ,N- 1, k=0"

(A tree is a graph with one and only one path between every two nodes.) In the course of the construction that we present here, the branches are subdivided into three sets: I. the branches definitely assignec~ to the tree under construction (they will form a subtree) ; II. the branches from which the next branch to be added to set I, will be selected ; III. the remaining branches (rejected or not yet considered). The nodes are subdivided into two sets: A. the nodes connected by the branches of set I, B. the remaining nodes (one and only one branch of set II will lead to each of these nodes), We start the construction by choosing an arbitrary node as the only member of set A, and by placing all branches that end in this node in set II. To start with, set I is empty. From then onwards we perform the following two steps repeatedly. Step 1. The shortest branch of set II is removed from this set and added to"

Several examples are included to illustrate the algorithm.

The related problem of computing of computing the resides of an N precision integer is handed by the same algorithm in O(N log2N loglogN) steps.

By making efficient use of the information in a random sample chosen during input of the sequence to be sorted, significant improvements over ordinary minimal storage tree sorting can be made.\nA procedure is proposed which is a generalization of minimal storage tree sorting and which has the following three properties: (a) There is a significant improvement (over ordinary minimal storage tree sorting) in the expected number of comparisons required to sort the input sequence. (b) The procedure is statistically insensitive to bias in the input sequence. (c) The expected number of comparisons required by the procedure approaches (slowly) the information-theoretic lower bound on the number of comparisons required.

Neither history, nor philosophy, nor common sense will tell us how these machines will affect us, for they do not do \"work\" as did machines of the Industrial Revolution. Instead of dealing with materials or energy, we are told that they handle \"control\" and \"information\" and even \"intellectual processes.\" There are very few individuals today who doubt that the computer and its relatives are developing rapidly in capability and complexity, and that these machines are destined to play important (though not as yet fully understood) roles in society's future. Though only some of us deal directly with computers, all of us are falling under the shadow of their ever-growing sphere of influence, and thus we all need to understand their capabilities and their limitations. \n \nIt would indeed be reassuring to have a book that categorically and systematically described what all these machines can do and what they cannot do, giving sound theoretical or practical grounds for each judgment. However, although some books have purported to do this, it cannot be done for the following reasons: a) Computer-like devices are utterly unlike anything which science has ever considered---we still lack the tools necessary to fully analyze, synthesize, or even think about them; and b) The methods discovered so far are effective in certain areas, but are developing much too rapidly to allow a useful interpretation and interpolation of results. The abstract theory---as described in this book---tells us in no uncertain terms that the machines' potential range is enormous, and that its theoretical limitations are of the subtlest and most elusive sort. There is no reason to suppose machines have any limitations not shared by man."

For example, we saw in Chapter 6 that because we can multiply two 2 x 2 matrices with seven scalar multiplications, we have an o ... (n1og 7) matrixmultiplication algorithm. The fact that Strassen's algorithm uses 18 additions is asymptotically negligible. In the first level of recursion for Strassen's algorithm the seven (n/2) x (n/2) matrix multiplications are arbitrarily more costly than the 18 (or any other number of) additions and subtractions of matrices of the same size, as /1 approaches infinity. In fact. if we could multiply two 2 x 2 matrices with six scalar multiplications using only the laws of a noncommutative ring, then we would have an 0 A (n1ot: 6 ) = o .... (n:!\u00b759 ) matrix-multiplication algorithm, no matter how many additions or subtractions a 2 x 2 matrix multiplication took. (It can be shown, however, that if the algorithm is to work for an arbitrary ring, seven multiplications are needed for a 2 x 2 matrix multiplication; see Hopcroft and Kerr [1971].) For another\u2022example, we saw in Section 2."

For example. Dantzig. Blattner. and Rao [ 1966] related the trnveling salesman problem to the shortest-path problem with negative weights. Divetti and Grasselli [ 1968] showed the relation between the set cover problem.and the feed.back edge set problem. Complete problems for .9'-SPACE were first considered in Meyer and Stockmeyer [ J 972]. The first space-complete language appeared implicitly in Savitch [ 1971]. where a language (the set of threadable mazes) complete for log 11 space was defined. Jones (1973] and Stockmeyer and Meyer (1973] treat restricted forms of polynomial-time reducibility between problems."

The fundamental issue here is whether there exists any proof system, and a polynomial p(n) such that every valid formula has a proof of length not exceeding p(n), where n is the length of the formula. Theorem 1 below helps establish the importance of this question. For the purposes of this theorem, we give the following definitions."
