The basic problem treated is one that does not allow classification violations. The problem is converted to a problem of computing the nearest point between two convex polytopes. The suitability of two classical nearest point algorithms, due to Gilbert, and Mitchell et al., is studied. Ideas from both these algorithms are combined and modified to derive our fast algorithm. For problems which require classification violations to be allowed, the violations are quadratically penalized and an idea due to Cortes and Vapnik and Friess is used to convert it to a problem in which there are no classification violations. Comparative computational evaluation of our algorithm against powerful SVM methods such as Platt's sequential minimal optimization shows that our algorithm is very competitive."

For the MNIST database, SMO is 1.7 times as fast as PCG chunking; while for the UCI Adult database and linear SVMs, SMO can be 1500 times faster than the PCG chunking algorithm."

Because SOR handles one point at a time, similar to Platt's sequential minimal optimization (SMO) algorithm which handles two constraints at a time and Joachims' SVMlight which handles a small number of points at a time, SOR can process very large datasets that need not reside in memory. The algorithm converges linearly to a solution. Encouraging numerical results are presented on datasets with up to 10,000,000 points. Such massive discrimination problems cannot be processed by conventional linear or quadratic programming methods, and to our knowledge have not been solved by other methods. On smaller problems, SOR was faster than SVMlight and comparable or faster than SMO."

                "text": "This chapter describes a new algorithm for training Support Vector Machines: Sequential Minimal Optimization, or SMO. Training a Support Vector Machine (SVM) requires the solution of a very large quadratic programming (QP) optimization problem. SMO breaks this large QP problem into a series of smallest possible QP problems. These small QP problems are solved analytically, which avoids using a time-consuming numerical QP optimization as an inner loop. The amount of memory required for SMO is linear in the training set size, which allows SMO to handle very large training sets. Because large matrix computation is avoided, SMO scales somewhere between linear and quadratic in the training set size for various test problems, while a standard projected conjugate gradient (PCG) chunking algorithm scales somewhere between linear and cubic in the training set size. SMO's computation time is dominated by SVM evaluation, hence SMO is fastest for linear SVMs and sparse data sets. For the MNIST database, SMO is as fast as PCG chunking; while for the UCI Adult database and linear SVMs, SMO can be more than 1000 times faster than the PCG chunking algorithm."

A later breakthrough by Keerthi and Gilbert (2000, 2002) proved the convergence finite termination for practical cases while the size of the working set is restricted to two. In this paper, we prove the asymptotic convergence of the algorithm used by the software SVM(light) and other later implementation. The size of the working set can be any even number.

Despite the fact that this type of problem is well understood, there are many issues to be considered in designing an SVM learner. In particular, for large learning tasks with many training examples, oo-the-shelf optimization techniques for general quadratic programs quickly become intractable in their memory and time requirements. SV M light1 is an implementation of an SVM learner which addresses the problem of large tasks. This chapter presents algorithmic and computational results developed for SV M light V2.0, which make large-scale SVM training more practical. The results give guidelines for the application of SVMs to large domains."

SVM is a machine-learning method, based on the principle of structural risk minimization, which performs well when applied to data outside the training set. We formulate MC detection as a supervised-learning problem and apply SVM to develop the detection algorithm. We use the SVM to detect at each location in the image whether an MC is present or not. We tested the proposed method using a database of 76 clinical mammograms containing 1120 MCs. We use free-response receiver operating characteristic curves to evaluate detection performance, and compare the proposed algorithm with several existing methods. In our experiments, the proposed SVM framework outperformed all the other methods tested. In particular, a sensitivity as high as 94% was achieved by the SVM method at an error rate of one false-positive cluster per image. The ability of SVM to outperform several well-known methods developed for the widely studied problem of MC detection suggests that SVM is a promising technique for object detection in a medical imaging application."

When the convex hulls of the two sets are also disjoint, the plane completely separates the two sets. When the convex hulls intersect, our linear program, unlike all previously proposed linear programs, is guaranteed to generate some error-minimizing plane, without the imposition of extraneous normalization constraints that inevitably fail to handle certain cases. The effectiveness of the proposed linear program has been demonstrated by successfully testing it on a number of databases. In addition, it has been used in conjunction with the multisurface method of piecewise-linear separation to train a feed-forward neural network with a single hidden layer."
