This representation is constructed by detecting peaks and ridges in the difference of lowpass (DOLP) transform. Descriptions of shapes which are encoded in this representation may be matched efficiently despite changes in size, orientation, or position. Motivations for a multiple resolution representation are presented first, followed by the definition of the DOLP transform. Techniques are then presented for encoding a symbolic structural description of forms from the DOLP transform. This process involves detecting local peaks and ridges in each bandpass image and in the entire three-dimensional space defined by the DOLP transform. Linking adjacent peaks in different bandpass images gives a multiple resolution tree which describes shape. Peaks which are local maxima in this tree provide landmarks for aligning, manipulating, and matching shapes. Detecting and linking the ridges in each DOLP bandpass image provides a graph which links peaks within a shape in a bandpass image and describes the positions of the boundaries of the shape at multiple resolutions. Detecting and linking the ridges in the DOLP three-space describes elongated forms and links the largest peaks in the tree. The principles for determining the correspondence between symbols in pairs of such descriptions are then described. Such correspondence matching is shown to be simplified by using the correspondence at lower resolutions to constrain the possible correspondence at higher resolutions."

                "text": "An algorithm is proposed for solving the stereoscopic matching problem. The algorithm consists of five steps: (1) Each image is filtered at different orientations with bar masks of four sizes that increase with eccentricity; the equivalent filters are one or two octaves wide. (2) Zero-crossings in the filtered images, which roughly correspond to edges, are localized. Positions of the ends of lines and edges are also found. (3) For each mask orientation and size, matching takes place between pairs of zero-crossings or terminations of the same sign in the two images, for a range of disparities up to about the width of the mask\u2019s central region. (4) Wide masks can control vergence movements, thus causing small masks to come into correspondence. (5) When a correspondence is achieved, it is stored in a dynamic buffer, called the 2\u00bd-D sketch. It is shown that this proposal provides a theoretical framework for most existing psychophysical and neurophysiological data about stereopsis. Several critical experimental predictions are also made, for instance about the size of Panum\u2019s area under various conditions. The results of such experiments would tell us whether, for example, co-operativity is necessary for the matching process."

(1) Intensity changes, which occur in a natural image over a wide range of scales, are detected separately at different scales. An appropriate filter for this purpose at a given scale is found to be the second derivative of a Gaussian, and it is shown that, provided some simple conditions are satisfied, these primary filters need not be orientation-dependent. Thus, intensity changes at a given scale are best detected by finding the zero values of \u22072G(x, y)* I(x, y) for image I, where G(x, y) is a two-dimensional Gaussian distribution and \u22072 is the Laplacian. The intensity changes thus discovered in each of the channels are then represented by oriented primitives called zero-crossing segments, and evidence is given that this representation is complete. (2) Intensity changes in images arise from surface discontinuities or from reflectance or illumination boundaries, and these all have the property that they are spatially localized. Because of this, the zero-crossing segments from the different channels are not independent, and rules are deduced for combining them into a description of the image. This description is called the raw primal sketch. The theory explains several basic psychophysical findings, and the operation of forming oriented zero-crossing segments from the output of centre-surround \u22072G filters acting on the image forms the basis for a physiological model of simple cells (see Marr & Ullman 1979)."

The method, called hierarchical discrete correlation, or HDC, is computationally efficient, typically requiring two or three orders of magnitude fewer computational steps than direct correlation or correlation computed in the spatial frequency domain using the Fast Fourier transform. In addition the method simultaneously generates correlations for kernels (operators) of many sizes. These kernels closely approximate the Gaussian probability distribution, so that the correlation is equivalent to low pass filtering. The operators commonly used in image processing can be readily obtained from sums and differences of Gaussian-like correlations at nearby image points."

In this paper, we apply this approach to the problem of representing three-dimensional shapes for the purpose of recognition. 1. Three criteria, accessibility, scope and uniqueness, and stability and sensitivity, are presented for judging the usefulness of a representation for shape recognition. 2. Three aspects of a representation\u2019s design are considered, (i) the representation\u2019s coordinate system, (ii) its primitives, which are the primary units of shape information used in the representation, and (iii) the organization the representation imposes on the information in its descriptions. 3. In terms of these design issues and the criteria presented, a shape representation for recognition should: (i) use an object-centred coordinate system, (ii) include volumetric primitives of varied sizes, and (iii) have a modular organization. A representation based on a shape\u2019s natural axes (for example the axes identified by a stick figure) follows directly from these choices. 4. The basic process for deriving a shape description in this representation must involve: (i) a means for identifying the natural axes of a shape in its image and (ii) a mechanism for transforming viewer-centred axis specifications to specifications in an object-centred coordinate system. 5. Shape recognition involves: (i) a collection of stored shape descriptions, and (ii) various indexes into the collection that allow a newly derived description to be associated with an appropriate stored description. The most important of these indexes allows shape recognition to proceed conservatively from the general to the specific based on the specificity of the information available from the image. 6. New constraints supplied by a conservative recognition process can be used to extract more information from the image. A relaxation process for carrying out this constraint analysis is described."

Workable schemes able to perform certain tasks performed by the visual system have been constructed and used as vehicles for investigating the problems faced by the visual system and its methods for solving them.Two major problems are treated: first, the correspondence problem, which concerns the identification of image elements that represent the same object at different times, thereby maintaining the perceptual identity of the object in motion or in change. The second problem is the three-dimensional interpretation of the changing image once a correspondence has been established.The author's computational approach to visual theory makes the work unique, and it should be of interest to psychologists working in visual perception and readers interested in cognitive studies in general, as well as computer scientists interested in machine vision, theoretical neurophysiologists, and philosophers of science."

In an extensive experiment with f = 14 cycles/deg, the independence hypothesis was consistently rejected only when f/f\u2032=54 or 45, but rarely rejected when the value of f/f\u2032 lay outside this range. In other experiments, f was between 1.9 and 22.4 cycles/deg.

                "text": "In considering methods for increasing the speed of telegraph circuits, the engineer is confronted by the problem of transmitting over a circuit the maximum amount of intelligence using a given frequency range, without causing undue interference, either in the circuit being considered or from that circuit to other circuits. In this paper the following two fundamentally important factors in connection with this problem are given principal attention: 1. Signal shaping, i. e., giving signals the best wave shape before impressing them on the transmitting medium so as to be able to send signal elements at maximum speed without undue interference into other circuits. 2. Choice of codes so as to transmit the maximum amount of intelligence with a given number of signal elements. These factors are discussed with the idea of indicating the best methods, as well as to give an idea of what ay be expected from these methods. In connection with the choice of codes, consideration is given to the effect of codes differing in the number of \u201ccurrent values\u201d employed. By this is meant the number of different current values which are employed in a system in forming the different characters. To illustrate, an ordinary land line telegraph circuit makes use of two current values \u2014 that is, zero current and the current which flows when the battery is connected to the circuit, or it may use a current value in one direction when battery is connected to the circuit with one polarity and a second current value in the opposite direction of similar magnitude when the battery is connected to the circuit with the opposite polarity. Submarine cables, on the other hand, ordinarily employ three different current values, that is, a definite value in one direction, a similar value in Ike opposite direction, and zero current. If a quadruplex circuit is analyzed, it will be seen that there are four different current values employed. There is, of course, no theoretical limit to the number of current values which may be thus employed. The paper also contains a discussion of certain telegraph systems which have been advocated, and an endeavor is made to clear up various misconceptions relative to the possibilities of these systems"

                "text": "Abstract : The Stanford AI Lab cart is a card-table sized mobile robot controlled remotely through a radio link, and equipped with a TV camera and transmitter. A computer has been programmed to drive the cart through cluttered indoor and outdoor spaces, gaining its knowledge of the world entirely from images broadcast by the onboard TV system. The cart uses several kinds of stereo to locate objects around it in 3D and to deduce its own motion. It plans an obstacle avoiding path to a desired destination on the basis of a model built with this information. The plan changes as the cart perceives new obstacles on its journey. The system is reliable for short runs, but slow. The cart moves one meter every ten to fifteen minutes, in lurches. After rolling a meter it stops, takes some pictures and thinks about them for a long time. Then it plans a new path, executes a little of it, and pauses again. The program has successfully driven the cart through several 20 meter indoor courses (each taking about five hours) complex enough to necessitate three or four avoiding swerves. A less successful outdoor run, in which the cart skirted two obstacles but collided with a third, was also done. Harsh lighting (very bright surfaces next to very dark shadows) giving poor pictures and movement of shadows during the cart's creeping progress were major reasons for the poorer outdoor performance. The action portions of these runs were filmed by computer controlled cameras. (Author)"
