In this paper we present a systematic investigation of these changes in visual sensitivity and apply it to adapt the quantizer of a predictive coder. The paper consists of three parts. In the first part, earlier psychophysical work in related areas relevant to picture coding is briefly reviewed. Certain simple measures of luminance activity (called the masking functions) are constructed. Subjective experiments which obtain fidelity measures related to the masking functions, using complex scenes (real-life pictures, head and shoulders view), are described. These relationships, called the visibility functions, express relationship between the relative amplitude accuracy required by the viewer and the masking functions. Perceptual, statistical, and contextual properties are inherent in them. Relationship between the visibility functions and some earlier measurements of psychovisual weighting functions are pointed out. In the second part, several adaptation strategies for the quantizer of a predictive DPCM coder are discussed. These include uniform as well as nonuniform quantizers with or without entropy constraints. These strategies are simulated on a computer, and the results are presented in the third part. The simulations indicate that, for the same picture quality, by using adaptive strategies, entropy reductions of about 30-50 percent are possible over nonadaptive techniques."

                "text": "Efficient, simple, and lossless methods for encoding and transmitting grey-scale and binary (B/W) pictures are described. The methods are such that an initial segment of the transmission permits the receiving device to construct an approximate picture; as transmission proceeds, the receiver progressively constructs better approximations. Some of the low-bandwidth channel usages include telebrowsing -where one wants to abort transmission of unwanted pictures as soon as they are recognized, and teleconferencing-where one wants to receive a gestalt first, followed by the details. In the method for grey-scale pictures, the transmitter first defines a hierarchical structure of picture subdivisions, and assigns, simply by table lookup, approximate average light values to all pairs of cells from the smallest size to that encompassing the entire picture. During tranmission the latter \"primary\" value is sent, followed by numbers which permit successive cell splitting, thus producing progressively finer picture representations in approximate values, culminating in an exact reconstruction at the pel level. A picture of p pels quantized into b bits each is perfectly reconstructed upon receipt of exactly b \u00d7 p bits. If the recipient deems an intermediate version satisfactory, then \"picture compression\" is effectively achieved. This scheme thus provides some of the benefits of transform encoding (Fourier, Hadamard, Hotelling, singular-value decomposition) but with no truncation error and no need for handling coefficients of various sizes. Furthermore, computation varies only linearly with number of pels. The method for binary (B/W) pictures also involves a hierarchical structuring of the picture but with attention paid to picture compression-by declaring subdivisions, at as high a level as possible, to be solid black or solid white (and in need of no further description). Compressions thus achieved are 8:1 in cases where the \"blob\" coding method of Frank gives 11\u00bd:1"

How does the perceived information vary with display signal-to-noise ratio. What perceptual effect does a change in display luminance have on the perceived information.

These energy resources and, in particular, the oil and natural gas deposits have now become the apple of discord in Central Asia introducing a new chapter in the Great Game of control over Eurasia (Hill 1997: 200). The region has great energy potential and is strategically important. The United States has varied and at times competing interests in Central Asia. In the past few years, real and present dangers to the U.S. national security especially Islamist terrorism and threats to the energy supply, have affected the U.S. policy in Central Asia. The region, which includes the five post-Soviet states of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan, as well as Afghanistan and the Caspian basin, plays an important part in the U.S. global strategy in view of its proximity to Russia, China, India, Pakistan, Iran, and other key regional actors. No less important are its ethno-religious composition and vast deposits of oil, gas, coal, and uranium. Literally, the U.S. interests in Central Asia can be summarized in three simple words: security, energy, and democracy. Moreover, a key U.S. national security concern is the"
