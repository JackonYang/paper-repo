Our segmentation method proceeds by minimizing the ratio between the exterior boundary cost and the enclosed interior benefit using a computationally efficient graph partitioning algorithm. Our interest is motivated by very efficient algorithms for finding the globally optimum solution, and a desire to investigate how weak smoothness constraints may be globally imposed without disallowing very high local curvature. We analyze the performance of the approach, indicating both strengths and weaknesses, and discuss its connections with prior image partitioning algorithms. The relationship with snakes is discussed in detail and it is shown how to efficiently compute an approximation to common snakes under the additional constraint that it enclose a given point. When user interaction is available, there is a clear advantage to minimizing user interaction for purposes of improved speed and ease of use and for robustness. \"Ratio regions\" can accommodate several levels of user interaction and it is empirically shown that very coarse initializations can be tolerated. User interaction not only guides the algorithm to perceptually salient regions but can also be exploited to significantly reduce the computational cost."

Recently, a number of authors have demonstrated good performance on this task using methods that are based on eigenvectors of the affinity matrix. These approaches are extremely attractive in that they are based on simple eigendecomposition algorithms whose stability is well understood. Nevertheless, the use of eigendecompositions in the context of segmentation is far from well understood. In this paper we give a unified treatment of these algorithms, and show the close connections between them while highlighting their distinguishing features. We then prove results on eigenvectors of block matrices that allow us to analyze the performance of these algorithms in simple grouping settings. Finally, we use our analysis to motivate a variation on the existing methods that combines aspects from different eigenvector segmentation algorithms. We illustrate our analysis with results on real and synthetic images."

Rather than focusing on local features and their consistencies in the image data, our approach aims at extracting the global impression of an image. We treat image segmentation as a graph partitioning problem and propose a novel global criterion, the normalized cut, for segmenting the graph. The normalized cut criterion measures both the total dissimilarity between the different groups as well as the total similarity within the groups. We show that an efficient computational technique based on a generalized eigenvalue problem can be used to optimize this criterion. We have applied this approach to segmenting static images and found results very encouraging."

The data to be clustered are represented by an undirected adjacency graph G with arc capacities assigned to reflect the similarity between the linked vertices. Clustering is achieved by removing arcs of G to form mutually exclusive subgraphs such that the largest inter-subgraph maximum flow is minimized. For graphs of moderate size ( approximately 2000 vertices), the optimal solution is obtained through partitioning a flow and cut equivalent tree of G, which can be efficiently constructed using the Gomory-Hu algorithm (1961). However for larger graphs this approach is impractical. New theorems for subgraph condensation are derived and are then used to develop a fast algorithm which hierarchically constructs and partitions a partially equivalent tree of much reduced size. This algorithm results in an optimal solution equivalent to that obtained by partitioning the complete equivalent tree and is able to handle very large graphs with several hundred thousand vertices. The new clustering algorithm is applied to the image segmentation problem. The segmentation is achieved by effectively searching for closed contours of edge elements (equivalent to minimum cuts in G), which consist mostly of strong edges, while rejecting contours containing isolated strong edges. This method is able to accurately locate region boundaries and at the same time guarantees the formation of closed edge contours. >"

Given a set of training images of an object in context, a learning process decides on the relative importance of the basic Gestalt relationships such as proximity, parallelness, similarity, symmetry, closure, and common region towards segregating the object from the background. This learning is accomplished using a team of stochastic automata in a N-player cooperative game framework. The grouping process which is based on graph partitioning is able to form large groups from relationships defined over a small set of primitives and is fast. We demonstrate the robust performance of the growing system on a variety of real images. Among the interesting conclusions is the significant role of photometric attributes in grouping and the ability to perform figure-ground segmentation from a set of local relations, each defined over a small number of primitives."

In particular, we propose and exemplify an approximate fuzzy c-means (AFCM) implementation based upon replacing the necessary ``exact'' variates in the FCM equation with integer-valued or real-valued estimates. This approximation enables AFCM to exploit a lookup table approach for computing Euclidean distances and for exponentiation. The net effect of the proposed implementation is that CPU time during each iteration is reduced to approximately one sixth of the time required for a literal implementation of the algorithm, while apparently preserving the overall quality of terminal clusters produced. The two implementations are tested numerically on a nine-band digital image, and a pseudocode subroutine is given for the convenience of applications-oriented readers. Our results suggest that AFCM may be used to accelerate FCM processing whenever the feature space is comprised of tuples having a finite number of integer-valued coordinates."

Pixel gray levels and the presence and orientation of edges are viewed as states of atoms or molecules in a lattice-like physical system. The assignment of an energy function in the physical system determines its Gibbs distribution. Because of the Gibbs distribution, Markov random field (MRF) equivalence, this assignment also determines an MRF image model. The energy function is a more convenient and natural mechanism for embodying picture attributes than are the local characteristics of the MRF. For a range of degradation mechanisms, including blurring, nonlinear deformations, and multiplicative or additive noise, the posterior distribution is an MRF with a structure akin to the image model. By the analogy, the posterior distribution defines another (imaginary) physical system. Gradual temperature reduction in the physical system isolates low energy states (``annealing''), or what is the same thing, the most probable states under the Gibbs distribution. The analogous operation under the posterior distribution yields the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the image given the degraded observations. The result is a highly parallel ``relaxation'' algorithm for MAP estimation. We establish convergence properties of the algorithm and we experiment with some simple pictures, for which good restorations are obtained at low signal-to-noise ratios."

For general linear elliptic partial differential equation (PDE) systems with piecewise smooth coefficients in general domains discretized by uniform grids, it is proved that, in the limit of small meshsizes, these predicted factors are indeed obtained, provided the cycle is supplemented with a proper processing at and near the boundaries. That processing, it is proved, costs negligible extra computer work. Apart from mode analysis, a coarse grid approximation (CGA) condition is introduced which is both necessary and sufficient for the multigrid algorithm to work properly. The present part studies the $L_2 $ convergence in one cycle for equations with constant coefficients. In the sequel [Brandt, Rigorous quantitative analysis of multigrid, II: Extensions and practical implications, manuscript] extensions are discussed to many cycles (asymptotic convergence), to more levels with arbitrary cycle ty..."
