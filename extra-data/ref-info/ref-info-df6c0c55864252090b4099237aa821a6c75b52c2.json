Recognition is based on matching surfaces by matching points using the spin-image representation. The spin-image is a data level shape descriptor that is used to match surfaces represented as surface meshes. We present a compression scheme for spin-images that results in efficient multiple object recognition which we verify with results showing the simultaneous recognition of multiple objects from a library of 20 models. Furthermore, we demonstrate the robust performance of recognition in the presence of clutter and occlusion through analysis of recognition trials on 100 scenes."

In particular, the design of a good representation suitable to model large numbers of generic objects that is also robust to occlusion has been a stumbling block in achieving success. In this paper, we propose a representation using appearance-based parts and relations to overcome these problems. Appearance-based parts and relations are defined in terms of closed regions and the union of these regions, respectively. The regions are segmented using the MDL principle, and their appearance is obtained from collection of images and compactly represented by parametric manifolds in the two eigenspaces spanned by the parts and the relations."

The scene may contain several overlapping objects, arbitrarily positioned and oriented. A laser range scanner is used to collect three-dimensional (3D) data points from the scene. The collected data is segmented into surface patches, and the segments are used to calculate various 3D surface properties. The CAD models are designed using commercially available CADKEY and accessed via the industry standard IGES. The models are analyzed off-line to derive various geometric features, their relationships, and their attributes. A strategy for identifying each model is then automatically generated and stored. The strategy is applied at run-time to complete the task of object recognition. The goal of the generated strategy is to select the model\u2032s geometric features in the sequence which may best be used to identify and locate the model in the scene. The generated strategy is guided by several factors, such as the visibility, detectability, the frequency of occurrence, and the topology of the features. The paper concludes with examples of the generated strategies and their application to object recognition in several scenes containing multiple objects."

The approach uses two different types of primitives for matching: small surface patches, where differential properties can be reliably computed, and lines corresponding to depth or orientation discontinuities. These are represented by splashes and 3-D curves, respectively. It is shown how both of these primitives can be encoded by a set of super segments, consisting of connected linear segments. These super segments are entered into a table and provide the essential mechanism for fast retrieval and matching. The issues of robustness and stability of the features are addressed in detail. The acquisition of the 3-D models is performed automatically by computing splashes in highly structured areas of the objects and by using boundary and surface edges for the generation of 3-D curves. The authors present results with the current system (3-D object recognition based on super segments) and discuss further extensions. >"

We assume that a range image of a scene is available, containing a view of a rigid 3D object without occlusion. We propose a new and general surface representation scheme for recognizing objects with free-form (sculpted) surfaces. In this scheme, an object is described concisely in terms of maximal surface patches of constant shape index. The maximal patches that represent the object are mapped onto the unit sphere via their orientations, and aggregated via shape spectral functions. Properties such as surface area, curvedness, and connectivity, which are required to capture local and global information, are also built into the representation. The scheme yields a meaningful and rich description useful for object recognition. A novel concept, the shape spectrum of an object is also introduced within the framework of COSMOS for object view grouping and matching. We demonstrate the generality and the effectiveness of our scheme using real range images of complex objects."

                "text": "Surface matching is the process that compares surfaces and decides whether they are similar. In three-dimensional (3-D) computer vision, surface matching plays a prominent role. Surface matching can be used for object recognition; by comparing two surfaces, an association between a known object and sensed data is established. By computing the 3-D transformation that aligns two surfaces, surface matching can also be used for surface registration. Surface matching is difficult because the coordinate system in which to compare two surfaces is undefined. The typical approach to surface matching is to transform the surfaces being compared into representations where comparison of surfaces is straightforward. Surface matching is further complicated by characteristics of sensed data, including clutter, occlusion and sensor noise. This thesis describes a data level representation of surfaces used for surface matching. In our representation, surface shape is described by a dense collection of oriented points, 3-D points with surface normal. Using a single point basis constructed from an oriented point, the position of other points on the surface can be described by two parameters. The accumulation of these parameters for many points on the surface results in an image at each oriented point. These images, localized descriptions of the global shape of the surface, are invariant to rigid transformations. Through correlation of images, point correspondences between two surfaces can be established. When two surfaces have many point correspondences, they match. Taken together, the oriented points and associated images make up our surface representation. Because the image generation process can be visualized as a sheet spinning about the normal of a point, the images in our representation are called spin-images . Spin-images combine the descriptive nature of global object properties with the robustness to partial views and clutter of local shape descriptions. Through adjustment of spin-image generation parameters, spin-images can be smoothly transformed from global to local representations. Since they are object-centered representations, spin-images can be compared without alignment of surfaces. However, spin-images are constructed with respect to specific surface points, so they can also be used to align surfaces. Because spin-images are constructed without surface fitting or optimization, they are simple to construct and analyze. We demonstrate the usefulness of spin-images by applying them to two problems in 3-D computer vision. First we show that surface registration using spin-images is accurate enough to build complete models of objects from multiple range images. Without a calibrated image acquisition system, we have built twenty models of objects with complicated shapes. We also apply spin-images to the problem of recognizing complete 3-D models of objects in partial scenes containing clutter and occlusion. Using spin-images, we have simultaneously recognized multiple objects from a library containing twenty models. We also verify experimentally that spin-image matching is robust to scene clutter by recognizing objects in 100 scenes containing clutter and occlusion."

We analyze the task requirements in terms of what information needs to be represented, how to represent it, what kind of paradigms can be used to process it, and how to implement the paradigms. We describe shape surfaces by curves and patches, which we represent by linear primitives, such as points, lines, and planes. Next we describe algo rithms to construct this representation from range data. We then propose the paradigm of recognizing objects while locat ing them. We analyze the basic constraint of rigidity that can be exploited, which we implement as a prediction and verifi cation scheme that makes efficient use of the representation. Results are presented for data obtained from a laser range finder, but both the shape representation and the matching algorithm are general and can be used for other types of data, such as ultrasound, stereo, and tactile."

In this representation, the weight associated with each outward surface normal is a complex weight. The normal distance of the surface from the predefined origin is encoded as the phase of the weight, whereas the magnitude of the weight is the visible area of the surface. This approach decouples the orientation and translation determination into two distinct least-squares problems. The justification for using such a scheme is twofold: it not only allows the pose of the object to be extracted, but it also distinguishes a convex object from a nonconvex object having the same EGI representation. The CEGI scheme has the advantage of not requiring explicit spatial object-model surface correspondence in determining object orientation and translation. Experiments involving synthetic data of two polyhedral and two smooth objects are presented to illustrate the feasibility of this method. >"

In this work, we address the problem of merging multiple textured 3-D data sets, each of which corresponds to a different view of a scene or object. There are two steps to the merging process: registration and integration. To register, or align, data sets we use a modified version of the Iterative Closest Point algorithm; our version, which we call color ICP, considers not only 3-D information, but color as well. We show that the use of color decreases registration error by an order of magnitude. Once the 3-D data sets have been registered we integrate them to produce a seamless, composite 3-D textured model. Our approach to integration uses a 3-D occupancy grid to represent likelihood of spatial occupancy through voting. In addition to occupancy information, we store surface normal in each voxel of the occupancy grid. Surface normal is used to robustly extract a surface from the occupancy grid; on that surface we blend textures from multiple views."

                "text": "Smooth surfaces are approximated by polyhedral surfaces both for display, and for other computational purposes. This is probably the most common surface representation in computer graphics, because polygons are what the current generation of graphics hardware can display efficiently. In computer vision this representation has not been very popular for a long time, probably because it was not seen as very appropriate for object recognition and positioning applications. But it is now being used in more applications, particularly in the medical domain, where polyhedral surface approximations of unknown surfaces are routinely generated with iso-surface construction algorithms. We look at polyhedral surfaces as a generalization of digital images, where the polygon takes the place of the pixel. The polygon is the fundamental surface element. Digital images are functions defined at the nodes of a regular rectangular grid. Discrete surface signals are functions defined at the vertices of a polyhedral surface of arbitrary topology. Signal processing operations, and Fourier analysis in particular, are the fundamental tools of low level computer vision. The lack of regularity and self-similarity of arbitrary polyhedral surface meshes, as opposed to the regular rectangular grids of digital images, complicates the analysis and processing of digital surface signals. Nevertheless, in this paper we generalize Fourier analysis to discrete surface signals. As a first application of this theory we consider the problem of surface smoothing, which corresponds to low-pass filtering within this framework. As in the classical cases of one-dimensional signals, and of digital images, the analysis of discrete surface signals is reduced to matrix analysis, and matrix computation techniques are used to achieve fast discrete surface signal processing operations. We intend to continue along this line of research in the near future, extending higher level computer vision operations to arbitrary polyhedral surfaces."

The resolution of a surface mesh is the overall spacing between vertices that comprise the mesh. Because sensed 3-D points are often unevenly distributed, the resolution of a surface mesh is often poorly defined. We present an algorithm that transforms a mesh with an uneven spacing between vertices into a mesh with a more even spacing between vertices, thus improving its definition of resolution. In addition, we show how the algorithm can be used to control the resolution of surface meshes, making them amenable to multiresolution approaches in computer vision. The structure of our algorithm is modeled on iterative mesh simplification algorithms common in computer graphics; however, the individual steps in our algorithm are designed specifically to control mesh resolution. An even spacing between vertices is generated by applying a sequence of local edge operations that promote uniform edge lengths while preserving mesh shape. To account for polyhedral objects, we introduce an accurate shape change measure that permits edge operations along sharp creases. By locally bounding the total change in mesh shape, drastic changes in global shape are prevented. We show results from many 3-D sensing domains including computed tomography, range imaging, and digital elevation map construction."

By generalizing classical discrete Fourier analysis to two-dimensional discrete surface signals \u2013 functions defined on polyhedral surfaces of arbitrary topology \u2013, we reduce the problem of surface smoothing, or fairing, to low-pass filtering. We describe a very simple surface signal low-pass filter algorithm that applies to surfaces of arbitrary topology. As opposed to other existing optimization-based fairing methods, which are computationally more expensive, this is a linear time and space complexity algorithm. With this algorithm, fairing very large surfaces, such as those obtained from volumetric medical data, becomes affordable. By combining this algorithm with surface subdivision methods we obtain a very effective fair surface design technique. We then extend the analysis, and modify the algorithm accordingly, to accommodate different types of constraints. Some constraints can be imposed without any modification of the algorithm, while others require the solution of a small associated linear system of equations. In particular, vertex location constraints, vertex normal constraints, and surface normal discontinuities across curves embedded in the surface, can be imposed with this technique. CR"

Unfortunately, the complexity of most existing search algorithms, such as k-d tree and R-tree, grows exponentially with dimension, making them impractical for dimensionality above 15. In nearly all applications, the closest point is of interest only if it lies within a user specified distance /spl epsiv/. We present a simple and practical algorithm to efficiently search for the nearest neighbor within Euclidean distance /spl epsiv/. Our algorithm uses a projection search technique along with a novel data structure to dramatically improve performance in high dimensions. A complexity analysis is presented which can help determine /spl epsiv/ in structured problems. Benchmarks clearly show the superiority of the proposed algorithm for high dimensional search problems frequently encountered in machine vision, such as real-time object recognition."

Probabilities conditional on events having probability 0 can- not be defined within standard probability theory. Many considered this to be a serious defect and tried to do better. Essentially four ways to deal with this problem have emerged. One method is due to Carnap; it consists in imposing his regularity condition on probability measures (cf. Carnap (1971, 1980), Section 7 and 21). However, this does not solve the problem; it is only a way of avoiding it as far as possible within standard probability theory. But the problem is unavoidable for measures on uncountable o-fields. The second method is the standard one within mathe- matics. It consists in generalizing the concept of conditional probability, i.e. in defining probabilities (and expectations) conditional on e-fields (cf., e.g., Lo~ve (1960), w w 24, 25). This method meets most of the needs of applied mathe- matics and should make us aware of the fact that the problem is a rather theoretical one. However , the probabil- ities conditional on oYfields are determined only almost uniquely (in the technical sense). Thus, I think, this method does not count as a fundamental solution of our problem. Another method is to do probability theory within the framework of nonstandard analysis (cf. Loeb, 1979). With- in this framework division by infinitesimals is defined. Thus, if non-empty events get at least infinitesimal instead of zero probability, probabilities conditional on them can also be defined. Without doubt, this method should be taken seriously. But nonstandard analysis is a very intricate matter, and I won't dwell upon this method here. The fourth method, developed independently by Popper and R~nyi, is the one I want to deal with. It consists in construing conditional probability not as a derived, but as a fundamental concept and in looking for a suitable set of axioms for it; absolute probabilities are then defined as probabilities conditional on the sure event. The simplest axiomatics that has emerged is comprised in the following"
