In this survey, we have attempted to take a fresh look at the potential role of the holistic paradigm in handwritten word recognition. The survey begins with an overview of studies of reading which provide evidence for the existence of a parallel holistic reading process,in both developing and skilled readers. In what we believe is a fresh perspective on handwriting recognition, approaches to recognition are characterized as forming a continuous spectrum based on the visual complexity of the unit of recognition employed and an attempt is made to interpret well-known paradigms of word recognition in this framework. An overview of features, methodologies, representations, and matching techniques employed by holistic approaches is presented."

Easy access to such collections requires an index, which is currently created manually at great cost. Because automatic handwriting recognizers fail on historical manuscripts, the word spotting technique has been developed: the words in a collection are matched as images and grouped into clusters which contain all instances of the same word. By annotating \"interesting\" clusters, an index that links words to the locations where they occur can be built automatically. Due to the noise in historical documents, selecting the right features for matching words is crucial. We analyzed a range of features suitable for matching words using dynamic time warping (DTW), which aligns and compares sets of features extracted from two images. Each feature's individual performance was measured on a test set. With an average precision of 72%, a combination of features outperforms competing techniques in speed and precision."

Key ideas employed in each functional module, which have been developed for dealing with the diversity of handwriting in its various aspects with a goal of system reliability and robustness, are described in this paper.

Convenient access to a collection requires an index, which is manually created at great labor and expense. Since current handwriting recognizers do not perform well on historical documents, a technique called word spotting has been developed: clusters with occurrences of the same word in a collection are established using image matching. By annotating \"interesting\" clusters, an index can be built automatically. We present an algorithm for matching handwritten words in noisy historical documents. The segmented word images are preprocessed to create sets of 1-dimensional features, which are then compared using dynamic time warping. We present experimental results on two different data sets from the George Washington collection. Our experiments show that this algorithm performs better and is faster than competing matching techniques."

The higher recognition rates for isolated characters vs. those obtained for words and connected character strings well illustrate this fact. A good part of recent progress in reading unconstrained printed and written text may be ascribed to more insightful handling of segmentation. This paper provides a review of these advances. The aim is to provide an appreciation for the range of techniques that have been developed, rather than to simply list sources. Segmentation methods are listed under four main headings. What may be termed the \"classical\" approach consists of methods that partition the input image into subimages, which are then classified. The operation of attempting to decompose the image into classifiable units is called \"dissection.\" The second class of methods avoids dissection, and segments the image either explicitly, by classification of prespecified windows, or implicitly by classification of subsets of spatial features collected from the image as a whole. The third strategy is a hybrid of the first two, employing dissection together with recombination rules to define potential segments, but using classification to select from the range of admissible segmentation possibilities offered by these subimages. Finally, holistic approaches that avoid segmentation by recognizing entire character strings as units are described."

A visual word spotting scheme that would serve these purposes is a challenging task even when the transcription of the document image is available. We propose a framework for mapping each word in the transcript to the associated word image in the document. Coarse word mapping based on document constraints is used for lexicon reduction. Then, word mappings are refined using word recognition results by a dynamic programming algorithm that finds the best match while satisfying the constraints."

Both the online case (which pertains to the availability of trajectory data during writing) and the off-line case (which pertains to scanned images) are considered. Algorithms for preprocessing, character and word recognition, and performance with practical systems are indicated. Other fields of application, like signature verification, writer authentification, handwriting learning tools are also considered."

The kernel of the system is a hidden Markov model (HMM) for handwriting recognition. The HMM is enhanced by a statistical language model. Thus linguistic knowledge beyond the lexicon level is incorporated in the recognition process. Another novel feature of the system is that the HMM is applied in such a way that the difficult problem of segmenting a line of text into individual words is avoided. A number of experiments with various language models and large vocabularies have been conducted. The language models used in the system were also analytically compared based on their perplexity."

Direct retrieval of documents using n-gram databases of 2 and 3-grams or 2, 3, 4 and 5-grams resulted in improved retrieval performance over standard (word based) queries on the same data when a level of 10 percent degradation or worse was achieved. A second method of using n-grams to identify appropriate matching and near matching terms for query expansion which also performed better than using standard queries is also described. This method was less effective than direct n-gram query formulations but can likely be improved with alternative query component weighting schemes and measures of term similarity. Finally, a web based retrieval application using n-gram retrieval of OCR text and display, with query term highlighting, of the source document image is described."

SDR involves the search and retrieval of excerpts from spoken audio recordings using a combination of automatic speech recognition and information retrieval technologies. The TREC SDR Track has provided an infrastructure for the development and evaluation of SDR technology and a common forum for the exchange of knowledge between the speech recognition and information retrieval research communities. The SDR Track can be declared a success in that it has provided objective, demonstrable proof that this technology can be successfully applied to realistic audio collections using a combination of existing technologies and that it can be objectively evaluated. The design and implementation of each of the SDR evaluations are presented and the results are summarized. Plans for the 2000 TREC SDR Track are presented and thoughts about how the track might evolve are discussed."

                "text": "Mental states correspond to physical changes in the brain. The object of this paper is to inquire into the time needed to bring about changes in the brain, and thus to determine the rapidity of thought. When waves in the luminiferous ether of a particular length strike the retina a red light is seen, but a certain time passes after the waves have struck the retina before the light is seen: (1) It takes time for the light waves to work on the retina, and generate in the cells a nervous impulse corresponding to the nature of the light; (2) it takes time for the nervous impulse to be conveyed along the optic nerve to the brain; (3) it takes time for the nervous impulse to be conveyed through the brain to the visual centre; and (4) it takes time for the nervous impulse to bring about changes in the visual centre corresponding to its own nature, and consequently to the nature of the external stimulus. When these changes are brought about a red light is seen. It does not take any time for a sensation or perception to arise after the proper changes in the brain have been brought about. The sensation of a red light is a state of consciousness corresponding to a certain condition of the brain. The chemical changes in a galvanic battery take time, but after they are brought about, no additional time is needed to produce the electric current. The current is the product of chemical changes in the battery, but at the same time the immediate representative of these changes; and the relation is so far analogous between states of consciousness and changes in the brain. Again, as it takes time to see a light, so it takes time to make a motion. Changes in the brain, the origin and nature of which we do not understand (physiologically they are part of the continuous life of the brain, mentally they are often given in continuous life of the brain, mentally they are often given in consciousness as a will-impulse), excite the centre for the coordination of motions. The impulse there developed is conveyed through the brain (and it may be spinal cord) to a motor nerve, and along the nerve to the muscle, which is contracted in accordance with the will-impulse. We have here in the reverse direction the same four periods as in the case of a stimulus giving rise to a sensation. In each case there is the latent period in the sense-organ or muscle, the centripetal or centrifugal time in the nerve, the centripetal or centrifugal time in the brain, and the time of growing energy in the sensory or motor centre. Besides these [p. 221] two classes of processes, the one centripetal, the other centrifugal, there are centrimanent cerebral operations, some of which are given in consciousness, and make up the mental life of thought and feeling. These cerebral changes all take time, and, as I shall show, the times can in many cases be determined."
