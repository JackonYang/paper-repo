Properties of the mean shift are reviewed and its convergence on lattices is proven. The proposed filtering method associates with each pixel in the image the closest local mode in the density distribution of the joint domain. Segmentation into a piecewise constant structure requires only one more step, fusion of the regions associated with nearby modes. The proposed technique has two parameters controlling the resolution in the spatial and range domains. Since convergence is guaranteed, the technique does not require the intervention of the user to stop the filtering at the desired image quality. Several examples, for gray and color images, show the versatility of the method and compare favorably with results described in the literature for the same images."

The first one is completely nonparametric and is based on the the adaptive estimation of the normalized density gradient. Employing the sample point estimator, we define the Variable Bandwidth Mean Shift, prove its convergence, and show its superiority over the fixed bandwidth procedure. The second technique has a semiparametric nature and imposes a local structure on the data to extract reliable scale information. The local scale of the underlying density is taken as the bandwidth which maximizes the magnitude of the normalized mean shift vector. Both estimators provide practical tools for autonomous image and quasi real-time video analysis and several examples are shown to illustrate their effectiveness."

This is achieved by repeatedly convolving the signal with a very small averaging filter modulated by a measure of the signal discontinuity at each point. This process is related to the anisotropic diffusion reported by P. Perona and J. Malik (1987) but it has a much simpler formulation and is not subject to instability or divergence. Real examples show how this approach can be applied to the smoothing of various types of signals. The detected features do not move, and thus no tracking is needed. The last property makes it possible to derive a novel scale-space representation of a signal using a small number of scales. Finally, this process is easily implemented on parallel architectures: the running time on a 16 K connection machine is three orders of magnitude faster than on a serial machine.<<ETX>>"

                "text": "The problem of segmenting images of objects with smooth surfaces is considered. The algorithm we present is a generalization of the ,K-means clustering algorithm to include spatial constraints and to account for local intensity variations in the image. Spatial constraints are included by the use of a Gibbs random field model. Local intensity variations are accounted for in a n iterative procedure involving averaging over a sliding window whose size decreases as the algorithm progresses. Results with an eight-neighbor Gibbs random field model applied to pictures of industrial objects, buildings, aerial photographs, optical characters, and faces, show that the algorithm performs better than the K-means algorithm and its nonadaptive extensions that incorporate spatial constraints by the use of Gibbs random fields. A hierarchical implementation is also presented and results in better performance and faster speed of execution. The segmented images are caricatures of the originals which preserve the most significant features, while removing unimportant details. They can be used in image recognition and as crude representations of the image. The caricatures are easy to display or print using a few grey levels and can be coded very efficiently. In particular, segmentation of faces results in binary sketches which preserve the main characteristics of the face, so that it is easily recognizable. I. INTRODUCTION E present a technique for segmenting a grey-scale image (typically 2.56 levels) into regions of uniform or slowly varying intensity. The segmented image consists of very few levels (typically 2-4). each denoting a different region, as shown in Fig. 1. It is a sketch, or caricature, of the original image which preserves its most significant features, while removing unimportant details. It can thus be the first stage of an image recognition system. However, assuming that the segmented image retains the intelligibility of the original, it can also be used as a crude representation of the image. The caricature has the advantage that it is easy to display or print with very few grey levels. The number of levels is crucial for special display media like paper, cloth, and binary computer screens. Also, the caricature can be coded very efficiently , since we only have to code the transitions between a few grey levels. We develop an algorithm that separates the pixels in the image into clusters based on both their intensity and their"

We contend that this problem can be tackled by mapping the pixels into various feature-spaces, whereupon they are subjected to a grouping algorithm. In this paper we develop a robust and versatile nonparametric clustering algorithm that is able to handle the unbalanced and highly irregular clusters encountered in such CBIR applications. The strength of our approach lies not so much in the clustering itself, but rather in the definition and use of two cluster-validity indices that are independent of the cluster topology. By combining them, an optimal clustering can be identified, and experiments confirm that the associated clusters do, indeed, correspond to perceptually salient image regions."

We assume that a preferable texture pattern is known (e.g., the pattern that we want to distinguish from the rest of the image). The textured feature space is generated by filtering the input and the preferable pattern image using Gabor filters, and analyzing their responses as multi-component conditional probability density functions. The texture segmentation is obtained by minimizing a Geodesic Active Contour Model objective function where the boundary-based information is expressed via discontinuities on the statistical space associated with the multi-modal textured feature space. This function is minimized using a gradient descent method where the obtained PDE is implemented using a level set approach, that handles naturally the topological changes. Finally a fast method is used for the level set implementation. The performance of our method is demonstrated on a variety of synthetic and real textured images."

Due to its general nature, various clustering and subspace-finding algorithms can be used.

The first type is the popular kernel method (and several of its variants) which uses locally tuned radial basis (e.g., Gaussian) functions to interpolate the multidimensional density; the second type is based on an exploratory projection pursuit technique which interprets the multidimensional density through the construction of several 1D densities along highly \"interesting\" projections of multidimensional data. Performance evaluations using training data from mixture Gaussian and mixture Cauchy densities are presented. The results show that the curse of dimensionality and the sensitivity of control parameters have a much more adverse impact on the kernel density estimators than on the projection pursuit density estimators. >"

This algorithm is derived by minimizing a generalized Bayes/minimum description length (MDL) criterion using the variational principle. The algorithm is guaranteed to converge to a local minimum and combines aspects of snakes/balloons and region growing. The classic snakes/balloons and region growing algorithms can be directly derived from our approach. We provide theoretical analysis of region competition including accuracy of boundary location, criteria for initial conditions, and the relationship to edge detection using filters. It is straightforward to generalize the algorithm to multiband segmentation and we demonstrate it on gray level images, color images and texture images. The novel color model allows us to eliminate intensity gradients and shadows, thereby obtaining segmentation based on the albedos of objects. It also helps detect highlight regions."

As the region boundaries in the approach remain sharp, a high-quality edge detector which successfully exploits global information is obtained. Experimental results are shown on a number of images.

The mixture distribution is viewed as a contaminated Gaussian density. Using this model and the model-fitting (MF) estimator, we propose a recursive algorithm called the Gaussian mixture density decomposition (GMDD) algorithm for successively identifying each Gaussian component in the mixture. The proposed decomposition scheme has advantages that are desirable but lacking in most existing techniques. In the GMDD algorithm the number of components does not need to be specified a priori, the proportion of noisy data in the mixture can be large, the parameter estimation of each component is virtually initial independent, and the variability in the shape and size of the component densities in the mixture is taken into account. Gaussian mixture density modeling and decomposition has been widely applied in a variety of disciplines that require signal or waveform characterization for classification and recognition. We apply the proposed GMDD algorithm to the identification and extraction of clusters, and the estimation of unknown probability densities. Probability density estimation by identifying a decomposition using the GMDD algorithm, that is, a superposition of normal distributions, is successfully applied to automated cell classification. Computer experiments using both real data and simulated data demonstrate the validity and power of the GMDD algorithm for various models and different noise assumptions."

Computer vision algorithms that are intended to form part of a perceptual user interface must be fast and efficient. They must be able to track in real time and yet not absorb a major share of computational resources. An efficient, new algorithm is described here based on the mean shift algorithm. The mean shift algorithm robustly finds the mode (peak) of probability distributions. We first describe histogram based methods of producing object probability distributions. In our case, we want to track the mode of an object's probability distribution within a video scene. Since the probability distribution of the object can change and move dynamically in time, the mean shift algorithm is modified to deal with dynamically changing probability distributions. The modified algorithm is called the Continuously Adaptive Mean Shift (CAMSHIFT) algorithm. CAMSHIFT is then used as an interface for games and graphics."

A user defined image scale is the only significant control parameter that is needed by the algorithm.

The method involves 'sharpening' the data by making them slightly more clustered than before, and then computing the estimator in the usual way, but from the sharpened data rather than the original data. The transformation depends in a simple, explicit way on the smoothing parameter employed for the density estimator, which may be based on classical kernel methods, orthogonal series, histosplines, singular integrals or other linear or approximately-linear methods. Bias is reduced by an order of magnitude, at the expense of a constant-factor increase in variance."

These methods are based on choosing the bandwidth to (approximately) minimize good quality estimates of the mean integrated squared error.

The concepts of an optimal number of features, representativeness of the training data, and the need to avoid overfitting to the training data are stressed. The chapter shows that methods such as the support vector machine and artificial neural networks are subject to these same training limitations, although each has its advantages. For neural networks, the multilayer perceptron architecture and back-propagation algorithm are described. The chapter distinguishes between supervised and unsupervised learning, demonstrating the advantages of the latter and showing how methods such as clustering and principal components analysis fit into the SPR framework. The chapter also defines the receiver operating characteristic, which allows an optimum balance between false positives and false negatives to be achieved."

The detected regions are homogeneous and surrounded by closed edge contours. Previous approaches to multiscale segmentation represent an image at different scales using a scale-space. However, structure is only represented implicitly in this representation, structures at coarser scales are inherently smoothed, and the problem of structure extraction is unaddressed. This paper argues that the issues of scale selection and structure detection cannot be treated separately. A new concept of scale is presented that represents image structures at different scales, and not the image itself. This scale is integrated into a nonlinear transform which makes structure explicit in the transformed domain. Structures that are stable (locally invariant) to changes in scale are identified as being perceptually relevant. The transform can be viewed as collecting spatially distributed evidence for edges and regions, and making it available at contour locations, thereby facilitating integrated detection of edges and regions without restrictive models of geometry or homogeneity. In this sense, it performs Gestalt analysis. All scale parameters of the transform are automatically determined, and the structure of any arbitrary geometry can be identified without any smoothing, even at coarse scales."

Specifically, we show that anisotropic diffusion can be seen as a robust estimation procedure that estimates a piecewise smooth image from a noisy input image. The \"edge-stopping\" function in the anisotropic diffusion equation is closely related to the error norm and influence function in the robust estimation framework. This connection leads to a new \"edge-stopping\" function based on Tukey's biweight robust estimator that preserves sharper boundaries than previous formulations and improves the automatic stopping of the diffusion. The robust statistical interpretation also provides a means for detecting the boundaries (edges) between the piecewise smooth regions in an image that has been smoothed with anisotropic diffusion. Additionally, we derive a relationship between anisotropic diffusion and regularization with line processes. Adding constraints on the spatial organization of the line processes allows us to develop new anisotropic diffusion equations that result in a qualitative improvement in the continuity of edges."

The algorithm exploits the color information in the L*u*v* space, and combines it with the motion information to separate moving objects from the background. A non-parametric gradient- based iterative color clustering algorithm, called the mean shift algorithm, is first employed to provide robust homogeneous color regions according to dominant colors. Next, moving regions are identified by a motion detection method, which is developed based on the frame intensity difference to circumvent the motion estimation complexity for the whole frame. Only moving regions are analyzed by a region-based affine motion model, and tracked to increase the temporal and spatial consistency of extracted objects. The final shape is optimized for MPEG-4 coding efficiency by using a variable bandwidth region boundary. The shape coding efficiency can be improved up to 30% with negligible loss of perceptual quality. The proposed system is evaluated for several typical MPEG-4 test sequences. It provides consistent and accurate object boundaries throughout the entire test sequences."

The textured feature space is generated by filtering the given textured images using isotropic and anisotropic filters, and analyzing their responses as multi-component conditional probability density functions. The texture segmentation is obtained by unifying region and boundary based information as an improved Geodesic Active Contour Model. The defined objective function is minimized using a gradient-descent method where a level set approach is used to implement the obtained PDE. According to this PDE, the curve propagation towards the final solution is guided by boundary and region based segmentation forces, and is constrained by a regularity force. The level set implementation is performed using a fast front propagation algorithm where topological changes are naturally handled. The performance of our method is demonstrated on a variety of synthetic and real textured frames."

We present a novel non-parametric background model and a background subtraction approach. The model can handle situations where the background of the scene is cluttered and not completely static but contains small motions such as tree branches and bushes. The model estimates the probability of observing pixel intensity values based on a sample of intensity values for each pixel. The model adapts quickly to changes in the scene which enables very sensitive detection of moving targets. We also show how the model can use color information to suppress detection of shadows. The implementation of the model runs in real-time for both gray level and color imagery. Evaluation shows that this approach achieves very sensitive detection with very low false alarm rates."

                "text": "The primary goal of pattern recognition is supervised or unsupervised classification. Among the various frameworks in which pattern recognition has been traditionally formulated, the statistical approach has been most intensively studied and used in practice. More recently, neural network techniques and methods imported from statistical learning theory have been receiving increasing attention. The design of a recognition system requires careful attention to the following issues: definition of pattern classes, sensing environment, pattern representation, feature extraction and selection, cluster analysis, classifier design and learning, selection of training and test samples, and performance evaluation. In spite of almost 50 years of research and development in this field, the general problem of recognizing complex patterns with arbitrary orientation, location, and scale remains unsolved. New and emerging applications, such as data mining, web searching, retrieval of multimedia data, face recognition, and cursive handwriting recognition, require robust and efficient pattern recognition techniques. The objective of this review paper is to summarize and compare some of the well-known methods used in various stages of a pattern recognition system and identify research topics and applications which are at the forefront of this exciting and challenging field."

Statistical shape models enforce the prior probabilities on global, parametric deformations for each object class. Once trained, the system autonomously segments deformed shapes from the background, while not merging them with adjacent objects or shadows. The formulation can be used to group image regions based on any image homogeneity predicate; e.g., texture, color or motion. The recovered shape models can be used directly in object recognition.

The filter is noise smoothing and adapts to local changes in image statistics based on a nonstationary mean, nonstationary variance (NMNV) image model. For images degraded by a class of uncorrelated, signal-dependent noise without blur, the adaptive noise smoothing filter becomes a point processor and is similar to Lee's local statistics algorithm [16]. The filter is able to adapt itself to the nonstationary local image statistics in the presence of different types of signal-dependent noise. For multiplicative noise, the adaptive noise smoothing filter is a systematic derivation of Lee's algorithm with some extensions that allow different estimators for the local image variance. The advantage of the derivation is its easy extension to deal with various types of signal-dependent noise. Film-grain and Poisson signal-dependent restoration problems are also considered as examples. All the nonstationary image statistical parameters needed for the filter can be estimated from the noisy image and no a priori information about the original image is required."

Like traditional image pyramids these hierarchies are constructed in a number of steps on the order of log(image-size) steps. However, the structure of a hierarchy is adapted to the image content and artifacts of rigid resolution reduction are avoided. Two applications of these techniques are presented: connected component analysis of labeled images and segmentation of gray level images. In labeled images, every connected component is reduced to a separate root, with the adjacency relations among the components also extracted. In gray level images the output is a segmentation of the image into a small number of classes as well as the adjacency graph of the classes. >"

This system is valid for images of piecewise uniform dielectric objects with highlights, moving it beyond the capabilities of previous physics-based segmentation algorithms which assume uniformly colored objects. This paper presents a summary of the complete system and focuses on two extensions of it that demonstrate its interpretive capacity and applicability to more complex scenes. The first extension provides interpretations of a scene by reasoning about the likelihood of different physical characteristics of simple image regions. The second extension allows the system to handle highlights within the general framework for segmentation. The resulting segmentations and interpretations more closely match our perceptions of objects since the resulting regions correspond to coherent surfaces, even when those surfaces have multiple colors and highlights."

The input can be in the form of points, or points with an associated tangent or normal, allowing both position and direction to be corrupted by noise. Most approaches treat the problem as an interpolation problem, which is solved by fitting a surface such as a membrane or thin plate to minimize some function. We argue that these physical constraints are not sufficient, and propose to impose additional perceptual constraints such as good continuity and \"cosurfacity\". These constraints allow us to not only infer surfaces, but also to detect surface orientation discontinuities, as well as junctions, all at the same time. The approach imposes no restriction on genus, number of discontinuities, number of objects, and is noniterative. The result is in the form of three dense saliency maps for surfaces, intersections between surfaces (i.e., 3D curves), and 3D junctions, respectively. These saliency maps are then used to guide a \"marching\" process to generate a description (e.g., a triangulated mesh) making information about surfaces, space curves, and 3D junctions explicit. The traditional marching process needs to be refined as the polarity of the surface orientation is not necessarily locally consistent. These three maps are currently not integrated, and this is the topic of our ongoing research. We present results on a variety of computer-generated and real data, having varying curvature, of different genus, and multiple objects."

Given a set of noisy point correspondences in two images as obtained from two views of a static scene without correspondences, even in the presence of moving objects, our method pulls out inlier matches while rejecting outliers. Unlike most methods which optimize certain objective function, our approach does not involve initialization or any search in the parameter space, and therefore is free of the problem of local optima or poor convergence. Since no search is involved, it is unnecessary to impose simplifying assumption (such as affine camera or local planar homography) to the scene being analyzed for reducing the search complexity. Subject to the general epipolar constraint only, we detect wrong matches by establishing salient \"extremalities\" via a naval approach, 8D Tensor Voting: the input set of matches is first transformed into a sparse and discrete 8D point set. Dense tensor kernels are then applied to vote for the most salient hyperplane (normal and intercept) that captures all inliers inherent in the input. With this filtered set of matches, the normalized Eight-point Algorithm suffices for the accurate estimation of the fundamental matrix. By using efficient data structure and locality, our method is both time and space efficient despite the higher dimensionality. We demonstrate the general usefulness of our method using example image pairs (i) for aerial image analysis, (ii) with widely different views, and (iii) from non-static 3D scenes (e.g. basketball game in an indoor stadium). Each example contains a considerable amount of wrong matches."

The methods compared are least squares cross-validation, biased cross-validation, and a plug-in rule. The comparison is done by asymptotic rate of convergence to the optimum and a simulation study. It is seen that the plug-in bandwidth is usually most efficient when the underlying density is sufficiently smooth, but is less robust when there is not enough smoothness present. We believe the plug-in rule is the best of those currently available, but there is still room for improvement."

In contrast with filters that operate on the three bands of a color image separately, a bilateral filter can enforce the perceptual metric underlying the CIE-Lab color space, and smooth colors and preserve edges in a way that is tuned to human perception. Also, in contrast with standard filtering, bilateral filtering produces no phantom colors along edges in color images, and reduces phantom colors where they appear in the original image."

A new undesirable effect, which we call the \"pinhole effect\" may result when AD is introduced for the first time. A robust solution to this effect is proposed and evaluated through experimental data. The evolution of the diffused signal is analyzed through a physical model using the optical flow technique (OFT). The overall strategy is evaluated through experimental results obtained on synthetic and actual images."

However, inherent subjectivity in user perception of an image results in retrieved images that are largely irrelevant to the user. We propose a novel methodology for efficient understanding of user perception from the query image itself. Our system automatically generates a set of modified images, after the user selects object(s) of interest from the segmented query image. Our goal is to learn the retrieval parameters by modifying the segment-level description of the query image. Segment-level description includes individual segment properties as well as the inter-segment relationships. The user perception is then learnt on the basis of user feedback on this set of modified images. We demonstrate the feasibility and advantages of the proposed approach with examples. The proposed methodology of intra-query learning saves the cost of repeated database search incurred in existing relevance feedback based approaches."

In both these approaches, images are smoothed while edges are preserved. Unlike anisotropic diffusion, bilateral filtering does not involve the solution of partial differential equations and can be implemented in a single iteration. Despite the difference in implementation, both methods are designed to prevent averaging across edges while smoothing an image. Their similarity suggests they can somehow be linked. Using a generalized representation for the intensity, we show that both can be related to adaptive smoothing. As a consequence, bilateral filtering can be applied to denoise and coherence-enhance degraded images with approaches similar to anisotropic diffusion."

Our color reflection model is based on the dichromatic model for dielectric materials and on a color space, called S space, formed with three orthogonal basis functions. We transform color pixels measured in RGB into the S space and analyze color variations on objects in terms of brightness, hue and saturation which are defined in the S space. When transforming the original RGB data into the S space, we discount the scene illumination color that is estimated using a white reference plate as an active probe. As a result, the color image appears as if the scene illumination is white. Under the whitened illumination, the interface reflection clusters in the S space are all aligned with the brightness direction. The brightness, hue and saturation values exhibit a more direct correspondence to body colors and to diffuse and specular interface reflections, shading, shadows and inter-reflections than the RGB coordinates. We exploit these relationships to segment the color image, and to separate specular and diffuse interface reflections and some inter-reflections from body reflections. The proposed algorithm is effications for uniformly colored dielectric surfaces under singly colored scene illumination. Experimental results conform to our model and algorithm within the liminations discussed."

Although these areas are particularly challenging because of their complexity, the degree of regularity in such man-made structures also helps to tackle the problems. The paper presents the iterated application of the Hough transform as a means to exploit such regularities. It shows how such 'Cascaded Hough Transform' (or CHT for short) yields straight lines, vanishing points, and vanishing lines. It also illustrates how the latter assist in improving the precision of the former. The examples are based on real aerial photographs."

                "text": "Edited by three well-known and respected statisticians, this book is another on exploratory data analysis (EDA), and is part of the prestigious Wiley Series on Probability and Mathematical Statistics. The contributors, in addition to the three editors, seem to be highly competent and write in a way that conveys a healthy exuberance for the work they are doing. The first chapter is by Diaconis and serves as an introductory and motivating piece. This chapter talks about problems with drawing correct conclusions from data, and it relies heavily on the work summarized in Nisbett and Ross (1980). Anyone interested in the psychological research on decisionmaking should refer to that book, although without a glossary of the jargon, it is difficult to read. The impression created is that this first chapter will build toward an advocacy of EDA and this is largely correct. Diaconis gives us seven remedies for the all too common \"magical thinking\" (his code words for irrational thinking). Five of them are complex mixtures of general methodological or statistical techniques such as cross-validation and bootstrapping. One remedy is negative in that it advocates not reporting p-values, apparently giving up on them being interpreted correctly. The seventh remedy is titled \"remedies to come\" and this is where EDA is classified. The focus of EDA is clarified when Diaconis says \"Yet, none of the classical theories of statistics comes close to capturing what a real scientist does when exploring new data in a real scientific problem\" (p. 22). The key is the focus on analysis of new data, but the implication is that the problem area is also new. In other words, EDA appears to be most useful when there is no theory (probabilistic or otherwise). More will be said about this later. In summary, this chapter, unlike many of the others, is a little unfocused, but intellectually very interesting and stimulating. It deals more with ideas than with algorithms."
