The difficulty is particularly pronounced in activities involving human-object interactions (e.g. playing tennis), where the relevant object tends to be small or only partially visible, and the human body parts are often self-occluded. We observe, however, that objects and human poses can serve as mutual context to each other \u2013 recognizing one facilitates the recognition of the other. In this paper we propose a new random field model to encode the mutual context of objects and human poses in human-object interaction activities. We then cast the model learning task as a structure learning problem, of which the structural connectivity between the object, the overall human pose, and different body parts are estimated through a structure search approach, and the parameters of the model are estimated by a new max-margin algorithm. On a sports data set of six classes of human-object interactions [12], we show that our mutual context model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art in detecting very difficult objects and human poses."

It involves understanding scene or event, analyzing human movements, recognizing manipulable objects, and observing the effect of the human movement on those objects. While each of these perceptual tasks can be conducted independently, recognition rate improves when interactions between them are considered. Motivated by psychological studies of human perception, we present a Bayesian approach which integrates various perceptual tasks involved in understanding human-object interactions. Previous approaches to object and action recognition rely on static shape or appearance feature matching and motion analysis, respectively. Our approach goes beyond these traditional approaches and applies spatial and functional constraints on each of the perceptual elements for coherent semantic interpretation. Such constraints allow us to recognize objects and actions when the appearances are not discriminative enough. We also demonstrate the use of such constraints in recognition of actions from static images without using any motion information."

                "text": "Psychologists have proposed that many human-object interaction activities form unique classes of scenes. Recognizing these scenes is important for many social functions. To enable a computer to do this is however a challenging task. Take people-playing-musical-instrument (PPMI) as an example; to distinguish a person playing violin from a person just holding a violin requires subtle distinction of characteristic image features and feature arrangements that differentiate these two scenes. Most of the existing image representation methods are either too coarse (e.g. BoW) or too sparse (e.g. constellation models) for performing this task. In this paper, we propose a new image feature representation called \u201cgrouplet\u201d. The grouplet captures the structured information of an image by encoding a number of discriminative visual features and their spatial configurations. Using a dataset of 7 different PPMI activities, we show that grouplets are more effective in classifying and detecting human-object interactions than other state-of-the-art methods. In particular, our method can make a robust distinction between humans playing the instruments and humans co-occurring with the instruments without playing."

We formulate the problem in a multiple instance learning (MIL) framework, based on multiple feature channels. By using a discriminative approach, we join multiple feature channels embedded to the MIL space. Our experiments over the large YouTube dataset show that scene and object information can be used to complement person features for human action recognition."

This challenging but important subject has mostly been ignored in the past due to several problems one of which is the lack of realistic and annotated video datasets. Our first contribution is to address this limitation and to investigate the use of movie scripts for automatic annotation of human actions in videos. We evaluate alternative methods for action retrieval from scripts and show benefits of a text-based classifier. Using the retrieved action samples for visual learning, we next turn to the problem of action classification in video. We present a new method for video classification that builds upon and extends several recent ideas including local space-time features, space-time pyramids and multi-channel non-linear SVMs. The method is shown to improve state-of-the-art results on the standard KTH action dataset by achieving 91.8% accuracy. Given the inherent problem of noisy labels in automatic annotation, we particularly investigate and show high tolerance of our method to annotation errors in the training set. We finally apply the method to learning and classifying challenging action classes in movies and show promising results."

We explicitly train it to distinguish objects with a well-defined boundary in space, such as cows and telephones, from amorphous background elements, such as grass and road. The measure combines in a Bayesian framework several image cues measuring characteristics of objects, such as appearing different from their surroundings and having a closed boundary. This includes an innovative cue measuring the closed boundary characteristic. In experiments on the challenging PASCAL VOC 07 dataset, we show this new cue to outperform a state-of-the-art saliency measure [17], and the combined measure to perform better than any cue alone. Finally, we show how to sample windows from an image according to their objectness distribution and give an algorithm to employ them as location priors for modern class-specific object detectors. In experiments on PASCAL VOC 07 we show this greatly reduces the number of windows evaluated by class-specific object detectors."

Its benefits are two-fold: 1) we can improve retrieval of action images, and 2) we can collect a large generic database of action poses, which can then be used in tagging videos.

Previous works generally require objects covering a large portion of the images. We present a novel approach that can cope with extensive clutter as well as large scale and appearance variations between object instances. To make this possible we propose a conditional random field that starts from generic knowledge and then progressively adapts to the new class. Our approach simultaneously localizes object instances while learning an appearance model specific for the class. We demonstrate this on the challenging PASCAL VOC 2007 dataset. Furthermore, our method enables to train any state-of-the-art object detector in a weakly supervised fashion, although it would normally require object location annotations."

                "text": "Many state-of-the-art approaches for object recognition reduce the problem to a 0-1 classification task. This allows one to leverage sophisticated machine learning techniques for training classifiers from labeled examples. However, these models are typically trained independently for each class using positive and negative examples cropped from images. At test-time, various post-processing heuristics such as non-maxima suppression (NMS) are required to reconcile multiple detections within and between different classes for each image. Though crucial to good performance on benchmarks, this post-processing is usually defined heuristically.We introduce a unified model for multi-class object recognition that casts the problem as a structured prediction task. Rather than predicting a binary label for each image window independently, our model simultaneously predicts a structured labeling of the entire image (Fig.\u00a01). Our model learns statistics that capture the spatial arrangements of various object classes in real images, both in terms of which arrangements to suppress through NMS and which arrangements to favor through spatial co-occurrence statistics.We formulate parameter estimation in our model as a max-margin learning problem. Given training images with ground-truth object locations, we show how to formulate learning as a convex optimization problem. We employ the cutting plane algorithm of Joachims et al. (Mach. Learn.\u00a02009) to efficiently learn a model from thousands of training images. We show state-of-the-art results on the PASCAL VOC benchmark that indicate the benefits of learning a global model encapsulating the spatial layout of multiple object classes (a preliminary version of this work appeared in ICCV 2009, Desai et al., IEEE international conference on computer vision,\u00a02009)."

While generative approaches can accurately determine human pose from image observations, they are computationally expensive due to search in the high dimensional human pose space. On the other hand, discriminative approaches do not generalize well, but are computationally efficient. We present a hybrid model that combines the strengths of the two in an integrated learning and inference framework. We extend the Gaussian process latent variable model (GPLVM) to include an embedding from observation space (the space of image features) to the latent space. GPLVM is a generative model, but the inclusion of this mapping provides a discriminative component, making the model observation driven. Observation Driven GPLVM (OD-GPLVM) not only provides a faster inference approach, but also more accurate estimates (compared to GPLVM) in cases where dynamics are not sufficient for the initialization of search in the latent space. We also extend OD-GPLVM to learn and estimate poses from parameterized actions/gestures. Parameterized gestures are actions which exhibit large systematic variation in joint angle space for different instances due to difference in contextual variables. For example, the joint angles in a forehand tennis shot are function of the height of the ball (Figure 2). We learn these systematic variations as a function of the contextual variables. We then present an approach to use information from scene/objects to provide context for human pose estimation for such parameterized actions."

In contrast to the previous work studying human actions in controlled settings, here we train and test algorithms on real movies with substantial variation of actions in terms of subject appearance, motion, surrounding scenes, viewing angles and spatio-temporal extents. We introduce a new annotated human action dataset and use it to evaluate several existing methods. We in particular focus on boosted space-time window classifiers and introduce \"keyframe priming\" that combines discriminative models of human motion and shape within an action. Keyframe priming is shown to significantly improve the performance of action detection.

We define an event in a static image as a human activity taking place in a specific environment. In this paper, we use a number of sport games such as snow boarding, rock climbing or badminton to demonstrate event classification. Our goal is to classify the event in the image as well as to provide a number of semantic labels to the objects and scene environment within the image. For example, given a rowing scene, our algorithm recognizes the event as rowing by classifying the environment as a lake and recognizing the critical objects in the image as athletes, rowing boat, water, etc. We achieve this integrative and holistic recognition through a generative graphical model. We have assembled a highly challenging database of 8 widely varied sport events. We show that our system is capable of classifying these event classes at 73.4% accuracy. While each component of the model contributes to the final recognition, using scene or objects alone cannot achieve this performance."

It starts from local dense yet scale-invariant spatio-temporal features. The most discriminative visual words are selected and used to cast bounding box hypotheses, which are then verified and further grouped into the final detections. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to extend the exemplar-based approach using local features into the spatio-temporal domain. This allows us to avoid the problems that typically plague sliding window-based approaches - in particular the exhaustive search over spatial coordinates, time, and spatial as well as temporal scales. We report state-ofthe-art results on challenging datasets, extracted from real movies, for both classification and localization."

Our system is able to represent highly variable object classes and achieves state-of-the-art results in the PASCAL object detection challenges. While deformable part models have become quite popular, their value had not been demonstrated on difficult benchmarks such as the PASCAL data sets. Our system relies on new methods for discriminative training with partially labeled data. We combine a margin-sensitive approach for data-mining hard negative examples with a formalism we call latent SVM. A latent SVM is a reformulation of MI--SVM in terms of latent variables. A latent SVM is semiconvex, and the training problem becomes convex once latent information is specified for the positive examples. This leads to an iterative training algorithm that alternates between fixing latent values for positive examples and optimizing the latent SVM objective function."

The traditional approach to recognition and 3D reconstruction of human activity has been to track motion in 3D, mainly using advanced geometric and dynamic models. In this paper we reverse this process. View based activity recognition serves as an input to a human body location tracker with the ultimate goal of 3D reanimation in mind. We demonstrate that specific human actions can be detected from single frame postures in a video sequence. By recognizing the image of a person's posture as corresponding to a particular key frame from a set of stored key frames, it is possible to map body locations from the key frames to actual frames. This is achieved using a shape matching algorithm based on qualitative similarity that computes point to point correspondence between shapes, together with information about appearance. As the mapping is from fixed key frames, our tracking does not suffer from the problem of having to reinitialise when it gets lost. It is effectively a closed loop. We present experimental results both for recognition and tracking for a sequence of a tennis player."

Features from a query sequence are matched to the trees and vote for action categories and their locations. Large number of trees make the process efficient and robust. The system is capable of simultaneous categorization and localization of actions using only a few frames per sequence. The approach obtains excellent performance on standard action recognition sequences. We perform large scale experiments on 17 challenging real action categories from Olympic Games1 .

Objects are modeled as flexible constellations of parts. A probabilistic representation is used for all aspects of the object: shape, appearance, occlusion and relative scale. An entropy-based feature detector is used to select regions and their scale within the image. In learning the parameters of the scale-invariant object model are estimated. This is done using expectation-maximization in a maximum-likelihood setting. In recognition, this model is used in a Bayesian manner to classify images. The flexible nature of the model is demonstrated by excellent results over a range of datasets including geometrically constrained classes (e.g. faces, cars) and flexible objects (such as animals)."

Such video material is uncontrolled and extremely challenging. We propose an approach that progressively reduces the search space for body parts, to greatly improve the chances that pose estimation will succeed. This involves two contributions: (i) a generic detector using a weak model of pose to substantially reduce the full pose search space; and (ii) employing 'grabcut' initialized on detected regions proposed by the weak model, to further prune the search space. Moreover, we also propose (Hi) an integrated spatio- temporal model covering multiple frames to refine pose estimates from individual frames, with inference using belief propagation. The method is fully automatic and self-initializing, and explains the spatio-temporal volume covered by a person moving in a shot, by soft-labeling every pixel as belonging to a particular body part or to the background. We demonstrate upper-body pose estimation by an extensive evaluation over 70000 frames from four episodes of the TV series Buffy the vampire slayer, and present an application to full- body action recognition on the Weizmann dataset."

In this paper, we demonstrate how such features can be used for recognizing complex motion patterns. We construct video representations in terms of local space-time features and integrate such representations with SVM classification schemes for recognition. For the purpose of evaluation we introduce a new video database containing 2391 sequences of six human actions performed by 25 people in four different scenarios. The presented results of action recognition justify the proposed method and demonstrate its advantage compared to other relative approaches for action recognition."

In learning mode, the parameters representing poses and activities are estimated from videos. In run mode, the method can be used both for videos or still images. For recognizing pose primitives, we extend a Histogram of Oriented Gradient (HOG) based descriptor to better cope with articulated poses and cluttered background. Action classes are represented by histograms of poses primitives. For sequences, we incorporate the local temporal context by means of n-gram expressions. Action recognition is based on a simple histogram comparison. Unlike the mainstream video surveillance approaches, the proposed method does not rely on background subtraction or dynamic features and thus allows for action recognition in still images."

This work is distinguished by three key contributions. The first is the introduction of a new image representation called the \"integral image\" which allows the features used by our detector to be computed very quickly. The second is a learning algorithm, based on AdaBoost, which selects a small number of critical visual features from a larger set and yields extremely efficient classifiers. The third contribution is a method for combining increasingly more complex classifiers in a \"cascade\" which allows background regions of the image to be quickly discarded while spending more computation on promising object-like regions. The cascade can be viewed as an object specific focus-of-attention mechanism which unlike previous approaches provides statistical guarantees that discarded regions are unlikely to contain the object of interest. In the domain of face detection the system yields detection rates comparable to the best previous systems. Used in real-time applications, the detector runs at 15 frames per second without resorting to image differencing or skin color detection."

Compact and yet discriminative appearance-based object class models are automatically learned from a set of training images. The method is simple and extremely fast, making it suitable for many applications such as semantic image retrieval, Web search, and interactive image editing. It classifies a region according to the proportions of different visual words (clusters in feature space). The specific visual words and the typical proportions in each object are learned from a segmented training set. The main contribution of this paper is twofold: i) an optimally compact visual dictionary is learned by pair-wise merging of visual words from an initially large dictionary. The final visual words are described by GMMs. ii) A novel statistical measure of discrimination is proposed which is optimized by each merge operation. High classification accuracy is demonstrated for nine object classes on photographs of real objects viewed under general lighting conditions, poses and viewpoints. The set of test images used for validation comprise: i) photographs acquired by us, ii) images from the Web and iii) images from the recently released Pascal dataset. The proposed algorithm performs well on both texture-rich objects (e.g. grass, sky, trees) and structure-rich ones (e.g. cars, bikes, planes)"

The procedure is based on a very low dimensional representation of the scene, that we term the Spatial Envelope. We propose a set of perceptual dimensions (naturalness, openness, roughness, expansion, ruggedness) that represent the dominant spatial structure of a scene. Then, we show that these dimensions may be reliably estimated using spectral and coarsely localized information. The model generates a multidimensional space in which scenes sharing membership in semantic categories (e.g., streets, highways, coasts) are projected closed together. The performance of the spatial envelope model shows that specific information about object shape or identity is not a requirement for scene categorization and that modeling a holistic representation of the scene informs about its probable semantic category."

This paper presents a large-scale evaluation of an approach that represents images as distributions (signatures or histograms) of features extracted from a sparse set of keypoint locations and learns a Support Vector Machine classifier with kernels based on two effective measures for comparing distributions, the Earth Mover\u2019s Distance and the \u03c72 distance. We first evaluate the performance of our approach with different keypoint detectors and descriptors, as well as different kernels and classifiers. We then conduct a comparative evaluation with several state-of-the-art recognition methods on four texture and five object databases. On most of these databases, our implementation exceeds the best reported results and achieves comparable performance on the rest. Finally, we investigate the influence of background correlations on recognition performance via extensive tests on the PASCAL database, for which ground-truth object localization information is available. Our experiments demonstrate that image representations based on distributions of local features are surprisingly effective for classification of texture and object images under challenging real-world conditions, including significant intra-class variations and substantial background clutter."

The use of such features makes the problem more manageable while providing increased robustness to noise and pose variation. In this work we develop an extension of these ideas to the spatio-temporal case. For this purpose, we show that the direct 3D counterparts to commonly used 2D interest point detectors are inadequate, and we propose an alternative. Anchoring off of these interest points, we devise a recognition algorithm based on spatio-temporally windowed data. We present recognition results on a variety of datasets including both human and rodent behavior."

While this is a necessity in order to generalize beyond a given set of training images, it is also a very difficult problem due to the high variability of visual appearance within each class. In the last years substantial performance gains on challenging benchmark datasets have been reported in the literature. This progress can be attributed to two developments: the design of highly discriminative and robust image features and the combination of multiple complementary features based on different aspects such as shape, color or texture. In this paper we study several models that aim at learning the correct weighting of different features from training data. These include multiple kernel learning as well as simple baseline methods. Furthermore we derive ensemble methods inspired by Boosting which are easily extendable to several multiclass setting. All methods are thoroughly evaluated on object classification datasets using a multitude of feature descriptors. The key results are that even very simple baseline methods, that are orders of magnitude faster than learning techniques are highly competitive with multiple kernel learning. Furthermore the Boosting type methods are found to produce consistently better results in all experiments. We provide insight of when combination methods can be expected to work and how the benefit of complementary features can be exploited most efficiently."

This image retrieval benchmark (referred to as the IAPR TC-12 Benchmark) has developed from an initiative started by the Technical Committee 12 (TC-12) of the International Association of Pattern Recognition (IAPR). The collection consists of 20,000 images from a private photographic image collection. The construction and composition of the IAPR TC-12 Benchmark is described, including its associated text captions which are expressed in multiple languages, making the collection well-suited for evaluating the effectiveness of both textbased and visual retrieval methods. We also discuss the current and expected uses of the collection, including its use to benchmark and compare different image retrieval systems in ImageCLEF 2006."

(Nov. 2005)- tree-reweighted max-product message passing (TRW). It was inspired by the problem of maximizing a lower bound on the energy. However, the algorithm is not guaranteed to increase this bound - it may actually go down. In addition, TRW does not always converge. We develop a modification of this algorithm which we call sequential tree-reweighted message passing. Its main property is that the bound is guaranteed not to decrease. We also give a weak tree agreement condition which characterizes local maxima of the bound with respect to TRW algorithms. We prove that our algorithm has a limit point that achieves weak tree agreement. Finally, we show that, our algorithm requires half as much memory as traditional message passing approaches. Experimental results demonstrate that on certain synthetic and real problems, our algorithm outperforms both the ordinary belief propagation and tree-reweighted algorithm in (M. J. Wainwright, et al., Nov. 2005). In addition, on stereo problems with Potts interactions, we obtain a lower energy than graph cuts"

                "text": "This thesis proposes a robust Automatic Face Verification (AFV) system using Local Binary Patterns (LBP). AFV is mainly composed of two modules: Face Detection (FD) and Face Verification (FV). The purpose of FD is to determine whether there are any face in an image, while FV involves confirming or denying the identity claimed by a person. The contributions of this thesis are the following: 1) a real-time multiview FD system which is robust to illumination and partial occlusion, 2) a FV system based on the adaptation of LBP features, 3) an extensive study of the performance evaluation of FD algorithms and in particular the effect of FD errors on FV performance. The first part of the thesis addresses the problem of frontal FD. We introduce the system of Viola and Jones which is the first real-time frontal face detector. One of its limitations is the sensitivity to local lighting variations and partial occlusion of the face. In order to cope with these limitations, we propose to use LBP features. Special emphasis is given to the scanning process and to the merging of overlapped detections, because both have a significant impact on the performance. We then extend our frontal FD module to multiview FD. In the second part, we present a novel generative approach for FV, based on an LBP description of the face. The main advantages compared to previous approaches are a very fast and simple training procedure and robustness to bad lighting conditions. In the third part, we address the problem of estimating the quality of FD. We first show the influence of FD errors on the FV task and then empirically demonstrate the limitations of current detection measures when applied to this task. In order to properly evaluate the performance of a face detection module, we propose to embed the FV into the performance measuring process. We show empirically that the proposed methodology better matches the final FV performance."

The first one is completely nonparametric and is based on the the adaptive estimation of the normalized density gradient. Employing the sample point estimator, we define the Variable Bandwidth Mean Shift, prove its convergence, and show its superiority over the fixed bandwidth procedure. The second technique has a semiparametric nature and imposes a local structure on the data to extract reliable scale information. The local scale of the underlying density is taken as the bandwidth which maximizes the magnitude of the normalized mean shift vector. Both estimators provide practical tools for autonomous image and quasi real-time video analysis and several examples are shown to illustrate their effectiveness."

In a realistic scenario, it is very likely that the lighting conditions of the probe image does not correspond to those of the gallery image, hence there is a need to handle such variations. In this work, we present a new preprocessing algorithm based on local binary patterns (LBP): a texture representation is derived from the input face image before being forwarded to the classifier. The efficiency of the proposed approach is empirically demonstrated using both an appearance-based (LDA) and a feature-based (HMM) face authentication systems on two databases: BANCA and XM2VTS (with its darkened set). Conducted experiments show a significant improvement in terms of verification error rates and compare to results obtained with state-of-the-art preprocessing techniques"

We wish to construct a nonparametric density estimator that incorporates the prior information. We propose an estimator that allows for the incorporation of prior information in the density estimation procedure within a non-Bayesian framework. The prior density is mixed with the available empirical data via a Langevin diffusion process. The diffusion process is constructed so that the prior density is the limiting and stationary distribution of the process. We analyze the asymptotic bias and variance properties of the estimator and compare them with the properties of the standard density estimators. We present simulation examples in which the proposed estimator outperforms the standard estimation procedures in terms of accuracy."
