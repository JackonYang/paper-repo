The context-feature is simple to implement, feed-forward, and effective across multiple object types in a street-scenes environment.Using context alone, we demonstrate robust detection of locations likely to contain bicycles, cars, and pedestrians. Furthermore, experiments are conducted so as to address several open questions regarding visual context. Specifically, it is demonstrated that context may be determined from low level visual features (simple color and texture descriptors) sampled over a wide receptive field. At least for the framework tested, high level semantic knowledge, e.g, the nature of the surrounding objects, is superfluous. Finally, it is shown that when the target object is unambiguously visible, context is only marginally useful."

Given a set of images and their associated text (e.g. keywords, captions, descriptions), the objective is to segment an image, in either a crude or sophisticated fashion, then to find the proper associations between words and regions. Previous models are limited by the scope of the representation. In particular, they fail to exploit spatial context in the images and words. We develop a more expressive model that takes this into account. We formulate a spatially consistent probabilistic mapping between continuous image feature vectors and the supplied word tokens. By learning both word-to-region associations and object relations, the proposed model augments scene segmentations due to smoothing implicit in spatial consistency. Context introduces cycles to the undirected graph, so we cannot rely on a straightforward implementation of the EM algorithm for estimating the model parameters and densities of the unknown alignment variables. Instead, we develop an approximate EM algorithm that uses loopy belief propagation in the inference step and iterative scaling on the pseudo-likelihood approximation in the parameter update step. The experiments indicate that our approximate inference and learning algorithm converges to good local solutions. Experiments on a diverse array of images show that spatial context considerably improves the accuracy of object recognition. Most significantly, spatial context combined with a nonlinear discrete object representation allows our models to cope well with over-segmented scenes."

When multiple detectors of objects and parts are trained in parallel using AdaBoost [1], object detectors might use the remaining intermediate detectors to enrich the weak learner set. This method generalizes the efficient features suggested by Viola and Jones [2] thus enabling information inference between parts and objects in a compositional hierarchy. In our experiments eye-, nose-, mouth- and face detectors are trained using the Mutual Boosting framework. Results show that the method outperforms applications overlooking contextual information. We suggest that achieving contextual integration is a step toward human-like detection capabilities."

Material detection refers to the problem of identifying key semantic material types (such as sky, grass, foliage, water, and snow in images). In this paper, we present a holistic approach to determining scene content, based on a set of individual material detection algorithms, as well as probabilistic spatial context models. A major limitation of individual material detectors is the significant number of misclassifications that occur because of the similarities in color and texture characteristics of various material types. We have developed a spatial context-aware material detection system that reduces misclassification by constraining the beliefs to conform to the probabilistic spatial context models. Experimental results show that the accuracy of materials detection is improved by 13% using the spatial context models over the individual material detectors themselves."

Objects are modeled as flexible constellations of parts. A probabilistic representation is used for all aspects of the object: shape, appearance, occlusion and relative scale. An entropy-based feature detector is used to select regions and their scale within the image. In learning the parameters of the scale-invariant object model are estimated. This is done using expectation-maximization in a maximum-likelihood setting. In recognition, this model is used in a Bayesian manner to classify images. The flexible nature of the model is demonstrated by excellent results over a range of datasets including geometrically constrained classes (e.g. faces, cars) and flexible objects (such as animals)."

The features are incorporated into a probabilistic framework, which combines the outputs of several components. Components differ in the information they encode. Some focus on the image-label mapping, while others focus solely on patterns within the label field. Components also differ in their scale, as some focus on fine-resolution patterns while others on coarser, more global structure. A supervised version of the contrastive divergence algorithm is applied to learn these features from labeled image data. We demonstrate performance on two real-world image databases and compare it to a classifier and a Markov random field."

The learned model is used for automatic visual recognition and semantic segmentation of photographs. Our discriminative model exploits novel features, based on textons, which jointly model shape and texture. Unary classification and feature selection is achieved using shared boosting to give an efficient classifier which can be applied to a large number of classes. Accurate image segmentation is achieved by incorporating these classifiers in a conditional random field. Efficient training of the model on very large datasets is achieved by exploiting both random feature selection and piecewise training methods. \n \nHigh classification and segmentation accuracy are demonstrated on three different databases: i) our own 21-object class database of photographs of real objects viewed under general lighting conditions, poses and viewpoints, ii) the 7-class Corel subset and iii) the 7-class Sowerby database used in [1]. The proposed algorithm gives competitive results both for highly textured (e.g. grass, trees), highly structured (e.g. cars, faces, bikes, aeroplanes) and articulated objects (e.g. body, cow)."

Traditional machine recognition paradigms assume either that all objects of interest are definable by a relatively small number of explicit shape models or that all objects of interest have characteristic, locally measurable features. The failure of both assumptions has a dramatic impact on the form of an acceptable architecture for an object recognition system. In this work, the use of the contextual information is a central issue, and a system is explicitly designed to identify and use context as an integral part of recognition that eliminates the traditional dependence on stored geometric models and universal image partitioning algorithms. This paradigm combines the results of many simple procedures that analyze monochrome, color, stereo, or 3D range images. Interpreting the results along with relevant contextual knowledge makes it possible to achieve a reliable recognition result, even when using imperfect visual procedures. Initial experimentation with the system on ground-level outdoor imagery has demonstrated competence beyond what is attainable with other vision systems. >"

The discriminative random fields offer several advantages over the conventional Markov random field (MRF) framework. First, the DRFs allow to relax the strong assumption of conditional independence of the observed data generally used in the MRF framework for tractability. This assumption is too restrictive for a large number of applications in vision. Second, the DRFs derive their classification power by exploiting the probabilistic discriminative models instead of the generative models used in the MRF framework. Finally, all the parameters in the DRF model are estimated simultaneously from the training data unlike the MRF framework where likelihood parameters are usually learned separately from the field parameters. We illustrate the advantages of the DRFs over the MRF framework in an application of man-made structure detection in natural images taken from the Corel database."

A novel hierarchical representation allows to represent individual images as well as various objects classes in a single, scale and rotation invariant model. The recognition method is based on a codebook representation where appearance clusters built from edge based features are shared among several object classes. A probabilistic model allows for reliable detection of various objects in the same image. The approach is highly efficient due to fast clustering and matching methods capable of dealing with millions of high dimensional features. The system shows excellent performance on several object categories over a wide range of scales, in-plane rotations, background clutter, and partial occlusions. The performance of the proposed multi-object class detection approach is competitive to state of the art approaches dedicated to a single object class recognition problem."

This approach is quite flexible, and permits recognition based on color, texture, and particularly shape, in a homogeneous framework. While nearest neighbor classifiers are natural in this setting, they suffer from the problem of high variance (in bias-variance decomposition) in the case of limited sampling. Alternatively, one could use support vector machines but they involve time-consuming optimization and computation of pairwise distances. We propose a hybrid of these two methods which deals naturally with the multiclass setting, has reasonable computational complexity both in training and at run time, and yields excellent results in practice. The basic idea is to find close neighbors to a query sample and train a local support vector machine that preserves the distance function on the collection of neighbors. Our method can be applied to large, multiclass data sets for which it outperforms nearest neighbor and support vector machines, and remains efficient when the problem becomes intractable for support vector machines. A wide variety of distance functions can be used and our experiments show state-of-the-art performance on a number of benchmark data sets for shape and texture classification (MNIST, USPS, CUReT) and object recognition (Caltech- 101). On Caltech-101 we achieved a correct classification rate of 59.05%(\u00b10.56%) at 15 training images per class, and 66.23%(\u00b10.48%) at 30 training images."

The usefulness of recognition for segmentation has been demonstrated with various top-down segmentation algorithms, however, the impact of bottom-up image segmentation as pre-processing for object recognition is not well understood. One factor impeding the utility of segmentation for recognition is the unsatisfactory quality of image segmentation algorithms. In this work we take advantage of a recently proposed method for computing multiple stable segmentations and illustrate the application of bottom-up image segmentation as a preprocessing step for object recognition and categorization. We extend a popular bag-of-features recognition model to provide multiple class categorization and localization of objects in images. We compare our categorization results to that of a conventional bag-of-features recognition model on the Caltech and PASCAL image databases."

                "text": "This paper describes a visual object detection framework that is capable of processing images extremely rapidly while achieving high detection rates. There are three key contributions. The first is the introduction of a new image representation called the \u201cIntegral Image\u201d which allows the features used by our detector to be computed very quickly. The second is a learning algorithm, based on AdaBoost, which selects a small number of critical visual features and yields extremely efficient classifiers [4]. The third contribution is a method for combining classifiers in a \u201ccascade\u201d which allows background regions of the image to be quickly discarded while spending more computation on promising object-like regions. A set of experiments in the domain of face detection are presented. The system yields face detection performance comparable to the best previous systems [16, 11, 14, 10, 1]. Implemented on a conventional desktop, face detection proceeds at 15 frames per second.

Rather than focusing on local features and their consistencies in the image data, our approach aims at extracting the global impression of an image. We treat image segmentation as a graph partitioning problem and propose a novel global criterion, the normalized cut, for segmenting the graph. The normalized cut criterion measures both the total dissimilarity between the different groups as well as the total similarity within the groups. We show that an efficient computational technique based on a generalized eigenvalue problem can be used to optimize this criterion. We have applied this approach to segmenting static images and found results very encouraging."

They evolved from texton methods in texture analysis. The basic idea is to treat images as loose collections of independent patches, sampling a representative set of patches from the image, evaluating a visual descriptor vector for each patch independently, and using the resulting distribution of samples in descriptor space as a characterization of the image. The four main implementation choices are thus how to sample patches, how to describe them, how to characterize the resulting distributions and how to classify images based on the result. We concentrate on the first issue, showing experimentally that for a representative selection of commonly used test databases and for moderate to large numbers of samples, random sampling gives equal or better classifiers than the sophisticated multiscale interest operators that are in common use. Although interest operators work well for small numbers of samples, the single most important factor governing performance is the number of patches sampled from the test image and ultimately interest operators can not provide enough patches to compete. We also study the influence of other factors including codebook size and creation method, histogram normalization method and minimum scale for feature extraction."

The efficiency and quality is exhibited in a live demonstration that recognizes CD-covers from a database of 40000 images of popular music CD\u2019s. The scheme builds upon popular techniques of indexing descriptors extracted from local regions, and is robust to background clutter and occlusion. The local region descriptors are hierarchically quantized in a vocabulary tree. The vocabulary tree allows a larger and more discriminatory vocabulary to be used efficiently, which we show experimentally leads to a dramatic improvement in retrieval quality. The most significant property of the scheme is that the tree directly defines the quantization. The quantization and the indexing are therefore fully integrated, essentially being one and the same. The recognition quality is evaluated through retrieval on a database with ground truth, showing the power of the vocabulary tree approach, going as high as 1 million images."

Novel features of our approach include the ability to detect multiple stable clusterings (instead of only one), a simpler means of calculating stability that does not require training a classifier, and a new characterization of the space of stabilities for a continuum of segmentations that provides for an efficient sampling scheme. Our contribution is a framework for visual grouping that frees the user from the hassles of parameter tuning and model order selection: the input is an image, the output is a shortlist of segmentations."

B. Julesz (1981) introduced the term texton, analogous to a phoneme in speech recognition, but did not provide an operational definition for gray-level images. We re-invent textons as frequently co-occurring combinations of oriented linear filter outputs. These can be learned using a K-means approach. By mapping each pixel to its nearest texton, the image can be analyzed into texton channels, each of which is a point set where discrete techniques such as Voronoi diagrams become applicable. Local histograms of texton frequencies can be used with a /spl chi//sup 2/ test for significant differences to find texture boundaries. Natural images contain both textured and untextured regions, so we combine this cue with that of the presence of peaks of contour energy derived from outputs of odd- and even-symmetric oriented Gaussian derivative filters. Each of these cues has a domain of applicability, so to facilitate cue combination we introduce a gating operator based on a statistical test for isotropy of Delaunay neighbors. Having obtained a local measure of how likely two nearby pixels are to belong to the same region, we use the spectral graph theoretic framework of normalized cuts to find partitions of the image into regions of coherent texture and brightness. Experimental results on a wide range of images are shown."

We formulate this as a Bayesian inference problem and describe a very simple algorithm for solving it. Our algorithm uses a model-based concept of a cluster and ranks items using a score which evaluates the marginal probability that each item belongs to a cluster containing the query items. For exponential family models with conjugate priors this marginal probability is a simple function of sufficient statistics. We focus on sparse binary data and show that our score can be evaluated exactly using a single sparse matrix multiplication, making it possible to apply our algorithm to very large datasets. We evaluate our algorithm on three datasets: retrieving movies from EachMovie, finding completions of author sets from the NIPS dataset, and finding completions of sets of words appearing in the Grolier encyclopedia. We compare to Google\u2122 Sets and show that Bayesian Sets gives very reasonable set completions."

There are three key contributions. The first is the introduction of a new image representation called the \u201cIntegral Image\u201d which allows the features used by our detector to be computed very quickly. The second is a simple and efficient classifier which is built using the AdaBoost learning algorithm (Freund and Schapire, 1995) to select a small number of critical visual features from a very large set of potential features. The third contribution is a method for combining classifiers in a \u201ccascade\u201d which allows background regions of the image to be quickly discarded while spending more computation on promising face-like regions. A set of experiments in the domain of face detection is presented. The system yields face detection performance comparable to the best previous systems (Sung and Poggio, 1998; Rowley et al., 1998; Schneiderman and Kanade, 2000; Roth et al., 2000). Implemented on a conventional desktop, face detection proceeds at 15 frames per second."

We illustrate how the constraints sometimes employed by artificial intelligence researchers constitute a different kind of assumption on the joint prior probability function. We discuss a couple of loss functions which do take context into account and when combined with the joint prior probability constraint create a decision problem requiring a combinatorial state space search. We also give a theory for how probabilistic relaxation works from a Bayesian point of view."

                "text": "dents. The first six chapters, the sixth added since the first edition, cover mixing processes, density and regression estimation for discrete time processes, density and regression estimation for continuous time processes, and the local time density estimator. The final chapter, also added since the first edition and the only one not devoted to theoretical results, reviews some aspects of implementation and gives examples. The book opens with a synopsis that defines the object of the study as being the construction of time series alternatives to the usual BoxJenkins SARIMA processes. Following that, it proceeds to highlight and summarize the main ideas of the book, beginning with definitions of kernel density and regression estimators and concluding with a brief list of some advantages of nonparametric over parametric time series methods. Specific advantages listed are that they are robust, that deseasonalization is not necessary, and that parametric convergence rates can, under some circumstances, be achieved. Having provided that overview, the book then proceeds in Chapter 1 to lay the theoretical groundwork for the analysis of a wide class of time series by a review of historical results for mixing processes. Results given include Berbee\u2019s and Bradley\u2019s lemmas for coupling, some results for covariances and joint densities including Rio\u2019s, Davydov\u2019s, and Billingsley\u2019s inequalities, some inequalities for partial sums including Hoeffding\u2019s and Bernstein\u2019s, and some limit theorems (laws of large numbers and central limit theorem) for strongly mixing processes. Chapters 2 and 3 cover the analysis of discrete time processes, Chapter 2 focusing on density estimation for sequences of correlated random variables and Chapter 3 on regression estimation and prediction. Topics include some specific kernels, optimal asymptotic quadratic error, uniform almost sure convergence for some kernels, asymptotic normality, and prediction for some stationary and nonstationary processes. These chapters are mainly review; although several results are from earlier papers by the author, they are not, by and large, new. Chapters 4 and 5 consider estimation for continuous time processes and are mainly new results. Their development is a broad parallel of the \u2019 development of Chapters 2 and 3, with Chapter 4 devoted to density estimation and Chapter 5 covering regression estimation and prediction. Topics and results include optimal and superoptimal asymptotic quadratic error including a minimax bound of Kutoyants (1997) and minimaxity of intermediate rates, optimal and superoptimal uniform convergence rates, asymptotic normality, irregular and admissible sampling, and the convergence rates of continuous-time nonparametric predictors. Some conditions are given under which a nonparametric predictor reaches a parametric convergence rate. Chapter 6 explores the use of local time for unbiased density estimation given a continuous time sample and consists, apart from one result, of new results. A definition is given of local time, followed by two existence criteria for local time, the first due to Geman and Horowitz (1973, 1980) and the second proven by the author. A density estimator based on local time is then defined and shown to be unbiased and consistent. Some results on convergence rates are then given, followed by asymptotic normality, a functional law of the iterated logarithm, and parametric rates for pointwise and uniform convergence. Chapter 7 is a brief summary of some practical aspects of nonparametric time series analysis. These fall into three areas-aspects of implementation. the comparison of nonparametric with parametric methods, and applied examples. The aspects of implementation addressed are variance stabilization via BoxCox transformation, methods for eliminating trend and seasonality, methods for choosing kernel bandwidth, and choosing a suitable order for predicting a Markov process in which the true order of the process is unknown. In comparing nonparametric and parametric methods of time series analysis, the book summarizes the results of Carbon and Delecroix (1993). who considered several simulated autoregressive moving average (ARMA) processes and some real business and engineering datasets, and the results of Rosa (1993), who considered ARMA models with and without generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity effects. An appendix gives 17 tables summarizing the results of the comparisons. Finally. some examples are given of applying nonparametric methods to finance and economic data. The value of this book is primarily in its theoretical development and, as such, it would be of more interest to researchers in statistical theory and"
