The salient ones for separating particular shapes are determined by inductive learning during the construction of classification trees. There is a feature for every possible geometric arrangement of local topographic codes. The arrangements express coarse constraints on relative angles and distances among the code locations and are nearly invariant to substantial affine and nonlinear deformations. They are also partially ordered, which makes it possible to narrow the search for informative ones at each node of the tree. Different trees correspond to different aspects of shape. They are statistically and weakly dependent due to randomization and are aggregated in a simple way. Adapting the algorithm to a shape family is then fully automatic once training samples are provided. As an illustration, we classified handwritten digits from the NIST database; the error rate was 0.7 percent."

We divide detection into visual selection and final classification, concentrating on the former: drastically reducing the number of candidate regions that require further, usually more intensive, processing, but with a minimum of computation and missed detections. Bottom-up processing is based on local groupings of edge fragments constrained by loose geometrical relationships. They have no a priori semantic or geometric interpretation. The role of training is to select special groupings that are moderately likely at certain places on the object but rare in the background. We show that the statistics in both populations are stable. The candidate regions are those that contain global arrangements of several local groupings. Whereas our model was not conceived to explain brain functions, it does cohere with evidence about the functions of neurons in V1 and V2, such as responses to coarse or incomplete patterns (e.g., illusory contours) and to scale and translation invariance in IT. Finally, the algorithm is applied to face and symbol detection."

More complex better suited distance measures are often expensive and rather ad-hoc. We propose a new distance measure which: 1) can be made locally invariant to any set of transformations of the input; and 2) can be computed efficiently. We tested the method on large handwritten character databases provided by the US Post Office and NIST. Using invariances with respect to translation, rotation, scaling, skewing and line thickness, the method outperformed all other systems on a small (less than 10,000 patterns) database and was competitive on our largest (60,000 patterns) database."

                "text": "Multiclass learning problems involve finding a definition for an unknown function f(x) whose range is a discrete set containing k > 2 values (i.e., k \"classes\"). The definition is acquired by studying collections of training examples of the form (xi, f(xi)). Existing approaches to multiclass learning problems include direct application of multiclass algorithms such as the decision-tree algorithms C4.5 and CART, application of binary concept learning algorithms to learn individual binary functions for each of the k classes, and application of binary concept learning algorithms with distributed output representations. This paper compares these three approaches to a new technique in which error-correcting codes are employed as a distributed output representation. We show that these output representations improve the generalization performance of both C4.5 and backpropagation on a wide range of multiclass learning tasks. We also demonstrate that this approach is robust with respect to changes in the size of the training sample, the assignment of distributed representations to particular classes, and the application of overfitting avoidance techniques such as decision-tree pruning. Finally, we show that--like the other methods--the error-correcting code technique can provide reliable class probability estimates. Taken together, these results demonstrate that error-correcting output codes provide a general-purpose method for improving the performance of inductive learning programs on multiclass problems."

These descriptors can be constructed using the methods of invariant theory, which are briefly surveyed. A range of applications of invariant descriptors in 3D model-based vision is demonstrated. First, a model-based vision system that recognizes curved plane objects irrespective of their pose is demonstrated. Curves are not reduced to polyhedral approximations but are handled as objects in their own right. Models are generated directly from image data. Once objects have been recognized, their pose can be computed. Invariant descriptors for 3D objects with plane faces are described. All these ideas are demonstrated using images of real scenes. The stability of a range of invariant descriptors to measurement error is treated in detail. >"

We show that if m O(W/\u220a log N/\u220a) random examples can be loaded on a feedforward network of linear threshold functions with N nodes and W weights, so that at least a fraction 1 \u220a/2 of the examples are correctly classified, then one has confidence approaching certainty that the network will correctly classify a fraction 1 \u220a of future test examples drawn from the same distribution. Conversely, for fully-connected feedforward nets with one hidden layer, any learning algorithm using fewer than (W/\u220a) random training examples will, for some distributions of examples consistent with an appropriate weight choice, fail at least some fixed fraction of the time to find a weight choice that will correctly classify more than a 1 \u220a fraction of the future test examples."

This approach exploits the power of tree classifiers to use appropriate local features at the different levels and nodes of the tree. The nets are trained and the tree is grown using a gradient-type learning algorithm in conjunction with a heuristic class aggregation algorithm. The method improves on standard classification tree design methods in that it generally produces trees with lower error rates and fewer nodes. It also provides a structured approach to neural network classifier design which reduces the problem associated with training large unstructured nets, and transfers the problem of selecting the size of the net to the simpler problem of finding the right size tree.

The question of generalization of network performance from a finite training set to unseen data is clearly of crucial importance. In this article we first show that the generalization error can be decomposed into two terms: the approximation error, due to the insufficient representational capacity of a finite sized network, and the estimation error, due to insufficient information about the target function because of the finite number of samples. We then consider the problem of learning functions belonging to certain Sobolev spaces with gaussian radial basis functions. Using the above-mentioned decomposition we bound the generalization error in terms of the number of basis functions and number of examples. While the bound that we derive is specific for radial basis functions, a number of observations deriving from it apply to any approximation technique. Our result also sheds light on ways to choose an appropriate network architecture for a particular problem and the kinds of problems that can be effectively solved with finite resources, i.e., with a finite number of parameters and finite amounts of data."

In this paper we describe a penalized version of LDA. It is designed for situations in which there are many highly correlated predictors, such as those obtained by discretizing a function, or the grey-scale values of the pixels in a series of images. In cases such as these it is natural, efficient and sometimes essential to impose a spatial smoothness constraint on the coefficients, both for improved prediction performance and interpretability. We cast the classification problem into a regression framework via optimal scoring. Using this, our proposal facilitates the use of any penalized regression technique in the classification setting. The technique is illustrated with examples in speech recognition and handwritten character recognition."

It is established that general-case view-invariants do not exist for any number of points, given true perspective, weak perspective, or orthographic projection models. Feature variation under the weak perspective approximation is then addressed. Though there are no general-case weak-perspective invariants, there are special-case invariants of practical importance. Those cited in the literature are derived from linear dependence relations and the invariance of this type of relation to linear transformation. The variation with respect to view is studied for an important set of 2D line segment features: the relative orientation, size, and position of one line segment with respect to another. The analysis includes an evaluation criterion for feature utility in terms of view-variation. This relationship is a function of both the feature and the particular configuration of 3D line segments. The use of this information in objection recognition is demonstrated for difficult discrimination tasks. >"

All possible candidates for these landmarks are found in the data image using robust relational local operators. A dynamic programming algorithm on the template graph finds the optimal match to a subset of the candidate points in polynomial time. This combination-local operators to describe points of interest/landmarks and a graph to describe their geometric arrangement in the plane-yields fast and precise matches of the model to the data with no initialization required. In addition, it provides a generic tool box for modeling shape in a variety of applications. This methodology is applied in the context of T2-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) axial and sagittal images of the brain to identify specific anatomies."

To reveal neuronal mechanisms of this invariance, we recorded activities from single cells in the anterior part of the inferotemporal cortex (anterior IT), determined the critical features for the activation of individual cells, and examined the effects of changes in stimulus size and position on the responses. 2. Twenty-one percent of the anterior IT cells studied here responded to ranges of size > 4 octaves, whereas 43% responded to size ranges < 2 octaves. The optimal stimulus size, measured by the distance between the outer edges along the longest axis of the stimulus, ranged from 1.7 to 30 degrees. 3. The selectivity for shape was mostly preserved over the entire range of effective size and over the receptive field, whereas some subtle but statistically significant changes were observed in one half of the cells studied here. 4. The size-specific responses observed in 43% of the cells are consistent with recent psychophysical data that suggest that images of objects are stored in a size-specific manner in the long-term memory. Both size-dependent and -independent processing of images may occur in anterior IT."

Generalization results are reported as a function of training set size and network capacity. Given a large training set, and a net with sufficient capacity to achieve high performance on the training set, nets typically achieved error rates of 4-5% at a 0% reject rate and 1-2% at a 10% reject rate. The topology and capacity of the system, as measured by the number of connections in the net, have surprisingly little effect on generalization. For those developing hand-printed character recognition systems, these results suggest that a large and representative training sample may be the single, most important factor in achieving high recognition accuracy. Benefits of reducing the number of net connections, other than improving generalization, are discussed."

The interface performs elementary image processing functions, such as noise filtering and thresholding of the video image from the scanner. The processor receives a binary image of the document, formats the image into individual character patterns, and classifies the patterns one-by-one. A CPU implementation is highly flexible and avoids much of the development and manufacturing costs for special-purpose, parallel circuitry typically used in commercial OCR. A processor-based recognition system has been investigated for reading documents printed in fixed-pitch conventional type fonts, such as occur in routine office typing. Novel, efficient methods for tracking a print line, resolving it into individual character patterns, detecting underscores, and eliminating noise have been devised. A previously developed classification technique, based on decision trees, has been extended in order to improve reading accuracy in an environment of considerable character variation, including the possibility that documents in the same font style may be produced using quite different print technologies. The system has been tested on typical office documents, and also on artificial stress documents, obtained from a variety of typewriters."

To study dependency of their responses on contrast polarity of stimulus images, we selected cells with optimal stimuli that were defined only by shape and not related to texture or color, and examined effects of reversing the contrast of the image or removing it except for edges between dark and bright parts of the image (\"outlining\"). The contrast reversal produced a reduction of the response to the optimal stimulus by > 50% in 60% of tested cells; the outlining, in 70%. When the two transformations were considered together, 94% of the cells showed a reduction by > 50%. Effects of the transformations on shape selectivity were also studied by comparing responses to several different shapes each of whose contours were expressed in different ways. Statistically significant changes in relative effectiveness of the different shapes as a function of contour expression were observed in more than half of the cells. These results suggest that responses of individual cells in anterior IT carry information about contrast polarity as well as about shape."

Spatial stationarity of the connection weights, the C-layers and the use of multiple resolutions are all forms of ORing aimed at achieving invariance. The complex cell in V1 is indeed the most basic evidence of such an operation in the visual system. There is additional evidence for disjunction at a very global scale in the cells of the inferotemporal cortex with very large receptive elds. These respond to certain shapes at all locations in the receptive eld, at a variety of scales but also for a variety of non-linear deformations such as changes in proportions of certain parts (see Ito, Tamura, Fujita & Tanaka (1995), Ito, Fujita, Tamura & Tanaka (1994))."

Based on the properties of IT, and one of its major sources of input, V4, a model is proposed that can account for some of the shape recognition properties of IT neurons including selectivity for complex visual stimuli and tolerance to the size and location of the stimuli. The model is composed of three components. First, stimulus location tolerance is modeled after the complex-cell-like properties observed in some V4 neurons. The second component of the model is an attentionally controlled scaling mechanism that facilitates size-invariant shape recognition. The transition from edge orientation-selective neurons in V4 to neurons with more complicated stimulus preference in IT is explained by the third component of the model, a competitive learning mechanism. Single-unit analysis of receptive field properties, stimulus selectivity, and stimulus size and position tolerance was performed on \"neurons\" from the simulation. Comparison of results from the simulation and a study of actual IT neurons shows that the set of mechanisms incorporated into the simulation is sufficient to emulate the physiological data."

                "text": "Cells in adult primary visual cortex are capable of integrating information over much larger portions of the visual field than was originally thought. Moreover, their receptive field properties can be altered by the context within which local features are presented and by changes in visual experience. The substrate for both spatial integration and cortical plasticity is likely to be found in a plexus of long-range horizontal connections, formed by cortical pyramidal cells, which link cells within each cortical area over distances of 6-8 mm. The relationship between horizontal connections and cortical functional architecture suggests a role in visual segmentation and spatial integration. The distribution of lateral interactions within striate cortex was visualized with optical recording, and their functional consequences were explored by using comparable stimuli in human psychophysical experiments and in recordings from alert monkeys. They may represent the substrate for perceptual phenomena such as illusory contours, surface fill-in, and contour saliency. The dynamic nature of receptive field properties and cortical architecture has been seen over time scales ranging from seconds to months. One can induce a remapping of the topography of visual cortex by making focal binocular retinal lesions. Shorter-term plasticity of cortical receptive fields was observed following brief periods of visual stimulation. The mechanisms involved entailed, for the short-term changes, altering the effectiveness of existing cortical connections, and for the long-term changes, sprouting of axon collaterals and synaptogenesis. The mutability of cortical function implies a continual process of calibration and normalization of the perception of visual attributes that is dependent on sensory experience throughout adulthood and might further represent the mechanism of perceptual learning."

We present a tutorial on nonparametric inference and its relation to neural networks, and we use the statistical viewpoint to highlight strengths and weaknesses of neural models. We illustrate the main points with some recognition experiments involving artificial data as well as handwritten numerals. In way of conclusion, we suggest that current-generation feedforward neural networks are largely inadequate for difficult problems in machine perception and machine learning, regardless of parallel-versus-serial hardware or other implementation issues. Furthermore, we suggest that the fundamental challenges in neural modeling are about representation rather than learning per se. This last point is supported by additional experiments with handwritten numerals."

Furthermore, the exploding growth of the Internet and the ubiquity of images and video, the field of image and multidimensional signal processing is becoming more and more exciting.

Oscillatory activity is often associated with the synchronization of spatially distributed responses10. Here we demonstrate, with simultaneous multi-electrode recordings from the retina and the LGN, that stationary and moving light stimuli evoke in retinal ganglion cells oscillatory responses in the frequency range of 61 to 114 Hz that become synchronized over distances larger than 20 degrees of visual angle across the nasal and temporal halves of the retina. This temporal patterning of retinal responses is transmitted reliably by LGN neurons, such that stimuli crossing the vertical meridian evoke synchronous responses in the LGNs of both hemispheres. The oscillatory responses are not phase-locked to the stimulus onset, indicating that synchronization results from horizontal interactions in the retina. The occurrence of synchronization depends on global stimulus properties such as size and continuity, suggesting that temporal correlation among responses of spatially segregated ganglion cells can be exploited to convey information relevant for perceptual grouping."

Scale, deformation, and other forms of invariance are achieved to a lesser degree, partially from using gray level data and soft thresholds, but mainly by utilizing very large training sets and sophisticated image normalization procedures. The neocognitron (Fukushima & Miyake (1982), Fukushima & Wake (1991)) is an interesting mechanism to achieve a degree of robustness to shape deformations and scale changes in addition to translation invariance. This is done using hidden layers which carry out a local ORing operation mimicking the operation of the complex neurons in V1. These layers are referred to as \\C-type\" layers in Fukushima & Miyake (1982) ."

In e ect, each tree provides an approximation to the full posterior where the features chosen depend on the branch which is traversed. There is a natural partial ordering on the queries which results from regarding each tag arrangement as a labeled graph: Vertex labels correspond to the tag types and edge labels to angle and distance constraints; see Figures 6,7. In this ways the features are ordered according to increasing structure and complexity. A related attribute is semi-invariance, which means that a large fraction of those images of a given class which answer the same way to a given query will also answer the same way to any query immediately succeeding it in the ordering. This leads to nearly invariant classi cation with respect to many of the transformations which preserve shape, such as scaling, translation, skew, and small non-linear deformations of the type shown in Figure 2. Due to the partial ordering, tree construction with an in nite-dimensional feature set is computationally e cient. During training multiple trees (Breiman (1994), Dietterich & Bakiri (1995), Shlien (1990)) are grown and a form of randomization is used to reduce the statistical dependence from tree to tree; weak dependence is veri ed experimentally."
