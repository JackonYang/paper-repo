This algorithm makes use of the essential property of a context-free language as a multi-parenthesis system. It is shown in this paper that a context-free language is n cubed-recognizable in the sense of Hartmanis and Stearns ('Computational complexity of recursive sequences'. Proc. Fifth Annual Symposium of Switching Circuit Theory and Logical Design (Oct. 1964) p.82-90) by a double-tape or double-head single-tape Turing machine and it is n to the 4th power-recognizable by a single-head single-tape Turing machine. If we use a random-access memory whose size is proportional to n cubed, the computing time required for syntaxanalysis is upperbounded by C(1)n cubed + C(2)n squared N, where N denotes the number of nonequivalent valid derivation sequences for a given input sequence and C(i)'s are constants independent of input sequences. If we use a tape of length C(3)n cubed and one of length C(4)n squared as working memories, the computing time for syntax-analysis is upperbounded by C(5)n cubed (1 + N). The size of required memory can be reduced to the order of n squared, but the computing time rises to the order of n to the 4th power. (Author)"

On the other hand, the use of extra tapes does make it possible to speed up the computation of certain functions. It is known that a square factor is sometimes required for a one-tape machine to behave as a two-tape machine and that a square factor is always sufficient.\nThe purpose of this paper is to show that, if a given function requires computation time <italic>T</italic> for a <italic>k</italic>-tape realization, then it requires at most computation time <italic>T</italic> log <italic>T</italic> for a two-tape realization. The proof of this fact is constructive; given any <italic>k</italic>-tape machine, it is shown how to design an equivalent two-tape machine that operates within the stated time bounds. In addition to being interesting in its own right, the trade-off relation between number of tapes and speed of computation can be used in a diagonalization argument to show that if <italic>T</italic>(<italic>n</italic>) and <italic>U</italic>(<italic>n</italic>) are two time functions such that inf <italic>T</italic>(<italic>n</italic>) log <italic>T</italic>(<italic>n</italic>) \u00f7 <italic>U</italic>(<italic>n</italic>) = 0 then there exists a function that can be computed within the time bound <italic>U</italic>(<italic>n</italic>) but not within the time bound <italic>T</italic>(<italic>n</italic>)."

Some of these, such as the prefix and finite delay properties, deal with the time delay with which circuits can be built to decipher the encodings. The self-synchronizing property deals with the ability of the deciphering circuits to get in phase automatically with the enciphering circuits. Exhaustive encodings have the property that all possible sequences of binary digits can occur as messages. Alphabetical-order encodings are those for which the alphabetical order of the letters is preserved as the numerical order of the binary codes, and would be of possible value for sorting of data or consultation of files or dictionaries. Various theorems are proved about the relationships between these properties, and also about their relationship to the average number of binary digits used to encode each letter of the original message."
