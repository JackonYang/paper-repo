The object hypotheses are represented as figure-ground segmentations, and are extracted automatically, without prior knowledge about properties of individual object classes, by solving a sequence of constrained parametric min-cut problems (CPMC) on a regular image grid. We then learn to rank the object hypotheses by training a continuous model to predict how plausible the segments are, given their mid-level region properties. We show that this algorithm significantly outperforms the state of the art for low-level segmentation in the VOC09 segmentation dataset. It achieves the same average best segmentation covering as the best performing technique to date [2], 0.61 when using just the top 7 ranked segments, instead of the full hierarchy in [2]. Our method achieves 0.78 average best covering using 154 segments. In a companion paper [18], we also show that the algorithm achieves state-of-the art results when used in a segmentation-based recognition pipeline."

                "text": "We present a probabilistic method for segmenting instances of a particular object category within an image. Our approach overcomes the deficiencies of previous segmentation techniques based on traditional grid conditional random fields (CRF), namely that 1) they require the user to provide seed pixels for the foreground and the background and 2) they provide a poor prior for specific shapes due to the small neighborhood size of grid CRF. Specifically, we automatically obtain the pose of the object in a given image instead of relying on manual interaction. Furthermore, we employ a probabilistic model which includes shape potentials for the object to incorporate top-down information that is global across the image, in addition to the grid clique potentials which provide the bottom-up information used in previous approaches. The shape potentials are provided by the pose of the object obtained using an object category model. We represent articulated object categories using a novel layered pictorial structures model. Nonarticulated object categories are modeled using a set of exemplars. These object category models have the advantage that they can handle large intraclass shape, appearance, and spatial variation. We develop an efficient method, OBJCUT, to obtain segmentations using our probabilistic framework. Novel aspects of this method include: 1) efficient algorithms for sampling the object category models of our choice and 2) the observation that a sampling-based approximation of the expected log-likelihood of the model can be increased by a single graph cut. Results are presented on several articulated (e.g., animals) and nonarticulated (e.g., fruits) object categories. We provide a favorable comparison of our method with the state of the art in object category specific image segmentation, specifically the methods of Leibe and Schiele and Schoenemann and Cremers."

We differ from existing approaches not only in our seemingly unreasonable assumption that good object-level segments can be obtained in a feed-forward fashion, but also in formulating recognition as a regression problem. Instead of focusing on a one-vs.-all winning margin that may not preserve the ordering of segment qualities inside the non-maximum (non-winning) set, our learning method produces a globally consistent ranking with close ties to segment quality, hence to the extent entire object or part hypotheses are likely to spatially overlap the ground truth. We demonstrate results beyond the current state of the art for image classification, object detection and semantic segmentation, in a number of challenging datasets including Caltech-101, ETHZ-Shape as well as PASCAL VOC 2009 and 2010."

The process of drawing samples from the joint distribution can be interpreted as first sampling tilings, modeled as maximal cliques, from a graph connecting spatially non-overlapping segments in the bag [1], followed by sampling labels for those segments, conditioned on the choice of a particular tiling. We learn the segmentation and labeling parameters jointly, based on Maximum Likelihood with a novel Incremental Saddle Point estimation procedure. The partition function over tilings and labelings is increasingly more accurately approximated by including incorrect configurations that a not-yet-competent model rates probable during learning. We show that the proposed methodology matches the current state of the art in the Stanford dataset [2], as well as in VOC2010, where 41.7% accuracy on the test set is achieved."

However, introducing a high-level prior such as a shape prior or a color-distribution prior into the segmentation process typically results in an energy that is much harder to optimize. The main contribution of the paper is a new global optimization framework for a wide class of such energies. The framework is built upon two powerful techniques: graph cut and branch-and-bound. These techniques are unified through the derivation of lower bounds on the energies. Being computable via graph cut, these bounds are used to prune branches within a branch-and-bound search. \n \nWe demonstrate that the new framework can compute globally optimal segmentations for a variety of segmentation scenarios in a reasonable time on a modern CPU. These scenarios include unsupervised segmentation of an object undergoing 3D pose change, category-specific shape segmentation, and the segmentation under intensity/color priors defined by Chan-Vese and GrabCut functionals."

Our approach considers object categorization and figure-ground segmentation as two interleaved processes that closely collaborate towards a common goal. As shown in our work, the tight coupling between those two processes allows them to benefit from each other and improve the combined performance.\n\nThe core part of our approach is a highly flexible learned representation for object shape that can combine the information observed on different training examples in a probabilistic extension of the Generalized Hough Transform. The resulting approach can detect categorical objects in novel images and automatically infer a probabilistic segmentation from the recognition result. This segmentation is then in turn used to again improve recognition by allowing the system to focus its efforts on object pixels and to discard misleading influences from the background. Moreover, the information from where in the image a hypothesis draws its support is employed in an MDL based hypothesis verification stage to resolve ambiguities between overlapping hypotheses and factor out the effects of partial occlusion.\n\nAn extensive evaluation on several large data sets shows that the proposed system is applicable to a range of different object categories, including both rigid and articulated objects. In addition, its flexible representation allows it to achieve competitive object detection performance already from training sets that are between one and two orders of magnitude smaller than those used in comparable systems.\n"

Potential functions over cliques combine unary Gestalt-based figure quality scores and pairwise compatibilities among spatially neighboring segments, constrained by T-junctions and the boundary interface statistics resulting from projections of real 3d scenes. Learning the model parameters is formulated as rank optimization, alternating between sampling image tilings and optimizing their potential function parameters.

But while much success has been reported in detecting several rectangular-shaped object classes (i.e. faces, cars, pedestrians), results have been much less impressive for more general types of objects. Several researchers have advocated the use of image segmentation as a way to get a better spatial support for objects. In this paper, our aim is to address this issue by studying the following two questions: 1) how important is good spatial support for recognition? 2) can segmentation provide better spatial support for objects? To answer the first, we compare recognition performance using ground-truth segmentation vs. bounding boxes. To answer the second, we use the multiple segmentation approach to evaluate how close can real segments approach the ground-truth for real objects, and at what cost. Our results demonstrate the importance of finding the right spatial support for objects, and the feasibility of doing so without excessive computational burden."

Martin et al., 2001] has enabled the development of learning approaches to the general segmentation problem. Using this database, we present an algorithm that learns how to segment images using region-based, perceptual features. The image is first densely segmented into regions and the edges between them using a variant of the Mumford-Shah functional. Each edge is classified as a boundary or non-boundary using a classifier trained on the ground-truth, resulting in an edge image estimating human-designated boundaries. This novel approach has a few distinct advantages over filter-based methods such as local gradient operators. First, the same perceptual features can represent texture as well as regular structure. Second, the features can measure relationships between image elements at arbitrary distances in the image, enabling the detection of Gestalt properties at any scale. Third, texture boundaries can be precisely localized, which is difficult when using filter banks. Finally, the learning system outputs a relatively small set of intuitive perceptual rules for detecting boundaries. The classifier is trained on 200 images in the ground-truth database, and tested on another 100 images according to the benchmark evaluation methods. Edge classification improves the benchmark F-score from 0.54, for the initial Mumford-Shah-variant segmentation, to 0.61 on grayscale images. This increase of 13% demonstrates the versatility and representational power of our perceptual features, as the score exceeds published results for any algorithm restricted to one type of image feature such as texture or brightness gradient."

Inference is cast as optimization over sets of maximal cliques sampled from a graph connecting all non-overlapping figure-ground segment hypotheses. Potential functions over cliques combine unary, Gestalt-based figure qualities, and pairwise compatibilities among spatially neighboring segments, constrained by T-junctions and the boundary interface statistics of real scenes. Learning the model parameters is based on maximum likelihood, alternating between sampling image tilings and optimizing their potential function parameters. State of the art results are reported on the Berkeley and Stanford segmentation datasets, as well as VOC2009, where a 28% improvement was achieved."

Beginning with an image, we execute a sequence of bottom-up aggregation steps in which pixels are gradually merged to produce larger and larger regions. In each step we consider pairs of adjacent regions and provide a probability measure to assess whether or not they should be included in the same segment. Our probabilistic formulation takes into account intensity and texture distributions in a local area around each region. It further incorporates priors based on the geometry of the regions. Finally, posteriors based on intensity and texture cues are combined using a mixture of experts formulation. This probabilistic approach is integrated into a graph coarsening scheme providing a complete hierarchical segmentation of the image. The algorithm complexity is linear in the number of the image pixels and it requires almost no user-tuned parameters. We test our method on a variety of gray scale images and compare our results to several existing segmentation algorithms."

One reason is their ability to incorporate contextual information at different scales. However, these models do not allow multiple labels to be assigned to a single node. At higher scales in the image, this yields an oversimplified model, since multiple classes can be reasonable expected to appear within one region. This simplified model especially limits the impact that observations at larger scales may have on the CRF model. Neglecting the information at larger scales is undesirable since class-label estimates based on these scales are more reliable than at smaller, noisier scales. To address this problem, we propose a new potential, called harmony potential, which can encode any possible combination of class labels. We propose an effective sampling strategy that renders tractable the underlying optimization problem. Results show that our approach obtains state-of-the-art results on two challenging datasets: Pascal VOC 2009 and MSRC-21."

Rather than trying to find or define a single ldquobestrdquo segmentation, we generate multiple segmentations of an image. This reflects contemporary methods for unsupervised object discovery from groups of images, and it allows us to define intuitive evaluation metrics for our sets of segmentations based on the accurate and parsimonious delineation of scene objects. Our proposed approach builds on recent advances in spectral clustering, image matting, and boundary detection. It is demonstrated qualitatively and quantitatively on a dataset of scenes and is suitable for current work in unsupervised object discovery without top-down knowledge."

Human observers perform this task with ease, relying on a system in which hierarchical processing seems to have a critical role. Despite many attempts, computerized algorithms have so far not demonstrated robust segmentation capabilities under general viewing conditions. Here we describe a new, highly efficient approach that determines all salient regions of an image and builds them into a hierarchical structure. Our algorithm, segmentation by weighted aggregation, is derived from algebraic multigrid solvers for physical systems, and consists of fine-to-coarse pixel aggregation. Aggregates of various sizes, which may or may not overlap, are revealed as salient, without predetermining their number or scale. Results using this algorithm are markedly more accurate and significantly faster (linear in data size) than previous approaches."

In many cases, unary costs of the energy depend linearly on parameter lambda. In this paper we study vision applications for which it is important to solve the maxflow problem for different lambda's. An example is a weighting between data and regularization terms in image segmentation or stereo: it is desirable to vary it both during training (to learn lambda from ground truth data) and testing (to select best lambda using high-knowledge constraints, e.g. user input). We review algorithmic aspects of this parametric maximum flow problem previously unknown in vision, such as the ability to compute all breakpoints of lambda and corresponding optimal configurations infinite time. These results allow, in particular, to minimize the ratio of some geometric functional, such as flux of a vector field over length (or area). Previously, such functional were tackled with shortest path techniques applicable only in 2D. We give theoretical improvements for \"PDE cuts\" [5]. We present experimental results for image segmentation, 3D reconstruction, and the cosegmentation problem."

This process provides accurate delineation of object boundaries that cannot be achieved by either the top-down or bottom-up approach alone. The top-down approach uses object representation learned from examples to detect an object in a given input image and provide an approximation to its figure-ground segmentation. The bottom-up approach uses image-based criteria to define coherent groups of pixels that are likely to belong together to either the figure or the background part. The combination provides a final segmentation that draws on the relative merits of both approaches: The result is as close as possible to the top-down approximation, but is also constrained by the bottom-up process to be consistent with significant image discontinuities. We construct a global cost function that represents these top-down and bottom-up requirements. We then show how the global minimum of this function can be efficiently found by applying the sum-product algorithm. This algorithm also provides a confidence map that can be used to identify image regions where additional top-down or bottom-up information may further improve the segmentation. Our experiments show that the results derived from the algorithm are superior to results given by a pure top-down or pure bottom-up approach. The scheme has broad applicability, enabling the combined use of a range of existing bottom-up and top-down segmentations."

This paper focusses on possibly the simplest application of graph-cuts: segmentation of objects in image data. Despite its simplicity, this application epitomizes the best features of combinatorial graph cuts methods in vision: global optima, practical efficiency, numerical robustness, ability to fuse a wide range of visual cues and constraints, unrestricted topological properties of segments, and applicability to N-D problems. Graph cuts based approaches to object extraction have also been shown to have interesting connections with earlier segmentation methods such as snakes, geodesic active contours, and level-sets. The segmentation energies optimized by graph cuts combine boundary regularization with region-based properties in the same fashion as Mumford-Shah style functionals. We present motivation and detailed technical description of the basic combinatorial optimization framework for image segmentation via s/t graph cuts. After the general concept of using binary graph cut algorithms for object segmentation was first proposed and tested in Boykov and Jolly (2001), this idea was widely studied in computer vision and graphics communities. We provide links to a large number of known extensions based on iterative parameter re-estimation and learning, multi-scale or hierarchical approaches, narrow bands, and other techniques for demanding photo, video, and medical applications."

We explicitly train it to distinguish objects with a well-defined boundary in space, such as cows and telephones, from amorphous background elements, such as grass and road. The measure combines in a Bayesian framework several image cues measuring characteristics of objects, such as appearing different from their surroundings and having a closed boundary. This includes an innovative cue measuring the closed boundary characteristic. In experiments on the challenging PASCAL VOC 07 dataset, we show this new cue to outperform a state-of-the-art saliency measure [17], and the combined measure to perform better than any cue alone. Finally, we show how to sample windows from an image according to their objectness distribution and give an algorithm to employ them as location priors for modern class-specific object detectors. In experiments on PASCAL VOC 07 we show this greatly reduces the number of windows evaluated by class-specific object detectors."

This diversity has led to a wide range of different approaches for image segmentation. In this paper we present a single unified framework for addressing this problem --- \"Segmentation by Composition\". We define a good image segment as one which can be easily composed using its own pieces, but is difficult to compose using pieces from other parts of the image. This non-parametric approach captures a large diversity of segment types, yet requires no pre-definition or modelling of segment types, nor prior training. Based on this definition, we develop a segment extraction algorithm --- i.e., given a single point-of-interest, provide the \"best\" image segment containing that point. This induces a figure-ground image segmentation, which applies to a range of different segmentation tasks: single image segmentation, simultaneous co-segmentation of several images, and class-based segmentations."

Searching the entire space of possible groupings is intractable, and previous approaches have adopted powerful perceptual grouping heuristics, such as proximity and co-curvilinearity, to manage the search. We introduce a new formulation of the problem, by transforming the problem of finding cycles of contour fragments to finding subsets of superpixels whose collective boundary has strong edge support in the image. Our cost function, a ratio of a novel learned boundary gap measure to area, promotes spatially coherent sets of superpixels. Moreover, its properties support a global optimization procedure using parametric maxflow. We evaluate our framework by comparing it to two leading contour closure approaches, and find that it yields improved performance."

We employ a large database of manually segmented images in order to learn an optimal affinity function between pairs of pixels. These pairwise affinities can then be used to cluster the pixels into visually coherent groups. Region cues are computed as the similarity in brightness, color, and texture between image patches. Boundary cues are incorporated by looking for the presence of an \"intervening contour\", a large gradient along a straight line connecting two pixels. We first use the dataset of human segmentations to individually optimize parameters of the patch and gradient features for brightness, color, and texture cues. We then quantitatively measure the power of different feature combinations by computing the precision and recall of classifiers trained using those features. The mutual information between the output of the classifiers and the same-segment indicator function provides an alternative evaluation technique that yields identical conclusions. As expected, the best classifier makes use of brightness, color, and texture features, in both patch and gradient forms. We find that for brightness, the gradient cue outperforms the patch similarity. In contrast, using color patch similarity yields better results than using color gradients. Texture is the most powerful of the three channels, with both patches and gradients carrying significant independent information. Interestingly, the proximity of the two pixels does not add any information beyond that provided by the similarity cues. We also find that the convexity assumptions made by the intervening contour approach are supported by the ecological statistics of the dataset."

Classical image segmentation tools use either texture (colour) information, e.g. Magic Wand, or edge (contrast) information, e.g. Intelligent Scissors. Recently, an approach based on optimization by graph-cut has been developed which successfully combines both types of information. In this paper we extend the graph-cut approach in three respects. First, we have developed a more powerful, iterative version of the optimisation. Secondly, the power of the iterative algorithm is used to simplify substantially the user interaction needed for a given quality of result. Thirdly, a robust algorithm for \"border matting\" has been developed to estimate simultaneously the alpha-matte around an object boundary and the colours of foreground pixels. We show that for moderately difficult examples the proposed method outperforms competitive tools."

The learned model is used for automatic visual recognition and semantic segmentation of photographs. Our discriminative model exploits novel features, based on textons, which jointly model shape and texture. Unary classification and feature selection is achieved using shared boosting to give an efficient classifier which can be applied to a large number of classes. Accurate image segmentation is achieved by incorporating these classifiers in a conditional random field. Efficient training of the model on very large datasets is achieved by exploiting both random feature selection and piecewise training methods. \n \nHigh classification and segmentation accuracy are demonstrated on three different databases: i) our own 21-object class database of photographs of real objects viewed under general lighting conditions, poses and viewpoints, ii) the 7-class Corel subset and iii) the 7-class Sowerby database used in [1]. The proposed algorithm gives competitive results both for highly textured (e.g. grass, trees), highly structured (e.g. cars, faces, bikes, aeroplanes) and articulated objects (e.g. body, cow)."

We define a predicate for measuring the evidence for a boundary between two regions using a graph-based representation of the image. We then develop an efficient segmentation algorithm based on this predicate, and show that although this algorithm makes greedy decisions it produces segmentations that satisfy global properties. We apply the algorithm to image segmentation using two different kinds of local neighborhoods in constructing the graph, and illustrate the results with both real and synthetic images. The algorithm runs in time nearly linear in the number of graph edges and is also fast in practice. An important characteristic of the method is its ability to preserve detail in low-variability image regions while ignoring detail in high-variability regions."

Existing methods are too generic and so far have not demonstrated competitive results for any specific task. In this paper we overcome this limitation by adding two new aspects to cosegmentation: (1) the \u201csomething\u201d has to be an object, and (2) the \u201csimilarity\u201d measure is learned. In this way, we are able to achieve excellent results on the recently introduced iCoseg dataset, which contains small sets of images of either the same object instance or similar objects of the same class. The challenge of this dataset lies in the extreme changes in viewpoint, lighting, and object deformations within each set. We are able to considerably outperform several competitors. To achieve this performance, we borrow recent ideas from object recognition: the use of powerful features extracted from a pool of candidate object-like segmentations. We believe that our work will be beneficial to several application areas, such as image retrieval."

However, evaluation of segmentation algorithms thus far has been largely subjective, leaving a system designer to judge the effectiveness of a technique based only on intuition and results in the form of a few example segmented images. This is largely due to image segmentation being an ill-defined problem-there is no unique ground-truth segmentation of an image against which the output of an algorithm may be compared. This paper demonstrates how a recently proposed measure of similarity, the normalized probabilistic rand (NPR) index, can be used to perform a quantitative comparison between image segmentation algorithms using a hand-labeled set of ground-truth segmentations. We show that the measure allows principled comparisons between segmentations created by different algorithms, as well as segmentations on different images. We outline a procedure for algorithm evaluation through an example evaluation of some familiar algorithms - the mean-shift-based algorithm, an efficient graph-based segmentation algorithm, a hybrid algorithm that combines the strengths of both methods, and expectation maximization. Results are presented on the 300 images in the publicly available Berkeley segmentation data set"

Our contour detector combines multiple local cues into a globalization framework based on spectral clustering. Our segmentation algorithm consists of generic machinery for transforming the output of any contour detector into a hierarchical region tree. In this manner, we reduce the problem of image segmentation to that of contour detection. Extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that both our contour detection and segmentation methods significantly outperform competing algorithms. The automatically generated hierarchical segmentations can be interactively refined by user-specified annotations. Computation at multiple image resolutions provides a means of coupling our system to recognition applications."

In particular, graph cut has problems with segmenting thin elongated objects due to the ldquoshrinking biasrdquo. To overcome this problem, we propose to impose an additional connectivity prior, which is a very natural assumption about objects. We formulate several versions of the connectivity constraint and show that the corresponding optimization problems are all NP-hard. For some of these versions we propose two optimization algorithms: (i) a practical heuristic technique which we call DijkstraGC, and (ii) a slow method based on problem decomposition which provides a lower bound on the problem. We use the second technique to verify that for some practical examples DijkstraGC is able to find the global minimum."

This probabilistic representation of shape resolves two important drawbacks of alternative implicit shape representations such as the level set method: Firstly, the space of shapes is convex in the sense that arbitrary convex combinations of a set of shapes again correspond to a valid shape. Secondly, we prove that the introduction of shape priors into variational image segmentation leads to functionals which are convex with respect to shape deformations. For a large class of commonly considered (spatially continuous) functionals, we prove that - under mild regularity assumptions - segmentation and tracking with statistical shape priors can be performed in a globally optimal manner. In experiments on tracking a walking person through a cluttered scene we demonstrate the advantage of global versus local optimality."

Rather than focusing on local features and their consistencies in the image data, our approach aims at extracting the global impression of an image. We treat image segmentation as a graph partitioning problem and propose a novel global criterion, the normalized cut, for segmenting the graph. The normalized cut criterion measures both the total dissimilarity between the different groups as well as the total similarity within the groups. We show that an efficient computational technique based on a generalized eigenvalue problem can be used to optimize this criterion. We have applied this approach to segmenting static images and found results very encouraging."

This algorithm is targeted for an integrated solution to image segmentation and curve grouping through Bayesian inference. The paper makes the following contributions. (1) It adopts a layered (or 2.1D-sketch) representation integrating both region and curve models which compete to explain an input image. The curve layer occludes the region layer and curves observe a partial order occlusion relation. (2) A Markov chain search scheme Metropolized Gibbs Samplers (MGS) is studied. It consists of several pairs of reversible jumps to traverse the complex solution space. An MGS proposes the next state within the jump scope of the current state according to a conditional probability like a Gibbs sampler and then accepts the proposal with a Metropolis-Hastings step. This paper discusses systematic design strategies of devising reversible jumps for a complex inference task. (3) The proposal probability ratios in jumps are factorized into ratios of discriminative probabilities. The latter are computed in a bottom-up process, and they drive the Markov chain dynamics in a data-driven Markov chain Monte Carlo framework. We demonstrate the performance of the algorithm in experiments with a number of natural images."

Our approach is to generate a set of segmentations by performing graph cuts based on a seed region and a learned affinity function. Then, the regions are ranked using structured learning based on various cues. Our experiments on BSDS and PASCAL VOC 2008 demonstrate our ability to find most objects within a small bag of proposed regions."

One of the most important and yet largely unsolved issues in the graph cut segmentation framework is parameter selection. Parameters are usually fixed beforehand by the developer of the algorithm. There is no single setting of parameters, however, that will result in the best possible segmentation for any general image. Usually each image has its own optimal set of parameters. If segmentation of an image is not as desired under the current setting of parameters, the user can always perform more interaction until the desired results are achieved. However, significant interaction may be required if parameter settings are far from optimal. In this paper, we develop an algorithm for automatic parameter selection. We design a measure of segmentation quality based on different features of segmentation that are combined using AdaBoost. Then we run the graph cut segmentation algorithm for different parameter values and choose the segmentation of highest quality according to our learnt measure. We develop a new way to normalize feature weights for the AdaBoost based classifier which is particularly suitable for our framework. Experimental results show a success rate of 95.6% for parameter selection."

In this paper we show that both tasks can in fact be solved simultaneously using global optimization. By computing cycles of minimal ratio in a large graph spanned by the product of the input image and a shape template, we are able to compute globally optimal segmentations of the image which are similar to a familiar shape and located in places of strong gradient. The presented approach is translation-invariant and robust to local and global scaling and rotation of the given shape. We show how it can be extended to incorporate invariance to similarity transformations. The particular structure of the graph allows for run-time and memory efficient implementations. Highly parallel implementations on graphics cards allow to produce globally optimal solutions in a few seconds only."

Our system is able to represent highly variable object classes and achieves state-of-the-art results in the PASCAL object detection challenges. While deformable part models have become quite popular, their value had not been demonstrated on difficult benchmarks such as the PASCAL data sets. Our system relies on new methods for discriminative training with partially labeled data. We combine a margin-sensitive approach for data-mining hard negative examples with a formalism we call latent SVM. A latent SVM is a reformulation of MI--SVM in terms of latent variables. A latent SVM is semiconvex, and the training problem becomes convex once latent information is specified for the positive examples. This leads to an iterative training algorithm that alternates between fixing latent values for positive examples and optimizing the latent SVM objective function."

It is difficult since often the decision for an edge cannot be made purely based on low level cues such as gradient, instead we need to engage all levels of information, low, middle, and high, in order to decide where to put edges. In this paper we propose a novel supervised learning algorithm for edge and object boundary detection which we refer to as Boosted Edge Learning or BEL for short. A decision of an edge point is made independently at each location in the image; a very large aperture is used providing significant context for each decision. In the learning stage, the algorithm selects and combines a large number of features across different scales in order to learn a discriminative model using an extended version of the Probabilistic Boosting Tree classification algorithm. The learning based framework is highly adaptive and there are no parameters to tune. We show applications for edge detection in a number of specific image domains as well as on natural images. We test on various datasets including the Berkeley dataset and the results obtained are very good."

Geometric classes describe the 3D orientation of an image region with respect to the camera. We provide a multiple-hypothesis framework for robustly estimating scene structure from a single image and obtaining confidences for each geometric label. These confidences can then be used to improve the performance of many other applications. We provide a thorough quantitative evaluation of our algorithm on a set of outdoor images and demonstrate its usefulness in two applications: object detection and automatic single-view reconstruction."

The cut ratio is defined as the ratio of the corresponding sums of two different weights of edges along the cut boundary and models the mean affinity between the segments separated by the boundary per unit boundary length. This new cost function allows the image perimeter to be segmented, guarantees that the segments produced by bipartitioning are connected, and does not introduce a size, shape, smoothness, or boundary-length bias. The latter allows it to produce segmentations where boundaries are aligned with image edges. Furthermore, the cut-ratio cost function allows efficient iterated region-based segmentation as well as pixel-based segmentation. These properties may be useful for some image-segmentation applications. While the problem of finding a minimum ratio cut in an arbitrary graph is NP-hard, one can find a minimum ratio cut in the connected planar graphs that arise during image segmentation in polynomial time. While the cut ratio, alone, is not sufficient as a baseline method for image segmentation, it forms a good basis for an extended method of image segmentation when combined with a small number of standard techniques. We present an implemented algorithm for finding a minimum ratio cut, prove its correctness, discuss its application to image segmentation, and present the results of segmenting a number of medical and natural images using our techniques."

For this purpose, we pursue generic shape models which characterize the most common features of 2D object shapes. In this paper, shape models are learned from observed natural shapes based on a minimax entropy learning theory. The learned shape models are Gibbs distributions defined on Markov random fields (MRFs). The neighborhood structures of these MRFs correspond to Gestalt laws-colinearity, cocircularity, proximity, parallelism, and symmetry. Thus, both contour-based and region-based features are accounted for. Stochastic Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms are proposed for learning and model verification. Furthermore, this paper provides a quantitative measure for the so-called nonaccidental statistics and, thus, justifies some empirical observations of Gestalt psychology by information theory. Our experiments also demonstrate that global shape properties can arise from interactions of local features."

We propose a set of novel features, including multiscale contrast, center-surround histogram, and color spatial distribution, to describe a salient object locally, regionally, and globally. A conditional random field is learned to effectively combine these features for salient object detection. Further, we extend the proposed approach to detect a salient object from sequential images by introducing the dynamic salient features. We collected a large image database containing tens of thousands of carefully labeled images by multiple users and a video segment database, and conducted a set of experiments over them to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach."

This work is distinguished by three key contributions. The first is the introduction of a new image representation called the \"integral image\" which allows the features used by our detector to be computed very quickly. The second is a learning algorithm, based on AdaBoost, which selects a small number of critical visual features from a larger set and yields extremely efficient classifiers. The third contribution is a method for combining increasingly more complex classifiers in a \"cascade\" which allows background regions of the image to be quickly discarded while spending more computation on promising object-like regions. The cascade can be viewed as an object specific focus-of-attention mechanism which unlike previous approaches provides statistical guarantees that discarded regions are unlikely to contain the object of interest. In the domain of face detection the system yields detection rates comparable to the best previous systems. Used in real-time applications, the detector runs at 15 frames per second without resorting to image differencing or skin color detection."

The relation of the mean shift procedure to the Nadaraya-Watson estimator from kernel regression and the robust M-estimators; of location is also established. Algorithms for two low-level vision tasks discontinuity-preserving smoothing and image segmentation - are described as applications. In these algorithms, the only user-set parameter is the resolution of the analysis, and either gray-level or color images are accepted as input. Extensive experimental results illustrate their excellent performance."

Detecting junctions locally has proved problematic because the image intensity surface is confusing in the neighborhood of a junction. Edge detectors also do not perform well near junctions. Current leading approaches to junction detection, such as the Harris operator, are based on 2D variation in the intensity signal. However, a drawback of this strategy is that it confuses textured regions with junctions. We believe that the right approach to junction detection should take advantage of the contours that are incident at a junction; contours themselves can be detected by processes that use more global approaches. In this paper, we develop a new high-performance contour detector using a combination of local and global cues. This contour detector provides the best performance to date (F=0.70) on the Berkeley Segmentation Dataset (BSDS) benchmark. From the resulting contours, we detect and localize candidate junctions, taking into account both contour salience and geometric configuration. We show that improvements in our contour model lead to better junctions. Our contour and junction detectors both provide state of the art performance."

Organised annually from 2005 to present, the challenge and its associated dataset has become accepted as the benchmark for object detection.This paper describes the dataset and evaluation procedure. We review the state-of-the-art in evaluated methods for both classification and detection, analyse whether the methods are statistically different, what they are learning from the images (e.g. the object or its context), and what the methods find easy or confuse. The paper concludes with lessons learnt in the three year history of the challenge, and proposes directions for future improvement and extension."

First, we introduce a descriptor that represents local image shape and its spatial layout, together with a spatial pyramid kernel. These are designed so that the shape correspondence between two images can be measured by the distance between their descriptors using the kernel. Second, we generalize the spatial pyramid kernel, and learn its level weighting parameters (on a validation set). This significantly improves classification performance. Third, we show that shape and appearance kernels may be combined (again by learning parameters on a validation set).\n Results are reported for classification on Caltech-101 and retrieval on the TRECVID 2006 data sets. For Caltech-101 it is shown that the class specific optimization that we introduce exceeds the state of the art performance by more than 10%."

The data to be clustered are represented by an undirected adjacency graph G with arc capacities assigned to reflect the similarity between the linked vertices. Clustering is achieved by removing arcs of G to form mutually exclusive subgraphs such that the largest inter-subgraph maximum flow is minimized. For graphs of moderate size ( approximately 2000 vertices), the optimal solution is obtained through partitioning a flow and cut equivalent tree of G, which can be efficiently constructed using the Gomory-Hu algorithm (1961). However for larger graphs this approach is impractical. New theorems for subgraph condensation are derived and are then used to develop a fast algorithm which hierarchically constructs and partitions a partially equivalent tree of much reduced size. This algorithm results in an optimal solution equivalent to that obtained by partitioning the complete equivalent tree and is able to handle very large graphs with several hundred thousand vertices. The new clustering algorithm is applied to the image segmentation problem. The segmentation is achieved by effectively searching for closed contours of edge elements (equivalent to minimum cuts in G), which consist mostly of strong edges, while rejecting contours containing isolated strong edges. This method is able to accurately locate region boundaries and at the same time guarantees the formation of closed edge contours. >"

The key algorithmic problem here is that of finding pointwise correspondences between an image shape and a stored prototype shape. We introduce a new shape descriptor, the shape context, which makes this possible, using a simple and robust algorithm. The shape context at a point captures the distribution over relative positions of other shape points and thus summarizes global shape in a rich, local descriptor. We demonstrate that shape contexts greatly simplify recovery of correspondences between points of two given shapes. Once shapes are aligned, shape contexts are used to define a robust score for measuring shape similarity. We have used this score in a nearest-neighbor classifier for recognition of hand written digits as well as 3D objects, using exactly the same distance function. On the benchmark MNIST dataset of handwritten digits, this yields an error rate of 0.63%, outperforming other published techniques."

The main goals of these two workshops were (1) to promote the creation of an international object recognition community, with common datasets and evaluation procedures, (2) to map the state of the art and identify the main open problems and opportunities for synergistic research, and (3) to articulate the industrial and societal needs and opportunities for object recognition research worldwide. These goals are reflected in a relatively small number of papers that illustrate the breadth of today's object recognition research and the arsenal of techniques at its disposal, and discuss current achievements and outstanding challenges. Most of the chapters are descriptions of technical approaches, intended to capture the current state of the art. Some of the chapters are of a tutorial nature. They cover fundamental building blocks for object recognition techniques."

The learned Gibbs distributions confirm and improve the forms of existing prior models.

By expressing the kernel as a Fourier expansion, features are generated based on a finite set of random basis projections with inner products that are Monte Carlo approximations to the original kernel. However, the original Fourier features are only applicable to translation-invariant kernels and are not suitable for histograms that are always non-negative. This paper extends the concept of translation-invariance and the random Fourier feature methodology to arbitrary, locally compact Abelian groups. Based on empirical observations drawn from the exponentiated \u03c72 kernel, the state-of-the-art for histogram descriptors, we propose a new group called the skewed-multiplicative group and design translation-invariant kernels on it. Experiments show that the proposed kernels outperform other kernels that can be similarly approximated. In a semantic segmentation experiment on the PASCAL VOC 2009 dataset, the approximation allows us to train large-scale learning machines more than two orders of magnitude faster than previous nonlinear SVMs."

Heavy-tailed RBF kernels of the form K(x, y) = e(-rho)Sigma(i)/xia-yia/b with a < or = 1 and b < or = 2 are evaluated on the classification of images extracted from the Corel stock photo collection and shown to far outperform traditional polynomial or Gaussian radial basis function (RBF) kernels.

Gallo et al. [6] showed that certain versions of the push-relabel algorithm for ordinary maximum flow can be extended to the parametric problem while only increasing the worst-case time bound by a constant factor. Recently Zhang et al. [14,13] proposed a novel, simple balancing algorithm for the parametric problem on bipartite networks. They claimed good performance for their algorithm on networks arising from a real-world application. We describe the results of an experimental study comparing the performance of the balancing algorithm, the GGT algorithm, and a simplified version of the GGT algorithm, on networks related to those of the application of Zhang et al. as well as networks designed to be hard for the balancing algorithm. Our implementation of the balancing algorithm beats both versions of the GGT algorithm on networks related to the application, thus supporting the observations of Zhang et al. On the other hand, the GGT algorithm is more robust; it beats the balancing algorithm on some natural networks, and by asymptotically increasing amount on networks designed to be hard for the balancing algorithm."

                "text": "Recently there has been a lot of interest in \u201censemble learning\u201d \u2014 methods that generate many classifiers and aggregate their results. Two well-known methods are boosting (see, e.g., Shapire et al., 1998) and bagging Breiman (1996) of classification trees. In boosting, successive trees give extra weight to points incorrectly predicted by earlier predictors. In the end, a weighted vote is taken for prediction. In bagging, successive trees do not depend on earlier trees \u2014 each is independently constructed using a bootstrap sample of the data set. In the end, a simple majority vote is taken for prediction. Breiman (2001) proposed random forests, which add an additional layer of randomness to bagging. In addition to constructing each tree using a different bootstrap sample of the data, random forests change how the classification or regression trees are constructed. In standard trees, each node is split using the best split among all variables. In a random forest, each node is split using the best among a subset of predictors randomly chosen at that node. This somewhat counterintuitive strategy turns out to perform very well compared to many other classifiers, including discriminant analysis, support vector machines and neural networks, and is robust against overfitting (Breiman, 2001). In addition, it is very user-friendly in the sense that it has only two parameters (the number of variables in the random subset at each node and the number of trees in the forest), and is usually not very sensitive to their values. The randomForest package provides an R interface to the Fortran programs by Breiman and Cutler (available at http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/ users/breiman/). This article provides a brief introduction to the usage and features of the R functions."

The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund & R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference, ***, 148\u2013156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting.

The algorithm solves directly a problem equivalent to the minimum-cut problem---the maximum blocking-cut problem. Once the maximum blocking-cut solution is available, the additional complexity required to find the respective maximum-flow is O(m log n). A variant of the algorithm is a new parametric maximum-flow algorithm generating all breakpoints in the same complexity required to solve the constant capacities maximum-flow problem. The pseudoflow algorithm has also a simplex variant, pseudoflow-simplex, that can be implemented to solve the maximum-flow problem. One feature of the pseudoflow algorithm is that it can initialize with any pseudoflow. This feature allows it to reach an optimal solution quickly when the initial pseudoflow is \u201cclose\u201d to an optimal solution. The complexities of the pseudoflow algorithm, the pseudoflow-simplex, and the parametric variants of pseudoflow and pseudoflow-simplex algorithms are all O(mn log n) on a graph with n nodes and m arcs. Therefore, the pseudoflow-simplex algorithm is the fastest simplex algorithm known for the parametric maximum-flow problem. The pseudoflow algorithm is also shown to solve the maximum-flow problem on s, t-tree networks in linear time, where s, t-tree networks are formed by joining a forest of capacitated arcs, with nodes s and t adjacent to any subset of the nodes."

We explore two sets of random features, provide convergence bounds on their ability to approximate various radial basis kernels, and show that in large-scale classification and regression tasks linear machine learning algorithms applied to these features outperform state-of-the-art large-scale kernel machines."

Finding the desired parameter value requires solving a sequence of related maximum flow problems. In this paper it is shown that the recent maximum flow algorithm of Goldberg and Tarjan can be extended to solve an important class of such parametric maximum flow problems, at the cost of only a constant factor in its worst-case time bound. Faster algorithms for a variety of combinatorial optimization problems follow from the result."

Each of these techniques constructs a graph such that the minimum cut on the graph also minimizes the energy. Yet, because these graph constructions are complex and highly specific to a particular energy function, graph cuts have seen limited application to date. In this paper, we give a characterization of the energy functions that can be minimized by graph cuts. Our results are restricted to functions of binary variables. However, our work generalizes many previous constructions and is easily applicable to vision problems that involve large numbers of labels, such as stereo, motion, image restoration, and scene reconstruction. We give a precise characterization of what energy functions can be minimized using graph cuts, among the energy functions that can be written as a sum of terms containing three or fewer binary variables. We also provide a general-purpose construction to minimize such an energy function. Finally, we give a necessary condition for any energy function of binary variables to be minimized by graph cuts. Researchers who are considering the use of graph cuts to optimize a particular energy function can use our results to determine if this is possible and then follow our construction to create the appropriate graph. A software implementation is freely available."
