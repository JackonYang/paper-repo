The formalism is based on the \"evidential proposltlonal calculus\", a derivative of Shafer's mathematical theory of evidence [4]. It is more general than either a Boolean or Bayeslan approach, providing for Boolean and Bayeslan inferencing when the appropriate information is available. In this formalism, the likelihood of a proposition A is represented as a subinterval, [s(A), p(A)], of the unit interval, [0, 1]. The evidential support for proposition A is represented by s(A), while p(A) represents its degree of plausibility; p(A) can also be interpreted as the degree to which one fails to doubt A, p(A) being equal to one minus the evidential support for A. This paper describes how evidential information, furnished by a knowledge source in the form of a probability \"mass\" distribution, can be converted to this interval representation; how, through a set of inference rules for computing intervals of dependent propositions, this Information can be extrapolated from those propositions it directly bears upon, to those it indirectly bears upon; and how multiple bodies of evidential Information can be pooled. A sample application of this approach, modeling the operation of a collection of sensors (a particular type of knowledge source), illustrates these techniques."

The paper formulates the theoretical framework and a method for inferring general and optimal (according to certain criteria) descriptions of object classes from examples of classification or partial descriptions. The language for expressing the class descriptions and the guidance rules is an extension of the first-order predicate calculus, called variable-valued logic calculus VL21. VL21 involves typed variables and contains several new operators especially suited for conducting inductive inference, such as selector, internal disjunction, internal conjunction, exception, and generalization. Important aspects of the theory include: 1) a formulation of several kinds of generalization rules; 2) an ability to uniformly and adequately handle descriptors (i.e., variables, functions, and predicates) of different type (nominal, linear, and structured) and of different arity (i.e., different number of arguments); 3) an ability to generate new descriptors, which are derived from the initial descriptors through a rule-based system (i.e., an ability to conduct the so called constructive induction); 4) an ability to use the semantics underlying the problem under consideration. An experimental computer implementation of the method is briefly described and illustrated by an example."

                "text": "Machine Learning is the study of methods for programming computers to learn. Computers are applied to a wide range of tasks, and for most of these it is relatively easy for programmers to design and implement the necessary software. However, there are many tasks for which this is difficult or impossible. These can be divided into four general categories. First, there are problems for which there exist no human experts. For example, in modern automated manufacturing facilities, there is a need to predict machine failures before they occur by analyzing sensor readings. Because the machines are new, there are no human experts who can be interviewed by a programmer to provide the knowledge necessary to build a computer system. A machine learning system can study recorded data and subsequent machine failures and learn prediction rules. Second, there are problems where human experts exist, but where they are unable to explain their expertise. This is the case in many perceptual tasks, such as speech recognition, hand-writing recognition, and natural language understanding. Virtually all humans exhibit expert-level abilities on these tasks, but none of them can describe the detailed steps that they follow as they perform them. Fortunately, humans can provide machines with examples of the inputs and correct outputs for these tasks, so machine learning algorithms can learn to map the inputs to the outputs. Third, there are problems where phenomena are changing rapidly. In finance, for example, people would like to predict the future behavior of the stock market, of consumer purchases, or of exchange rates. These behaviors change frequently, so that even if a programmer could construct a good predictive computer program, it would need to be rewritten frequently. A learning program can relieve the programmer of this burden by constantly modifying and tuning a set of learned prediction rules. Fourth, there are applications that need to be customized for each computer user separately. Consider, for example, a program to filter unwanted electronic mail messages. Different users will need different filters. It is unreasonable to expect each user to program his or her own rules, and it is infeasible to provide every user with a software engineer to keep the rules up-to-date. A machine learning system can learn which mail messages the user rejects and maintain the filtering rules automatically. Machine learning addresses many of the same research questions as the fields of statistics, data mining, and psychology, but with differences of emphasis. Statistics focuses on understanding the phenomena that have generated the data, often with the goal of testing different hypotheses about those phenomena. Data mining seeks to find patterns in the data that are understandable by people. Psychological studies of human learning aspire to understand the mechanisms underlying the various learning behaviors exhibited by people (concept learning, skill acquisition, strategy change, etc.)."

                "text": "The first successful learning programs were developed in the 1950s and belonged to a general category which was at that time commonly known as 'hill-climbing'. Global mathematical models of system performance were typically constructed in forms permitting multi-dimensional representation in systems of orthogonal co-ordinate axes. Numerical parameters were then automatically tuned at run time in response to sensed deviations from computed criteria of optimality. This scheme embraces classical adaptive control, along with many studies of machine learning in games and game-like situations. How the problem appeared to AI workers of that epoch can be gleaned from the proceedings of a celebrated symposium held in 1957 under the title: Mechanisation of Thought Processes (HMSO, London). The present paper is the second of a series. The first appeared nearly 20 years ago and proposed a new principle for attaining the above purposes, now known as 'rule-based' learning. The idea was to partition the problem-domain into a mosaic of smaller sub-domains and to associate a separate rule of action with each. In the pre-learning state a rule may be stochastic or even vacuous. In the learning mode, entry into a given subdomain invokes a global procedure for collecting data on the sensed consequences of executing the associated rule and for up-dating the rule's content in the light of these. A worked toy example was supplied in the form of a computer simulation of a machine for learning to play Noughts and Crosses (Tic-Tac-Toe). Distinct equivalence classes into which the positions can be grouped were taken as the separate sub-domains. These were represented as separate 'boxes', as in a card-filing system. Successful tests of the 'boxes' principle were subsequently made on a hard dynamical problem, namely automatically controlling the support point of an inverted pendulum within a bounded space. The adaptive polebalancer was required to deliver 20 left-right decisions per second to a motor-controlled cart on which was balanced a pole free to move in the vertical plane defined by a straight bounded track (Fig. I). The task of the BOXES program was to acquire by trial and error, or from being shown by a human tutor, or from a combination of both, the ability to control the cart within the bounds set by the ends of the track without permitting the pole's angular deviation from the vertical to exceed a pre-set tolerance. For experimental runs the precise specification was: the system fails if any of four monitored variables (position on track, velocity, pole angle, angular velocity of pole) pass outside fixed bounds. Initially decisions were taken randomly, and fail-free periods were measured in seconds. After learning, the fail-free periods lasted half an hour or more. BOXES was the first system to be driven by a set of independently modifiable production rules, and thus foreshadowed today's 'expert systems'. The mode of learning was primitive, being confined to revising the action-recommendations associated with stored situation-patterns, the latter being fixed. The next series of experiments at Edinburgh, involving computer-coordination of hand-eye robots, focused on the situationperception component of machine learning. In the FREDDY robot work, the learning module built new patterns in memory as the basis of adaptive perception of situation-categories. The stored structures were descriptions in semantic net form of the visual appearances of various objects such as cup, spectacles, axle, wheel, and so forth. From these the system was required at run time to recognize instances from images sampled from the television camera acting as the robot's eye. In robot vision 'programming by example' becomes a necessity. The infeasibility of programming in the ordinary sense is apparent if one compares the police task of identifying a culprit from photographs with identification purely on the basis of verbal description.

When a scientist succeeds in explaining a set of nobservations using a model Mof complexity c then it is generally believed that the likelihood of finding another explanatory model with similar complexity but leading to opposite predictions decreases with increasing nand decreasing c. This paper derives formal relationships between n, c and the probability of ambiguous predictions by examining three modeling languages under binary classification tasks: perceptrons, Boolean formulae, and Boolean networks. Bounds are also derived for the probability of error associated with the policy of accepting only models of complexity not exceeding c. Human tendency to regard the simpler as the more trustworthy is given a qualified justification."

The program represents information at varying levels of description, with higher levels summarizing the levels below them. BACON.4 employs a small set of data-driven heuristics to detect regularities in numeric and nominal data. These heuristics note constancies and trends, causing BACON.4 to formulate hypotheses, to define theoretical terms, and to postulate intrinsic properties. The introduction of intrinsic properties plays an important role in BACON.4\u2019s rediscovery of Ohm\u2019s law for electric circuits and Archimedes\u2019 law of displacement. When augmented with a heuristic for noting common divisors, the system is able to replicate a number of early chemical discoveries, arriving at Proust\u2019s law of definite proportions, Gay-Lussac\u2019s law of combining volumes, Cannizzaro\u2019s determination of the relative atomic weights, and Prout\u2019s hypothesis. The BACON.4 heuristics, including the new technique for finding common divisors, appear to be general mechanisms applicable to discovery in diverse domains."

Hoel's \u201cIntroduction to Mathematical Statistics\u201d seems to me to be an excellent work, and if only it can become generally available it may have a most favourable effect on the situation just described. In spite of the restrictive effect of the present licensing system, means should be found of introducing the book widely in Britain. Placed in the hands of any intelligent mathematical undergraduate, it will give him in a few weeks not only familiarity with the broad outlines of the subject but also a real understanding of the types of problem with which the research worker in this field is contending.Introduction to Mathematical StatisticsBy Assoc.
