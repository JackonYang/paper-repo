                "text": "Recently, Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) have been applied to the task of human pose estimation, and have shown its potential of learning better feature representations and capturing contextual relationships. However, it is difficult to incorporate domain prior knowledge such as geometric relationships among body parts into DCNNs. In addition, training DCNN-based body part detectors without consideration of global body joint consistency introduces ambiguities, which increases the complexity of training. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end framework for human pose estimation that combines DCNNs with the expressive deformable mixture of parts. We explicitly incorporate domain prior knowledge into the framework, which greatly regularizes the learning process and enables the flexibility of our framework for loopy models or tree-structured models. The effectiveness of jointly learning a DCNN with a deformable mixture of parts model is evaluated through intensive experiments on several widely used benchmarks. The proposed approach significantly improves the performance compared with state-of-the-art approaches, especially on benchmarks with challenging articulations."

We propose an approach that jointly solves the tasks of detection and pose estimation: it infers the number of persons in a scene, identifies occluded body parts, and disambiguates body parts between people in close proximity of each other. This joint formulation is in contrast to previous strategies, that address the problem by first detecting people and subsequently estimating their body pose. We propose a partitioning and labeling formulation of a set of body-part hypotheses generated with CNN-based part detectors. Our formulation, an instance of an integer linear program, implicitly performs non-maximum suppression on the set of part candidates and groups them to form configurations of body parts respecting geometric and appearance constraints. Experiments on four different datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art results for both single person and multi person pose estimation."

In this work we show a systematic design for how convolutional networks can be incorporated into the pose machine framework for learning image features and image-dependent spatial models for the task of pose estimation. The contribution of this paper is to implicitly model long-range dependencies between variables in structured prediction tasks such as articulated pose estimation. We achieve this by designing a sequential architecture composed of convolutional networks that directly operate on belief maps from previous stages, producing increasingly refined estimates for part locations, without the need for explicit graphical model-style inference. Our approach addresses the characteristic difficulty of vanishing gradients during training by providing a natural learning objective function that enforces intermediate supervision, thereby replenishing back-propagated gradients and conditioning the learning procedure. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance and outperform competing methods on standard benchmarks including the MPII, LSP, and FLIC datasets."

A typical approach to this problem is to use a linear structured model, which struggles to capture the wide range of appearance present in realistic, unconstrained images. In this paper, we instead propose a model of human pose that explicitly captures a variety of pose modes. Unlike other multimodal models, our approach includes both global and local pose cues and uses a convex objective and joint training for mode selection and pose estimation. We also employ a cascaded mode selection step which controls the trade-off between speed and accuracy, yielding a 5x speedup in inference and learning. Our model outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across the accuracy-speed trade-off curve for several pose datasets. This includes our newly-collected dataset of people in movies, FLIC, which contains an order of magnitude more labeled data for training and testing than existing datasets."

Our main contribution is a CNN cascaded architecture specifically designed for learning part relationships and spatial context, and robustly inferring pose even for the case of severe part occlusions. To this end, we propose a detection-followed-by-regression CNN cascade. The first part of our cascade outputs part detection heatmaps and the second part performs regression on these heatmaps. The benefits of the proposed architecture are multi-fold: It guides the network where to focus in the image and effectively encodes part constraints and context. More importantly, it can effectively cope with occlusions because part detection heatmaps for occluded parts provide low confidence scores which subsequently guide the regression part of our network to rely on contextual information in order to predict the location of these parts. Additionally, we show that the proposed cascade is flexible enough to readily allow the integration of various CNN architectures for both detection and regression, including recent ones based on residual learning. Finally, we illustrate that our cascade achieves top performance on the MPII and LSP data sets. Code can be downloaded from http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~psxab5/."

However, to push for maximum performance recent approaches exploit computationally expensive deep network architectures, train on multiple datasets, apply additional post-processing and provide limited details about used design choices. This makes it hard not only to compare different methods and but also to reproduce existing results . In this work, we propose an efficient deep network architecture that is trained efficiently with a transparent procedure and exploits the best available ingredients from deep learning with low computational budget. The network is trained only on the same dataset without pre-training and achieves impressive performance on popular benchmarks in human pose estimation."

Different from existing approaches of modeling structures on score maps or predicted labels, feature maps preserve substantially richer descriptions of body joints. The relationships between feature maps of joints are captured with the introduced geometrical transform kernels, which can be easily implemented with a convolution layer. Features and their relationships are jointly learned in an end-to-end learning system. A bi-directional tree structured model is proposed, so that the feature channels at a body joint can well receive information from other joints. The proposed framework improves feature learning substantially. With very simple post processing, it reaches the best mean PCP on the LSP and FLIC datasets. Compared with the baseline of learning features at each joint separately with ConvNet, the mean PCP has been improved by 18% on FLIC. The code is released to the public."

While the fine-level state-space of poses of individual parts is too large to permit the use of rich appearance models, most possibilities can be ruled out by efficient structured models at a coarser scale. We propose to learn a sequence of structured models at different pose resolutions, where coarse models filter the pose space for the next level via their max-marginals. The cascade is trained to prune as much as possible while preserving true poses for the final level pictorial structure model. The final level uses much more expensive segmentation, contour and shape features in the model for the remaining filtered set of candidates. We evaluate our framework on the challenging Buffy and PASCAL human pose datasets, improving the state-of-the-art."

Still these serve as the common sources to evaluate, train and compare different models on. In this paper we introduce a novel benchmark \"MPII Human Pose\" that makes a significant advance in terms of diversity and difficulty, a contribution that we feel is required for future developments in human body models. This comprehensive dataset was collected using an established taxonomy of over 800 human activities [1]. The collected images cover a wider variety of human activities than previous datasets including various recreational, occupational and householding activities, and capture people from a wider range of viewpoints. We provide a rich set of labels including positions of body joints, full 3D torso and head orientation, occlusion labels for joints and body parts, and activity labels. For each image we provide adjacent video frames to facilitate the use of motion information. Given these rich annotations we perform a detailed analysis of leading human pose estimation approaches and gaining insights for the success and failures of these methods."

Here we propose a framework that expands the expressive power of hierarchical feature extractors to encompass both input and output spaces, by introducing top-down feedback. Instead of directly predicting the outputs in one go, we use a self-correcting model that progressively changes an initial solution by feeding back error predictions, in a process we call Iterative Error Feedback (IEF). IEF shows excellent performance on the task of articulated pose estimation in the challenging MPII and LSP benchmarks, matching the state-of-the-art without requiring ground truth scale annotation."

We make the following three contributions: (i) an architecture combining a feed forward module with a recurrent module, where the recurrent module can be run iteratively to improve the performance; (ii) the model can be trained end-to-end and from scratch, with auxiliary losses incorporated to improve performance; (iii) we investigate whether keypoint visibility can also be predicted. The model is evaluated on two benchmark datasets.

This is extremely challenging because of variation in pose, anatomy, clothing, and imaging conditions. Current methods use simple models of body part appearance and plausible configurations due to limitations of available training data and constraints on computational expense. We show that such models severely limit accuracy. Building on the successful pictorial structure model (PSM) we propose richer models of both appearance and pose, using state-of-the-art discriminative classifiers without introducing unacceptable computational expense. We introduce a new annotated database of challenging consumer images, an order of magnitude larger than currently available datasets, and demonstrate over 50% relative improvement in pose estimation accuracy over a stateof-the-art method."

The theme we explore is that once a person is localized using an upper body detector, the search for their body parts can be considerably simplified using weak constraints on position and appearance arising from that detection. Our approach is capable of estimating upper body pose in highly challenging uncontrolled images, without prior knowledge of background, clothing, lighting, or the location and scale of the person in the image. People are only required to be upright and seen from the front or the back (not side).We evaluate the stages of our approach experimentally using ground truth layout annotation on a variety of challenging material, such as images from the PASCAL VOC 2008 challenge and video frames from TV shows and feature films.We also propose and evaluate techniques for searching a video dataset for people in a specific pose. To this end, we develop three new pose descriptors and compare their classification and retrieval performance to two baselines built on state-of-the-art object detection models."

Traditional ConvNet architectures include pooling and sub-sampling layers which reduce computational requirements, introduce invariance and prevent over-training. These benefits of pooling come at the cost of reduced localization accuracy. We introduce a novel architecture which includes an efficient `position refinement' model that is trained to estimate the joint offset location within a small region of the image. This refinement model is jointly trained in cascade with a state-of-the-art ConvNet model [21] to achieve improved accuracy in human joint location estimation. We show that the variance of our detector approaches the variance of human annotations on the FLIC [20] dataset and outperforms all existing approaches on the MPII-human-pose dataset [1]."

We propose a novel approach where each location in the image votes for the position of each keypoint using a convolutional neural net. The voting scheme allows us to utilize information from the whole image, rather than rely on a sparse set of keypoint locations. Using dense, multi-target votes, not only produces good keypoint predictions, but also enables us to compute image-dependent joint keypoint probabilities by looking at consensus voting. This differs from most previous methods where joint probabilities are learned from relative keypoint locations and are independent of the image. We finally combine the keypoints votes and joint probabilities in order to identify the optimal pose configuration. We show our competitive performance on the MPII Human Pose and Leeds Sports Pose datasets."

We adopt stacked hourglass networks to generate attention maps from features at multiple resolutions with various semantics. The Conditional Random Field (CRF) is utilized to model the correlations among neighboring regions in the attention map. We further combine the holistic attention model, which focuses on the global consistency of the full human body, and the body part attention model, which focuses on detailed descriptions for different body parts. Hence our model has the ability to focus on different granularity from local salient regions to global semantic consistent spaces. Additionally, we design novel Hourglass Residual Units (HRUs) to increase the receptive field of the network. These units are extensions of residual units with a side branch incorporating filters with larger receptive field, hence features with various scales are learned and combined within the HRUs. The effectiveness of the proposed multi-context attention mechanism and the hourglass residual units is evaluated on two widely used human pose estimation benchmarks. Our approach outperforms all existing methods on both benchmarks over all the body parts. Code has been made publicly available."

We propose (1) improved body part detectors that generate effective bottom-up proposals for body parts; (2) novel image-conditioned pairwise terms that allow to assemble the proposals into a variable number of consistent body part configurations; and (3) an incremental optimization strategy that explores the search space more efficiently thus leading both to better performance and significant speed-up factors. Evaluation is done on two single-person and two multi-person pose estimation benchmarks. The proposed approach significantly outperforms best known multi-person pose estimation results while demonstrating competitive performance on the task of single person pose estimation (Models and code available at http://pose.mpi-inf.mpg.de)."

By analogy with auto-encoders, we propose Context Encoders - a convolutional neural network trained to generate the contents of an arbitrary image region conditioned on its surroundings. In order to succeed at this task, context encoders need to both understand the content of the entire image, as well as produce a plausible hypothesis for the missing part(s). When training context encoders, we have experimented with both a standard pixel-wise reconstruction loss, as well as a reconstruction plus an adversarial loss. The latter produces much sharper results because it can better handle multiple modes in the output. We found that a context encoder learns a representation that captures not just appearance but also the semantics of visual structures. We quantitatively demonstrate the effectiveness of our learned features for CNN pre-training on classification, detection, and segmentation tasks. Furthermore, context encoders can be used for semantic inpainting tasks, either stand-alone or as initialization for non-parametric methods."

This paper aims to push the state-of-the-art in articulated pose estimation in two ways. First we explore various types of appearance representations aiming to substantially improve the body part hypotheses. And second, we draw on and combine several recently proposed powerful ideas such as more flexible spatial models as well as image-conditioned spatial models. In a series of experiments we draw several important conclusions: (1) we show that the proposed appearance representations are complementary, (2) we demonstrate that even a basic tree-structure spatial human body model achieves state-of-the-art performance when augmented with the proper appearance representation, and (3) we show that the combination of the best performing appearance model with a flexible image-conditioned spatial model achieves the best result, significantly improving over the state of the art, on the ``Leeds Sports Poses'' and ``Parse'' benchmarks."

Rather than modeling articulation using a family of warped (rotated and foreshortened) templates, we use a mixture of small, nonoriented parts. We describe a general, flexible mixture model that jointly captures spatial relations between part locations and co-occurrence relations between part mixtures, augmenting standard pictorial structure models that encode just spatial relations. Our models have several notable properties: 1) They efficiently model articulation by sharing computation across similar warps, 2) they efficiently model an exponentially large set of global mixtures through composition of local mixtures, and 3) they capture the dependency of global geometry on local appearance (parts look different at different locations). When relations are tree structured, our models can be efficiently optimized with dynamic programming. We learn all parameters, including local appearances, spatial relations, and co-occurrence relations (which encode local rigidity) with a structured SVM solver. Because our model is efficient enough to be used as a detector that searches over scales and image locations, we introduce novel criteria for evaluating pose estimation and human detection, both separately and jointly. We show that currently used evaluation criteria may conflate these two issues. Most previous approaches model limbs with rigid and articulated templates that are trained independently of each other, while we present an extensive diagnostic evaluation that suggests that flexible structure and joint training are crucial for strong performance. We present experimental results on standard benchmarks that suggest our approach is the state-of-the-art system for pose estimation, improving past work on the challenging Parse and Buffy datasets while being orders of magnitude faster."

This is why pixel-space video prediction may be viewed as a promising avenue for unsupervised feature learning. In addition, while optical flow has been a very studied problem in computer vision for a long time, future frame prediction is rarely approached. Still, many vision applications could benefit from the knowledge of the next frames of videos, that does not require the complexity of tracking every pixel trajectories. In this work, we train a convolutional network to generate future frames given an input sequence. To deal with the inherently blurry predictions obtained from the standard Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss function, we propose three different and complementary feature learning strategies: a multi-scale architecture, an adversarial training method, and an image gradient difference loss function. We compare our predictions to different published results based on recurrent neural networks on the UCF101 dataset"

We describe a general, flexible mixture model for capturing contextual co-occurrence relations between parts, augmenting standard spring models that encode spatial relations. We show that such relations can capture notions of local rigidity. When co-occurrence and spatial relations are tree-structured, our model can be efficiently optimized with dynamic programming. We present experimental results on standard benchmarks for pose estimation that indicate our approach is the state-of-the-art system for pose estimation, outperforming past work by 50% while being orders of magnitude faster."

However, these approaches ignore the most basic principle of image formation: images are product of: (a) Structure: the underlying 3D model; (b) Style: the texture mapped onto structure. In this paper, we factorize the image generation process and propose Style and Structure Generative Adversarial Network (\\({\\text {S}^2}\\)-GAN). Our \\({\\text {S}^2}\\)-GAN has two components: the Structure-GAN generates a surface normal map; the Style-GAN takes the surface normal map as input and generates the 2D image. Apart from a real vs. generated loss function, we use an additional loss with computed surface normals from generated images. The two GANs are first trained independently, and then merged together via joint learning. We show our \\({\\text {S}^2}\\)-GAN model is interpretable, generates more realistic images and can be used to learn unsupervised RGBD representations."

Our approach uses a cascade of convolutional networks within a Laplacian pyramid framework to generate images in a coarse-to-fine fashion. At each level of the pyramid, a separate generative convnet model is trained using the Generative Adversarial Nets (GAN) approach [11]. Samples drawn from our model are of significantly higher quality than alternate approaches. In a quantitative assessment by human evaluators, our CIFAR10 samples were mistaken for real images around 40% of the time, compared to 10% for samples drawn from a GAN baseline model. We also show samples from models trained on the higher resolution images of the LSUN scene dataset."

The training procedure for G is to maximize the probability of D making a mistake. This framework corresponds to a minimax two-player game. In the space of arbitrary functions G and D, a unique solution exists, with G recovering the training data distribution and D equal to \u00bd everywhere. In the case where G and D are defined by multilayer perceptrons, the entire system can be trained with backpropagation. There is no need for any Markov chains or unrolled approximate inference networks during either training or generation of samples. Experiments demonstrate the potential of the framework through qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the generated samples."

However, in recent years generic and powerful recurrent neural network architectures have been developed to learn discriminative text feature representations. Meanwhile, deep convolutional generative adversarial networks (GANs) have begun to generate highly compelling images of specific categories, such as faces, album covers, and room interiors. In this work, we develop a novel deep architecture and GAN formulation to effectively bridge these advances in text and image modeling, translating visual concepts from characters to pixels. We demonstrate the capability of our model to generate plausible images of birds and flowers from detailed text descriptions."

We focus on two applications of GANs: semi-supervised learning, and the generation of images that humans find visually realistic. Unlike most work on generative models, our primary goal is not to train a model that assigns high likelihood to test data, nor do we require the model to be able to learn well without using any labels. Using our new techniques, we achieve state-of-the-art results in semi-supervised classification on MNIST, CIFAR-10 and SVHN. The generated images are of high quality as confirmed by a visual Turing test: our model generates MNIST samples that humans cannot distinguish from real data, and CIFAR-10 samples that yield a human error rate of 21.3%. We also present ImageNet samples with unprecedented resolution and show that our methods enable the model to learn recognizable features of ImageNet classes."

Similar to the probabilistic GANs, a generator is seen as being trained to produce contrastive samples with minimal energies, while the discriminator is trained to assign high energies to these generated samples. Viewing the discriminator as an energy function allows to use a wide variety of architectures and loss functionals in addition to the usual binary classifier with logistic output. Among them, we show one instantiation of EBGAN framework as using an auto-encoder architecture, with the energy being the reconstruction error, in place of the discriminator. We show that this form of EBGAN exhibits more stable behavior than regular GANs during training. We also show that a single-scale architecture can be trained to generate high-resolution images."

Comparatively, unsupervised learning with CNNs has received less attention. In this work we hope to help bridge the gap between the success of CNNs for supervised learning and unsupervised learning. We introduce a class of CNNs called deep convolutional generative adversarial networks (DCGANs), that have certain architectural constraints, and demonstrate that they are a strong candidate for unsupervised learning. Training on various image datasets, we show convincing evidence that our deep convolutional adversarial pair learns a hierarchy of representations from object parts to scenes in both the generator and discriminator. Additionally, we use the learned features for novel tasks - demonstrating their applicability as general image representations."

In this model, the output variables for a given input are predicted sequentially using neural networks. The prediction for each output variable depends not only on the input but also on the previously predicted output variables. The model is applied to spatial localization tasks and uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for processing input images and a multi-scale deconvolutional architecture for making spatial predictions at each step. We explore the impact of weight sharing with a recurrent connection matrix between consecutive predictions, and compare it to a formulation where these weights are not tied. Untied weights are particularly suited for problems with a fixed sized structure, where different classes of output are predicted at different steps. We show that chain models achieve top performing results on human pose estimation from images and videos."

In particular we wish to accurately localise hands and arms, despite fast motion and a cluttered and changing background.We cast the problem as inference in a generative model of the image, and propose a complete model which accounts for self-occlusion of the arms. Under this model, limb detection is expensive due to the very large number of possible configurations each part can assume. We make the following contributions to reduce this cost: (i)\u00a0efficient sampling from a pictorial structure proposal distribution to obtain reasonable configurations; (ii)\u00a0identifying a large number of frames where configurations can be correctly inferred, and exploiting temporal tracking elsewhere.Results are reported for signing footage with challenging image conditions and for different signers. We show that the method is able to identify the true arm and hand locations with high reliability. The results exceed the state-of-the-art for the length and stability of continuous limb tracking."

Such approaches tend to work in a \"unidirectional\" bottom-up feed-forward fashion. However, practical experience and biological evidence tells us that feedback plays a crucial role, particularly for detailed spatial understanding tasks. This work explores \"bidirectional\" architectures that also reason with top-down feedback: neural units are influenced by both lower and higher-level units. We do so by treating units as rectified latent variables in a quadratic energy function, which can be seen as a hierarchical Rectified Gaussian model (RGs) [39]. We show that RGs can be optimized with a quadratic program (QP), that can in turn be optimized with a recurrent neural network (with rectified linear units). This allows RGs to be trained with GPU-optimized gradient descent. From a theoretical perspective, RGs help establish a connection between CNNs and hierarchical probabilistic models. From a practical perspective, RGs are well suited for detailed spatial tasks that can benefit from top-down reasoning. We illustrate them on the challenging task of keypoint localization under occlusions, where local bottom-up evidence may be misleading. We demonstrate state-of-the-art results on challenging benchmarks."

We present a residual learning framework to ease the training of networks that are substantially deeper than those used previously. We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers - 8\u00d7 deeper than VGG nets [40] but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57% error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our extremely deep representations, we obtain a 28% relative improvement on the COCO object detection dataset. Deep residual nets are foundations of our submissions to ILSVRC & COCO 2015 competitions1, where we also won the 1st places on the tasks of ImageNet detection, ImageNet localization, COCO detection, and COCO segmentation."

In particular, we explore the use of generative models to create depictions of objects at future times. These models explore several different prediction tasks: generating a future state given a single depiction of an object, generating a future state given two depictions of an object at different times, and generating future states recursively in a recurrent framework. We provide both qualitative and quantitative evaluations of the generated results, and also conduct a human evaluation to compare variations of our models."
