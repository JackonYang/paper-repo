If the features are not uniquely characterized by their local appearances, as is often the case in programmable assembly, the matching technique must base its decisions on the relative structure of the features. In this paper we describe a technique that uses the relative positions and orientations of the features to determine the correspondence between features of an object model and features observed in a picture. A graph is constructed in which maximal cliques (i.e., completely connected subgraphs) represent mutually consistent assignments of model features to observed features. The technique is a robust, general-purpose way to match structures. However, in practical applications its use is restricted to moderately sized graphs because the algorithm that locates maximal cliques is apparently exponential. For tasks that require the analysis of large graphs a few techniques are presented to reformulate them so that smaller graphs are sufficient."

The technique forms all possible pairs of image features and model features which match on the basis of local evidence alone. For each possible pair of matching features the parameters of an RST (rotation, scaling, and translation) transformation are derived. Clustering in the space of all possible RST parameter sets reveals a good global transformation which matches many image features to many model features. Results with a variety of data sets are presented which demonstrate that the technique does not require sophisticated feature detection and is robust with respect to changes of image orientation and content. Examples in both cartography and object detection are given."

The matching is a specification of the geometrical disparity between the images and may be used to partially reconstruct the three-dimensional structure of the scene. Sets of candidate matching points are selected independently in each image. These points are the locations of small, distinct features which are likely to be detectable in both images. An initial network of possible matches between the two sets of candidates is constructed. Each possible match specifies a possible disparity of a candidate point in a selected reference image. An initial estimate of the probability of each possible disparity is made, based on the similarity of subimages surrounding the points. These estimates are iteratively improved by a relaxation labeling technique making use of the local continuity property of disparity that is a consequence of the continuity of real world surfaces. The algorithm is effective for binocular parallax, motion parallax, and object motion. It quickly converges to good estimates of disparity, which reflect the spatial organization of the scene."

In preparing the film, the cellulose films are unwound from rolls D, D over cylinders A, A placed close together and heated by steam &c., the distance between the cylinders being adjustable. The plastic material is fed into the gap E between the films, and the composite film passes over a series of cylinders B, which may be heated when heat is necessary to set the plastic material. One of the two outer films may be glued to a strip of paper, fabric, metal, or other thin sheet material, and powder, fibres, blades, spangles, and other solid substances may be mixed with the plastic material."

These experiences made me aware that seemingly simple discrete optimization problems could hold the seeds of combinatorial explosions. The work of Dantzig, Fulkerson, Hoffman, Edmonds, Lawler and other pioneers on network flows, matching and matroids acquainted me with the elegant and efficient algorithms that were sometimes possible. Jack Edmonds\u2019 papers and a few key discussions with him drew my attention to the crucial distinction between polynomial-time and superpolynomial-time solvability. I was also influenced by Jack\u2019s emphasis on min-max theorems as a tool for fast verification of optimal solutions, which foreshadowed Steve Cook\u2019s definition of the complexity class NP. Another influence was George Dantzig\u2019s suggestion that integer programming could serve as a universal format for combinatorial optimization problems."
