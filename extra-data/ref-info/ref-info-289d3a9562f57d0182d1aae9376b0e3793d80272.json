A model for text comprehension based on this notion accounts for the formation of a coherent semantic text base in terms of a cyclical process constrained by limitations of working memory. Furthermore, the model includes macro-operators, whose purpose is to reduce the information in a text base to its gist, that is, the theoretical macrostructure. These operations are under the control of a schema, which is a theoretical formulation of the comprehender's goals. The macroprocesses are predictable only when the control schema can be made explicit. On the production side, the model is concerned with the generation of recall and summarization protocols. This process is partly reproductive and partly constructive, involving the inverse operation of the macro-operators. The model is applied to a paragraph from a psychological research report, and methods for the empirical testing of the model are developed."

The system offers insights into a variety of linguistic phenomena and allows easy testing of a variety of hypotheses. Language interpretation takes place on a activation network which is dynamically created from input, recent context, and long-term knowledge. Initially ambiguous and unstable, the network settles on a single interpretation, using a parallel, analog relaxation process. We also describe a parallel model for the representation of context and of the priming of concepts. Examples illustrating contextual influence on meaning interpretation and \u201csemantic garden path\u201d sentence processing, among other issues, are included."

CRT encompasses representational ideas that have emerged from work in semantic networks, frames, frame semantics, and Conceptual Dependency. the theory attempts to meet certain desiderata for a meaning representation, namely, the principles of adequacy, interpret ability, uniformity, economy, and, in particular, cognitive correspondence. Motivated by these principles, the theory eliminates the frame/slot distinction found in frame-based languages (alternatively, node/link distinction. In addition, the theory incorporates as representational entities notions reminiscent of natural language metaphoric and metanymic relationships. This is done through a mechanism called views. The theory allows for the representation of some ideas that in the past have only been represented procedurally, informally, or not at all. An implementation of much of CRT, called KODIAK, has been created, and used in a number of experiments."

Furthermore, not all authors who use comparable semantic units in their analyses use the same term. For instance, Dik (1980) talked about predicates and terms combining to form predications. Wilensky (1986) used relation and aspectuals. In spite of this terminological disarray and the possibility of confusion with the meaning of proposition in logic, proposition appears to be the most widely accepted term and will be retained here. 4 The extreme informality of this notation is chosen for ease of exposition. Frequently, of course, a more precise formalism is needed. It is fairly straightforward to elaborate the present informal notation whenever that is the case. For example, in the computer simulation of word problem solving by I)ellarosa (1986), the LOOPS language provides a ready-made type-token distinction."

Assuming a certain general framework about working memory and long-term memory, the evidence tended to point toward a positive conclusion-that both can be cognitive units. Evidence for this comes from observations about all-or-none recall, heightened recall of units, associative priming, diminution of interference effects, considerations of implementation efficiency, and considerations of cognitive naturalness. This being said, I do not find the current picture so convincing that I would want to make a never-say-die commitment to the positive conclusion for cognitive units at all levels of knowledge structures. The idea seems sufficiently promising that it is worthwhile to develop a more explicit theory of what a cognitive unit would be like. So I have proposed a general notion of a cognitive unit that spanned propositions and schemata as special cases and specified the encoding and retrieval properties that such a cognitive unit would have. To be succinct, the important ideas associated with cognitive units are the following: (1) They can occur at multiple levels and enter into hierarchies. (2) If a set of working-memory elements can be put in correspondence with an existing knowledge structure, the elements can be joined in a cognitive unit by a single encoding act. (3) The elements in a cognitive unit are brought into working memory in a single retrieval act. (4) It is possible to evaluate general properties of a cognitive unit without having to expand it into its elements and inspect these. Perhaps this is done by measuring level of activation."

In three experiments, subjects read texts presented by a rapid serial visual procedure and performed a lexical decision on visually presented targets that followed ambiguous prime words. When the target was a word, it was either an associate of the prime word, a probable inference suggested by the discourse, or an unrelated word. For associates, lexical decisions that related to either the appropriate or the inappropriate sense of the ambiguous word were generally facilitated at short (200-400 msec) prime-target stimulus onset asynchronies (SOAs). At longer SOAs, responses were faster to appropriate than to inappropriate associates. For the thematic inferences, there was no difference between these (appropriate) inferences and (inappropriate) control words at short SOAs. At long SOAs (1,000 and 1,500 msec), however, inference words were facilitated. The results are interpreted as consistent with a model of lexical processing in which sense activation functions independently of context. Discourse context effects, whether on sense selection (suppression of inappropriate associates) or on sense elaboration (creation of inferences), are seen as postlexical."

An appropriate recent interest in word problems has produced much data on the relative difficulty of different kinds of word problems, and some data on the strategies children use to solve these problems together with the kinds of errors they make. We also have accounts of problem difficulty based on descriptions of the problem, that is, on their structural variables or on their semantic structure. We present here and account of problem difficulty based on a description of the psychological processes of the child. The purpose of this article is to outline a model of these processes, made explicit in the form of a computer-implemented model. The model solves many common word problems by acting them out with representations of physical counters. More difficult problems require augmenting this procedure first with knowledge that one object is a member of both ..."

The model has as its central feature a set of \"logogens\": devices which accept information relevant to a particular word response irrespective of the source of this information. When more than a threshold amount of information has accumulated in any logogen, that particular response becomes available for responding. The model is tested against data available on the effect of word frequency on recognition, the effect of limiting the number of response alternatives, the interaction of stimulus and context, and the interaction of successive presentations of stimuli. The implications of the underlying model are largely upheld. Other possible models for word recognition are discussed as are the implications of the Logogen Model for theories of memory."

The present experiment reexamines this question with improved procedures.

Mary, bake, and cake activate their corresponding lexical nodes, and MARY and CAKE are assigned the roles of agent and object in the BAKE proposition. As was suggested in Figure 2, BAKE requires a PERSON as agent, hence a test is made whether MARY is a person. This may either involve a search through the knowledge net for the proposition ISA[MARY,PERSON] or, should that search prove unsuccessful, an attempt to infer this proposition (e.g., the net may contain only propositions to the effect that MARY is a name and that persons have names; exactly how such problem-solving activity occurs within an associative net will not be considered here). The present model, however, differs in a significant way from my earlier conceptions: It does not require that the right, and only the right, proposition always be formed. Instead, the construction rules for building propositions can be weakened, allowing for the formation of incomplete or \"wrong\" propositions. Proposition building is on-line, and frequently, all the relevant information for building just the right one is not available on-line, leading to false starts or incompleted attempts. In the aforementioned example, this has no interesting consequences; for example, if in response to the phrase Mary bakes . . , the proposition BAKE[MARY,$I--the dollar sign indicates an unfilled slot--is formed, it will simply be replaced by the complete proposition when the rest of the sentence is processed. However, consider an example discussed by Frazier and Rayner (1982): The linguists knew the solution of the problem wouM not be easy Here, the on-line construction of propositions is not so simple."

For word arithmetic problems, the most important constructions involved the arithmetic hypotheses. The construction of macropropositions could be neglected, mostly because the word problems were short ones and their macrostructure played no role in the problem-solving process) For many other types of text, construction rules to form successive layers of abstractions and generalizations, as described by Turner et al. (1986), would be of primary interest. The macrostructure of a text could thus be made an integral part of a text base rather than a separate component, as it is presently treated. Thus, there are a great many rules necessary to make the construction-integration model work for proposition building, assigning references and coreferences, bridging inferences, forming macrostructures, elaborating knowledge, and so on. Some of these construction rules are reasonably well worked out at this point, others are available within restricted domains, but many problems remain as yet unsolved. Thus, some of the same problems are encountered here as in conventional expectationdriven, top-down models of comprehension--but with one difference: Weaker, more general rules can be used here because these rules need not be fine-tuned to an ever-changing context. Whatever rules are still needed ought to be easier to work out within the construction-integration framework. In van Dijk and Kintsch (1983), an imporant distinction was made between text bases and situation models."

It posits cue-dependent probabilistic sampling and recovery from an associative network, but the network is specified as a retrieval structure rather than a storage structure. A quantitative computer simulation of SAM was developed and applied to the part-list cuing paradigm. When free recall of a list of words was cued by a random subset of words from that list, the probability of recalling one of the remaining words was less than if no cues were provided at all. SAM predicted this effect in all its variations by making extensive use of interword associations in retrieval, a process that previous theorizing has dismissed. (55 ref)"

The conditions under which readers appear to infer such predictable outcomes were examined with three different retrieval paradigms: immediate recognition test, cued recall, and priming in word recognition. On immediate test, responses to a word representing the implicit outcome (e.g., dead) were slow, but on delayed test these responses were slow or inaccurate only when primed by an explicitly stated word. However, the word expressing the predictable outcome did function as an effective recall cue. Results suggest that readers encode these inferences into memory only minimally, but that they can make use of a cue word that represents the inference (e.g., dead) both at the time of an immediate test and in delayed cued recall."

By manipulating the difficulty of each task, it is argued that the procedure estimates the attention demands of the memory-access component of word recognition. Specifically, the the complexity of the secondary task was varied from a simple reaction time task to a choice reaction time task, and the difficulty of a lexical decision (word vs. nonword) primary task was varied by manipulating word frequency. A comparison of the effect of secondary task complexity across levels of word frequency showed that the difference between the two secondary tasks was larger for low-frequency words than for high-frequency words. This result, supported by other characteristics of the data, suggests that the memory-access processing in one type of word recognition task does demand attention."

The present studies investigated the possibility that assessment of confidence is biased by attempts to justify one's chosen answer. These attempts include selectively focusing on evidence supporting the chosen answer and disregarding evidence contradicting it. Experiment 1 presented subjects with two-alternative questions and required them to list reasons for and against each of the alternatives prior to choosing an answer and assessing the probability of its being correct. This procedure produced a marked improvement in the appropriateness of confidence judgments. Experiment 2 simplified the manipulation by asking subjects first to choose an answer and then to list (a) one reason supporting that choice, (b) one reason contradicting it, or (c) one reason supporting and one reason contradicting. Only the listing of contradicting reasons improved the appropriateness of confidence. Correlational analyses of the data of Experiment 1 strongly suggested that the confidence depends on the amount and strength of the evidence supporting the answer chosen."

There may have been times when developments in neuroscience, artificial intelligence, or cognitive psychology seduced researchers into believing that their discipline was on the verge of discovering the secret of intelligence. But a humbling history of hopes disappointed has produced the realization that understanding the mind will challenge the power of all these methodologies combined. The work reported in this chapter rests on the conviction that a methodology that has a crucial role to play in the development of cognitive science is mathematical analysis. The success of cognitive science, like that of many other sciences, will, I believe, depend upon the construction of a solid body of theoretical results: results that express in a mathematical language the conceptual insights of the field; results that squeeze all possible implications out of those insights by exploiting powerful mathematical techniques. This body of results, which I will call the theory of information processing, exists because information is a concept that lends itself to mathematical formalization. One part of the theory of information processing is already well-developed. The classical theory of computation provides powerful and elegant results about the notion of effective procedure, including languages for precisely expressing them and theoretical machines for realizing them."

Young children's understanding of correspondences and numerical differences between disjoint sets was studied in a series of 3 experiments. In the first 2 experiments, 64 children between 4 and 8 years of age were shown pairs of sets and were asked both standard (\"How many more birds than worms are there?\") and nonstandard (\"How many birds won't get a worm?\") numerical difference questions. The children's observed success in answering the Won't Get questions indicates that many young children are skillful at establishing correspondences and determining exact numerical differences between disjoint sets; their poor performance on the standard questions apparently reflects a misinterpretation or inadequate comprehension of comparative constructions of the general form \"How many . . . [comparative term] . . than . .. ?\" The final experiment, involving 30 additional kindergarten children, dealt with children's solution strategies in answering Won't Get questions. The most frequently observed solution strategy was a sophisticated indirect counting strategy rather than a perceptually guided pairing strategy. Taken together, the present findings restrict the domain of applicability of the theory that young children are limited to perceptually based forms of mathematical reasoning."

The result is an initial, enriched, but incoherent and possibly contradictory text base, which is then subjected to an integration process to form a coherent structure. In Step A of this process, a propositionai representation of the text is constructed from a parsed linguistic input, such as the words of a text with suitable syntactic annotations, and from a knowledge system as envisioned earlier. Note that the parser itself is not a part of the present model. The basic process of proposition building has been described in van Dijk and Kintsch (1983, chapter 4) and Kmtsch (1985). I will illustrate it here with some simple examples. Consider the sentence Mary bakes a cake. The parser out put needed is Mary (agent of BAKE) bakes (predicate) a cake(object of BAKE). Mary, bake, and cake activate their corresponding lexical nodes, and M A R Y and CAKE are assigned the roles of agent and object in the BAKE proposition. As was suggested in Figure 2, BAKE requires a PERSON as agent, hence a test is made whether M A R Y is a person. This may either involve a search through the knowledge net for the proposition ISA[MARY,PERSON] or, should that search prove unsuccessful, an attempt to infer this proposition (e.g., the net may contain only propositions to the effect that M A R Y is a name and that persons have names; exactly how such problem-solving activity occurs within an associative net will not be considered here). The present model, however, differs in a significant way from my earlier conceptions: It does not require that the right, and only the right, proposition always be formed. Instead, the construction rules for building propositions can be weakened, allowing for the formation of incomplete or \"wrong\" propositions. Proposition building is on-line, and frequently, all the relevant information for building just the right one is not available on-line, leading to false starts or incompleted attempts. In the aforementioned example, this has no interesting consequences; for example, if in response to the phrase Mary bakes . the proposition BAKEfMARY.Sj\u2014the dollar sign indicates an unfilled slot\u2014is formed, it will simply be replaced by the complete proposition when the rest of the sentence is processed. However, consider an example discussed by Fra/ier and Rayner (1982): The linguists knew the solution of the problem would not be easy."

The model does not account for the time values cited here, but ii describes a processing sequence in accordance with the empirically determined time sequence. In many models of word identification, the problem is thought to be \"How do we get from a certain (acoustic or visual) stimulus pattern to the place in the mental lexicon where the meaning of this word is stored?\" In the present model, word identification is much more deeply embedded into the process of discourse understanding. The lexical node itself provides just one entry point into the comprehender's long-term memory store of knowledge and experiences, and what eventually becomes activated from that store depends on the discourse context. In conceptions of the lexicon like that of Mudersbach's (1982), the meaning of a word is given by its \"neighborhood\" in the associative network into which it is embedded."

The construction-integration model is closely related to Norris's model. On the one hand, it is more specific in that it proposes computational procedures by means of which Norris's \"plausibility check\" could actually be achieved, whereas on the other hand it replaces Norris's shift in criterion bias with the computationally more feasible integration mechanism. It appears likely that the present model can handle all the data the checking model accounts for, in just the same way and for just the same reasons as the checking model. There is, however, another part of the literature on word recognition that is not discussed in Norris (1986): the work on word identification in discourse."
