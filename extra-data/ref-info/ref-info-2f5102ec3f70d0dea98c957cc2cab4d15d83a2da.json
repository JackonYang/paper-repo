With it, you'll learn how to write Python programs that work with large collections of unstructured text. You'll access richly annotated datasets using a comprehensive range of linguistic data structures, and you'll understand the main algorithms for analyzing the content and structure of written communication. Packed with examples and exercises, Natural Language Processing with Python will help you: Extract information from unstructured text, either to guess the topic or identify \"named entities\" Analyze linguistic structure in text, including parsing and semantic analysis Access popular linguistic databases, including WordNet and treebanks Integrate techniques drawn from fields as diverse as linguistics and artificial intelligence This book will help you gain practical skills in natural language processing using the Python programming language and the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) open source library. If you're interested in developing web applications, analyzing multilingual news sources, or documenting endangered languages -- or if you're simply curious to have a programmer's perspective on how human language works -- you'll find Natural Language Processing with Python both fascinating and immensely useful."

Most importantly, unlike other modern parsing models, the factored model admits an extremely effective A* parsing algorithm, which enables efficient, exact inference."

It is the companion book to an impressive open-source software library called the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK), written in Python. NLTK combines language processing tools (tokenizers, stemmers, taggers, syntactic parsers, semantic analyzers) and standard data sets (corpora and tools to access the corpora in an efficient and uniform manner). Although the book builds on the NLTK library, it covers only a relatively small part of what can be done with it. The combination of the book with NLTK, a growing system of carefully designed, maintained, and documented code libraries, is an extraordinary resource that will dramatically influence the way computational linguistics is taught. The book attempts to cater to a large audience: It is a textbook on computational linguistics for science and engineering students; it also serves as practical documentation for the NLTK library, and it finally attempts to provide an introduction to programming and algorithm design for humanities students. I have used the book and its earlier on-line versions to teach advanced undergraduate and graduate students in computer science in the past eight years. The book adopts the following approach:"

These researchers are engaged in activities ranging from natural language dialog, information retrieval, topic-tracking, named-entity detection, document classification and machine translation to bioinformatics and open-domain question answering. An analysis of these activities strongly suggested that improving the organization's ability to quickly discover each other's results and rapidly combine different technologies and approaches would accelerate scientific advance. Furthermore, the ability to reuse and combine results through a common architecture and a robust software framework would accelerate the transfer of research results in NLP into IBM's product platforms. Market analyses indicating a growing need to process unstructured information, specifically multilingual, natural language text, coupled with IBM Research's investment in NLP, led to the development of middleware architecture for processing unstructured information dubbed UIMA. At the heart of UIMA are powerful search capabilities and a data-driven framework for the development, composition and distributed deployment of analysis engines. In this paper we give a general introduction to UIMA focusing on the design points of its analysis engine architecture and we discuss how UIMA is helping to accelerate research and technology transfer."

Further progress towards understanding compositionality in tasks such as sentiment detection requires richer supervised training and evaluation resources and more powerful models of composition. To remedy this, we introduce a Sentiment Treebank. It includes fine grained sentiment labels for 215,154 phrases in the parse trees of 11,855 sentences and presents new challenges for sentiment compositionality. To address them, we introduce the Recursive Neural Tensor Network. When trained on the new treebank, this model outperforms all previous methods on several metrics. It pushes the state of the art in single sentence positive/negative classification from 80% up to 85.4%. The accuracy of predicting fine-grained sentiment labels for all phrases reaches 80.7%, an improvement of 9.7% over bag of features baselines. Lastly, it is the only model that can accurately capture the effects of negation and its scope at various tree levels for both positive and negative phrases."

We show how to solve this dilemma with Gibbs sampling, a simple Monte Carlo method used to perform approximate inference in factored probabilistic models. By using simulated annealing in place of Viterbi decoding in sequence models such as HMMs, CMMs, and CRFs, it is possible to incorporate non-local structure while preserving tractable inference. We use this technique to augment an existing CRF-based information extraction system with long-distance dependency models, enforcing label consistency and extraction template consistency constraints. This technique results in an error reduction of up to 9% over state-of-the-art systems on two established information extraction tasks."

Our sieve architecture applies a battery of deterministic coreference models one at a time from highest to lowest precision, where each model builds on the previous model's cluster output. The two stages of our sieve-based architecture, a mention detection stage that heavily favors recall, followed by coreference sieves that are precision-oriented, offer a powerful way to achieve both high precision and high recall. Further, our approach makes use of global information through an entity-centric model that encourages the sharing of features across all mentions that point to the same real-world entity. Despite its simplicity, our approach gives state-of-the-art performance on several corpora and genres, and has also been incorporated into hybrid state-of-the-art coreference systems for Chinese and Arabic. Our system thus offers a new paradigm for combining knowledge in rule-based systems that has implications throughout computational linguistics."

Thereby, semantic information processing technologies are utilized to transform unstructured information into structured knowledge for different media types, including text and handwriting. In order to support the interoperability of components created in various research projects of UKP, we decided to build upon Unstructured Information Management Architecture (UIMA) (Ferrucci and Lally, 2004), released as an open-source project by IBM in 2006. The mid-term goal is to provide a collection of software components for semantic information processing based on UIMA, called Darmstadt Knowledge Processing Software Repository (DKPro).
