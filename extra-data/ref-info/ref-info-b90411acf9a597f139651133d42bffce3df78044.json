By classifying each pixel as either periphery, background, text block, or decoration, we achieve high quality segmentation without any assumption of specific topologies and shapes. Various color and texture features such as color variance, smoothness, Laplacian, Local Binary Patterns, and Gabor Dominant Orientation Histogram are used for classification. Some of these features have so far not got many attentions for document image layout analysis. By applying an Improved Fast Correlation-Based Filter feature selection algorithm, the redundant and irrelevant features are removed. Finally, the segmentation results are refined by a smoothing post-processing procedure. The proposed method is demonstrated by experiments conducted on three different historical handwritten document image datasets. Experiments show the benefit of combining various color and texture features for classification. The results also show the advantage of using a feature selection method to choose optimal feature subset. By applying the proposed method we achieve superior accuracy compared with earlier work on several datasets, e.g., We achieved 93% accuracy compared with 91% of the previous method on the Parzival dataset which contains about 100 million pixels."

We introduce an approach that segments text appearing in page margins (a.k.a side-notes text) from manuscripts with complex layout format. Simple and discriminative features are extracted in a connected-component level and subsequently robust feature vectors are generated. Multilayer perception classifier is exploited to classify connected components to the relevant class of text. A voting scheme is then applied to refine the resulting segmentation and produce the final classification. In contrast to state-of-the-art segmentation approaches, this method is independent of block segmentation, as well as pixel level analysis. The proposed method has been trained and tested on a dataset that contains a variety of complex side-notes layout formats, achieving a segmentation accuracy of about 95%."

First, we segment text elements from non-text elements using a binarized version of the document. Then, we refine the segmentation of the non-text regions into drawings, background and noise. At this stage, spatial and color features are exploited to guarantee coherent regions in the final segmentation. Experiments show that the suggested approach achieves better segmentation quality with respect to other methods. We examine the segmentation quality on 252 pages of a historical manuscript, for which the suggested method achieves about 92% and 90% segmentation accuracy of drawings and text elements, respectively."

We use a pyramidal approach where at the first level, pixels are classified into: text, background, decoration, and out of page, at the second level, text regions are split into text line and non text line. Color and texture features based on Local Binary Patterns and Gabor Dominant Orientation are used for classification. By applying a modified Fast Correlation-Based Filter feature selection algorithm, redundant and irrelevant features are removed. Finally, the text line segmentation results are refined by a smoothing post-processing procedure. Unlike other projection profile or connected components methods, the proposed algorithm does not use any script-specific knowledge and is applicable to color images. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on three historical manuscript image datasets of diverse nature and achieved an average precision of 91% and recall of 84%. Experiments also show that the proposed algorithm is robust with respect to changes of the writing style, page layout, and noise on the image."

It describes the competition (modus operandi, dataset and evaluation methodology) held in the context of ICDAR2011 and the International Workshop on Historical Document Imaging and Processing (HIP2011), presenting the results of the evaluation of four submitted methods. A commercial state-of-the-art system is also evaluated for comparison. Two scenarios are reported in this paper, one evaluating the ability of methods to accurately segment regions and the other evaluating the whole pipeline of segmentation and region classification (with a text extraction goal). The results indicate that there is a convergence to a certain methodology with some variations in the approach. However, there is still a considerable need to develop robust methods that deal with the idiosyncrasies of historical documents."

                "text": "Texture feature analysis has undergone tremendous growth in recent years. It plays an important role for the analysis of many kinds of images. More recently, the use of texture analysis techniques for historical document image segmentation has become a logical and relevant choice in the conditions of significant document image degradation and in the context of lacking information on the document structure such as the document model and the typographical parameters. However, previous work in the use of texture analysis for segmentation of digitized historical document images has been limited to separately test one of the well-known texture-based approaches such as autocorrelation function, Grey Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM), Gabor filters, gradient, wavelets, etc. In this paper we raise the question of which texture-based method could be better suited for discriminating on the one hand graphical regions from textual ones and on the other hand for separating textual regions with different sizes and fonts. The objective of this paper is to compare some of the well-known texture-based approaches: autocorrelation function, GLCM, and Gabor filters, used in a segmentation of digitized historical document images. Texture features are briefly described and quantitative results are obtained on simplified historical document images. The achieved results are very encouraging."

We propose a learning-free approach to detect the main text area in ancient manuscripts. First, we coarsely segment the main text area by using a texture-based filter. Then, we refine the segmentation by formulating the problem as an energy minimization task and achieving the minimum using graph cuts. The energy function is derived from properties of the text components. Spatial coherence of the segmented text regions is explicitly encouraged by the energy function. We evaluate the suggested method on a publicly available dataset of 38 historical document images. Experiments show that the suggested approach outperforms another state-of-the-art page segmentation method in terms of segmentation quality and time performance."

Nom is an ideographic script to represent Vietnamese, used from the 10th century to 20th century. Because of various complex layouts, we propose an efficient method based on connected component analysis for extraction of characters from images. The area Voronoi diagram is then employed to represent the neighborhood and boundary of connected components. Based on this representation, each character can be considered as a group of extracted adjacent Voronoi regions. To improve the performance of segmentation, we use the recursive x-y cut method to segment separated regions. We evaluate the performance of this method on several pages in different layouts. The results confirm that the method is effective for character segmentation in Nom documents."

The proposed system detects text lines, segments characters, and retrieves similar characters from document images. The process includes background separation, text line extraction, rule-based character integration and segmentation, and similar character retrieval. The experimental results show that the proposed method segmented all text lines correctly and successfully extracted more than 79% of the complicated characters, as well as provided promising character retrieval results."

Given an appropriate network architecture, gradient-based learning algorithms can be used to synthesize a complex decision surface that can classify high-dimensional patterns, such as handwritten characters, with minimal preprocessing. This paper reviews various methods applied to handwritten character recognition and compares them on a standard handwritten digit recognition task. Convolutional neural networks, which are specifically designed to deal with the variability of 2D shapes, are shown to outperform all other techniques. Real-life document recognition systems are composed of multiple modules including field extraction, segmentation recognition, and language modeling. A new learning paradigm, called graph transformer networks (GTN), allows such multimodule systems to be trained globally using gradient-based methods so as to minimize an overall performance measure. Two systems for online handwriting recognition are described. Experiments demonstrate the advantage of global training, and the flexibility of graph transformer networks. A graph transformer network for reading a bank cheque is also described. It uses convolutional neural network character recognizers combined with global training techniques to provide record accuracy on business and personal cheques. It is deployed commercially and reads several million cheques per day."

However, historical Chinese character segmentation remains a difficult problem due to the complex structure of Chinese characters and various writing styles. This paper presents a novel method for historical Chinese character segmentation based on graph model. After a preliminary over-segmentation stage, the system applies a merging process. The candidate segmentation positions are denoted by the nodes of a graph, and the merging process is regarded as selecting an optimal path of the graph. The weight of edge in the graph is calculated by the cost function which considers geometric features and recognition confidence. Experimental results show that the proposed method is effective with a detection rate of 94.6% and an accuracy rate of 96.1% on a test set of practical historical Chinese document samples."

The dataset is based on a generic model for ground-truth presentation of the complex layout structure of historical documents. For the purpose of extracting uniformly the document contents, our model defines five types of regions of interest: page, text block, text line, decoration, and comment. Unconstrained polygons are used to outline the regions. A performance metric is proposed in order to evaluate various page segmentation methods based on this model. We have analysed four state-of-the-art ground-truthing tools: TRUVIZ, GEDI, WebGT, and Aletheia. From this analysis, we conceptualized and developed Divadia, a new tool that overcomes some of the drawbacks of these tools, targeting the simplicity and the efficiency of the layout ground truthing process on historical document images. With Divadia, we have created a new public dataset. This dataset contains 120 pages from three historical document image collections of different styles and is made freely available to the scientific community for historical document layout analysis research."

Scaling such models to full-sized, high-dimensional images remains a difficult problem. To address this problem, we present the convolutional deep belief network, a hierarchical generative model which scales to realistic image sizes. This model is translation-invariant and supports efficient bottom-up and top-down probabilistic inference. Key to our approach is probabilistic max-pooling, a novel technique which shrinks the representations of higher layers in a probabilistically sound way. Our experiments show that the algorithm learns useful high-level visual features, such as object parts, from unlabeled images of objects and natural scenes. We demonstrate excellent performance on several visual recognition tasks and show that our model can perform hierarchical (bottom-up and top-down) inference over full-sized images."

The goal is to help users to easily apply SVM to their applications. LIBSVM has gained wide popularity in machine learning and many other areas. In this article, we present all implementation details of LIBSVM. Issues such as solving SVM optimization problems theoretical convergence multiclass classification probability estimates and parameter selection are discussed in detail."
