In this paper a set of seven metrics are proposed for quantifying different aspects of a detection algorithm's performance. The strengths and weaknesses of these metrics are described. They are implemented in the Video Performance Evaluation Resource (ViPER) system and will be used to evaluate algorithms for detecting text, faces, moving people and vehicles. Results for running two previous text-detection algorithms on a common data set are presented."

However, there is still a lack of performance evaluation protocols for video text detection. In this paper, we propose an objective and comprehensive performance evaluation protocol for video text detection algorithms. The protocol includes a positive set and a negative set of indices at the textbox level, which evaluate the detection quality in terms of both location accuracy and fragmentation of the detected textboxes. In the protocol, we assign a detection difficulty (DD) level to each ground truth textbox. The performance indices can then be normalized with respect to the textbox DD level and are therefore tolerant to different ground-truth difficulties to a certain degree. We also assign a detectability index (DI) value to each ground-truth textbox. The overall detection rate is the DI-weighted average of the detection qualities of all ground-truth textboxes, which makes the detection rate more accurate to reveal the real performance. The automatic performance evaluation scheme has been applied to performance evaluation of a text detection approach to determine the best thresholds that can yield the best detection results. The protocol has also been employed to compare the performances of several text detection systems. Hence, we believe that the proposed protocol can be used to compare the performance of different video/image text detection algorithms/systems and can even help improve, select, and design new text detection methods."

In the University of Washington English Document Image Database-III, there are 1600 English document images that come with manually edited ground truth of entity bounding boxes. These bounding boxes enclose text and non-text zones, text-lines, and words. We describe a performance metric for the comparison of the detected entities and the ground truth in terms of their bounding boxes. The Document Attribute Format Specification is used as the standard data representation. The protocol is intended to serve as a model for using the UW-III database to evaluate the document analysis algorithms. A set of layout analysis algorithms which detect different entities have been tested based on the data set and the performance metric. The evaluation results are presented in this paper."

In spite of the prevalence of vectorization and line detection methods, no standard for their performance evaluation protocol exists. We propose a protocol for evaluating both straight and circular line extraction to help compare, select, improve, and even design line detection algorithms to be incorporated into line drawing recognition and understanding systems. The protocol involves both positive and negative sets of indices, at pixel and vector levels. Time efficiency is also included in the protocol. The protocol may be extended to handle lines of any shape as well as other classes of graphic objects.\n"

Complex layouts are accurately described and layout analysis methods that handle them can be effectively evaluated. A further benefit of the new approach is that it measures the accuracy of the description of regions, an issue which is important for complex layouts involving non text regions."

With the rapid growth in research over the last few years on recognizing text in natural scenes, there is an urgent need to establish some common benchmark datasets and gain a clear understanding of the current state of the art. We use the term \u2018robust reading\u2019 to refer to text images that are beyond the capabilities of current commercial OCR packages. We chose to break down the robust reading problem into three subproblems and run competitions for each stage, and also a competition for the best overall system. The subproblems we chose were text locating, character recognition and word recognition. By breaking down the problem in this way, we hoped to gain a better understanding of the state of the art in each of the subproblems. Furthermore, our methodology involved storing detailed results of applying each algorithm to each image in the datasets, allowing researchers to study in depth the strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm. The text-locating contest was the only one to have any entries. We give a brief description of each entry and present the results of this contest, showing cases where the leading entries succeed and fail. We also describe an algorithm for combining the outputs of the individual text locators and show how the combination scheme improves on any of the individual systems."

With the rapid growth in research over thelast few years on recognizing text in natural scenes, thereis an urgent need to establish some common benchmarkdatasets, and gain a clear understanding of the current stateof the art. We use the term robust reading to refer to text imagesthat are beyond the capabilities of current commercialOCR packages. We chose to break down the robust readingproblem into three sub-problems, and run competitionsfor each stage, and also a competition for the best overallsystem. The sub-problems we chose were text locating,character recognition and word recognition.By breaking down the problem in this way, we hope togain a better understanding of the state of the art in eachof the sub-problems. Furthermore, our methodology involvesstoring detailed results of applying each algorithm toeach image in the data sets, allowing researchers to study indepth the strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm. Thetext locating contest was the only one to have any entries.We report the results of this contest, and show cases wherethe leading algorithms succeed and fail."

Nevertheless, commercial OCR have never been evaluated on such corpora. This article details a new methodology to evaluate a commercial OCR on a video document.

The edit operations investigated allow changing one symbol of a string into another single symbol, deleting one symbol from a string, or inserting a single symbol into a string. An algorithm is presented which solves this problem in time proportional to the product of the lengths of the two strings. Possible applications are to the problems of automatic spelling correction and determining the longest subsequence of characters common to two strings."
