Recent efforts to train extremely large networks (with over 1 billion parameters) have relied on cloudlike computing infrastructure and thousands of CPU cores. In this paper, we present technical details and results from our own system based on Commodity Off-The-Shelf High Performance Computing (COTS HPC) technology: a cluster of GPU servers with Infiniband interconnects and MPI. Our system is able to train 1 billion parameter networks on just 3 machines in a couple of days, and we show that it can scale to networks with over 11 billion parameters using just 16 machines. As this infrastructure is much more easily marshaled by others, the approach enables much wider-spread research with extremely large neural networks."

We choose an optimal algorithm with blocking in both shared memory and registers to satisfy the constraints of the Fermi memory hierarchy. Our optimization strategy is further guided by a performance modeling based on micro-architecture benchmarks. Our optimizations include software pipelining, use of vector memory operations, and instruction scheduling. Our best CUDA algorithm achieves comparable performance with the latest CUBLAS library1. We further improve upon this with an implementation in the native machine language, leading to 20% increase in performance. That is, the achieved peak performance (efficiency) is improved from 302Gflop/s (58%) to 362Gflop/s (70%)."

In order to leverage their ability to learn complex functions, large amounts of data are required for training. Training a large convolutional network to produce state-of-the-art results can take weeks, even when using modern GPUs. Producing labels using a trained network can also be costly when dealing with web-scale datasets. In this work, we present a simple algorithm which accelerates training and inference by a significant factor, and can yield improvements of over an order of magnitude compared to existing state-of-the-art implementations. This is done by computing convolutions as pointwise products in the Fourier domain while reusing the same transformed feature map many times. The algorithm is implemented on a GPU architecture and addresses a number of related challenges."

However, they can be difficult to implement and are usually slower than traditional multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs). We present three novel approaches to speeding up CNNs: a) unrolling convolution, b) using BLAS (basic linear algebra subroutines), and c) using GPUs (graphic processing units). Unrolled convolution converts the processing in each convolutional layer (both forward-propagation and back-propagation) into a matrix-matrix product. The matrix-matrix product representation of CNNs makes their implementation as easy as MLPs. BLAS is used to efficiently compute matrix products on the CPU. We also present a pixel shader based GPU implementation of CNNs. Results on character recognition problems indicate that unrolled convolution with BLAS produces a dramatic 2.4X\u22123.0X speedup. The GPU implementation is even faster and produces a 3.1X\u22124.1X speedup."

On the test data, we achieved top-1 and top-5 error rates of 37.5% and 17.0%, respectively, which is considerably better than the previous state-of-the-art. The neural network, which has 60 million parameters and 650,000 neurons, consists of five convolutional layers, some of which are followed by max-pooling layers, and three fully connected layers with a final 1000-way softmax. To make training faster, we used non-saturating neurons and a very efficient GPU implementation of the convolution operation. To reduce overfitting in the fully connected layers we employed a recently developed regularization method called \"dropout\" that proved to be very effective. We also entered a variant of this model in the ILSVRC-2012 competition and achieved a winning top-5 test error rate of 15.3%, compared to 26.2% achieved by the second-best entry."

The main hallmark of this architecture is the improved utilization of the computing resources inside the network. By a carefully crafted design, we increased the depth and width of the network while keeping the computational budget constant. To optimize quality, the architectural decisions were based on the Hebbian principle and the intuition of multi-scale processing. One particular incarnation used in our submission for ILSVRC14 is called GoogLeNet, a 22 layers deep network, the quality of which is assessed in the context of classification and detection."

Given an appropriate network architecture, gradient-based learning algorithms can be used to synthesize a complex decision surface that can classify high-dimensional patterns, such as handwritten characters, with minimal preprocessing. This paper reviews various methods applied to handwritten character recognition and compares them on a standard handwritten digit recognition task. Convolutional neural networks, which are specifically designed to deal with the variability of 2D shapes, are shown to outperform all other techniques. Real-life document recognition systems are composed of multiple modules including field extraction, segmentation recognition, and language modeling. A new learning paradigm, called graph transformer networks (GTN), allows such multimodule systems to be trained globally using gradient-based methods so as to minimize an overall performance measure. Two systems for online handwriting recognition are described. Experiments demonstrate the advantage of global training, and the flexibility of graph transformer networks. A graph transformer network for reading a bank cheque is also described. It uses convolutional neural network character recognizers combined with global training techniques to provide record accuracy on business and personal cheques. It is deployed commercially and reads several million cheques per day."

Although domain knowledge can be used to help design representations, learning can also be used, and the quest for AI is motivating the design of more powerful representation-learning algorithms. This paper reviews recent work in the area of unsupervised feature learning and deep learning, covering advances in probabilistic models, manifold learning, and deep learning. This motivates longer-term unanswered questions about the appropriate objectives for learning good representations, for computing representations (i.e., inference), and the geometrical connections between representation learning, density estimation and manifold learning."

This integrated framework is the winner of the localization task of the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge 2013 (ILSVRC2013) and obtained very competitive results for the detection and classifications tasks.

                "text": "From the Book: \nCaveat Emptor: The cost of software maintenance increases with the square of the programmer's creativity. \nFirst Law of Programmer Creativity, \nRobert D. Bliss, 1992 \n \nThis is a collection of small programming tricks which the author has comeacross over many years. Most of them will work only on computers that representintegers in two's-complement form. Although a 32-bit machine is assumedwhen the register length is relevant, most of the tricks are easily adapted tomachines with other register sizes. \n \nThis book does not deal with \"large\" tricks such as sophisticated sorting andcompiler optimization techniques. Rather, it deals with \"small\" tricks that usuallyinvolve individual computer words or instructions, such as counting thenumber of 1-bits in a word. Such tricks often use a mixture of arithmetic and logicalinstructions. \n \nIt is assumed throughout that integer overflow interrupts have been maskedoff, so they cannot occur. C, Fortran, and even Java programs run in thisenvironment, but Pascal and ADA users beware! \n \nThe presentation is informal. Proofs are given only when the algorithm is definitelynot obvious, and sometimes not even then. The methods use computer-arithmetic, \"floor\" functions, mixtures of arithmetic and logical operations, etc.Proofs in this domain are often difficult and awkward to express.To reduce typographical errors and oversights, many of the algorithms havebeen executed. That is why they are given in a real programming language eventhough it, like every computer language, has some ugly features. For the highlevel language C is used, because it is widely known, it allows the straightforwardmixture of integer and bit-stringoperations, and C compilers are availablethat produce high quality object code. \n \nOccasionally machine language is used. It employs a 3-address format, mainlyfor ease of readability. The assembly language used is that of a fictitiousmachine that is representative of today's RISC computers. \n \nBranch-free code is favored. This is because on many computers branchesslow down instruction fetching and inhibit executing instructions in parallel.Another problem with branches is that they may inhibit compiler optimizationssuch as instruction scheduling, commoning, and register allocation. That is, thecompiler may be more effective at these optimizations with a program that consistsof a few large basic blocks, rather than many small ones. \n \nThe code sequences also tend to favor small immediate values, comparisons tozero (rather than to some other number), and instruction-level parallelism.Although much of the code would become more concise by using table lookups(from memory), this is not often mentioned. This is because loads are becomingmore expensive relative to arithmetic instructions, and the table lookup methodsare often not very interesting (although they are often practical). But there areexceptional cases. \n \nFinally, I should mention that the term \"hacker\" in the title is meant in the originalsense of an aficionado of computers\u0097someone who enjoys making computersdo new things, or do old things in a new and clever way. The hacker isusually quite good at his craft, but may very well not be a professional computerprogrammer or designer. The hacker's work may be useful or may be just agame. As an example of the latter, more than one determined hacker has writtena program which, when executed, writes out an exact copy of itself. 1 This is thesense in which we use \"hacker.\" If you're looking for tips on how to break intoother's computers, you won't find them here. \nH.

We describe a pre-trained deep neural network hidden Markov model (DNN-HMM) hybrid architecture that trains the DNN to produce a distribution over senones (tied triphone states) as its output. The deep belief network pre-training algorithm is a robust and often helpful way to initialize deep neural networks generatively that can aid in optimization and reduce generalization error. We illustrate the key components of our model, describe the procedure for applying CD-DNN-HMMs to LVSR, and analyze the effects of various modeling choices on performance. Experiments on a challenging business search dataset demonstrate that CD-DNN-HMMs can significantly outperform the conventional context-dependent Gaussian mixture model (GMM)-HMMs, with an absolute sentence accuracy improvement of 5.8% and 9.2% (or relative error reduction of 16.0% and 23.2%) over the CD-GMM-HMMs trained using the minimum phone error rate (MPE) and maximum-likelihood (ML) criteria, respectively."

Deep neural network acoustic models are now commonplace in HMM-based speech recognition systems, but building such systems is a complex, domain-specific task. Recent work demonstrated the feasibility of discarding the HMM sequence modeling framework by directly predicting transcript text from audio. This paper extends this approach in two ways. First, we demonstrate that a straightforward recurrent neural network architecture can achieve a high level of accuracy. Second, we propose and evaluate a modified prefix-search decoding algorith m. This approach to decoding enables first-pass speech recognition with a langu age model, completely unaided by the cumbersome infrastructure of HMM-based systems. Experiments on the Wall Street Journal corpus demonstrate fairly competitive word error rates, and the importance of bi-directional network recurrence."

This paper describes the creation of this benchmark dataset and the advances in object recognition that have been possible as a result. We discuss the challenges of collecting large-scale ground truth annotation, highlight key breakthroughs in categorical object recognition, provide a detailed analysis of the current state of the field of large-scale image classification and object detection, and compare the state-of-the-art computer vision accuracy with human accuracy. We conclude with lessons learned in the 5\u00a0years of the challenge, and propose future directions and improvements."

An alternative way to evaluate the fit is to use a feed-forward neural network that takes several frames of coefficients as input and produces posterior probabilities over HMM states as output. Deep neural networks (DNNs) that have many hidden layers and are trained using new methods have been shown to outperform GMMs on a variety of speech recognition benchmarks, sometimes by a large margin. This article provides an overview of this progress and represents the shared views of four research groups that have had recent successes in using DNNs for acoustic modeling in speech recognition."
