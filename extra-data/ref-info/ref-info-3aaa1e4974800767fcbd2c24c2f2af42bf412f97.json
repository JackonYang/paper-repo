This paper present two techniques to improve performance of standard NNLMs. First, the form of NNLM is modelled by introduction an additional output layer node to model the probability mass of out-of-shortlist (OOS) words. An associated probability normalisation scheme is explicitly derived. Second, a novel NNLM adaptation method using a cascaded network is proposed. Consistent WER reductions were obtained on a state-of-the-art Arabic LVCSR task over conventional NNLMs. Further performance gains were also observed after NNLM adaptation."

Results indicate that it is possible to obtain around 50% reduction of perplexity by using mixture of several RNN LMs, compared to a state of the art backoff language model. Speech recognition experiments show around 18% reduction of word error rate on the Wall Street Journal task when comparing models trained on the same amount of data, and around 5% on the much harder NIST RT05 task, even when the backoff model is trained on much more data than the RNN LM. We provide ample empirical evidence to suggest that connectionist language models are superior to standard n-gram techniques, except their high computational (training) complexity.

However, training such models for large vocabulary tasks is computationally challenging which does not scale easily to the huge corpora that are nowadays available. In this work, we study the performance and behavior of two neural statistical language models so as to highlight some important caveats of the classical training algorithms. The induced word embeddings for extreme cases are also analysed, thus providing insight into the convergence issues. A new initialization scheme and new training techniques are then introduced. These methods are shown to greatly reduce the training time and to significantly improve performance, both in terms of perplexity and on a large-scale translation task."

Almost all state.. o. f-the-art systems use statistical n-gram language models estimated on text corpora. One principle problem with such language models is the fact that many of the n-grams are never observed even in very large training corpora, and therefore it is common to back-off to a lower-order model. In this paper we propose to address this problem by carrying out the estimation task in a continuous space, enabling a smooth interpolation of the probabilities. A neural network is used to learn the projection of the words onto a continuous space and to estimate the n-gram probabilities. The connectionist language model is being evaluated on the DARPA HUB5 conversational telephone speech recognition task and preliminary results show consistent improvements in both perplexity and word error rate."

The main drawback of NPLMs is their extremely long training and testing times. Morin and Bengio have proposed a hierarchical language model built around a binary tree of words, which was two orders of magnitude faster than the non-hierarchical model it was based on. However, it performed considerably worse than its non-hierarchical counterpart in spite of using a word tree created using expert knowledge. We introduce a fast hierarchical language model along with a simple feature-based algorithm for automatic construction of word trees from the data. We then show that the resulting models can outperform non-hierarchical neural models as well as the best n-gram models."

Previous experiments with random forests were mainly concerned with small or medium size data tasks. In this work the development version of the 2009 LIMSI Mandarin Chinese STT system was chosen as a challenging baseline to improve upon. This system is characterized by a language model trained on a very large text corpus (over 3.2 billion segmented words) making the baseline 4-gram estimates particularly robust. We observed moderate perplexity and CER improvements when this model is interpolated with a random forest language model. In order to attain the goal we tried different strategies to build random forests on the available data and introduced a Forest of Random Forests language modeling scheme. However, the improvements we get for large data over a well-tuned baseline N-gram model are less impressive than those reported for smaller data tasks."

However, the question of whether it is better to use a word-based or a character-based model warrants being for the Mandarin Chinese language. Since Chinese is written without any spaces or word delimiters, a word segmentation algorithm is applied in a pre-processing step prior to training a wordbased language model. Chinese characters carry meaning and speakers are free to combine characters to construct new words. This suggests that character information can also be useful in communication. This paper explores both word-based and character-based models, and their complementarity. Although word-based modeling is found to outperform character-based modeling, increasing the vocabulary size from 56k to 160k words did not lead to a gain in performance. Results are reported for the Gale Mandarin speech-to-text task. Index Terms: Speech recognition, language modeling, Mandarin Chinese, speech-to-text transcription"

This is intrinsically difficult because of the curse of dimensionality: a word sequence on which the model will be tested is likely to be different from all the word sequences seen during training. Traditional but very successful approaches based on n-grams obtain generalization by concatenating very short overlapping sequences seen in the training set. We propose to fight the curse of dimensionality by learning a distributed representation for words which allows each training sentence to inform the model about an exponential number of semantically neighboring sentences. The model learns simultaneously (1) a distributed representation for each word along with (2) the probability function for word sequences, expressed in terms of these representations. Generalization is obtained because a sequence of words that has never been seen before gets high probability if it is made of words that are similar (in the sense of having a nearby representation) to words forming an already seen sentence. Training such large models (with millions of parameters) within a reasonable time is itself a significant challenge. We report on experiments using neural networks for the probability function, showing on two text corpora that the proposed approach significantly improves on state-of-the-art n-gram models, and that the proposed approach allows to take advantage of longer contexts."

Both of these methods are motivated by the observation that shrinking the sum of parameter magnitudes in an exponential language model tends to improve performance [2]. In this paper, we investigate whether these shrinkage-based techniques also perform well on larger training sets and on other domains. First, we explain why good performance on large data sets is uncertain, by showing that gains relative to a baseline n-gram model tend to decrease as training set size increases. Next, we evaluate several methods for data/model combination with Model M and rMDI models on limited-scale domains, to uncover which techniques should work best on large domains. Finally, we apply these methods on a variety of medium-to-large-scale domains covering several languages, and show that Model M consistently provides significant gains over existing language models for state-of-the-art systems in both speech recognition and machine translation."

We examine a variety of syntactic features, including part-of-speech tags, shallow parse tags, and exposed head words and their non-terminal labels both before and after the word to be predicted. Neural network LMs are used to model these features since they generalize better to unseen events by modeling words and other context features in continuous space. Using morphological and syntactic features, we can improve the word error rate (WER) significantly on various test sets, including EVAL'08U, the unsequestered portion of the DARPA GALE Phase 3 evaluation test set."
