A paragraph is coherent when the information in successive sentences follows some pattern of inference or of knowledge with which the hearer is familiar. To signal such inferences, speakers usually use relations that link successive sentences in fixed ways. A set of 20 relations that span most of what people usually say in English is proposed in the Rhetorical Structure Theory of Mann and Thompson. This paper describes the formalization of these relations and their use in a prototype text planner that structures input elements into coherent paragraphs."

In Section 2, we will present the underlying application and give examples of the output of the System. In Section 3, we will discuss the overall s tructure of Joyce. We then discuss the three main components in turn: the text planner in Section 4, the sentence planner in Section 5 and the realizer in Section 6. We will discuss the text planner in some detail since it represents a new approach to the problem. Section 7 traces the generation of a short text. In Section 8, we address the problem of portability, and wind up by discussing some shortcomings of Joyce in the conclusion."

                "text": "This thesis presents new surface generation techniques that improve on both aspects of surface generation: (1) lexical choice, which consists of choosing words and their associated syntactic structures and (2) syntactic realization, which consists of combining these partial structures into grammatical sentences. The thesis investigates the impact of the pragmatic situation on surface generation. Because surface generation depends directly on many aspects of the situation, these new techniques allow a purely conceptual input to be expressed by a greater variety of linguistic forms and with more sensitivity to pragmatic factors than was previously possible. \nSpecifically, this research focuses on the impact on lexical choice of one part of the pragmatic situation: the speaker's argumentative intent, i.e., the goal of the speaker to convince the hearer of a certain conclusion. The argumentative intent can be realized by a variety of evaluative expressions appearing at various ranks in the syntactic structure. This thesis describes the selection of four classes of evaluative expressions: judgment determiners (i.e., many), scalar adjectives (i.e., difficult), connotative verbs (i.e., require, enjoy) and argumentative connectives (i.e., but, so). These four classes were not addressed in previous generators. \nThe scFUF formalism is introduced in this thesis to address the issue of complex constraint interaction arising when performing lexical choice under pragmatic constraints. scFUF is derived from Functional Unification Grammars (scFUGs), a formalism previously used for syntactic realization only. scFUF extends scFUGs by providing new mechanisms for control, for expressing hierarchical relations and for using modular knowledge sources. These extensions make scFUF capable of handling lexical choice. In addition, this thesis describes the use of scFUF to develop scSURGE, one of the largest and most widely used syntactic realization grammar available. \nFinally these new generation techniques are applied to the implementation of scADVISOR II, a question-answering system helping students to choose classes for a semester. In particular, scADVISOR II uses the increased expressive flexibility provided by these techniques to convince a student to choose different classes by presenting the same objective data, retrieved from an underlying knowledge base, in different linguistic forms using evaluative expressions."

Financial institutions, mail-order companies, legal firms\u2014any corporation that maintains a Customer Service Department\u2014must generate written correspondence that clearly communicates specific, individualized information to clients. Indeed, in a slumping economy, much has been made of the need to differentiate one's business from the competition by providing higher-quality customer service (Agins et al. 1990). However, the industry continues to express this commitment through a combination of awkward form letters and expensive original letters composed by hand. This chapter describes an application of Cognitive Systems' Intelligent Correspondence Generator (ICG), which has increased the quality, reduced the complexity, and drastically cut the turnaround time associated with the production of personalized letters at its installation site. Users with little or no training in business correspondence can invoke the system to automatically compose complete, high-quality letters specifically tailored to the addressee's situation."
