                "text": "New techniques and features have been developed for machine recognition of cursive script. Some experimental results have been obtained and are described in this thesis. \nCursive script is input to a computer using a Rand type graphics tablet. The cursive script pattern is stored as a chronological sequence of X and Y coordinates. New preprocessing techniques eliminate input noise and employ feature extraction utilizing special features to perform \"prerecognition,\" a phase in which certain characteristics are recognized before the actual recognition phase is entered in order to aid in script orientation and normalization. Preprocessing operations performed include rotation, vertical and horizontal scaling and deskewing along with some gap filling and spot noise elimination. These operations are performed in a \"closed-loop\" manner in which verification is performed after each operation. The process may be repeated until satisfactory results are obtained. \nNext, feature extraction in performed and recognition is achieved by the application of a modified k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) rule. Cursive script words are \"pre-selected\" as most likely class candidates by a \"distance to class mean\" measure. The k-NN algorithm is applied only to the pre-selected classes. Class locations are established by supervised machine learning, in which identified cursive script samples are presented to the machine for feature extraction analysis. The resulting parameters are stored in a \"dictionary\" for future reference. \nFor testing purposes a special set of computer selected words is used. These words are chosen from the set of all possible two letter words for difficulty of discrimination (by the recognition algorithms). For selection purposes words are generated by computer linking of handwritten letters using a cubic spline algorithm. Of the 676 possible two letter classes, the twenty that are most densely packed in the feature space (and, hence, most difficult to discriminate between) are obtained by a computer search. These words are then linked to form a dense feature space distribution of 400 four letter classes which is again searched. The twenty most difficult to recognize four letter words thus obtained are used as the initial testing set. Results on 200 samples of the author's handwriting indicate that greater than 90% recognition accuracy is achievable using this \"worst case\" set of words. Better performance can be expected for virtually all other sets of words. \nImprovements in recognition accuracy over previously reported results have been obtained by several techniques. These include an improved feature set containing local character level information, a weighted metric for classification, the development of more sophisticated preprocessing techniques, and the use of unsupervised learning, which allows the machine to use unknown script input samples to update its \"dictionary\" as the style of the handwriting varies with time or with various script authors. \nFrom individual handwriting styles it is possible to recognize the script author and utilize this information to more accurately recognize handwriting by providing individual \"dictionaries\" for each author. Substantial recognition accuracy improvements are expected when the machine is expanded to read at the sentence level, thus allowing contextual information to be used."

Here, this technique is applied to the problem of recognizing cursive script. The parameters used in the matching are derived from time sequences of x-y coordinate data of words handwritten on an electronic tablet. Chosen for their properties of invariance with respect to size and translation of the writing, these parameters are found particularly suitable for the elastic matching technique. A salient feature of the recognition system is the establishment, in a training procedure, of prototypes by each writer using the system. In this manner, the system is tailored to the user. Processing is performed on a word-by-word basis after the writing is separated into words. Using prototypes for each letter, the matching procedure allows any letter to follow any letter and finds the letter sequence which best fits the unknown word. A major advantage of this procedure is that it combines letter segmentation and recognition in one operation by, in essence, evaluating recognition at all possible segmentations, thus avoiding the usual segmentation-then-recognition philosophy. Results on cursive writing are presented where the alphabet is restricted to the lower-case letters. Letter recognition accuracy is over 95 percent for each of three writers."

For example, most optical character recognition [OCR] machines are limited to a few fonts of machine print, or text that is handprinted under certain constraints; any deviation from these constraints will produce highly garbled text. This paper describes an algorithm for text recognition/correction that effectively merges a bottom-up refinement process that is based on the utilization of transitional probabilities and letter confusion probabilities, known as the Viterbi algorithm [VA], together with a top-down process based on searching a trie structure representation of a lexicon. The algorithm is applicable to text containing an arbitrary number of character substitution errors such as that produced by OCR machines."

The present paper describes a recognition scheme which is independent of the dynamics of writing and is suitable both for on-line and off-line systems. New recognition criteria, namely, the distribution of intensity of marking along and perpendicular to the direction of writing are used. Methods for correcting the inclination of script, determination of zonal limits and segmentation of the continuous script into a set of curve elements have been developed. The method of correlation is used for classification of the curve-elements. A simple grammer for the reconstruction of letters from classified segments is presented. A significant recognition has been found."
