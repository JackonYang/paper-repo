                "text": "!, Model-based vision is firmly established as a robust approach to recognizing and locating known rigid objects in the presence of noise, clutter, and occlusion. It is more problematic to apply modelbased methods to images of objects whose appearance can vary, though a number of approaches based on the use of flexible templates have been proposed. The problem with existing methods is that they sacrifice model specificity in order to accommodate variability, thereby compromising robustness during image interpretation. We argue that a model should only be able to deform in ways characteristic of the class of objects it represents. We describe a method for building models by learning patterns of variability from a training set of correctly annotated images. These models can be used for image search in an iterative refinement algorithm analogous to that employed by Active Contour Models (Snakes). The key difference is that our Active Shape Models can only deform to fit the data in ways consistent with the training set. We show several practical examples where we have built such models and used them to locate partially occluded objects in noisy, cluttered images. Q 199s A&& prrss, IN."

A vocabulary of information-rich object parts is automatically constructed from a set of sample images of the object class of interest. Images are then represented using parts from this vocabulary, along with spatial relations observed among them. Based on this representation, a feature-efficient learning algorithm is used to learn to detect instances of the object class. The framework developed can be applied to any object with distinguishable parts in a relatively fixed spatial configuration. We report experiments on images of side views of cars. Our experiments show that the method achieves high detection accuracy on a difficult test set of real-world images, and is highly robust to partial occlusion and background variation.In addition, we discuss and offer solutions to several methodological issues that are significant for the research community to be able to evaluate object detection approaches."

A further complication is that coarse measurements, applied to the image for detecting these properties, often average over properties of neighboring segments, making it difficult to separate the segments and to reliably detect their boundaries. Below we present a method for segmentation that generates and combines multiscale measurements of intensity contrast, texture differences, and boundary integrity. The method is based on our former algorithm SWA, which efficiently detects segments that optimize a normalized-cut like measure by recursively coarsening a graph reflecting similarities between intensities of neighboring pixels. In this process aggregates of pixels of increasing size are gradually collected to form segments. We intervene in this process by computing properties of the aggregates and modifying the graph to reflect these coarse scale measurements. This allows us to detect regions that differ by fine as well as coarse properties, and to accurately locate their boundaries. Furthermore, by combining intensity differences with measures of boundary integrity across neighboring aggregates we can detect regions separated by weak, yet consistent edges."

                "text": "The task of visual classification is thce recognition of an object in the image as belonging to a general class of similar objects, such as a face, a car, a dog, and the like. This is a fundamental and natural task for biological visual systems, but it has proven difficult to perform visual classification by artificial computer vision systems. The main reason for this difficulty is the variability of shape within a class: different objects vary widely in appearance, and it is difficult to capture the essential shape features that characterize the members of one category and distinguish them from another, such as dogs from cats. \n \nIn this paper we describe an approach to classification using a fragment-based representation. In this approach, objects within a class are represented in terms of common image fragments that are used as building blocks for representing a large variety of different objects that belong to a common class. The fragments are selected from a training set of images based on a criterion of maximizing the mutual information of the fragments and the class they represent. For the purpose of classification the fragments are also organized into types, where each type is a collection of alternative fragments, such as different hairline or eye regions for face classification. During classification, the algorithm detects fragments of the different types, and then combines the evidence for the detected fragments to reach a final decision. Experiments indicate that it is possible to trade off the complexity of fragments with the complexity of the combination and decision stage, and this tradeoff is discussed. \n \nThe method is different from previous part-based methods in using class-specific object fragments of varying complexity, the method of selecting fragments, and the organization into fragment types. Experimental results of detecting face and car views show that the fragment-based approach can generalize well to a variety of novel image views within a class while maintaining low mis-classification error rates. We briefly discuss relationships between the proposed method and properties of parts of the primate visual system involved in object perception"

Objects are modeled as flexible constellations of parts. A probabilistic representation is used for all aspects of the object: shape, appearance, occlusion and relative scale. An entropy-based feature detector is used to select regions and their scale within the image. In learning the parameters of the scale-invariant object model are estimated. This is done using expectation-maximization in a maximum-likelihood setting. In recognition, this model is used in a Bayesian manner to classify images. The flexible nature of the model is demonstrated by excellent results over a range of datasets including geometrically constrained classes (e.g. faces, cars) and flexible objects (such as animals)."

We focus on a particular type of model where objects are represented as flexible constellations of rigid parts (features). The variability within a class is represented by a joint probability density function (pdf) on the shape of the constellation and the output of part detectors. In a first stage, the method automatically identifies distinctive parts in the training set by applying a clustering algorithm to patterns selected by an interest operator. It then learns the statistical shape model using expectation maximization. The method achieves very good classification results on human faces and rear views of cars."

Numerous applications in computer vision can be naturally interpreted as instanciations of this fundamental problem. Recently, a non-iterative discrete approach, tensor voting, has been introduced to solve this problem and has been applied successfully to various applications. As an alternative, we propose a variational formulation of this problem in the continuous setting and derive an iterative algorithm which approximates its solutions. This method and tensor voting are somewhat the differential and integral form of one another. Although iterative methods are slower in general, the strength of the suggested method is that it can easily be applied when the ambient space is not Euclidean, which is important in many applications. The algorithm consists in solving a partial differential equation that performs a special anisotropic diffusion on an implicit representation of the known set of points. This results in connecting isolated neighbouring points. This approach is very simple, mathematically sound, robust and powerful since it handles in a homogeneous way manifolds of arbitrary dimension and topology, embedded in Euclidean or non-Euclidean spaces, with or without border. We shall present this approach and demonstrate both its benefits and shortcomings in two different contexts: (i) data visual analysis, (ii) skin detection in color images."

We have proposed that some shape recognition processes can operate in parallel with processes assessing other variables relevant to figure-ground organization. The influence of these shape recognition processes should be observed only when shape edges can be detected early enough in visual processing so that the critical shape recognition operations can be finished before figure-ground computations are completed. In three experiments, we tested this prediction using stereograms portraying two regions equal in area, but unequal in denotivity (roughly, meaningfulness): One region was high in denotivity, the other region was low in denotivity. Binocular disparity specified that either the high denotative region or the low denotative region was in front (i.e., was figure). For some stereograms (random dot stereograms), no edge was visible between the two regions until after stereo fusion; for other stereograms (black-and-white stereograms), a luminance edge was visible before fusion. In black-and-white stereograms, but not in random-dot stereograms, high denotative regions could appear to be in front (i.e., to be figure) and the shapes they depicted could be recognized, even when this organization was inconsistent with the disparity. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that shape recognition processes can contribute to figure-ground computations, at least when the figure-ground border is a luminance contrast edge. Implications for shape recognition and perceptual organization are discussed."

Such methods suffer from a number of restrictions such as the limitation to linear manifolds or the absence of a probablistic representation. In this paper we exploit recent developments in the fields of variational inference and latent variable models to develop a novel and tractable probabilistic approach to modelling manifolds which can handle complex non-linearities. Our framework comprises a mixture of sub-space components in which both the number of components and the effective dimensionality of the subspaces are determined automatically as part of the Bayesian inference procedure. We illustrate our approach using two classical problems: modelling the manifold of face images and modelling the manifolds of hand-written digits."

Snakes provide a unified account of a number of visual problems, including detection of edges, lines, and subjective contours; motion tracking; and stereo matching.
