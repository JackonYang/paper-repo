The relaxation process rests on a notion of which word in one text corresponds to which word in the other text that is essentially based on the similarity of their distributions. It exploits a partial alignment of the word level to induce a maximum likelihood alignment of the sentence level, which is in turn used, in the next iteration, to refine the word level estimate. The algorithm appears to converge to the correct sentence alignment in only a few iterations."

We define a concept of word-by-word alignment between such pairs of sentences. For any given pair of such sentences each of our models assigns a probability to each of the possible word-by-word alignments. We give an algorithm for seeking the most probable of these alignments. Although the algorithm is suboptimal, the alignment thus obtained accounts well for the word-by-word relationships in the pair of sentences. We have a great deal of data in French and English from the proceedings of the Canadian Parliament. Accordingly, we have restricted our work to these two languages; but we feel that because our algorithms have minimal linguistic content they would work well on other pairs of languages. We also feel, again because of the minimal linguistic content of our algorithms, that it is reasonable to argue that word-by-word alignments are inherent in any sufficiently large bilingual corpus."

The program takes the output of char_align (Church, 1993), a robust alternative to sentence-based alignment programs, and applies word-level constraints using a version of Brown et al.\u2019s Model 2 (Brown et al., 1993), modified and extended to deal with robustness issues. Word_align was tested on a subset of Canadian Hansards supplied by Simard (Simard et al., 1992). The combination of word_align plus char_align reduces the variance (average square error) by a factor of 5 over char_align alone. More importantly, because word_align and char_align were designed to work robustly on texts that are smaller and more noisy than the Hansards, it has been possible to successfully deploy the programs at AT&T Language Line Services, a commercial translation service, to help them with difficult terminology."

Watson Research Center. The sources of these procedures will be referenced where practicable, but the working style of the Group has been deliberately cooperative (as the Acknowledgment Section indicates), so a certain amount of inadequate or udust crediting is inevitable. The author tried his best to keep it at a minimum. The exposition, appearing as it does in an IEEE publication, is aimed mostly at engineers who are less familiar with speech and language than with information transmission, statistics, or signal processing. At the same time, the author would like to enable speech specialists to read the more mathematical parts of the paper. Inevitably, a compromise between these two audiences has been attempted that resulted in a somewhat lengthened presentation. The author would like to invite his readers to skip rather boldly over material familiar to them. The fust six sections contain the essence of the formulation that is centered on the design of an actual speech recognition system. Readers of Section VI that contains experimental results may feel somewhat dissatisfied with the fact that no comparisons are attempted with performance achieved by alternate design philosophies. Unfortunately, such judgments are made difficult by the great variety in utterance corpora to be recognized, in experimental conditions, and in recognizer function goals.\u2019 However, the accompanying survey paper by Reddy [231 does assess the merits of the various speech recognition projects, and can serve as an excellent introduction to the field for the nonspecialist. In the speech recognition community, our project is somewhat controversial, since it attempts to model utterance production statistically, rather than through a grammar that would describe syntactically and semantically the allowable (mini-) universe of discourse. It is much too early to tell which emphasis is sounder. There is little doubt that before automatic recognition of speech is accomplished, the statistical"
