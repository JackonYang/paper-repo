We evaluate our results against paraphrase judgments elicited experimentally from humans and show that the model's ranking of meanings correlates reliably with human intuitions: meanings that are found highly probable by the model are also rated as plausible by the subjects."

We present a new algorithm to compute lexical chains in a text, merging several robust knowledge sources: the WordNet thesaurus, a part-of-speech tagger, shallow parser for the identification of nominal groups, and a segmentation algorithm. Summarization proceeds in four steps: the original text is segmented, lexical chains are constructed, strong chains are identified and significant sentences are extracted. We present in this paper empirical results on the identification of strong chains and of significant sentences. Preliminary results indicate that quality indicative summaries are produced. Pending problems are identified. Plans to address these short-comings are briefly presented."

However, this specific task raises a number of difficult issues that are quite distinct from the generic task of language generation: conciseness, complex sentences, floating concepts, historical background, paraphrasing power and implicit content. \nIn this thesis, I address these specific issues by proposing a new generation model in which a first pass builds a draft containing only the essential new facts to report and a second pass incrementally revises this draft to opportunistically add as many background facts as can fit within the space limit. This model requires a new type of linguistic knowledge: revision operations, which specifies the various ways a draft can be transformed in order to concisely accommodate a new piece of information. I present an in-depth corpus analysis of human-written sports summaries that resulted in an extensive set of such revision operations. I also present the implementation, based on functional unification grammars, of the system scSTREAK, which relies on these operations to incrementally generate complex sentences summarizing basketball games. This thesis also contains two quantitative evaluations. The first shows that the new revision-based generation model is far more robust than the one-pass model of previous generators. The second evaluation demonstrates that the revision operations acquired during the corpus analysis and implemented in scSTREAK are, for the most part, portable to at least one other quantitative domain (the stock market). \nscSTREAK is the first report generator that systematically places the facts which it summarizes in their historical perspective. It is more concise than previous systems thanks to its ability to generate more complex sentences and to opportunistically convey facts by adding a few words to carefully chosen draft constituents. The revision operations on which scSTREAK is based constitute the first set of corpus-based linguistic knowledge geared towards incremental generation. The evaluation presented in this thesis is also the first attempt to quantitatively assess the robustness of a new generation model and the portability of a new type of linguistic knowledge."

                "text": "Researchers in both machine translation (e.g., Brown et al. 1990) and bilingual lexicography (e.g., Klavans and Tzoukermann 1990) have recently become interested in studying bilingual corpora, bodies of text such as the Canadian Hansards (parliamentary proceedings), which are available in multiple languages (such as French and English). One useful step is to align the sentences, that is, to identify correspondences between sentences in one language and sentences in the other language.This paper will describe a method and a program (align) for aligning sentences based on a simple statistical model of character lengths. The program uses the fact that longer sentences in one language tend to be translated into longer sentences in the other language, and that shorter sentences tend to be translated into shorter sentences. A probabilistic score is assigned to each proposed correspondence of sentences, based on the scaled difference of lengths of the two sentences (in characters) and the variance of this difference. This probabilistic score is used in a dynamic programming framework to find the maximum likelihood alignment of sentences.It is remarkable that such a simple approach works as well as it does. An evaluation was performed based on a trilingual corpus of economic reports issued by the Union Bank of Switzerland (UBS) in English, French, and German. The method correctly aligned all but 4% of the sentences. Moreover, it is possible to extract a large subcorpus that has a much smaller error rate. By selecting the best-scoring 80% of the alignments, the error rate is reduced from 4% to 0.7%. There were more errors on the English-French subcorpus than on the English-German subcorpus, showing that error rates will depend on the corpus considered; however, both were small enough to hope that the method will be useful for many language pairs.To further research on bilingual corpora, a much larger sample of Canadian Hansards (approximately 90 million words, half in English and and half in French) has been aligned with the align program and will be available through the Data Collection Initiative of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL/DCI). In addition, in order to facilitate replication of the align program, an appendix is provided with detailed c-code of the more difficult core of the align program."

                "text": "Paraphrase, as a general concept, is a very mutable thing; at one extreme, paraphrase is the relation between units of text with identical meanings, as under the transformationalgenerative view, and at the other extreme there is the view that no text is interchangeable with any other. Each point in the spectrum ranging between these two views is a valid one, and in order to focus on a speci c point it is necessary to examine paraphrase under a particular context and application. In this thesis, the context is the task of Reluctant Paraphrase (RP). Given an ideal starting text, which expresses exactly what its author intends, it is often necessary to alter the text in some way in order to t it to some externally imposed constraints|length, readability as speci ed by a house style guide, and so on. In this context, paraphrase is a relation between interchangeable units of text; the task is then to choose the best set of such paraphrases that will t the whole text to the constraints, with `best' in this case being the set that changes the text the least. This di ers from other tasks where paraphrase is central: in natural language generation, particularly revision-based generation, where positively correlated constraints have meant there is no need for advanced search strategies to nd the best solution, and where the starting point is a knowledge representation rather than text, with the system consequently being omniscient regarding equivalence of concept realisations into text; and in style checkers and controlled language checkers, where the goal is to correct text, and consequently where the locality of alterations again means that advanced strategies for nding the best solution are unnecessary. The thesis uses the application of paraphrase as a means of exploring properties of the Tree Adjoining Grammar (TAG) formalism. TAG is a mathematical formalism, within which linguistic theories can be expressed, that is constrained in expressive power, which means that formal results about the language can be established, and that a linguistic theory has less work to do in circumscribing the class of acceptable constructions, since the formalism imposes universal constraints. And, as one of a class of mildly context sensitive grammars, it is well suited to describing natural language. Moreover, it is possible to map between TAG grammars using the Synchronous TAG (S-TAG) formalism, which has been used in applications such as machine translation, syntax{semantics mapping and modelling of coordination. However, in these applications the S-TAG formalism is not able to model all the phenomena that occur. Paraphrase is another, di erent application that allows exploration of the formalism from a di erent perspective, one which is particularly structurally complex. This application and the context of RP are closely interrelated. In performing the RP task, a representation of paraphrase is necessary, for which S-TAG provides a formalism. And, in using paraphrase to explore TAG, the RP context provides a focus narrowing down the paraphrases and consequently the requirements of the representation formalism. The thesis then looks at the two related modelling tasks. Firstly, the modelling of the RP task. Integer Programming is shown to be an appropriate framework, allowing a text tting the constraints to be determined, one minimally altered by paraphrasing. A range of model variants is possible, and the thesis investigates which is the best model in terms of search criteria. Secondly, the modelling of paraphrase in S-TAG. The relative structural complexity gives insights into the cause of representational di culties with S-TAG, and leads to generalisations of S-TAG that resolve existing problems in the formalism."

We present a multilevel bootstrapping algorithm that generates both the semantic lexicon and extraction patterns simultaneously. As input, our technique requires only unannotated training texts and a handful of seed words for a category. We use a mutual bootstrapping technique to alternately select the best extraction pattern for the category and bootstrap its extractions into the semantic lexicon, which is the basis for selecting the next extraction pattern. To make this approach more robust, we add a second level of bootstrapping (metabootstrapping) that retains only the most reliable lexicon entries produced by mutual bootstrapping and then restarts the process. We evaluated this multilevel bootstrapping technique on a collection of corporate web pages and a corpus of terrorism news articles. The algorithm produced high-quality dictionaries for several semantic categories."

In all cases the books are self-contained; they are intended to treat important areas in general linguistics and to be of value for a number of years"

Words are represented by the relative frequency distributions of contexts in which they appear, and relative entropy between those distributions is used as the similarity measure for clustering. Clusters are represented by average context distributions derived from the given words according to their probabilities of cluster membership. In many cases, the clusters can be thought of as encoding coarse sense distinctions. Deterministic annealing is used to find lowest distortion sets of clusters: as the annealing parameter increases, existing clusters become unstable and subdivide, yielding a hierarchical \"soft\" clustering of the data. Clusters are used as the basis for class models of word coocurrence, and the models evaluated with respect to held-out test data."

We describe how our system exploits this linguistic knowledge to compute a measure of similarity between two adjectives, using statistical techniques and without having access to any semantic information about the adjectives. We also show how a clustering algorithm can use these similarities to produce the groups of adjectives, and we present results produced by our system for a sample set of adjectives. We conclude by presenting evaluation methods for the task at hand, and analyzing the significance of the results obtained."

There are two important aspects to person-machine communication: understanding and generating. While natural language understanding has been a major focus of research, natural language generation is a relatively new and increasingly active field of research. This book presents an overview of the state of the art in natural language generation, describing both new results and directions for new research. The principal emphasis of natural language generation is not only to facili tate the use of computers but also to develop a computational theory of human language ability. In doing so, it is a tool for extending, clarifying and verifying theories that have been put forth in linguistics, psychology and sociology about how people communicate. A natural language generator will typically have access to a large body of knowledge from which to select information to present to users as well as numer of expressing it. Generating a text can thus be seen as a problem of ous ways decision-making under multiple constraints: constraints from the propositional knowledge at hand, from the linguistic tools available, from the communicative goals and intentions to be achieved, from the audience the text is aimed at and from the situation and past discourse. Researchers in generation try to identify the factors involved in this process and determine how best to represent the factors and their dependencies."

We define a concept of word-by-word alignment between such pairs of sentences. For any given pair of such sentences each of our models assigns a probability to each of the possible word-by-word alignments. We give an algorithm for seeking the most probable of these alignments. Although the algorithm is suboptimal, the alignment thus obtained accounts well for the word-by-word relationships in the pair of sentences. We have a great deal of data in French and English from the proceedings of the Canadian Parliament. Accordingly, we have restricted our work to these two languages; but we feel that because our algorithms have minimal linguistic content they would work well on other pairs of languages. We also feel, again because of the minimal linguistic content of our algorithms, that it is reasonable to argue that word-by-word alignments are inherent in any sufficiently large bilingual corpus."

A large number of rules is needed for coverage of the domain, suggesting that a fairly large number of labeled examples should be required to train a classifier. However, we show that the use of unlabeled data can reduce the requirements for supervision to just 7 simple \"seed\" rules. The approach gains leverage from natural redundancy in the data: for many named-entity instances both the spelling of the name and the context inwhich it appears are sufficient to determine its type. We present two algorithms. The first method uses a similar algorithm to that of (Yarowsky 95), with modifications motivated by (Blum and Mitchell 98). The second algorithm extends ideas from boosting algorithms, designed for supervised learning tasks, to the framework suggested by (Blum and Mitchell 98)."
