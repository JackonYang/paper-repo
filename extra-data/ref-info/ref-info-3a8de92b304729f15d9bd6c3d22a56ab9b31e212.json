Over 93 per cent of the word tags were correctly selected by using a matrix of tag pair probabilities and this figure was upgraded by a further 3 per cent by retagging problematic strings of words prior to disambiguation and by altering the probability weightings for sequences of three tags. The remaining 3 to 4 per cent were corrected by a human post-editor.The system was originally designed to run in batch mode over the corpus but we have recently modified procedures to run interactively for sample sentences typed in by a user at a terminal. We are currently extending the word tag set and improving the word tagging procedures to further reduce manual intervention. A similar probabilistic system is being developed for phrase and clause tagging."

This paper describes a computational grammar coder which has been completely programmed and is oper~tional on Lhe IBM 7090. It is part of a complete syntactic annlysis system for which it accomplishes word-class coding, using a computational approach rather than the usual method of dictionary lookup. The resulting system is completely contained in less than 1~,000 computer words. It processes running English text on the IBM 7090 at a rate of more than 1250 words per minute. Since the system is not dependent on large dictionaries, it operates on any ordinary English text. In preliminary experiments with scientific text, the system correctly and unambiguously coded over 90 percent of the words in two samples of scientific writing. A fair proportion of the remaining ambiguity can be removed at higher levels of synvactic analysis, but the problem of structural ambiguity in natural languages is seen to be a critical one in the development of practical language processing systems."

However, recent advances in linguistics, most notably the system of formal semantics known as Montague semantics, suggest ways of putting semantic interpretation onto a cleaner and firmer foundation. \nAbsity, the system we describe, is a Montague-inspired semantic interpreter. Like Montague formalisms, our semantics is compositional by design and is strongly typed, with semantic rules in one-to-one correspondence with the meaning-affecting rules of a Marcus parser. We have replaced the Montague semantic objects--functors and truth conditions--with elements of the frame language Frail. Absity's partial results are always well-formed Frail objects. \nA semantic interpreter must be able to provide feedback to the parser to help it handle structural ambiguities. In Absity, this is done by the \"Semantic Enquiry Desk\", a process that answers the parser's questions on semantic preferences. Disambiguation of word senses and of case slots is done by a set of procedures, one per word or slot, each of which determines its correct sense in cooperation with the others. A partially disambiguated procedure's remaining possibilities are well-formed Frail objects that can be seen and used by other processes, including the Semantic Enquiry Desk, just as a person can see many of the details of a partly developed \"instant\" photograph. \nIt is from the fact that partial results are always well-formed semantic objects that the system gains much of its power. This, in turn, comes from the strict correspondence between syntax and semantics in Absity. The result is a foundation for semantic interpretation that we believe to be superior to previous approaches."

The tag set used is very similar, but somewhat larger, at about 130 tags. The dictionary used is derived from the tagged Brown Corpus, rather than from the untagged. It contains 7000 rather than 3000 entries, and 700 rather than 450 suffixes. CLAWS treats plural, possessive, and hyphenated words as special cases for purposes of initial tagging. The LOB researchers began by using TAGGIT on parts of the LOB Corpus. They noticed that While less than 25% of TAGGIT's context frame rules are concerned with only the immediately preceding or succeeding w o r d . . , these rules were applied in about 80% of all attempts to apply rules. This relative overuse of minimally specified contexts indicated that exploitation of the relationship between successive tags, coupled with a mechanism that would be applied throughout a sequence of ambiguous words, would produce a more accurate and effective method of word disambiguation (Marshall (1983), p."
