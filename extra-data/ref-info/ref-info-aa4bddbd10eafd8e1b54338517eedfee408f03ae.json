To provide a variety of clustering solutions, the data sets were analyzed by four hierarchical clustering methods. External criterion measures indicated excellent recovery of the true cluster structure by the methods at the correct hierarchy level. Thus, the clustering present in the data was quite strong. The simulation results for the stopping rules revealed a wide range in their ability to determine the correct number of clusters in the data. Several procedures worked fairly well, whereas others performed rather poorly. Thus, the latter group of rules would appear to have little validity, particularly for data sets containing distinct clusters. Applied researchers are urged to select one or more of the better criteria. However, users are cautioned that the performance of some of the criteria may be data dependent."

Unfortunately with mixture models, regularity conditions do not hold for -2 log A, to have it usual asymptotic null distribution of chi-squared. In this paper the role of the bootstrap is highlighted for the assessment of the null distribution of -2 log A{ for the test of a single normal density versus a mixture of two normal densities in the univariate case."

This improves upon the naive O(n 3) implementation of single linkage clustering. A single linkage dendrogram is a tree, where each level of the tree corresponds to a different threshold dissimilarity measure h. The nodes of a dataset are grouped into \" equivalence classes \" c(h) at each level of the dendrogram, where two classes C i and C j are merged if there is a pair of \" OTU's \" (vertices) v i \u2208 C i and v j \u2208 C j such that the dissimilarity measure between v i and v j is less than h, or D(v i , v j) < h. For example, consider a set of 10 vertices v 1 ,. .. , v 10 for which the dissimilarity matrix D is given below, with D ij equal to the dissimilarity between v i and v j. Suppose we take four cutoff dissimilarity measures h 1 , h 2 , h 3 , h 4 and produce the dendrogram according to these thresholds. An example illustrating how the 10 vertices are grouped into equivalence classes at each level is shown in Figure 1. Since no dissimilarity is at or below 1, each vertex or \" OTU \" is its own equivalence class at the level corresponding to h 1 = 1. At the next level, however, we see that some classes have been merged together because several dissimilarity measures are below h 2 = 2. We can see that c(h 2) consists of 6 equivalence classes, c(h 3) has 3 equivalence classes, and c(h 4 = 4) aggregates all the vertices into one equivalence class. In single linkage clustering, the number of levels in the tree is determined by the nearest-neighbor criterion \u2013 at each level, at least one new merge is made between two clusters, and the merge is made for clusters C i and C j if the minimal distance between vertices v i \u2208 C i and v j \u2208 C j is the smallest such distance across all the clusters. In other words, the nearest neighbors between clusters C j and C i are found, and if these neighbors are closer than all the other nearest-neighbor pairs, then C i and C \u2026"
