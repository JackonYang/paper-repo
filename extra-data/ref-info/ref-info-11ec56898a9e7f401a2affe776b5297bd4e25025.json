The behaviour for the second subtask (textual entailment) obtained much better performance than the one evaluated at the first subtask (relatedness), ranking our approach in the 7th position of 18 teams that participated at the competition."

Specifically, we address two questions: (1) Can we solve these two subtasks together? (2) Are features proposed for textual entailment task still effective for semantic relatedness task? To address them, we extracted seven types of features including text difference measures proposed in entailment judgement subtask, as well as common text similarity measures used in both subtasks. Then we exploited the same feature set to solve the both subtasks by considering them as a regression and a classification task respectively and performed a study of influence of different features. We achieved the first and the second rank for relatedness and entailment task respectively."

For determining semantic similarity we took a supervised approach using a variety of features, the majority of which was produced by our system for recognizing textual entailment.

MeanMaxSim, an unsupervised procedure, is proposed as a new baseline to assess the efficiency gain provided by compositional models. It outperforms a number of other baselines by a wide margin. Compared to the wordoverlap baseline, it has the advantage of taking into account the distributional similarity between words that are also involved in compositional models. The second procedure aims at building a predictive model using as predictors MeanMaxSim and (transformed) lexical features describing the differences between each sentence of a pair. It finished sixth out of 17 teams in the textual similarity sub-task and sixth out of 19 in the textual entailment subtask."

We aim to help the research community working on compositional distributional semantic models (CDSMs) by providing SICK (Sentences Involving Compositional Knowldedge), a large size English benchmark tailored for them. SICK consists of about 10,000 English sentence pairs that include many examples of the lexical, syntactic and semantic phenomena that CDSMs are expected to account for, but do not require dealing with other aspects of existing sentential data sets (idiomatic multiword expressions, named entities, telegraphic language) that are not within the scope of CDSMs. By means of crowdsourcing techniques, each pair was annotated for two crucial semantic tasks: relatedness in meaning (with a 5-point rating scale as gold score) and entailment relation between the two elements (with three possible gold labels: entailment, contradiction, and neutral). The SICK data set was used in SemEval-2014 Task 1, and it freely available for research purposes."

The implementation is based on unsupervised learning of matrices for relational words and applying them to the vectors of their arguments. The evaluation is based on the word disambiguation task developed by Mitchell and Lapata (2008) for intransitive sentences, and on a similar new experiment designed for transitive sentences. Our model matches the results of its competitors in the first experiment, and betters them in the second. The general improvement in results with increase in syntactic complexity showcases the compositional power of our model."

The training data contained 2000 sentence pairs from previously existing paraphrase datasets and machine translation evaluation resources. The test data also comprised 2000 sentences pairs for those datasets, plus two surprise datasets with 400 pairs from a different machine translation evaluation corpus and 750 pairs from a lexical resource mapping exercise. The similarity of pairs of sentences was rated on a 0-5 scale (low to high similarity) by human judges using Amazon Mechanical Turk, with high Pearson correlation scores, around 90%. 35 teams participated in the task, submitting 88 runs. The best results scored a Pearson correlation >80%, well above a simple lexical baseline that only scored a 31% correlation. This pilot task opens an exciting way ahead, although there are still open issues, specially the evaluation metric."

A subtask was also proposed, aimed at detecting novel information. To continue the effort of testing RTE in NLP applications, a KBP Validation Pilot Task was set up, in which RTE systems had to validate the output of systems participating in the KBP Slot Filling Task. Eighteen teams participated in the Main Task (48 submitted runs) and 9 in the Novelty Detection Subtask (22 submitted runs). As for the Pilot, 10 runs were submitted by 3 participants. Finally, the exploratory effort started in RTE-5 to perform resource evaluation through ablation tests was not only reiterated in RTE-6, but also extended to tools."

RTMs are a computational model for identifying the translation acts between any two data sets with respect to interpretants selected in the same domain, which are effective when making monolingual and bilingual similarity judgments. RTMs judge the quality or the semantic similarity of text by using retrieved relevant training data as interpretants for reaching shared semantics. We derive features measuring the closeness of the test sentences to the training data via interpretants, the difficulty of translating them, and the presence of the acts of translation, which may ubiquitously be observed in communication. RTMs provide a language independent approach to all similarity tasks and achieve top performance when predicting monolingual cross-level semantic similarity (Task 3) and good results in semantic relatedness and entailment (Task 1) and multilingual semantic textual similarity (STS) (Task 10). RTMs remove the need to access any task or domain specific information or resource."

In creating this year's dataset, a number of longer texts were introduced to make the challenge more oriented to realistic scenarios. Additionally, a pool of resources was offered so that the participants could share common tools. A pilot task was also set up, aimed at differentiating unknown entailments from identified contradictions and providing justifications for overall system decisions. 26 participants submitted 44 runs, using different approaches and generally presenting new entailment models and achieving higher scores than in the previous challenges."

However, they cannot capture the compositional meaning of longer phrases, preventing them from a deeper understanding of language. We introduce a recursive neural network (RNN) model that learns compositional vector representations for phrases and sentences of arbitrary syntactic type and length. Our model assigns a vector and a matrix to every node in a parse tree: the vector captures the inherent meaning of the constituent, while the matrix captures how it changes the meaning of neighboring words or phrases. This matrix-vector RNN can learn the meaning of operators in propositional logic and natural language. The model obtains state of the art performance on three different experiments: predicting fine-grained sentiment distributions of adverb-adjective pairs; classifying sentiment labels of movie reviews and classifying semantic relationships such as cause-effect or topic-message between nouns using the syntactic path between them."

The appeal of these models lies in their ability to represent meaning simply by using distributional information under the assumption that words occurring within similar contexts are semantically similar. Despite their widespread use, vector-based models are typically directed at representing words in isolation, and methods for constructing representations for phrases or sentences have received little attention in the literature. This is in marked contrast to experimental evidence (e.g., in sentential priming) suggesting that semantic similarity is more complex than simply a relation between isolated words. This article proposes a framework for representing the meaning of word combinations in vector space. Central to our approach is vector composition, which we operationalize in terms of additive and multiplicative functions. Under this framework, we introduce a wide range of composition models that we evaluate empirically on a phrase similarity task."

Our model significantly outperforms the rivals on the task of reconstructing AN vectors not seen in training. A small post-hoc analysis further suggests that, when the model-generated AN vector is not similar to the corpus-observed AN vector, this is due to anomalies in the latter. We show moreover that our approach provides two novel ways to represent adjective meanings, alternative to its representation via corpus-based co-occurrence vectors, both outperforming the latter in an adjective clustering task."

SemantiKLUE combines unsupervised and supervised techniques into a robust system for measuring semantic similarity. At the core of the system is a word-to-word alignment of two texts using a maximum weight matching algorithm. The system participated in three SemEval-2014 shared tasks and the competitive results are evidence for its usability in that broad field of application."
