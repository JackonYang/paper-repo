Following an initial discussion of some basic facts about eye movements and perception, the following topics are discussed: (I) the span of effective vision during scene perception, (2) the role of eye movements in scene perception, (3) integration of information across saccades, (4) scene context, object identification and eye movements, and (5) the control of eye movements. The relationship of eye movements during reading to eye movements during scene perception is considered. A preliminary model of eye movement control in scene perception is described and directions for future research are suggested."

This claim has provided a basis for challenging widely accepted data-driven models of visual perception in order to advocate alternative models with an outspoken top-down character. The present paper offers a review of the evidence to demonstrate that the observed scene-context effects may be the product of post-perceptual and task-dependent guessing strategies. A new research paradigm providing an on-line measure of genuine perceptual effects of context on object identification is proposed. First-fixation durations for objects incidentally fixated during the free exploration of real-world scenes are shown to increase when the objects are improbable in the scene or violate certain aspects of their typical spatial appearance in it. These effects of contextual violations are shown to emerge only at later stages of scene exploration, contrary to the notion of schema-driven scene perception effective from the very first scene fixation. In addition, evidence is reported in support of the existence of a facilitatory component in scene-context effects. This is taken to indicate that the context directly affects the ease of perceptual object processing and does not merely serve as a framework for checking the plausibility of the output of perceptual processes. Finally, our findings are situated against other contrasting results. Some future research questions are highlighted."

How do we accomplish this visual-cognitive feat? The commonly held explanation is known as the schema hypothesis, according to which a visual scene is rapidly identified as a member of a semantic category, and predictions generated from the scene category are then used to aid subsequent object identification. In this paper I will first outline and offer a critique of the evidence that has been taken to support the schema hypothesis. I will then offer an alternative framework for understanding scene processing, which I will call the local-processing hypothesis. This hypothesis assumes a modular, informationally-encapsulated architecture, and explicitly includes the role of covert visual attention in scene processing."

An important part of this question is whether the context of the real-world \u201cscene\u201d in which the object is placed influences the identification of the object, and if so, how. However, there is significant disagreement among researchers in the area as to what has been discovered. This is due in part to different theoretical orientations and in part to disagreement as to what paradigm or paradigms are adequate for studying object identification. As a result, we will briefly review some of the literature in order to place our research in sufficient context."

In the present experiments we used a paradigm in which an object in a scene is \"wiggled\"--drawing both attention and an eye fixation to itself--and then named. Thus the effect of scene context on object identification can be examined in a situation in which the target object is fixated and hence is fully visible. Experiment 1 indicated that a scene background that was episodically consistent with a target object facilitated the speed of naming. In Experiments 2 and 3, we investigated the time course of scene background information acquisition using display changes contingent on eye movements to the target object. The results from Experiment 2 were inconclusive; however, Experiment 3 demonstrated that scene background information present only on either the first or second fixation on a scene significantly affected naming time. Thus background information appears to be both extracted and able to affect object identification continuously during scene viewing."

Pictures were presented for 10, 30, 50, 75, 100, 150, 300, or 1000 ms and subjects were asked to determine if a probe was the portion of the scene which had appeared in that location. The probed sections had previously been rated on informativeness and high-, medium-, and low-rated areas were examined. Medium-informative sections were recognized better than high- or low-informative sections. A comparison of sections in the central and peripheral positions of the visual field indicated that medium-informative sections were recognized better in the periphery, while highly informative areas were recognized more accurately at central locations. These results are interpreted as supporting the concept that context develops prior to the identification of objects."

Also, many of the scenes that we do see are familiar in the sense that they have been experienced before. Do these factors influence the perception of a scene? In three experiments, priming subjects with a verbal descriptor of a scene was not found to improve reliably the perception of that scene as assessed by the speed and accuracy of detecting an incongruity between an object and its setting (Experiments 1 and 2) or a specified target object (Experiment 3). Also, in attempting to perceive these scenes, subjects could not capitalize on the residue from prior exposures of a scene's background, even though those backgrounds had been processed to the point where semantic information had been extracted from them. Although these results are inconsistent with recent speculations on the role of frames in scene perception, recent experiments on the perception of a scene from a single fixation, and film-editing practice with \"flash cuts.\" The implications of these results are that the mechanisms for perceiving and interpreting nondegraded real-world scenes are so quick and efficient that conditions can readily be found in which priming and prior exposures of substantial portions of scenes are not helpful for perceiving and judging certain aspects of those scenes."

However, when brief blank fields are placed between alternating displays of an original and a modified scene, a striking failure of perception is induced: Identification of changes becomes extremely difficult, even when changes are large and made repeatedly. Identification is much faster when a verbal cue is provided, showing that poor visibility is not the cause of this difficulty. Identification is also faster for objects considered to be important in the scene. These results support the idea that observers never form a complete, detailed representation of their surroundings. In addition, the results indicate that attention is required to perceive change, and that in the absence of localized motion signals, attention is guided on the basis of high-level interest."

The model tries to cover the entire range from behavior and phenomenological experience to detailed neural encodings in crude but computationally plausible reductive steps. The problems addressed include perceptual constancies, eye movements and the stable visual world, object descriptions, perceptual generalizations, and the representation of extrapersonal space. The entire development is based on an action-oriented notion of perception. The observer is assumed to be continuously sampling the ambient light for information of current value. The central problem of vision is taken to be categorizing and locating objects in the environment. The critical step in this process is the linking of visual information to symbolic object descriptions; this is called indexing, from the analogy of identifying a book from index terms. The system must also identify situations and use this knowledge to guide movement and other actions in the environment. The treatment focuses on the different representations of information used in the visual system. The four representational frames capture information in the following forms: retinotopic, head-based, symbolic, and allocentric. The functional roles of the four frames, the communication among them, and their suggested neurophysiological realization constitute the core of the paper. The model is perforce crude, but appears to be consistent with all relevant findings."

However, the question remains of how processes of object and scene categorization use the information associated with different perceptual spatial scales. The psychophysics of scale perception suggests that recognition uses coarse blobs before fine scale edges, because the former is perceptually available before the latter. Although possible, this perceptually determined scenario neglects the nature of the task the recognition system must solve. If different spatial scales transmit different information about the input, an identical scene might be flexibly encoded and perceived at the scale that optimizes information for the considered task-i.e., the diagnostic scale. This paper tests the hypothesis that scale diagnosticity can determine scale selection for recognition. Experiment 1 tested whether coarse and fine spatial scales were both available at the onset of scene categorization. The second experiment tested that the selection of one scale could change depending on the diagnostic information present at this scale. The third and fourth experiments investigated whether scale-specific cues were independently processed, or whether they perceptually cooperated in the recognition of the input scene. Results suggest that a mandatory low-level registration of multiple spatial scales promotes flexible scene encodings, perceptions, and categorizations."

The results indicated that the subjects acquired word-length pattern information at least 12 to 15 character positions to the right of the fixation point, and that this information primarily influenced saccade lengths.

When viewing a scene, we seem to use detailed representations of object properties and interobject relations to achieve a sense of continuity across views. Yet, several recent studies show that human observers fail to detect changes to objects and object properties when localized retinal information signaling a change is masked or eliminated (e.g., by eye movements). However, these studies changed arbitrarily chosen objects which may have been outside the focus of attention. We draw on previous research showing the importance of spatiotemporal information for tracking objects by creating short motion pictures in which objects in both arbitrary locations and the very center of attention were changed. Adult observers failed to notice changes in both cases, even when the sole actor in a scene transformed into another person across an instantaneous change in camera angle (or \u201ccut\u201d)."

In both cases there was unilateral neglect of one side of visual displays if items in the displays were coded as parts of a single perceptual object, and neglect of the opposite side if items were coded as separate perceptual objects. In addition, attentional cueing effects to either the left or right side were specific to the form of representation involved. These cases demonstrate that there is parallel coding of visual displays into within- and between-object spatial representations.

At the same time, experimental psychologists have also known that during the course of a complex visual task such as reading or picture viewing, our eyes move from one location to another at an average rate of 3 to 5 times per second (e.g., Rayner, 1978; Tinker, 1939; Yarbus, 1967). The question therefore arises how these covert and overt changes in processing focus are related. This is the question addressed in the present chapter."

This phenomenon of visual stability was explored by making changes in natural, full-color pictures during selected saccades as observers examined them in preparation for a recognition test. In Experiment 1, the pictures were displaced up, down, left, or right by 0.3, 0.4, or 1.2 degrees. In Experiment 2, the pictures were expanded or contracted by 10% or 20%. As a secondary task, subjects pressed a button when a change was detected. Three results from previous studies with simpler stimuli did not generalize. Evidence suggests that subjects' detection of image changes primarily involves the use of local information in the region of the eyes' landing position. A saccade target theory of visual stability is proposed."

We have developed a neural network model of the hierarchy of maps in visual cortex to explore the hypothesis that visual features are encoded in egocentric (spatiotopic) coordinates at early stages of visual processing. Most psychophysical studies that have attempted to examine this question have concluded that features are represented in retiThe three most common types of coordinates used for representing visual objects in biological and computer vision systems are eye-centered (retinal), object-centered, and viewer-centered (egocentric). Eye-centered representations are consistent with many physiological and psychophysical studies of early vision. Neurons in primary visual cortex and most extrastriate areas are organized into retinotopic maps (Felleman & Van Essen, 1991). Most psychophysical experiments designed to determine the nature of spatial representation at early visual stages have reached the same conclusion, as we review in the discussion. Other types of representation are believed to be used at the highest stages of visual processing. Mishkin, Ungerleider, and Macko (1983) proposed a functional distinction between two main streams of processing, the \"what\" and \"where\" pathways leading, respectively, in the temporal and parietal cortex. Object-centered reference frames have been suggested for the representation of objects in the inferior temporal cortex and egocentric reference frames have been proposed for the representation of spatial location in the parietal cortex (Andersen, 1989). Goodale and Milner (1990) recently proposed that the dorsal pathway to parietal cortex could also be involved *Present address: Department of Psychology, Yale University. O 1993 Mmachuset& Institute of Technology nal coordinates, but the interpretation of these experiments does not preclude the type of retinospatiotopic representation that is embodied in our model. The model also explains why electrical stimulation experiments in visual cortex cannot distinguish between retinal and retinospatiotopic coordinates in the early stages of visual processing. Psychophysical predictions are made for testing the existence of retinospatiotopic repre-"

Of interest is whether the identification of the target object depends on the identification of the scene or the identification of other diagnostic objects in the scene. Experiment 1 indicated objects are more difficult to identify when located in an \"episodically\" inconsistent background even when the same diagnostic objects are present in both inconsistent and consistent backgrounds. Experiment 2 demonstrated that the degree to which noncued (cohort) objects are consistent with the target object has no effect on the object identification task. Experiment 3 showed consistent episodic background information facilitated object identification and inconsistent episodic background information did not interfere relative to \"nonsense\" backgrounds roughly equated on visual characteristics. Implications for models of scene perception are discussed."

In Experiment 1 subjects saw 100 ms presentations of line drawings containing objects that were either usual or unusual given the picture context. Following each exposure they were required to select from among four objects the one that had been contained in the scene. The consistency of the three distractor alternatives with the meaning of the picture was varied. Recognition accuracy was poor for unusual objects and when the distractors were consistent with the picture meaning and did not substantially differ from the performance of subjects who selected response alternatives after being provided with a theme of the picture, without actually viewing the pictures. This supports the conclusion that subjects were responding on the basis of the global information but not the local object information in the pictures. When the exposure duration was increased to 2 s (Experiment 2), processing of local information was apparent for both usual and unusual objects but effects of the global information were still evident."

Experiment 1 replicated the I. Biederman, R. J. Mezzanotte, and J. C. Rabinowitz (1982) object-detection paradigm. Detection performance was higher for semantically consistent versus inconsistent objects. However, when the paradigm was modified to control for response bias (Experiments 2 and 3) or when response bias was eliminated by means of a forced-choice procedure (Experiment 4), no such advantage obtained. When an additional source of biasing information was eliminated by presenting the object label after the scene (Experiments 3 and 4), there was either no effect of consistency (Experiment 4) or an inconsistent object advantage (Experiment 3). These results suggest that object perception is not facilitated by consistent scene context."

In normal viewing conditions\u2014when the eye is not tracking a moving object\u2014the eyes stay relatively immobile for periods of only a fraction of a second. In between these periods of rest (called fixations), there are rapid ballistic eye movements (called saccades) in which the retinal image is merely a smear. Thus, vision usually consists of the following sequence of events: an interval of a sixth to about a half a second in which there is a stable retinal image followed by a brief interval of a smear, an interval with a different stable retinal image, another smear, and so on (Rayner, 1978a). A central question of visual perception is how the percept of a stable world emerges from all this chaos."

The effect of the mask is to sappress the report of the letter that stimulates the same retinal location, even though the mask appears to cover or surround the letter whose position in real space it shares. Masking is. however, weaker when the eyes move than when they do not. An auxiliary experiment suggests that the spatial aspects of observable (reportable by S) stimulus persistence are unaffected by eye movements, and therefore that observable persistence differs from that susceptible to masking."

Previous investigators have suggested that our perception of a stable visual environment is due to anintegrative visual buffer, a special memory store capable of fusing the visual contents of successive fixations according to their environmental coordinates. In this paper, three experiments are reported that attempted to demonstrate the existence of an integrative visual buffer. The experimental procedure required subjects to mentally fuse two halves of a dot matrix presented in the same spatial region of a display, but separated by an eye movement so that each half was viewed only during one fixation. Thus, subjects had to integrate packets of visual information that had the same environmental coordinates, but different retinal coordinates. No evidence was found in any experiment for the fusion of visual information from successive fixations in memory, leaving the status of the integrative visual buffer in serious doubt."

We have developed a neural network model of the hierarchy of maps in visual cortex to explore the hypothesis that visual features are encoded in egocentric (spatio-topic) coordinates at early stages of visual processing. Most psychophysical studies that have attempted to examine this question have concluded that features are represented in retinal coordinates, but the interpretation of these experiments does not preclude the type of retinospatiotopic representation that is embodied in our model. The model also explains why electrical stimulation experiments in visual cortex cannot distinguish between retinal and retinospatiotopic coordinates in the early stages of visual processing. Psychophysical predictions are made for testing the existence of retinospatiotopic representations."

                "text": "Although the study of visual perception has made more progress in the past 40 years than any other area of cognitive science, there remain major disagreements as to how closely vision is tied to cognition. This target article sets out some of the arguments for both sides (arguments from computer vision, neuroscience, psychophysics, perceptual learning, and other areas of vision science) and defends the position that an important part of visual perception, corresponding to what some people have called early vision, is prohibited from accessing relevant expectations, knowledge, and utilities in determining the function it computes \u2013 in other words, it is cognitively impenetrable. That part of vision is complex and involves top-down interactions that are internal to the early vision system. Its function is to provide a structured representation of the 3-D surfaces of objects sufficient to serve as an index into memory, with somewhat different outputs being made available to other systems such as those dealing with motor control. The paper also addresses certain conceptual and methodological issues raised by this claim, such as whether signal detection theory and event-related potentials can be used to assess cognitive penetration of vision. A distinction is made among several stages in visual processing, including, in addition to the inflexible early-vision stage, a pre-perceptual attention-allocation stage and a post-perceptual evaluation, selection, and inference stage, which accesses long-term memory. These two stages provide the primary ways in which cognition can affect the outcome of visual perception. The paper discusses arguments from computer vision and psychology showing that vision is \u201cintelligent\u201d and involves elements of \u201cproblem solving.\u201d The cases of apparently intelligent interpretation sometimes cited in support of this claim do not show cognitive penetration; rather, they show that certain natural constraints on interpretation, concerned primarily with optical and geometrical properties of the world, have been compiled into the visual system. The paper also examines a number of examples where instructions and \u201chints\u201d are alleged to affect what is seen. In each case it is concluded that the evidence is more readily assimilated to the view that when cognitive effects are found, they have a locus outside early vision, in such processes as the allocation of focal attention and the identification of the stimulus."

Subjects looked at arrays of four objects while their eye movements were recorded. Their task was to identify the objects in the array for an immediate probe memory test. During viewing, the number and location of objects visible during given fixations were manipulated. In Experiments 1 and 2, we found that multiple extrafoveal previews of an object did not afford any more benefit than a single extrafoveal preview, as assessed by means of time of fixation on the objects. In Experiment 3, we found evidence for a model in which extrafoveal information acquired during a fixation derives primarily from the location toward which the eyes will move next. The results are discussed in terms of their implications for the relationship between covert visual attention and extrafoveal information use, and a sequential attention model is proposed."

One hypothesisabout how this perception is achieved is that the contents of succesaivatienn~arefusedinmemory according to environmental coordinates. Two experiments failed to support this hypothesis; they showed that one\u2019s ability to detecta grating presented after a saccade is unaffected by the presentation of a grating with the same spatial frequency in the same spatial location before the saccade. A third experiment tested an alternative explanation of perceptual stability that claims that the contents of successive fixations are compared, rather than fused, across-saccades, allowing one to determine whether the world has remained stable. This hypothesis was supported: Experienced subjects could accurately determine whether two patterns viewed in successive fixationswere identical or different, evenwhenthe two patterns appeared in different spatial positions across the saccade. Taken together, these results suggest that perceptual stability and information integration across saccades rely on memory for the relative positions of objects in the environment, rather than on the spatiotopic fusion of visual information from successive fixations."

In all experiments, subjects were presented with realistically rendered images of computer-generated 3D objects, with tight control over stimulus shape, surface properties, illumination, and viewpoint, as well as subjects' prior exposure to the stimulus objects. Contrary to the predictions of the paradigmatic theory of recognition, which holds that object representations are viewpoint invariant, performance in all experiments was consistently viewpoint dependent, was only partially aided by binocular stereo and other depth information, was specific to viewpoints that were familiar, and was systematically disrupted by rotation in depth more than by deforming the 2D images of the stimuli. The emerging concept of multiple-views representation supported by these results is consistent with recently advanced computational theories of recognition based on view interpolation. Moreover, in several simulated experiments employing the same stimuli used in experiments with human subjects, models based on multiple-views representations replicated many of the psychophysical results concerning the observed pattern of human performance."

However, the specific function of each of these regions is not yet clear. Here we present evidence that a particular area within human parahippocampal cortex is involved in a critical component of navigation: perceiving the local visual environment. This region, which we name the \u2018parahippocampal place area\u2019 (PPA), responds selectively and automatically in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to passively viewed scenes, but only weakly to single objects and not at all to faces. The critical factor for this activation appears to be the presence in the stimulus of information about the layout of local space. The response in the PPA to scenes with spatial layout but no discrete objects (empty rooms) is as strong as the response to complex meaningful scenes containing multiple objects (the same rooms furnished) and over twice as strong as the response to arrays of multiple objects without three-dimensional spatial context (the furniture from these rooms on a blank background). This response is reduced if the surfaces in the scene are rearranged so that they no longer define a coherent space. We propose that the PPA represents places by encoding the geometry of the local environment."

However, when 2 corresponding stimuli were superimposed by means of a 2-field tachistoscope, a 3-letter nonsense syllable was perceived. Temporal organization in perception was studied in Experiment I by varying the interval between the presentation of the 2 corresponding patterns over 300 msec. Identification accuracy of syllables was a decreasing function of interstimulus interval over a range in excess of 100 msec. Experiment II used unequal energy levels for the 2 corresponding patterns and also varied the sequence of occurrence of the high and low energy members of corresponding sets. The relevance of such concepts as perceptual memory, afterimages, and psychological moments to the data was considered. It was suggested that mechanisms in the visual system such as the \"off\" response that detect the termination of a stimulus may be responsible for inhibition of integration over time."

The ability of observers to identify the different images was determined after each set of measurements. An index of similarity, calculated in terms of the sum of the squares of the distances between each fixation point and its nearest neighbour in the other set, was developed in order to provide a basis for the comparison of two sets of eye movements, each made by a different observer or both made on different occasions by the same observer. Application of this index shows that brief (1.5-s) presentation, there exists a high degree of similarity between fixations made by different observers in response to the same image. For longer (3-s) periods, however, the similarity for inter-observer comparisons is reduced. The data demonstrate that filtering of the image has little effect on the pattern of fixations made to a given image, but the duration of fixations is greatest for low-pass filtered images and least for unfiltered images, whereas the amplitude of saccades is greatest for unfiltered images and least for low-pass filtered images. It is proposed that for brief presentations, eye movements made during examination of an unfamiliar image are performed automatically in response to the spatial features of the image."

The fundamental assumption of the proposed theory, recognition-by-components (RBC), is that a modest set of generalized-cone components, called geons (N \u00a3 36), can be derived from contrasts of five readily detectable properties of edges in a two-dimensiona l image: curvature, collinearity, symmetry, parallelism, and cotermination. The detection of these properties is generally invariant over viewing position an$ image quality and consequently allows robust object perception when the image is projected from a novel viewpoint or is degraded. RBC thus provides a principled account of the heretofore undecided relation between the classic principles of perceptual organization and pattern recognition: The constraints toward regularization (Pragnanz) characterize not the complete object but the object's components. Representational power derives from an allowance of free combinations of the geons. A Principle of Componential Recovery can account for the major phenomena of object recognition: If an arrangement of two or three geons can be recovered from the input, objects can be quickly recognized even when they are occluded, novel, rotated in depth, or extensively degraded. The results from experiments on the perception of briefly presented pictures by human observers provide empirical support for the theory. Any single object can project an infinity of image configurations to the retina. The orientation of the object to the viewer can vary continuously, each giving rise to a different two-dimensional projection. The object can be occluded by other objects or texture fields, as when viewed behind foliage. The object need not be presented as a full-colored textured image but instead can be a simplified line drawing. Moreover, the object can even be missing some of its parts or be a novel exemplar of its particular category. But it is only with rare exceptions that an image fails to be rapidly and readily classified, either as an instance of a familiar object category or as an instance that cannot be so classified (itself a form of classification)."

Although they were judged to be highly recognizable, all the redundant (or predictable) contours received few fixations. Areas of mere texture scored low on both measures. The relations between fixation densities and estimated recognizability suggest that a scene may be divided into informative features and redundant regions. Not only do the eyes have to be aimed, they are usually aimed intelligently, even during the casual inspection of pictures."

The similarity between the locations of the eye movements and those of each stimulus feature was determined by means of a least squares index IS. For averages taken over data for all observers, the similarity determined in this way is much lower than values for pairs of fixation locations made by different observers. It is concluded that the pattern of fixations made to a given image which is highly conserved between different observers, cannot be associated with any one of the local features examined by us. It is shown further that the distribution of fixation locations over the images is non-uniform, with a marked bias to central areas, whereas the image features are more uniformly distributed. Weighting the distributions of feature locations to take account of the non-uniform distribution of fixations produces much higher IS values, but the dominant contribution to these high values is the weighting function itself. Only in the case of edge density is there significant similarity between the locations of eye movements and those of the image features."

Not all object individuation is plausibly viewed as emerging from an innate object module. In particular, the identification of objects in a static scene draws on a person's prior experience with the objects and on sensitivity to cues such as discontinuities in color and texture. These are the same factors that apply for the individuation of nonobject entities such as parts, suggesting that the procedures for nonobject individuation can sometimes extend to objects as well. Note, however, that although infants are sensitive to object properties such as spatiotemporal continuity, the ability to exploit these other types of cues is not present early in development (for discussion, see Baillargeon &c Hanko-Summers, 1990; Spelke, Breinlinger, )acobson, & Phillips, 1993). This developmental dissociation suggests that although the two modes of individuation might sometimes apply to the same entities (objects), they are nonetheless distinct."

Here, the role of individual objects in the recognition of complete figures and the influence of contextual information on the identification of ambiguous objects were investigated. Configurations of objects that were placed in either proper or improper spatial relations were used, and response times and error rates in a recognition task were measured. Two main results were obtained. First, proper spatial relations among the objects of a scene decrease response times and error rates in the recognition of individual objects. Second, the presence of objects that have a unique interpretation improves the identification of ambigous objects in the scene. Ambiguous objects were recognized faster and with fewer errors in the presence of clearly recognized objects compared with the same objects in isolation or in improper spatial relations. The implications of these findings for the organization of recognition memory are discussed."

The 24 dots were part of a 5 \u00d7 5 matrix, and the task of the subject was to report which dot was missing. The data were consistent with other recent studies: subjects could successfully report the location of the missing dot far above chance (54%), whereas performance in a control condition (in which the two sets of dots were presented to different spatial and retinal locations) was almost at chance level (10%).

To explore this question, we used an artificial moving scotoma paradigm to eliminate a region of a currently viewed display in real time as a function of eye position. Subjects examined linear arrays of four line drawings of objects while their eye movements were recorded. Immediately following each array, a test probe was presented to test the degree to which the subject had identified those objects. Three conditions were compared, one in which a central foveal scotoma was created, one in which an extrafoveal scotoma was created, and a control condition in which the scotoma was absent. The main result was that identification accuracy was very good, but eye-movement behavior was disrupted when a foveal scotoma was present. These results suggest that foveal information is not necessary but is beneficial for perceptual encoding during object identification; the loss of foveal information can be overcome as long as compensatory extrafoveal processing is possible."

Giving 5s response alternatives before the stimulus display as well as after it caused an impairment of performance. Performance on single words was clearly better than performance on single letters.

It is shown that eye-movement traces made by different observers in response to the same image have few common temporal sequences involving the same fixation locations, even for sequences of only two fixations. There is a greater incidence of such sequences in eye-movement traces made by the same observer in response to two presentations of the same image, but average numbers are still low. Conserved sequences involving more than two identical locations occur at a much lower frequency, and the incidence of repeated sequences is not increased if consideration is restricted to regions of the image which attract large numbers of fixations. It is concluded that the temporal sequence in which fixations are made is not a significant factor in the analysis of the eye-movement data considered in this report. Calculations based on a least squares index of similarity are consistent with this conclusion. The analysis shows a relatively high incidence of re-fixation on certain locations in the images and there is evidence that such re-fixations are a significant factor in the high similarity between fixation locations established by different observers when viewing the same image."

In Experiment 1 we extended previous work by demonstrating that a previously seen related priming object speeded the time to name a target object even when a saccade intervened between the two objects. In Experiment 2 we replicated this result and further showed that the benefit on naming time was due to facilitation from the related object rather than inhibition from the unrelated object. In addition, naming of the target object was much slower in both experiments when there was not a peripheral preview of the target object on fixation n. However, because the effect of the foveal priming object was greater when the target was not present than when it was present, priming did not appear to make extraction of the extrafoveal information more efficient. In Experiment 3, fixation times were recorded while subjects looked at four objects in order to identify them. Fixation time on an object was shorter when a related object was fixated immediately before it, even though the four objects did not form a scene. The size of the facilitation was roughly comparable to that in several analogous experiments where scenes were used. The results suggest that the effects of a predictive scene context on object identification may be explainable in terms of an object-to-object or \"intralevel\" priming mechanism."

In this paper I will discuss several defects of vision and the classical theories of how they are overcome. I will criticize these theories and suggest an alternative approach, in which the outside world is considered as a kind of external memory store which can be accessed instantaneously by casting one's eyes (or one's attention) to some location. The feeling of the presence and extreme richness of the visual world is, under this view, a kind of illusion, created by the immediate availability of the information in this external store."

In Experiment 2 we replicated this result and further showed that the benefit on naming time was due to facilitation from the related object rather than inhibition from the unrelated object. In addition, naming of the target object was much slower in both experiments when there was not a peripheral preview of the target object on fixation n. However, because the effect of the fbveal priming object was greater when the target was not present than when it was present, priming did not appear to make extraction of the extrafoveal information more efficient. In Experiment 3, fixation times were recorded while subjects looked at four objects in order to identify them. Fixation time on an object was shorter when a related object was fixated immediately before it, even though the four objects did not form a scene. The size of the facilitation was roughly comparable to that in several analogous experiments where scenes were used. The results suggest that the effects of a predictive scene context on object identification may be explainable in terms of an object-to-object or \"intralevel\" priming mechanism."

The results indicated that following one fixation on a picture at the time of initial study, performance based on holistic information was superior to performance based on specific feature information, whereas the reverse was true following sufficient study time for multiple fixations. These results support a view of pictorial information acquisition which postulates that most holistic information extracted from a picture is extracted during the first eye fixation on the picture, whereas subsequent fixations have the primary purpose of seeking out specific, informative features."

In this paper, we apply this approach to the problem of representing three-dimensional shapes for the purpose of recognition. 1. Three criteria, accessibility, scope and uniqueness, and stability and sensitivity, are presented for judging the usefulness of a representation for shape recognition. 2. Three aspects of a representation\u2019s design are considered, (i) the representation\u2019s coordinate system, (ii) its primitives, which are the primary units of shape information used in the representation, and (iii) the organization the representation imposes on the information in its descriptions. 3. In terms of these design issues and the criteria presented, a shape representation for recognition should: (i) use an object-centred coordinate system, (ii) include volumetric primitives of varied sizes, and (iii) have a modular organization. A representation based on a shape\u2019s natural axes (for example the axes identified by a stick figure) follows directly from these choices. 4. The basic process for deriving a shape description in this representation must involve: (i) a means for identifying the natural axes of a shape in its image and (ii) a mechanism for transforming viewer-centred axis specifications to specifications in an object-centred coordinate system. 5. Shape recognition involves: (i) a collection of stored shape descriptions, and (ii) various indexes into the collection that allow a newly derived description to be associated with an appropriate stored description. The most important of these indexes allows shape recognition to proceed conservatively from the general to the specific based on the specificity of the information available from the image. 6. New constraints supplied by a conservative recognition process can be used to extract more information from the image. A relaxation process for carrying out this constraint analysis is described."

In the present article, the general properties of frame theories are discussed with regard to their implications for psychological processes, and an experiment is presented which tests whether this approach yields viable predictions about the manner in which people comprehend and remember pictures of real-world scenes. Normative ratings were used to construct six target pictures, each of which contained both expected and unexpected objects. Eye movements were then recorded as subjects who anticipated a difficult recognition test viewed the targets for 30 sec each. Then, the subjects were asked to discriminate the target pictures from distractors in which either expected or unexpected objects had been changed. One consequence of the embeddedness of frame systems is that global frames may function as \"semantic pattern detectors,\" so that the perceptual knowledge in them could be used for relatively automatic pattern recognition and comprehension. Thus, subjects might be able to identify expected objects by using automatized encoding procedures that operate on global physical features. In contrast, identification of unexpected objects (i.e., objects not represented in the currently active frame) should generally require more analysis of local visual details. These hypotheses were confirmed with the fixation duration data: First fixations to the unexpected objects were approximately twice as long as first fixations to the expected objects. On the recognition test, subjects generally noticed only the changes that had been made to the unexpected objects, despite the fact that the proportions of correct rejections were made conditional on whether the target objects had been fixated. These data are again consistent with the idea that local visual details of objects represented in the frame are not neccesary for identification and are thus not generally encoded. Further, since subjects usually did not notice when expected objects were deleted or replaced with different expected objects, it was concluded that if two events instantiate the same frame, they may often be indistinguishable, as long as any differences between them are represented as arguments in the frame. Thus, for the most part, the only information about an event that is episodically \"tagged\" is information which distinguishes that particular event from others of the same general class. The data reinforce the utility of a frame theory approach to perception and memory."

This suggests that iconic memory can more properly be identified with ongoing neural processes than with the decaying contents of a sensory store. Since the publication of Sperling's influential monograph1 there has been general agreement that a relatively faithful representation of a visual display remains perceptually available for several hundred milliseconds after the distal stimulus has vanished. This led to the postulation of a short-term visual store, also called iconic memory2 or sensory register3, with contents decaying rapidly after the termination of the inducing display. The terms visual persistence or icon are commonly used to refer to the perceptual availability of the decaying contents of the sensory store. Iconic memory is regarded as having temporal combinatorial properties which allow perceptual integration of two or more sequential displays even if separated by a brief temporal gap. Integration in iconic memory was convincingly demonstrated in a study where the subjects were required to identify which element in a briefly-displayed array of 16 alphabet characters had been singled out by a temporally trailing bar marker4. Temporal integration has also provided an explanation for some aspects of visual masking5 and for temporal integration of patterns whose parts were presented sequentially in time6,7. Here I question the view that iconic memory is a store whose contents begin to decay when the inducing stimulus is terminated. I suggest that the duration of iconic persistence is linked to the duration of visual processes which begin at the onset of stimulation and continue for a given duration, whether or not the inducing stimulus is still on display. This view is based on the finding that the duration of visual persistence is negatively related to the duration of the inducing stimulus."

                "text": "Work on eye movements in reading received a considerable new impetus starting in about 1975, when several research groups began using computers to control eye movement experiments \u201con-line\u201d (McConkie & Rayner, 1975; O\u2019Regan, 1979; Reder, 1973). The idea of a \u201cmoving window\u201d allowing only a limited amount of text to be visible around the instantaneous eye position was an appealing technique that allowed researchers to measure the size of the \u201cperceptual span,\u201d that is, the zone around the fixation point from which different kinds of information is gathered. My own feeling at that time, and I believe also the feeling of other workers, was that the most reasonable thing that the eye might be doing in reading would be to adjust its saccades so that from moment to moment, the edges of successive perceptual spans would just touch, or overlap by a fixed amount. In that way, at moments when the text is easy to predict, or the words easy to recognize, the eye would be able to make larger saccades than when the eye was moving into less predictable or more difficult territory. This view of reading could be called the \u201cperceptual span control\u201d hypothesis (Jacobs & O\u2019Regan, 1987). The perceptual span control hypothesis is at the root of a very large body of research in which perceptual span is measured by making perturbations in the information available in parafoveal vision (for a review see Rayner & Pollatsek, 1987): in this research, changes in eye movements are assumed to indicate changes in perceptual span. However, it has not usually been realized that this assumption can only be true to the extent that perceptual span actually directly determines eye movements."

We show that neglect is manifest on the left or right side as a function of whether visual stimuli are encoded as parts of a single perceptual object or as separate perceptual objects. JR's left neglect in reading words can be switched to right neglect by having him read aloud all the letters in the string. He also showed left neglect in a search task in which the visual elements configure into a coherent object, but right neglect in displays using similar elements which did not so configure.

Eighteen colleagues from a broad range of disciplines, including biophysics, electrophysiology, neuroanatomy, psychophysics, clinical studies, mathematics and computer vision, discussed 'Large Scale Models of the Brain,' that is, theories and models that cover a broad range of phenomena, including early and late vision, various memory systems, selective attention, and the neuronal code underlying figure-ground segregation and awareness (for a brief summary of this meeting, see Stevens 1993). The bias in the selection of the speakers toward researchers in the area of visual perception reflects both the academic background of one of the organizers as well as the (relative) more mature status of vision compared with other modalities. This should not be surprising given the emphasis we humans place on'seeing' for orienting ourselves, as well as the intense scrutiny visual processes have received due to their obvious usefullness in military, industrial, and robotic applications.

The similarities between the two phenomena suggest that a common attentional mechanism underlies both, and this has been explicitly proposed by several attention theorists. In this article it is argued that the phenomena of semantic and perceptual priming are qualitatively different, perceptual priming reflecting a sensitivity change in the recognition process brought about by attention, and semantic priming reflecting a bias change in the recognition process brought about by attention. Because different mechanisms are required to produce sensitivity and bias changes, this implies that the attentional mechanisms responsible for semantic and perceptual priming are distinct. In terms of recent discussions of the modularity versus the unity of cognitive architecture, the present conclusion supports a modular architecture for attentional processes."

In two experiments, sequences of 16 color photographs were presented at rates of 113, 167, or 333 msec per picture. In one group, subjects were given an immediate test of recognition memory for the pictures and in other groups they searched for a target picture. Even when the target had only been specified by a title (e.g., a boat) detection of a target was strikingly superior to recognition memory. Detection was slightly but significantly better for pictured than named targets. In a third experiment pictures were presented for 50, 70, 90 or 120 msec preceded and followed by a visual mask; at 120 msec recognition memory was as accurate as detection had been. The results, taken together with those in 1969 of Potter and Levy for slower rates of sequential presentation, suggest that on the average a scene is understood and so becomes immune to ordinary visual masking within about 100 msec but requires about 300 msec of further processing before the memory representation is resistant to conceptual masking from a following picture. Possible functions of a short-term conceptual memory, such as the control of eye fixations, are discussed."

Human infants are born with a remarkable array of perceptual sensitivities that allow them to detect the basic properties that are common to the world's languages. During the first year of life, these sensitivities undergo modification reflecting an exquisite tuning to just that phonological information that is needed to map sound to meaning in the native language. We review this transition from language-general to language-specific perceptual sensitivity that occurs during the first year of life and consider whether the changes propel the child into word learning. To account for the broad-based initial sensitivities and subsequent reorganizations, we offer an integrated transactional framework based on the notion of a specialized perceptual-motor system that has evolved to serve human speech, but which functions in concert with other developing abilities. In so doing, we highlight the links between infant speech perception, babbling, and word learning."

Formerly, studies in this area indicated that there were pronounced age-related differences in suggestibility, with preschool children being particularly susceptible to misleading suggestions. The studies on which this conclusion was based were criticized on several grounds (e.g. unrealistic scenarios, truncated age range). Newer studies that have addressed these criticisms, however, have largely confirmed the earlier conclusions. These studies indicate that preschool children are disproportionately vulnerable to a variety of suggestive influences. There do not appear to any strict boundary conditions to this conclusion, and preschool children will sometimes succumb to suggestions about bodily touching, emotional events, and participatory events. The evidence for this assertion is presented in this review."

                "text": "Abstract The computational view of mind rests on certain intuitions regarding the fundamental similarity between computation and cognition. We examine some of these intuitions and suggest that they derive from the fact that computers and human organisms are both physical systems whose behavior is correctly described as being governed by rules acting on symbolic representations. Some of the implications of this view are discussed. It is suggested that a fundamental hypothesis of this approach (the \u201cproprietary vocabulary hypothesis\u201d) is that there is a natural domain of human functioning (roughly what we intuitively associate with perceiving, reasoning, and acting) that can be addressed exclusively in terms of a formal symbolic or algorithmic vocabulary or level of analysis. Much of the paper elaborates various conditions that need to be met if a literal view of mental activity as computation is to serve as the basis for explanatory theories. The coherence of such a view depends on there being a principled distinction between functions whose explanation requires that we posit internal representations and those that we can appropriately describe as merely instantiating causal physical or biological laws. In this paper the distinction is empirically grounded in a methodological criterion called the \u201ccognitive impenetrability condition.\u201d Functions are said to be cognitively impenetrable if they cannot be influenced by such purely cognitive factors as goals, beliefs, inferences, tacit knowledge, and so on. Such a criterion makes it possible to empirically separate the fixed capacities of mind (called its \u201cfunctional architecture\u201d) from the particular representations and algorithms used on specific occasions. In order for computational theories to avoid being ad hoc, they must deal effectively with the \u201cdegrees of freedom\u201d problem by constraining the extent to which they can be arbitrarily adjusted post hoc to fit some particular set of observations. This in turn requires that the fixed architectural function and the algorithms be independently validated. It is argued that the architectural assumptions implicit in many contemporary models run afoul of the cognitive impenetrability condition, since the required fixed functions are demonstrably sensitive to tacit knowledge and goals. The paper concludes with some tactical suggestions for the development of computational cognitive theories."

One goal is to determine if common organizational principles are shared between nervous systems in diverse taxa. This chapter selectively reviews the evidence that particular brain regions subserve behaviors that require spatial learning in nature. Recent evidence suggests that the insect brain regions known as the mushroom bodies may function similarly to the avian and mammalian hippocampus. Volume changes in these brain regions during the life of an individual may reflect both developmental and phylogenetic trends. These patterns may reveal important structure-function relationships in the nervous system."

We examine the steps in the chain of events by which the expectations of one person guide and direct the dynamics of social interaction such that the behavior of the target of those expectations comes to confirm or disconfirm those expectations. We further inquire into the motivational and structural foundations of confirmation and disconfirmation in social interaction, using these inquiries to address frequently asked, but rarely answered, questions about expectations and social interaction. Finally, we argue that investigations of expectations in social interaction provide a paradigm for more general theoretical and empirical considerations of interpersonal processes and social relationships."

A sampling of studies that were conducted during the most recent generation of peer relations research is organized and reviewed in relation to two types of research objectives: (a) enduring agendas--aims from past research generations that have continued to serve as an impetus for empirical investigation during the 1990s--and (b) innovative agendas--newly emergent objectives that are predicated on novel conceptual issues or ongoing research controversies and deficiencies. This profile of continuity and change in investigators' research agendas provides a platform for delineating and analyzing recent empirical accomplishments in the field of peer relations research."

Each of these reviews concludes by examining the directions for future experiments; the subsequent article then often describes that research. The series of four articles permits the reader to get a sense of the length of time, the number of researchers, and the huge effort necessary to make significant advances. The book is written at a level which can be understood by anyone with some background in biology. It assumes very little, and most articles are self-explanatory. As Friedberg is careful to point out, this book is not meant to cover all of cancer biology rigorously or comprehensively, but instead to convey several important concepts. As such, it is an excellent, easily read volume for anyone, especially students, wishing to learn about cancer biology; it would be very useful as a fast overview of the field which will make subsequent reading of more detailed articles much easier. So well written and easy to read that it is both enjoyable and informative, this book is highly recommended to anyone interested in learning about cancer biology."

The theoretical analysis integrates evolutionary and ontogenetic perspectives on cultural and human development across several levels of analysis. Specific predictions are advanced dealing with the general architecture of lifespan ontogeny, including its directionality and age-differential allocation of developmental resources into the three major goals of developmental adaptation: growth, maintenance, and regulation of loss. Consistent with this general lifespan architecture, a meta-theory of development is outlined that is based on the orchestrated and adaptive interplay between three processes of behavioral regulation: selection, optimization, and compensation. Finally, these propositions and predictions about the general nature of lifespan development are examined and supported by empirical evidence on the development of cognition and intelligence across the life span."

This is a Bayesian view of assessment that is consistent with the well-known concept of incremental validity. Conventional approaches to evaluating the accuracy of assessment methods are confounded by the choice of cutting points, by the base rates of the events, and by the assessment goal (e.g. nomothetic vs idiographic predictions). Clinical assessors need a common metric for quantifying the information value of assessment data, independent of the cutting points, base rates, or particular application. Signal detection theory (SDT) provides such a metric. We review SDT's history, concepts, and methods and provide examples of its application to a variety of assessment problems."

This interest has been fueled, at least in part, by accumulating evidence that trust has a number of important benefits for organizations and their members. A primary aim of this review is to assess the state of this rapidly growing literature. The review examines recent progress in conceptualizing trust and distrust in organizational theory, and also summarizes evidence regarding the myriad benefits of trust within organizational systems. The review also describes different forms of trust found in organizations, and the antecedent conditions that produce them. Although the benefits of trust are well-documented, creating and sustaining trust is often difficult. Accordingly, the chapter concludes by examining some of the psychological, social, and institutional barriers to the production of trust."
