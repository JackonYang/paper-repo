While the form of the algorithm varies with its application, certain linguistic problems are common to any stemming procedure. As a basis for evaluation of previous attempts to deal with these problems, this paper first discusses the theoretical and practical attributes of stemming algorithms. Then a new version of a context-sensitive, longest-match stemming algorithm for English is proposed; though developed for use in a library information transfer system, it is of general application. A major linguistic problem in stemming, variation in spelling of stems, is discussed in some detail and several feasible programmed solutions are outlined, along with sample results of one of these methods."

Methods originally developed in the SMART project are used for abstract analysis: stemming algorithm, cosine function for query\u2010document comparisons, ranked output, and clustered document collection. Searches are entered and performed on\u2010line, with output consisting of document abstracts ranked in decreasing order of similarity with the query. Additional facilities include off\u2010line searches, SDI, and display of data base statistics. Future plans and improvements are also discussed."
