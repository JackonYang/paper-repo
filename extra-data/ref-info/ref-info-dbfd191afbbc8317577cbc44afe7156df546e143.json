Syntactically valid cooccurences including a new word W are detected by a high-coverage morphosyntactic analyzer. Syntactic relations are interpreted e.g. replaced by case relations, using a a catalogue of patterns/interpretation pairs, a concept type hierarchy, and a set of selectional restriction rules on semantic interpretation types."

The algorithm checks the context surrounding the target noun against that of previously observed instances and chooses the sense for which the most evidence is found, where evidence consists of a set of orthographic, syntactic, and lexical features. Because the sense distinctions made are coarse, the disambiguation can be accomplished without the expense of knowledge bases or inference mechanisms. An implementation of the algorithm is described which, starting with a small set of hand-labeled instances, improves its results automatically via unsupervised training. The approach is compared to other attempts at homograph disambiguation using both machine readable dictionaries and unrestricted text and the use of training instances is determined to be a crucial di erence."

The long term issue is that the understander must incorporate new words into its lexicon for future use. This paper describes an approach to constructing new lexical entries in a gradual process by analyzing a sequence of example texts. This approach permits the graceful tolerance of new words while enabling the automated extension of the lexicon. Each new acquired lexeme starts as a set of assumptions derived from the analysis of each word in a textual context. A variety of knowledge sources, including morphological, syntactic, semantic, and contextual knowledge, determine the assumptions. These assumptions, along with justifications and dependencies, are interpreted and refined by a learning program that ultimately updates the system's lexicon. This approach uses existing linguistic knowledge, and generalization of multiple occurrences, to create new operational lexical entries."

                "text": "The creation and development of a large Lexical Database (LDB) which, until now, mainly reuses the data found in standard Machine Readable Dictionaries, has been going on in Pisa for a number of years (see Calzolari 1984, 1988, Calzolari, Picchi 1988). We are well aware that, in order to build a more powel-ful I.DB (or even a Le.'dcal Knowledge Base) to be used in different ComputationM l.inguistics (CL) applications, types of information other than those usually found in machine readable dictionaries are urgently needed. Different sources of information must therefore be exploited if we wemt to overcome the 'qchcal bottleneck ~\" of Natural l..anguage Processing ( N I P ) . In a trend which is becoming increasingly relevant both m c1 proper and in Literao\" and Iinguistic Computing, we feel that very interesting data ibr our LI)Bs c:m be found b.v processing large textuM corpora, where the actual usage of the language can be truly investigated. Many research projects are nowadays collecting large amounts of textuM data, thus providing more and more material to be analyzed for descriptions based on measurable evidence of how language is actually used. We uhhnately aim at integrating lexical data extracted from the an',dysis of large textual corpora into the I,DB we are implementing. These data refer, typically, to: i) complementation relations introduced by prepositions (e.g. dividere subcategorizes for a PP headed by the preposition in ha one sense, and by the preposition fra in another sense); ii) lexically conditioned modification relations (tena macchina potente , un farmaco potente and not /brte , while un cajfe\" forte , una moneta forte and not potente ); iii) lefically significant collocations (premiere ut~a decisione and not fare z~na decisione , prestare attenzione and not dare ); iv) fixed phrases and idioms I (donna itz carriera, dottorato di ricerca, a propo~ito di); v) compounds ( tarola calda, ~ave scuo/a). All these types of data are a major issue of practical relevance, and particularly problematic, in many N I P applications in different areas. They should therefore be dvcn very lm'ge coverage in any useful LDB, and, moreover, should also be annotated, in a computerk,'ed lexicon, for the pe~inent t)equency information obtained fiom the processed corpus, and obviously updated fl\"om time to time. As a matter of fact, dictionaries now tend to encode all the theoreticcd possibilities on a same level, but \"if e ; 'e~ possibility in the diction:m, must be given equal weight, parsing is very diificult\" (Church 1988, p.3): they should provide infornaation on what is more likely to occur, e.g. relative likelihood of alternate pm-ts of speech for a word or of ahernate word-senses, both out of context and it\" possible taking into account contextu~d factors. Statistical anMyses of linguistic data were very popular in the \"50s and '60s, mainly, even though not only, for literary types of analyses and for studies on the lexicon (Guiraud 1959, Muller 1964, Moskovich 1977). Stochastic approaches to linguistic analyses have been strongly reevaluated in the past few years, either for syntactic analysis (Gm'side et al. 1987, Church 1988), or for NLP applications (Brown et al. 1988), or for semantic analysis (Zemik 1989, Smadja 1989). Quantitative (not statistical) evidence on e.g. word-sense occurrences in a large corpus have been taken into account for lexicographic descriptions (Cobuild 1%7)."

Five subcategorization frames are currently detected and we foresee no impediment to detecting many more. Ultimately, we expect to provide a large subcategorization dictionary to the NLP community and to train dictionaries for specific corpora."

They can involve two, three or more words, these words can be of different syntactic categories and they can be involved in more or less rigid ways. This leads to two main difficulties: collocational knowledge has to be acquired and it must be represented flexibly so that it can be used for language generation. We address both problems in this paper, focusing on the acquisition problem. We describe a program, Xtract, that automatically acquires a range of collocations from large textual corpora and we describe how they can be represented in a flexible lexicon using a unification based formalism."

These lexical chains are a direct result of units of text being \"about the same thing,\" and finding text structure involves finding units of text that are about the same thing. Hence, computing the chains is useful, since they will have a correspondence to the structure of the text. Determining the structure of text is an essential step in determining the deep meaning of the text. In this paper, a thesaurus is used as the major knowledge base for computing lexical chains. Correspondences between lexical chains and structural elements are shown to exist. Since the lexical chains are computable, and exist in non-domain-specific text, they provide a valuable indicator of text structure. The lexical chains also provide a semantic context for interpreting words, concepts, and sentences."

An experimental system embodying this mechanism has been implemented for processing definitions from the Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English. A property of this dictionary, exploited by the system, is that it uses a restricted vocabulary in its word sense definitions. The structures generated by the experimental system are intended to be used for the classification of new word senses in terms of the senses of words in the restricted vocabulary. Examples illustrating the output generated are presented, and some qualitative performance results and problems that were encountered are discussed. The analysis process applies successively more specific phrasal analysis rules as determined by a hierarchy of patterns in which less specific patterns dominate more specific ones. This ensures that reasonable incomplete analyses of the definitions are produced when more complete analyses are not possible, resulting in a relatively robust analysis mechanism. Thus the work reported addresses two robustness problems faced by current experimental natural language processing systems: coping with an incomplete lexicon and with incomplete knowledge of phrasal constructions."

                "text": "This report describes an investigation of the workings of expository technical texts with the goal of being able to automatically acquire and use some of the knowledge that they contain. The motivating question is: How does the presentation of material in college-level physics textbooks make it possible to solve problems based on that material? \nMy hypothesis is that a lot of what is needed to solve problems is encoded fairly straightforwardly in the linguistic structure of the presentation text. Presentation passages often begin by describing a scene or telling a simple story. The physics is then introduced as a commentary on the described scene or story, perhaps by deriving an equation relating quantities in the story, or by introducing a physical phenomenon that occurs in the situations described. Problems are also presented as simple stories, and solving a problem requires locating in the presentation text a description of a situation that subsumes the one in the problem so that the associated equations can be applied. \nA program, called \"Sagredo,\" was written to illustrate these ideas. Sagredo can read a passage of text describing elementary kinematics and can solve problems based on that material. As the program processes the source text, it interprets a set of definitions and rules in a unification-grammar based logic programming formalism, and constructs a representation of the occurrences described by the text. When it encounters passages that present new material, the program records definitions and rules that it can later instantiate when it reads and solves problems. \nOne result of my reading lots of physics books was the realization that textbooks do much more than just list the laws of physics or show how to solve problems. Especially in the earlier chapters, where the fundamental principles and methods are treated, physics textbooks often resort more to rhetorical persuasion than to the sort of logical presentation that a program can easily follow. A complete account of the workings of expository technical texts must attend to wider roles that such texts play in the creation and maintenance of their communities of practice.

Verbs are detected by a novel technique based on the Case Filter of Rouvret and Vergnaud (1980). The completeness of the output list increases monotonically with the total number of occurrences of each verb in the corpus. False positive rates are one to three percent of observations. Five SFs are currently detected and more are planned. Ultimately, I expect to provide a large SF dictionary to the NLP community and to train dictionaries for specific corpora."
