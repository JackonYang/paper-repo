Therefore, implicit in the perceptual analysis of occluding contour must lie various assumptions about the viewed surfaces. The assumptions that seem most natural are (a) that the distinction between convex and concave segments reflects real properties of the viewed surface; and (b) that contiguous portions of contour arise from contiguous parts of the viewed surface \u2013 i. e. there are no invisible obscuring edges. It is proved that, for smooth surfaces, these assumptions are essentially equivalent to assuming that the viewed surface is a generalized cone. Methods are defined for finding the axis of such a cone, and for segmenting a surface constructed of several cones into its components, whose axes can then be found separately. These methods provide one link between an uninterpreted figure extracted from an image, and the 3-D representation theory of Marr & Nishihara (1977)."

The aim of this study is to determine valid constraints that are sufficient to allow surface orientation and distance (up to a multiplicative constant) to be computed from the image of surface texture and of surface contours. The report is in three parts. Part I consists of a review of major theories of surface perception, a discussion of vision as computation and of the nature in which three-dimensional information is manifest in the image, and a study of the representation of local surface orientation. Part II reconisiders the familiar 'texture gradient'. Part III examines our preception of surface contours. It is shown that surface contours are strong sources of information about local surface shape."

Descriptions of texture are formalized from natural language descriptions; local descriptors are obtained from the directional and nondirectional components of the Fourier transform power spectrum. Analytic expressions are obtained for orientation, contrast, size, spacing, and in periodic cases, the locations of the choice of sizes is made by a simple higher-level program. The process of region growing is represented by a sheaf-theoretical model which formalizes the operation of pasting local structure (over a window) into global structure (over a region). Programs were implemented which form regions of similar color and similar texture with respect to the local descriptors."

The notion of completely empty space is asserted to be irrelevant for the theory of space-perception. The perception of space between objects, in this theory, depends on the experience of contours against a general background, and on the impression of one surface behind another. The fundamental 'sensations' of space are assumed to be the impressions of surface and edge. If the theory is valid, there should be discoverable variables in stimulation for the essential properties or qualities of a surface, and these should prove to be the effective stimuli for space-perception. What is called for is a listing of the properties or qualities-a phenomenological study-and a search for the corresponding stimulus variables-a program of psychophysical experiments."

                "text": "A theory of edge detection is presented. The analysis proceeds in two parts. (1) Intensity changes, which occur in a natural image over a wide range of scales, are detected separately at different scales. An appropriate filter for this purpose at a given scale is found to be the second derivative of a Gaussian, and it is shown that, provided some simple conditions are satisfied, these primary filters need not be orientation-dependent. Thus, intensity changes at a given scale are best detected by finding the zero values of \u22072G(x, y)* I(x, y) for image I, where G(x, y) is a two-dimensional Gaussian distribution and \u22072 is the Laplacian. The intensity changes thus discovered in each of the channels are then represented by oriented primitives called zero-crossing segments, and evidence is given that this representation is complete. (2) Intensity changes in images arise from surface discontinuities or from reflectance or illumination boundaries, and these all have the property that they are spatially localized. Because of this, the zero-crossing segments from the different channels are not independent, and rules are deduced for combining them into a description of the image. This description is called the raw primal sketch. The theory explains several basic psychophysical findings, and the operation of forming oriented zero-crossing segments from the output of centre-surround \u22072G filters acting on the image forms the basis for a physiological model of simple cells (see Marr & Ullman 1979)."

The algorithm consists of five steps: (1) Each image is filtered at different orientations with bar masks of four sizes that increase with eccentricity; the equivalent filters are one or two octaves wide. (2) Zero-crossings in the filtered images, which roughly correspond to edges, are localized. Positions of the ends of lines and edges are also found. (3) For each mask orientation and size, matching takes place between pairs of zero-crossings or terminations of the same sign in the two images, for a range of disparities up to about the width of the mask\u2019s central region. (4) Wide masks can control vergence movements, thus causing small masks to come into correspondence. (5) When a correspondence is achieved, it is stored in a dynamic buffer, called the 2\u00bd-D sketch. It is shown that this proposal provides a theoretical framework for most existing psychophysical and neurophysiological data about stereopsis. Several critical experimental predictions are also made, for instance about the size of Panum\u2019s area under various conditions. The results of such experiments would tell us whether, for example, co-operativity is necessary for the matching process."

It is shown here that the optic array does specify distance, and that the limitations of visual information are precisely defined in the theory. Visual information alone is insufficient when judgments in arbitrary metric units are required. The limitation of the theory is not in the specification of potential and effective information, but in the description of the observer\u2019s response to that information."
