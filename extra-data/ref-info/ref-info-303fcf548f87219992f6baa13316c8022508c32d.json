Typical of these are the supply-demand theorem due to Gale (4), which states a condition for the existence of a flow satisfying demands at certain nodes from supplies at other nodes, and the Hoffman circulation theorem (received by the present author in private communication), which states a condition for the existence of a circulatory flow in a network in which each arc has associated with it not only an upper bound for the arc flow, but a lower bound as well. If the constraints on flows are integral (for example, if the bounds on arc flows for the circulation theorem are integers), it is also true that integral flows meeting the requirements exist provided any flow does so."

The problem arises naturally in the study of transportation networks; it may be stated in the following way. One is given a network of directed arcs and nodes with two distinguished nodes, called source and sink, respectively. All other nodes are called intermediate. Each directed arc in the network has associated with it a nonnegative integer, its flow capacity. Source arcs may be assumed to be directed away from the source, sink arcs into the sink. Subject to the conditions that the flow in an arc is in the direction of the arc and does not exceed its capacity, and that the total flow into any intermediate node is equal to the flow out of it, it is desired to find a maximal flow from source to sink in the network, i.e., a flow which maximizes the sum of the flows in source (or sink) arcs. Thus, if we let P 1 be the source, P n the sink, we are required to find x ij (i,j =1, . . . , w) which maximize"

The models and algorithms introduced in Flows in Networks are used widely today in the fields of transportation systems, manufacturing, inventory planning, image processing, and Internet traffic. The techniques presented by Ford and Fulkerson spurred the development of powerful computational tools for solving and analyzing network flow models, and also furthered the understanding of linear programming. In addition, the book helped illuminate and unify results in combinatorial mathematics while emphasizing proofs based on computationally efficient construction. Flows in Networks is rich with insights that remain relevant to current research in engineering, management, and other sciences. This landmark work belongs on the bookshelf of every researcher working with networks."
