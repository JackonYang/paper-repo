                "text": "1. All complex cells in the cat's striate cortex exhibit gross non\u2010linearities of spatial summation when tested with sinusoidal grating stimuli. Their responses to moving gratings of all but the lowest spatial frequencies are usually dominated by a component that is not modulated by the passage of the bars of the grating across the receptive field. They give responses to temporally modulated stationary gratings that consist mostly of even harmonics of the stimulus frequency and that vary little in amplitude or wave form as the spatial phase of the grating is varied. 2. We compared complex cells' receptive fields with their sensitivity to sinusoidal gratings of different spatial frequencies. Qualitatively, the receptive fields are usually two to five times wider than the bars of the gratings that stimulate them most effectively. Quantitatively, the receptive field profiles of complex cells are invariably broader than those predicted by Fourier synthesis of their spatial frequency tuning curves, and in particular lack predicted spatially antagonistic regions. 3. We further examined the receptive field organization of these cells, using pairs of stationary lines flashed synchronously on their receptive fields. If both lines are of the same polarity (bright or dark), complex cells respond to the paired stimulus much less well than they do to either of its component bars, unless the bars are separated by less than about one quarter of the width of the receptive field. If the lines are of opposite polarity, one bright and one dark, the opposite situation obtains: closely spaced bars elicit small responses, while paired bars of larger separation are much more effective. In either case, the results are independent in general character of the absolute positions of the stimuli within the receptive field; rather, they depend in a manner characteristic of each cell on the relative positions of the two bars. 4. The two\u2010line interaction profile that plots the change in a complex cell's response to one bar as a function of the position of a second added bar corresponds closely to the receptive field profile predicted from Fourier synthesis of the cell's spatial frequency tuning curve. These profiles may thus reveal the spatial characteristics of subunits within complex cell\u2010receptive fields. We examined the nature of the interaction between these subunits by performing several two\u2010line interaction experiments in which the onset of the second bar was delayed some time after the onset of the first. The results suggest that neighbouring subunits interact in a facilitatory fashion: for an interval after the presentation of one bar, responses to neighbouring bars are enhanced. 5. The subunits of a complex receptive field may, by their spatial properties, determine the spatial selectivities of complex cells, while the nature of the interaction among the subunits may determine these cells' sensitivity and selectivity for moving visual stimuli..."

                "text": "1. We have examined the spatial and temporal tuning properties of 238 cortical neurones, recorded using conventional techniques from acutely prepared anaesthetized cats. We determined spatial and temporal frequency tuning curves using sinusoidal grating stimuli presented to each neurone's receptive field by a digital computer on a cathode ray tube. 2. We measured tuning curves either by determining response amplitude as a function of spatial or temporal frequency, or by measuring contrast sensitivity (the inverse of the contrast of the grating that just elicited a detectable response). The two measures give very similar tuning curves in all cases. 3. We recorded from 184 neurones in area 17; of these 156 had receptive fields within 5 degrees of the area centralis. The range of preferred spatial frequency for these neurones was 0.3\u2010\u20103 c/deg, and their spatial frequency tuning band widths varied from 0.7 to 3.2 octaves at half\u2010amplitude. The most common band width was roughly 1.3 octaves. Simple and complex cells in area 17 did not differ in their distributions of preferred spatial frequency, although complex cells were, on average, slightly less selective for spatial frequency than simple cells. 4. We recorded from fifty\u2010four neurones from area 18, and performed several experiments in which we recorded from corresponding portions of both area 17 and area 18 in the same electrode penetration. Neurones in area 18 preferred spatial frequencies that were, on average, one third as high as those preferred by area 17 neurones at the same retinal eccentricity. Thus the range of preferred spatial frequency in area eighteen cells having receptive fields within 5 deg of the area centralis was between less than 0.1 and 0.5 c/deg. The distributions of optimum spatial frequency in the two areas were practically non\u2010overlapping at eccentricities as high as 15 deg, the greatest eccentricity we examined. Neurones in area 18 were about as selective for spatial frequency as were neurones in area 17. 5. We determined temporal frequency tuning characteristics for some neurones from each area, using gratings that moved steadily across the screen. Neurones from area 17 all responded well to low temporal frequencies, and less well to higher frequencies (in excess of, usually, 2 or 4 Hz). In contrast, neurones recorded from area 18 sometimes had similar tuning properties, but more commonly showed a pronounced reduction in response as the temporal frequency was moved either above or below some optimum value (usually 2\u2010\u20108 Hz). 6. We conclude from these results that areas 17 and 18 act in parallel to process different aspects of the visual information relayed from the retina via the lateral geniculate complex. Some or all of the differences between the areas may be attributable to the predominance of Y cell input to area 18 and the predominance of X cell input to area 17..."

Their initial reports, however, established that cells in Area 17 of cat (and also monkey) were quite unresponsive to full-field illumination, requiring more specific patterns to elicit a response. Their receptive field (RF) maps of simple cells showed an elongated excitatory center and inhibitory flanks, or vice versa; or two adjacent excitatory and inhibitory areas. Initially HUBEL and WIESEL (2) reported that there was summation within the excitatory and inhibitory regions and an antagonism between them. As we shall see, such summation, if true, would have implications not at all foreseen at the time, and would lead one, in fact, to a quite different model of what such cells do from the one which they actually proposed."

Recordings were taken from optic tract fibres of anaesthetized, paralysed cats. 2. When an alternating phase sine wave grating was used as a stimulus, X cells had null positions and Y cells responded at all positions of the grating. 3. These results did not depend on the temporal wave form or the temporal frequency of pattern alternation over a wide range. 4. At high spatial frequencies for the particular cell, a Y cell gave abig 'on\u2010off' response, or frequency doubling, at all positions of the grating, while an X cell did not. 5. The use of contrast sensitivity versus spatial phase also served to differentiate the two cell types. With an alternating sine grating stimulus X cells had a sinusoidal dependence on spatial phase, while each Y cell's sensitivity depended in a complicated manner on spatial phase. 6. Sensitivity versus spatial phase for different Fourier components of the neural response also separated the two classes of cells. Significant second harmonic distortion was present in Y cells. The second harmonic component was spatial phase insensitive, and became dominant at high spatial frequencies. 7. The maximum of the 2nd/1st harmonic ratio was taken as an index of nonlinearity. X cells always had a nonlinearity index less than 1 while in Y cells this index always exceeded 1. 8. Response to spots, diffuse light and drifting gratings were compared to the nonlinearity index as a basis for classifying cells. The nonlinearity index was most reliable because it was least dependent on retinal eccentricity."

Using a relatively simple set of geometric test stimuli and classification criteria, they were able to divide striate neurones into two groups, simple and complex. Simple cells have receptive fields that are, like those of neurones in the retina and lateral geniculate nucleus, divided into distinct excitatory and inhibitory regions. Tested qualitatively, simple cells behave as though there is spatial summation within each of these regions, and antagonism between regions of opposite sense. Thus the response elicited by a light presented in an 'on' region increases as the size or intensity of the test pattern increases, and is attenuated or eliminated when the pattern invades an 'off' region. Complex cells, on the other hand, do not usually have distinct regions in their large receptive fields; rather, this field appears more or less uniform, and commonly gives 'on-off' responses to stimuli presented anywhere within it. While the geometry of the optimal spatial stimulus for a simple cell can be predicted from the arrangement of receptive field regions, the optimal stimulus for a complex cell cannot be predicted in this way. The best simply shaped stimulus for a simple cell is one that roughly fills the most sensitive region of its receptive field, while that for a complex cell is usually smaller than the receptive field, or any directly definable receptive field subregion. Simple cells may therefore sum inputs from all parts of their receptive fields in a linear manner, while complex cells cannot act in this way. Since 1962, many workers have studied the stimulus-selectivity of visual cortical neurones, but there has been no quantitative examination of the basis of Hubel & Wiesel's classification: spatial summation. This property has, however, been extensively studied in more peripheral visual neurones, and a particularly elegant set of tests of spatial summation was devised and used by Enroth-Cugell & Robson (1966) in their study of cat retinal ganglion cells."

Rmin will equal zero, and the ellipse become a straight line through the origin, when any of A, B, XI, and T equal zero. There will then exist two values of 0, 1800 apart, at which no response is elicited, and the temporal phase of the response will be independent of 5 save that it will shift by 1800 when the value of 0 passes through one of the nulls. If, however, all four variables are non-zero, a response will be obtained at all values of 5S, and the temporal phase of the response will vary continuously with 0.

The transformation of external objects into neural images is accomplished by the summation of excitatory and inhibitory influences over the visual field of each neurone. Distortion occurs when the neural response is not simply proportional to the sum of excitation and inhibition because of nonlinear mechanisms in spatial summation. If the responses of all visual cells were distorted by such nonlinear summation, fine visual discriminations like those necessary for reading Nature would be impossible. Nonlinear mechanisms do however, seem to be important in one class of visual neurone, perhaps for signalling change or motion in the external world. We have attempted to understand the importance of the different kinds of spatial summation by studying single cells in the cat visual system."

Spatial frequency contrast sensitivity functions for the fundamental and second harmonic responses of Y cells to alternating phase gratings were determined. 3. The fundamental spatial frequency response was predicted by the Fourier transform of the sensitivity profile of the Y cell. The high spatial frequency cut\u2010off of a Y cell's fundamental response was in this way related to the centre of the cell's receptive field. 4. The second harmonic response of a Y cell did not cut off at such a low spatial frequency as the fundamental response. This result indicated that the source of the second harmonic was a spatial subunit of the receptive field smaller in spatial extent than the centre. 5. Contrast sensitivity vs. spatial phase for a Y cell was measured under three conditions: a full grating, a grating seen through a centrally located window, a grating partially obscured by a visual shutter. The 2nd/1st harmonic sensitivity ratio went down with the window and up with the shutter. These results implied that the centre of Y cells was linear and also that the nonlinear subunits extended into the receptive field surround. 6. Spatial localization of the nonlinear subunits was determined by means of a spatial dipole stimulus. The nonlinear subunits overlapped the centre and surround of the receptive field and extended beyond both. 7. The nature of the Y cell nonlinearity was found to be rectification, as determined from measurements of the second harmonic response as a function of contrast. 8. Spatial models for the Y cell receptive field are proposed."

It would be astonishing if such a structure did not profoundly modify the response patterns of fibres coming into it. In the cat's visual cortex, the receptive field arrangements of single cells suggest that there is indeed a degree of complexity far exceeding anything yet seen at lower levels in the visual system. In a previous paper we described receptive fields of single cortical cells, observing responses to spots of light shone on one or both retinas (Hubel & Wiesel, 1959). In the present work this method is used to examine receptive fields of a more complex type (Part I) and to make additional observations on binocular interaction (Part II). This approach is necessary in order to understand the behaviour of individual cells, but it fails to deal with the problem of the relationship of one cell to its neighbours. In the past, the technique of recording evoked slow waves has been used with great success in studies of functional anatomy. It was employed by Talbot & Marshall (1941) and by Thompson, Woolsey & Talbot (1950) for mapping out the visual cortex in the rabbit, cat, and monkey. Daniel & Whitteiidge (1959) have recently extended this work in the primate. Most of our present knowledge of retinotopic projections, binocular overlap, and the second visual area is based on these investigations. Yet the method of evoked potentials is valuable mainly for detecting behaviour common to large populations of neighbouring cells; it cannot differentiate functionally between areas of cortex smaller than about 1 mm2. To overcome this difficulty a method has in recent years been developed for studying cells separately or in small groups during long micro-electrode penetrations through nervous tissue. Responses are correlated with cell location by reconstructing the electrode tracks from histological material. These techniques have been applied to"

The activity of neurones of the visual cortex (area 17) has been recorded in anaesthetized cats in response to gratings of different profile and to single light and dark bars. 2. At very low spatial frequencies, outside the frequency response range to sinusoidal gratings, the response to square\u2010wave drifting gratings is obtainable from a combination of the response to the single bars of the grating presented in isolation. At higher spatial frequencies this is no longer true. 3. At very low spatial frequencies the responses to square\u2010wave gratings and to missing\u2010fundamental gratings (obtained by subtraction from the square\u2010wave grating of its fundamental gratings (obtained by subtraction from the square\u2010wave grating of its fundamental harmonic) are very similar. 4. At spatial frequencies near the peak of the spatial frequency tuning curve of the cell, the responses to square\u2010wave grating and to sinusoidal gratings are very similar. At these spatial frequencies the response to the missing\u2010fundamental grating is practically zero. 5. At spatial frequencies lower than that of best sensitivity for the cell, the response to square\u2010wave gratings is correlated with the 1st and 3rd harmonic of the stimulus. 6. We conclude that at very low spatial frequencies of the grating the response of cortical cells is correlated with the light or dark edges (or light or dark bars) of the stimulus, because the edges contain high frequencies within the range of sensitivity of the cells. At higher spatial frequencies the results are interpreted best by assuming that cortical cells respond to the harmonics of the visual periodic stimulus. 7. When a background of dynamic visual noise is added to increase the spontaneous discharge of simple cells, their response to visual stimuli becomes linear or quasi\u2010linear. The stimuli could be either single bars or gratings."

Responses to stimuli moving at different velocities were examined. 2. Peak evoked firing frequency, rather than fotal evoked spikes, is used throughout as a measure of response. The former mea\u2010ure gives curves of response vs. velocity that correlate well with curves of contrast sensitivity vs. velocity, wheras the latter does not. 3. Cortical receptive fields were classified according to the criteria of Hubel & Wiesel. Simple cells were found to prefer lower velocities (mean 2\u20102 deg sec\u20101) than complex cells (mean 18\u20138 deg sec\u20101). The response of simple cells to stimuli moving faster than 20 deg sec\u20101 is generally poor; complex cells usually discharge briskly to these speeds. 4. Cells classified as hypercomplex by the end\u2010inhibition criterion were further chara\u2010terized as type I or type II, according to the suggestion of Dreher (1972). Type I units are indistinguishable from simple cells in their velocity tuning, and type II units equally clearly resemble complex cells. These results are therefor consistent with Dreher's sbudivision. 5. Teh selectivity of cells for velocity is variable but can be quite marked. The average selectivities of simple and complex cells are not significantly different. There is an inverse correlation between preferred velocity and the sharpness of velocity selectivity for simple cells; no trend is apparent for other cell types. 6. No clear correlation is observed between the velocity preferances of units and their degree of direction selectivity, or receptive field arrangement. Simple cells with \u2018sustainef\u2019 temporal responses to flashed stimuli tend to prefer slower rates of movement than \u2018transient\u2019 ones, and to be less selective for velocity. 7. The results for different cortical cell\u2010types are compared with the velocity tuning of X\u2010 and Y\u2010cells in the lateral geniculate nucleus."

                "text": "1. Subregions in the receptive fields of hypercomplex cells have been examined by a variety of quantitative methods with particular reference to the dimensions and properties of the end-zone inhibitory areas. These data have made it possible to construct detailed maps of the receptive-field organization of the two types of hypercomplex cell (I and II). 2. The spatial extent of the end-zone inhibitory area is much greater than that responsible for discharge-region excitation. End-zone inhibition is, however, position dependent, the part of the area causing maximal inhibition lying precisely along the line of the most responsive part of the discharge region and just beyond its lateral border. Spatial summation of end-zone inhibition takes place along the line of its optimal stimulus orientation. 3. Some simple and complex cells may have hypercomplex-type length-response curves in the nonpreferred direction of stimulus movement and vice versa for some hypercomplex cells. Whether these response patterns are due to the presence of directionselective end-zone inhibition or not remains to be determined. While end-zone inhibition may be direction selective, it appears that it is usually nondirectional. Even when discharge region excitation is itself completely direction selective, the end-zone inhibition may be equally effective in both directions. Hence end-zone inhibition appears to be independent of the mechanism responsible for the direction selectivity of the discharge region. 4. End-zone inhibition is stimulus orientation dependent, being maximal when the orientation is the same as the orientation that is optimal for the discharge region. When the stimulus is rotated away from the optimal, the strength of the inhibition progressively declines, falling to zero at 90\u2019 to the optimal. This property distinguishes end-zone inhibition from side band inhibition since the latter is not orientation sensitive. 5. There may be considerable, or even total, spatial overlap between dischargeregion excitation and end-zone inhibition, the spatial summation required for excitation being much less that that required to produce an inhibitory effect. The onset of inhibition in the length-response curve indicates that the effects of the spatial summation of inhibition now exceeds those of dischargeregion excitation."

                "text": "1. These experiments have investigated the contribution made by GABA\u2010mediated inhibitory processes to the orientation tuning of complex cells in the cat's striate cortex. The GABA antagonist bicuculline has been ionophoretically applied to individual complex cells and the modifications produced in their orientation tuning documented. 2. In terms of the type of change produced in orientation tuning by the application of bicuculline, it seems that there are two categories of complex cells. 3. In one of these categories the orientation selectivity was eliminated during bicuculline application. The excitatory input to these cells would therefore appear to be non\u2010orientation specific. Their orientation selectivity is presumably generated by a GABA\u2010mediated inhibitory input. 4. In the other category of complex cells, although the orientation selectivity was decreased during bicuculline application, the cells retained a preference for a range of orientations that was generally centred around the original optimal orientation. It is suggested that for these cells the inhibitory input enhances the orientation tuning of an excitatory input that is already broadly orientation tuned. 5. Comparison of normal orientation tuning curves with those observed during the application of bicuculline provides a basis for estimating the orientation tuning of the GABA\u2010mediated inhibitory input. In all cases, it is clear that at normal resting discharge levels, orientations either side of the optimal, and not those centred on the optimal, generate the most powerful inhibitory input. 6. These results would seem to be best explained by inhibitory interconnexions between cortical columns sensitive to different orientations. This type of lateral interaction between columns may serve to enhance the contrast in the orientation domain for the cortical representation of a specific stimulus orientation. 7. Increasing the resting discharge level of a complex cell, without blocking the action of GABA appeared to increase the gain of the inhibitory mechanisms acting on the cell. The normal excitatory responses to optimal or near optimal orientations were greatly reduced, or replaced by inhibitory responses, and non\u2010optimal orientations produced only inhibitory responses. These inhibitory effects were blocked on the context of other observations in the literature. It is tentatively suggested that the interneurones providing the inhibitory drive to complex cells receive an input from recurrent collaterals of the recipient complex cells. Their other inputs would derive from neighbouring colums and from the afferent input to the parent column. The inputs from neighbouring columns would mediate the lateral inhibitory interactions in the orientation domain, and the recurrent collateral feed\u2010back the decreased responsiveness at high resting discharge levels."

                "text": "1. Twenty\u2010three kittens were monocularly deprived of vision until the age of 4, 5, 6 or 7 weeks. Their deprived eyes were then opened, and their experienced eyes shut for a further 3\u201063 days. After this time physiological recordings were made in the visual cortex, area 17. Three control kittens, monocularly deprived for various periods, showed that at the time of reverse\u2010suturing, few neurones could be influenced at all from the deprived eye. 2. Following reverse\u2010suturing, the initially deprived eye regained control of cortical neurones. This switch of cortical ocular dominance was most rapid following reverse\u2010suturing at the age of 4 weeks. Delaying the age of reverse\u2010suturing reduced the rate and then the extent of the cortical ocular dominance changes. 3. The cortex of reverse\u2010sutured kittens is divided into regions of cells dominated by one eye or the other. The relative sizes of these ocular dominance columns changed during reversed deprivation. The columns devoted to the initially deprived eye were very small in animals reverse\u2010sutured for brief periods, but in animals that underwent longer periods of reversed deprivation, the columns driven by that eye were larger, while those devoted to the initially open eye were smaller. 4. Clear progressions of orientation columns across the cortex were apparent in many of the kittens, but, in contrast to the situation in normal or strabismic kittens, these sequences were disrupted at the borders of eye dominance columns: the cortical representations of orientation and ocular dominance were not independent. 5. Binocular units in these kittens were rather rare, but those that could be found often had dissimilar receptive field properties in the two eyes. Commonly, a cell would have a normal orientation selective receptive field in one eye, and an immature, unselective receptive field in the other. Cells that had orientation selective receptive fields in both eyes often had greatly differing orientation preferences in the two eyes, occasionally by nearly 90 degrees. 6. During the reversal of deprivation effects, the proportion of receptive fields exhibiting mature properties declined in the initially experienced eye, while the proportion increased in the initially deprived eye. Similarly, the average band width of orientation tuning of receptive fields in the initially deprived eye decreased, while that of receptive fields in the initially experienced eye increased. 7. One kitten was reverse\u2010sutured twice, to demonstrate that cortical ocular dominance may be reversed a second time, even after one reversal of ocular dominance. 8. It is suggested that the sensitive period for cortical binocular development consists of two phases. In the first phase, all cortical neurones may be modified by experience, but the rate at which they may be modified decreases with age. In the second phase, an increasing number of cortical neurones becomes fixed in their properties, while those that remain modifiable are as modifiable as they were at the end of the first phase. 9..."

The effective image area, which is the convolution of the object area with the sampling area of the visual system, is determined from its Fourier spectrum. The constants of the transfer functions are established from the optical constants of the eye, its storage-time function, and the maximum transfer ratio of statistical units of the rod and cone systems. There is little room for variation of constants, if they are to remain in agreement with observed values."
