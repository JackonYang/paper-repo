The method of characteristics can be used to do this, but it suffers from a number of theoretical difficulties and implementation problems. This thesis presents an iterative relaxation algorithm for solving this equation on a grid of points. Here, repeated local computations eventually lead to a global solution. The algorithm solves for the surface orientation at each point by employing an iterative relaxation scheme. The constraint of surface smoothness is achieved while simultaneously satisfying the constraints imposed by the equation of image illumination. The algorithm has the distinct advantage of being capable of handling any reflectance function whether analytically or empirically specified. Included are brief overviews of some of the more important shape-from-shading algorithms in existence and a list of potential applications of this iterative approach to several image domains including scanning electron microscopy, remote sensing of topography and industrial inspection.

This method is complementary to the use of stereoscopy which relies on matching up sharp detail and will fail on smooth objects. Until now the image processing of single views has been restricted to objects which can meaningfully be considered two-dimensional or bounded by plane surfaces. It is possible to derive a first-order non-linear partial differential equation in two unknowns relating the intensity at the image points to the shape of the object. This equation can be solved by means of an equivalent set of five ordinary differential equations. A curve traced out by solving this set of equations for one set of starting values is called a characteristic strip. Starting one of these strips from each point on some initial curve will produce the whole solution surface. The initial curves can usually be constructed around so-called singular points. A number of applications of this method will be discussed including one to lunar topography and one to the scanning electron microscope. In both of these cases great simplifications occur in the equations. A note on polyhedra follows and a quantitative theory of facial make-up is touched upon. An implementation of some of these ideas on the PDP-6 computer with its attached image-dissector camera at the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory will be described, and also a nose-recognition program."

Therefore, implicit in the perceptual analysis of occluding contour must lie various assumptions about the viewed surfaces. The assumptions that seem most natural are (a) that the distinction between convex and concave segments reflects real properties of the viewed surface; and (b) that contiguous portions of contour arise from contiguous parts of the viewed surface \u2013 i. e. there are no invisible obscuring edges. It is proved that, for smooth surfaces, these assumptions are essentially equivalent to assuming that the viewed surface is a generalized cone. Methods are defined for finding the axis of such a cone, and for segmenting a surface constructed of several cones into its components, whose axes can then be found separately. These methods provide one link between an uninterpreted figure extracted from an image, and the 3-D representation theory of Marr & Nishihara (1977)."

The image Hessian matrix is introduced as a convenient viewer-centered representation of surface curvature. Properties of surface curvature are expressed as properties of the Hessian matrix. For several classes of surfaces, image analysis simplifies. This result has already been established for planar surfaces. Similar simplification is demonstrated for singly curved surfaces and for the subclass of doubly curved surfaces known as generalized cones.

The technique is photometric because it uses the radiance values recorded at a single image location, in successive views, rather than the relative positions of displaced features. Photometric stereo is used in computer-based image understanding. It can be applied in two ways. First, it is a general technique for deter-mining surface orientation at each image point.

In particular, can the shape of an object be reconstructed by measuring the light it reflects from points on its surface? These questions were raised by Horn (H070) who formulated a set of conditions such that the image formation can be described in terms of a first order partial differential equation, the image irradiance equation. In general, an image irradiance equation has infinitely many solutions. Thus constraints necessary to find a unique solution need to be identified. First we study the continuous image irradiance equation. It is demonstrated when and how the knowledge of the position of edges on a surface can be used to reconstruct the surface. Furthermore we show how much about the shape of a surface can be deduced from so called singular points. At these points the surface orientation is uniquely determined by the measured brightness. Then we investigate images in which certain types of silhouettes, which we call b-silhouettes, can be detected. In particular we answer the following question in the affirmative: Is there a set of constraints which assure that if an image irradiance equation has a solution, it is unique? To this end we postulate three constraints upon the image irradiance equation and prove that they are sufficient to uniquely reconstruct the surface from its image."

The reflectance map, showing scene radiance as a function of surface gradient, has proved to be helpful in this endeavor. The reflectance map depends both on the nature of the surface layers of the objects being imaged and the distribution of light sources. Recently, a unified approach to the specification of surface reflectance in terms of both incident and reflected beam geometry has been proposed. The reflecting properties of a surface are specified in terms of the bidirectional reflectance-distribution function (BRDF). Here we derive the reflectance map in terms of the BRDF and the distribution of source radiance. A number of special cases of practical importance are developed in detail. The significance of this approach to the understanding of image formation is briefly indicated."

The projection has the merit that circles are represented as circles and that angles are retained.

A second constraint is needed. A method for finding the optical flow pattern is presented which assumes that the apparent velocity of the brightness pattern varies smoothly almost everywhere in the image. An iterative implementation is shown which successfully computes the optical flow for a number of synthetic image sequences. The algorithm is robust in that it can handle image sequences that are quantized rather coarsely in space and time. It is also insensitive to quantization of brightness levels and additive noise. Examples are included where the assumption of smoothness is violated at singular points or along lines in the image."

Frequently, processes are needed which reduce ambiguity and noise, and select the best label among several possible choices. Relaxation labeling processes are just such a class of algorithms. They are based on the parallel use of local constraints between labels. This paper develops a theory to characterize the goal of relaxation labeling. The theory is founded on a definition of con-sistency in labelings, extending the notion of constraint satisfaction. In certain restricted circumstances, an explicit functional exists that can be maximized to guide the search for consistent labelings. This functional is used to derive a new relaxation labeling operator. When the restrictions are not satisfied, the theory relies on variational cal-culus. It is shown that the problem of finding consistent labelings is equivalent to solving a variational inequality. A procedure nearly identical to the relaxation operator derived under restricted circum-stances serves in the more general setting. Further, a local convergence result is established for this operator. The standard relaxation labeling formulas are shown to approximate our new operator, which leads us to conjecture that successful applications of the standard methods are explainable by the theory developed here. Observations about con-vergence and generalizations to higher order compatibility relations are described."
