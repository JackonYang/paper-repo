Understanding this kind of linguistic input is challenging because diverse words and phrases must be mapped into structures that the robot can understand, and elements in those structures must be grounded in an uncertain environment. We present a system that follows natural language directions by extracting a sequence of spatial description clauses from the linguistic input and then infers the most probable path through the environment given only information about the environmental geometry and detected visible objects. We use a probabilistic graphical model that factors into three key components. The first component grounds landmark phrases such as \u201cthe computers\u201d in the perceptual frame of the robot by exploiting co-occurrence statistics from a database of tagged images such as Flickr. Second, a spatial reasoning component judges how well spatial relations such as \u201cpast the computers\u201d describe a path. Finally, verb phrases such as \u201cturn right\u201d are modeled according to the amount of change in orientation in the path. Our system follows 60% of the directions in our corpus to within 15 meters of the true destination, significantly outperforming other approaches."

This thesis develops a model for understanding language about space and movement in realistic situations. The system understands language from two real-world domains: finding video clips that match a spatial language description such as \"People walking through the kitchen and then going to the dining room\" and following natural language commands such as \"Go down the hall towards the fireplace in the living room.\" Understanding spatial language expressions is a challenging problem because linguistic expressions, themselves complex and ambiguous, must be connected to real-world objects and events. The system bridges the gap between language and the world by modeling the meaning of spatial language expressions hierarchically, first capturing the semantics of spatial prepositions, and then composing these meanings into higher level structures. Corpus-based evaluations of how well the system performs in different, realistic domains show that the system effectively and robustly understands spatial language expressions.

In this paper, we describe an integrated robotic architecture that can achieve the above steps by translating natural language instructions incrementally and simultaneously into formal logical goal description and action languages, which can be used both to reason about the achievability of a goal as well as to generate new action scripts to pursue the goal. We demonstrate the implementation of our approach on a robot taking spoken natural language instructions in an office environment."

We present MARCO, an agent that follows free-form, natural language route instructions by representing and executing a sequence of compound action specifications that model which actions to take under which conditions. MARCO infers implicit actions from knowledge of both linguistic conditional phrases and from spatial action and local configurations. Thus, MARCO performs explicit actions, implicit actions necessary to achieve the stated conditions, and exploratory actions to learn about the world. \n \nWe gathered a corpus of 786 route instructions from six people in three large-scale virtual indoor environments. Thirtysix other people followed these instructions and rated them for quality. These human participants finished at the intended destination on 69% of the trials. MARCO followed the same instructions in the same environments, with a success rate of 61%. We measured the efficacy of action inference with MARCO variants lacking action inference: executing only explicit actions, MARCO succeeded on just 28% of the trials. For this task, inferring implicit actions is essential to follow poor instructions, but is also crucial for many highly-rated route instructions."

In this work we investigate how statistical machine translation techniques can be used to bridge the gap between natural language route instructions and a map of an environment built by a robot. Our approach uses training data to learn to translate from natural language instructions to an automatically-labeled map. The complexity of the translation process is controlled by taking advantage of physical constraints imposed by the map. As a result, our technique can efficiently handle uncertainty in both map labeling and parsing. Our experiments demonstrate the promising capabilities achieved by our approach."

At the core of the approach is a model of object schemas that enables a robot to encode beliefs about physical objects in its environment using collections of coupled processes responsible for sensorimotor interaction. These interaction processes run concurrently in order to ensure responsiveness to the environment, while co-ordinating sensorimotor expectations, action planning and language use. The model has been implemented on a robot that manipulates objects on a tabletop in response to verbal input. The implementation responds to verbal requests such as \u2018Group the green block and the red apple\u2019, while adapting in real time to unexpected physical collisions and taking opportunistic advantage of any new information it may receive through perceptual and linguistic channels."

In this paper, the work on robot spatial relationships is combined with a multimodal robot interface. We show how linguistic spatial descriptions and other spatial information can be extracted from an evidence grid map and how this information can be used in a natural, human-robot dialog. Examples using spatial language are included for both robot-to-human feedback and also human-to-robot commands. We also discuss some linguistic consequences in the semantic representations of spatial and locative information based on this work."

Where traditional models learn from linguistic annotation or word distributions, our approach is grounded in the world, learning by apprenticeship from routes through a map paired with English descriptions. Lacking an explicit alignment between the text and the reference path makes it difficult to determine what portions of the language describe which aspects of the route. We learn this correspondence with a reinforcement learning algorithm, using the deviation of the route we follow from the intended path as a reward signal. We demonstrate that our system successfully grounds the meaning of spatial terms like above and south into geometric properties of paths."

The core part of such a system is the semantic parser that maps questions to logical forms. Semantic parsers are typically trained from examples of questions annotated with their target logical forms, but this type of annotation is expensive.Our goal is to instead learn a semantic parser from question\u2013answer pairs, where the logical form is modeled as a latent variable. We develop a new semantic formalism, dependency-based compositional semantics (DCS) and define a log-linear distribution over DCS logical forms. The model parameters are estimated using a simple procedure that alternates between beam search and numerical optimization. On two standard semantic parsing benchmarks, we show that our system obtains comparable accuracies to even state-of-the-art systems that do require annotated logical forms."

But what sets humans apart from other species is our ability to express spatial experience through language. This target article explores the language of objects and places , asking what geometric properties are preserved in the representations underlying object nouns and spatial prepositions in English. Evidence from these two aspects of language suggests there are significant differences in the geometric richness with which objects and places are encoded. When an object is named (i.e., with count nouns), detailed geometric properties \u2013 principally the object's shape (axes, solid and hollow volumes, surfaces, and parts) \u2013 are represented. In contrast, when an object plays the role of either \u201cfigure\u201d (located object) or \u201cground\u201d (reference object) in a locational expression, only very coarse geometric object properties are represented, primarily the main axes. In addition, the spatial functions encoded by spatial prepositions tend to be nonmetric and relatively coarse, for example, \u201ccontainment,\u201d \u201ccontact,\u201d \u201crelative distance,\u201d and \u201crelative direction.\u201d These properties are representative of other languages as well. The striking differences in the way language encodes objects versus places lead us to suggest two explanations: First, there is a tendency for languages to level out geometric detail from both object and place representations. Second, a nonlinguistic disparity between the representations of \u201cwhat\u201d and \u201cwhere\u201d underlies how language represents objects and places. The language of objects and places converges with and enriches our understanding of corresponding spatial representations."

These concepts are manipulated routinely in almost every waking hour of most people's lives. They are largely acquired in infancy and they are intersubjectively shared among members of the speech community. It is hard to imagine such elaborate and variable representation systems not having a substantial role to play in ordinary cognition, and yet the language-and-thought question continues to be a contested one across the various disciplines and sub-disciplines of cognitive science.

Conditional random fields offer several advantages over hidden Markov models and stochastic grammars for such tasks, including the ability to relax strong independence assumptions made in those models. Conditional random fields also avoid a fundamental limitation of maximum entropy Markov models (MEMMs) and other discriminative Markov models based on directed graphical models, which can be biased towards states with few successor states. We present iterative parameter estimation algorithms for conditional random fields and compare the performance of the resulting models to HMMs and MEMMs on synthetic and natural-language data."

This is formalized in the attentional vector-sum (AVS) model. This computational model accurately predicts linguistic acceptability judgments for spatial terms, under a variety of spatial configurations. In 7 experiments, the predictions of the AVS model are tested against those of 3 competing models. The results support the AVS model and disconfirm its competitors. The authors conclude that the structure of linguistic spatial categories can be partially explained in terms of independently motivated perceptual processes."

Efficient algorithms have been proposed for this task, but they are impractical when the number of parameters is very large. We present an algorithm Orthant-Wise Limited-memory Quasi-Newton (OWL-QN), based on L-BFGS, that can efficiently optimize the L1-regularized log-likelihood of log-linear models with millions of parameters. In our experiments on a parse reranking task, our algorithm was several orders of magnitude faster than an alternative algorithm, and substantially faster than L-BFGS on the analogous L2-regularized problem. We also present a proof that OWL-QN is guaranteed to converge to a globally optimal parameter vector."

Organized based on a helpful photo restoration workflow, the book will feature Adobe Photoshop as the primary software solution of choice, with coverage of Photoshop Elements and Lightroom as well. Read the book from start to finish or quickly access the information you need for the specific photo problems at hand. The book will start by covering the basics, such as how to evaluate how a photo is damaged and then move to the appropriate solution; how to properly handle and scan/import your photos; and how to use Photoshop as a photo retouching tool, with information on how Photoshop Elements and Lightroom can also play a role in restoring your images. The book then dives into specific issues that arise with old or damaged photos, such as removal of dust, scuff marks, and stains; repairing actual damage such as creases or missing corners; correcting color-related problems like blue or yellow-tinted images and oversaturation; and improving the contrast and brightness of both color and black-and-white images. Finally, the book finishes up by showing you how to add a special touch of greatness and creativity to your photos, in addition to printing and archiving....

The instructions are segmented on the basis of the actions to be taken, and each segment is labeled with the required action. This flat formulation reduces the problem to a sequential labeling task, to which machine learning methods are applied. We propose an innovative machine learning method for explicitly modeling the actions described in instructions and integrating learning and inference about the physical environment. We obtained a corpus of 840 route instructions that experimenters verified as follow-able, given by people in building navigation situations. Using the four-fold cross validation, our experiments showed that the simulated robot reached the correct destination 88% of the time."
