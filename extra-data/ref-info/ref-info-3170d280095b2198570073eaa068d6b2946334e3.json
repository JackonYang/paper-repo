In order to prove the feasibility of our concepts, we have developed the prototypical analysis system OfficeMAID (Office Mail Analysis, Interpretation and Delivery). The system analyses documents, as used in the daily work of a purchasing department, by a priori knowledge about workflows and document features. In this way, the system provides goal-directed information extraction, shallow understanding and process identification for given documents (paper, fax, e-mail)."

For each document, the system retrieves the nearest processing experience in order to analyze and interpret the current document. When a complete analysis is done, this document needs to be added to the document database. This requires an incremental learning process in order to take into account every new information, without losing the previous learnt ones. For this purpose, we proposed an improved version of an already existing neural network called Incremental Growing Neural Gas. Applied on documents learning and classification, this neural network reaches a recognition rate of 97.63%."

In order to process electronically the contents of printed documents, information must be extracted from digital images of documents. When dealing with complex documents, in which the contents of different regions and fields can be highly heterogeneous with respect to layout, printing quality and the utilization of fonts and typing standards, the reconstruction of the contents of documents from digital images can be a difficult problem. In the present article we present an efficient solution for this problem, in which the semantic contents of fields in a complex document are extracted from a digital image."

Then, the information required has to be recognized in documents and stored in the required format. In the natural language understanding field, the extraction of words from documents such as a person\u2019s name, place names, or an organization\u2019s name and their relationship, is called information extraction. In general, it is difficult to extract required keywords and their relationship from printed documents accurately, because such documents have unknown words such as proper nouns, compound words, or incorrect words due to OCR errors. Furthermore, it is necessary to solve word segmentation problems for Japanese documents, because the boundaries between words are ambiguous. In this paper, the author proposes a new document analysis method to extract required keywords/fields and their logical relationship automatically from various printed documents using models which define each category of document. The proposed system can handle not only documents in common use but also forms which are defined by the horizontal and vertical ruled lines. In the next section, method details will be discussed. Following that, experimental results that demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method will be presented."

Such documents obtained from OCR results may have not only unknown words and compound words, but also incorrect words due to OCR errors. To cope with OCR errors, the proposed method adopts robust keyword matching which searches for a string pattern from two dimensional OCR results consisting of a set of possible character candidates. This keyword matching uses a keyword dictionary that includes incorrect words with typical OCR errors and segments of words to deal with the above difficulties. After keyword matching, a global document matching is carried out between keyword matching results in an input document and document models which consist of keyword models and their logical relationship. This global matching determines the most suitable model for the input document and solves word segmentation problems accurately even if the document has unknown words, compound words, or incorrect words. Experimental results obtained for 100 documents show that the method is robust and effective for various document structures."

In an attempt to move toward a paperless office, large quantities of printed documents are often scanned and archived as images, without adequate index information. One way to provide traditional data-base indexing and retrieval capabilities is to fully convert the document to an electronic representation which can be indexed automatically. Unfortunately, there are many factors which prohibit complete conversion including high cost, low document quality, and the fact that many nontext components cannot be adequately represented in a converted form. In such cases, it can be advantageous to maintain a copy of and use the document in image form. In this paper, we provide a survey of methods developed by researchers to access and manipulate document images without the need for complete and accurate conversion. We briefly discuss traditional text indexing techniques on imperfect data and the retrieval of partially converted documents. This is followed by a more comprehensive review of techniques for the direct characterization, manipulation, and retrieval, of images of documents containing text, graphics, and scene images."

There is great diversity in document image classifiers: they differ in the problems they solve, in the use of training data to construct class models, and in the choice of document features and classification algorithms. We survey this diverse literature using three components: the problem statement, the classifier architecture, and performance evaluation. This brings to light important issues in designing a document classifier, including the definition of document classes, the choice of document features and feature representation, and the choice of classification algorithm and learning mechanism. We emphasize techniques that classify single-page typeset document images without using OCR results. Developing a general, adaptable, high-performance classifier is challenging due to the great variety of documents, the diverse criteria used to define document classes, and the ambiguity that arises due to ill-defined or fuzzy document classes."

The system first performs optical character recognition to find words and in some cases parts of words (we have observed error rates as high as 10 to 20 percent). For all these \u201cnoisy\u201d words, a set of features is computed which include internal text features, location features, and relationship features. These features are combined to estimate the relevance of the word in the context of the page and the recipient database. The parameters of the word relevance function are learned from training data using the AdaBoost learning algorithm. Words are then compared to the database of recipients to find likely matches. The recipients are finally ranked by combining the quality of the matches and the relevance of the words. Experiments are presented which demonstrate the effectiveness of this system on a large set of real data."

The second category corresponds to a new structural classifier based on tree comparison. The low level information based on a pyramidal decomposition of the document image is used by the kNN and the MLP classifiers, while the high level information represents the form content with a hierarchical structure used by the new structural classifier. Experimental results are presented. Some strategies of classifier co-operation are proposed."
