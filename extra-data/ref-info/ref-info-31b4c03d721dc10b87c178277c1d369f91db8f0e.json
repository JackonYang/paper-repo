This paper presents a method to reduce this demand using active learning, which selects what samples to annotate, instead of annotating blindly the whole training corpus.Sample selection for annotation is based upon \"representativeness\" and \"usefulness\". A model-based distance is proposed to measure the difference of two sentences and their most likely parse trees. Based on this distance, the active learning process analyzes the sample distribution by clustering and calculates the density of each sample to quantify its representativeness. Further more, a sentence is deemed as useful if the existing model is highly uncertain about its parses, where uncertainty is measured by various entropy-based scores.Experiments are carried out in the shallow semantic parser of an air travel dialog system. Our result shows that for about the same parsing accuracy, we only need to annotate a third of the samples as compared to the usual random selection method."

This enables bootstrapping from a small set of labeled training data via a large set of unlabeled data. This study examines the learning behavior of co-training on natural language processing tasks that typically require large numbers of training instances to achieve usable performance levels. Using base noun phrase bracketing as a case study, we find that co-training reduces by 36% the difference in error between co-trained classifiers and fully supervised classifiers trained on a labeled version of all available data. However, degradation in the quality of the bootstrapped data arises as an obstacle to further improvement. To address this, we propose a moderately supervised variant of cotraining in which a human corrects the mistakes made during automatic labeling. Our analysis suggests that corrected co-training and similar moderately supervised methods may help cotraining scale to large natural language learning tasks."

From unlabeled data we form a smooth. low-dimensional feature space, where each word token is projected based on its underlying role as a function or content word. We then use this projection as additional input features to a linear-chain conditional random field trained on limited labeled training data. On standard part-of-speech tagging and Chinese word segmentation data sets we show as much as 14% error reduction due to the unlabeled data, and also statistically-significant improvements over a related semi-supervised sequence tagging method due to Miller et al."

A large number of rules is needed for coverage of the domain, suggesting that a fairly large number of labeled examples should be required to train a classifier. However, we show that the use of unlabeled data can reduce the requirements for supervision to just 7 simple \"seed\" rules. The approach gains leverage from natural redundancy in the data: for many named-entity instances both the spelling of the name and the context inwhich it appears are sufficient to determine its type. We present two algorithms. The first method uses a similar algorithm to that of (Yarowsky 95), with modifications motivated by (Blum and Mitchell 98). The second algorithm extends ideas from boosting algorithms, designed for supervised learning tasks, to the framework suggested by (Blum and Mitchell 98)."

Named entity (N.E.) recognition is a form of information extraction in which we seek to classify every word in a document as being a person-name, organization, location, date, time, monetary value, percentage, or \u201cnone of the above\u201d. The task has particular significance for Internet search engines, machine translation, the automatic indexing of documents, and as a foundation for work on more complex information extraction tasks. \nTwo of the most significant problems facing the constructor of a named entity system are the questions of portability and system performance. A practical N.E. system will need to be ported frequently to new bodies of text and even to new languages. The challenge is to build a system which can be ported with minimal expense (in particular minimal programming by a computational linguist) while maintaining a high degree of accuracy in the new domains or languages. \nMENE attempts to address these issues through the use of maximum entropy probabilistic modeling. It utilizes a very flexible object-based architecture which allows it to make use of a broad range of knowledge sources in making its tagging decisions. In the DARPA-sponsored MUC-7 named entity evaluation, the system displayed an accuracy rate which was well-above the median, demonstrating that it can achieve the performance goal. In addition, we demonstrate that the system can be used as a post-processing tool to enhance the output of a hand-coded named entity recognizer through experiments in which MENE improved on the performance of N.E. systems from three different sites. Furthermore, when all three external recognizers are combined under MENE, we are able to achieve very strong results which, in some cases, appear to be competitive with human performance. \nFinally, we demonstrate the trans-lingual portability of the system. We ported the system to two Japanese-language named entity tasks, one of which involved a new named entity category, \u201cartifact\u201d. Our results on these tasks were competitive with the best systems built by native Japanese speakers despite the fact that the author speaks no Japanese."

This is difficult because most high-performance named entity recognition systems operate by sequentially classifying words as to whether or not they participate in an entity name; however, the most useful similarity measures score entire candidate names. To correct this mismatch we formalize a semi-Markov extraction process, which is based on sequentially classifying segments of several adjacent words, rather than single words. In addition to allowing a natural way of coupling high-performance NER methods and high-performance similarity functions, this formalism also allows the direct use of other useful entity-level features, and provides a more natural formulation of the NER problem than sequential word classification. Experiments in multiple domains show that the new model can substantially improve extraction performance over previous methods for using external dictionaries in NER."

The main novelty of these experiments is the use of untagged text in the training of the model. We have used a simple triclass Markov model and are looking for the best way to estimate the parameters of this model, depending on the kind and amount of training data provided. Two approaches in particular are compared and combined:using text that has been tagged by hand and computing relative frequency counts,using text without tags and training the model as a hidden Markov process, according to a Maximum Likelihood principle.Experminents show that the best training is obtained by using as much tagged text as possible. They also show that Maximum Likelihood training, the procedure that is routinely used to estimate hidden Markov models parameters from training data, will not necessarily improve the tagging accuracy. In fact, it will generally degrade this accuracy, except when only a limited amount of hand-tagged text is available."

Because of the sparseness of counts of such dependencies, smoothing and the ability to use multiple sources of knowledge are important challenges. For example, if the probability P(N|V) of noun N being the subject of verb V is high, and V takes similar objects to V', and V' is synonymous to V\", then we want to conclude that P(N|V\") should also be reasonably high---even when those words did not cooccur in the training data.To capture these higher order relationships, we propose a Markov chain model, whose stationary distribution is used to give word probability estimates. Unlike the manually defined random walks used in some link analysis algorithms, we show how to automatically learn a rich set of parameters for the Markov chain's transition probabilities. We apply this model to the task of prepositional phrase attachment, obtaining an accuracy of 87.54%."

Through the HMM, our system is able to apply and integrate four types of internal and external evidences: 1) simple deterministic internal feature of the words, such as capitalization and digitalization; 2) internal semantic feature of important triggers; 3) internal gazetteer feature; 4) external macro context feature. In this way, the NER problem can be resolved effectively. Evaluation of our system on MUC-6 and MUC-7 English NE tasks achieves F-measures of 96.6% and 94.1% respectively. It shows that the performance is significantly better than reported by any other machine-learning system. Moreover, the performance is even consistently better than those based on handcrafted rules."

We have evaluated the model in English (based on data from the Sixth and Seventh Message Understanding Conferences [MUC-6, MUC-7] and broadcast news) and in Spanish (based on data distributed through the First Multilingual Entity Task [MET-1]), and on speech input (based on broadcast news). We report results here on standard materials only to quantify performance on data available to the community, namely, MUC-6 and MET-1. Results have been consistently better than reported by any other learning algorithm. IdentiFinder's performance is competitive with approaches based on handcrafted rules on mixed case text and superior on text where case information is not available. We also present a controlled experiment showing the effect of training set size on performance, demonstrating that as little as 100,000 words of training data is adequate to get performance around 90% on newswire. Although we present our understanding of why this algorithm performs so well on this class of problems, we believe that significant improvement in performance may still be possible."

                "text": "This article considers approaches which rerank the output of an existing probabilistic parser. The base parser produces a set of candidate parses for each input sentence, with associated probabilities that define an initial ranking of these parses. A second model then attempts to improve upon this initial ranking, using additional features of the tree as evidence. The strength of our approach is that it allows a tree to be represented as an arbitrary set of features, without concerns about how these features interact or overlap and without the need to define a derivation or a generative model which takes these features into account. We introduce a new method for the reranking task, based on the boosting approach to ranking problems described in Freund et al. (1998). We apply the boosting method to parsing the Wall Street Journal treebank. The method combined the log-likelihood under a baseline model (that of Collins [1999]) with evidence from an additional 500,000 features over parse trees that were not included in the original model. The new model achieved 89.75 F-measure, a 13 relative decrease in F-measure error over the baseline model's score of 88.2. The article also introduces a new algorithm for the boosting approach which takes advantage of the sparsity of the feature space in the parsing data. Experiments show significant efficiency gains for the new algorithm over the obvious implementation of the boosting approach. We argue that the method is an appealing alternative-in terms of both simplicity and efficiency-to work on feature selection methods within log-linear (maximum-entropy) models. Although the experiments in this article are on natural language parsing (NLP), the approach should be applicable to many other NLP problems which are naturally framed as ranking tasks, for example, speech recognition, machine translation, or natural language generation."

The preliminary experiment shows that the segmentation accuracy of our algorithm is acceptable.

This is important because in many text classification problems obtaining training labels is expensive, while large quantities of unlabeled documents are readily available.We introduce an algorithm for learning from labeled and unlabeled documents based on the combination of Expectation-Maximization (EM) and a naive Bayes classifier. The algorithm first trains a classifier using the available labeled documents, and probabilistically labels the unlabeled documents. It then trains a new classifier using the labels for all the documents, and iterates to convergence. This basic EM procedure works well when the data conform to the generative assumptions of the model. However these assumptions are often violated in practice, and poor performance can result. We present two extensions to the algorithm that improve classification accuracy under these conditions: (1) a weighting factor to modulate the contribution of the unlabeled data, and (2) the use of multiple mixture components per class. Experimental results, obtained using text from three different real-world tasks, show that the use of unlabeled data reduces classification error by up to 30%."

We contrast two parameter estimation methods: the perceptron algorithm, and a method based on conditional random fields (CRFs). The models are encoded as deterministic weighted finite state automata, and are applied by intersecting the automata with word-lattices that are the output from a baseline recognizer. The perceptron algorithm has the benefit of automatically selecting a relatively small feature set in just a couple of passes over the training data. However, using the feature set output from the perceptron algorithm (initialized with their weights), CRF training provides an additional 0.5% reduction in word error rate, for a total 1.8% absolute reduction from the baseline of 39.2%."

In particular, we consider a problem setting motivated by the task of learning to classify web pages, in which the description of each example can be partitioned into two distinct views. For example, the description of a web page can be partitioned into the words occurring on that page, and the words occurring in hyperlinks t,hat point to that page. We assume that either view of the example would be sufficient for learning if we had enough labeled data, but our goal is to use both views together to allow inexpensive unlabeled data to augment, a much smaller set of labeled examples. Specifically, the presence of two distinct views of each example suggests strategies in which two learning algorithms are trained separately on each view, and then each algorithm\u2019s predictions on new unlabeled examples are used to enlarge the training set of the other. Our goal in this paper is to provide a PAC-style analysis for this setting, and, more broadly, a PAC-style framework for the general problem of learning from both labeled and unlabeled data. We also provide empirical results on real web-page data indicating that this use of unlabeled examples can lead to significant improvement of hypotheses in practice. *This research was supported in part by the DARPA HPKB program under contract F30602-97-1-0215 and by NSF National Young investigator grant CCR-9357793.

Documents often contain tables in order to communicate densely packed, multi-dimensional information. Tables do this by employing layout patterns to efficiently indicate fields and records in two-dimensional form.Their rich combination of formatting and content present difficulties for traditional language modeling techniques, however. This paper presents the use of conditional random fields (CRFs) for table extraction, and compares them with hidden Markov models (HMMs). Unlike HMMs, CRFs support the use of many rich and overlapping layout and language features, and as a result, they perform significantly better. We show experimental results on plain-text government statistical reports in which tables are located with 92% F1, and their constituent lines are classified into 12 table-related categories with 94% accuracy. We also discuss future work on undirected graphical models for segmenting columns, finding cells, and classifying them as data cells or label cells."

This work proposes to use sample selection to find helpful training examples and reduce human effort spent on annotating less informative ones. We consider several criteria for predicting whether unlabeled data might be a helpful training example. Experiments are performed across two syntactic learning tasks and within the single task of parsing across two learning models to compare the effect of different predictive criteria. We find that sample selection can significantly reduce the size of annotated training corpora and that uncertainty is a robust predictive criterion that can be easily applied to different learning models."

By treating words as strings composed of morphemes/phonemes which are themselves composed of character/phone strings, we use EM to first identify the important morphemes/phonemes in a corpus, and then use a second level of EM to identify words given a lower level morpheme/phoneme segmentation. To further improve performance of the basic method we employ a mutual information criterion to eliminate long word agglomerations and reduce the size of the inferred lexicon while moving EM out of poor local maxima. Experiments on the Brown corpus show that our method accurately recovers hidden word boundaries using less training data than current MDL based approaches, even though our method is only trained on raw unsupervised data."

Among sequence labeling tasks in language processing, shallow parsing has received much attention, with the development of standard evaluation datasets and extensive comparison among methods. We show here how to train a conditional random field to achieve performance as good as any reported base noun-phrase chunking method on the CoNLL task, and better than any reported single model. Improved training methods based on modern optimization algorithms were critical in achieving these results. We present extensive comparisons between models and training methods that confirm and strengthen previous results on shallow parsing and training methods for maximum-entropy models."

Our models can condition on arbitrary features of input sentences, thus incorporating an important kind of lexical information without the added algorithmic complexity of modeling headedness. We provide an efficient algorithm for learning such models and show experimental evidence of the model\u2019s improved performance over a natural baseline model and a lexicalized probabilistic context-free grammar."

A key advantage of CRFs is their great flexibility to include a wide variety of arbitrary, non-independent features of the input. Faced with this freedom, however, an important question remains: what features should be used? This paper presents an efficient feature induction method for CRFs. The method is founded on the principle of iteratively constructing feature conjunctions that would significantly increase conditional log-likelihood if added to the model. Automated feature induction enables not only improved accuracy and dramatic reduction in parameter count, but also the use of larger cliques, and more freedom to liberally hypothesize atomic input variables that may be relevant to a task. The method applies to linear-chain CRFs, as well as to more arbitrary CRF structures, such as Relational Markov Networks, where it corresponds to learning clique templates, and can also be understood as supervised structure learning. Experimental results on named entity extraction and noun phrase segmentation tasks are presented."

In this thesis, we present a new semi-supervised learning method called co-learning that is designed to use unlabeled data to enhance standard supervised learning algorithms. The idea is that two or more standard supervised learning algorithms can leverage off the fact that they have different representations of the hypotheses and they are likely to detect different patterns in labeled data. We also design an active co-learning strategy to bootstrap our co-leaning procedure when the originally labeled data set is too small to provide accurate confidence estimate for the learned hypotheses. We provide a priority sampling technique as the selection component in our active co-learning method. We evaluate our co-learning algorithms on several datasets from a commonly used data repository in the machine learning community. We also test our co-learning method on text categorization. The contribution of this research is to put forward a new semi-supervised learning approach for learning with a small number of labeled examples, and explore the applicability of our co-learning strategy in real world applications."

Kernel-based approaches, such as support vector machines (SVMs), which maximize the margin of confidence of the classifier, are the method of choice for many such tasks. Their popularity stems both from the ability to use high-dimensional feature spaces, and from their strong theoretical guarantees. However, many real-world tasks involve sequential, spatial, or structured data, where multiple labels must be assigned. Existing kernel-based methods ignore structure in the problem, assigning labels independently to each object, losing much useful information. Conversely, probabilistic graphical models, such as Markov networks, can represent correlations between labels, by exploiting problem structure, but cannot handle high-dimensional feature spaces, and lack strong theoretical generalization guarantees. In this paper, we present a new framework that combines the advantages of both approaches: Maximum margin Markov (M3) networks incorporate both kernels, which efficiently deal with high-dimensional features, and the ability to capture correlations in structured data. We present an efficient algorithm for learning M3 networks based on a compact quadratic program formulation. We provide a new theoretical bound for generalization in structured domains. Experiments on the task of handwritten character recognition and collective hypertext classification demonstrate very significant gains over previous approaches."

The forward mapping from symbol sequences to the speech stream is modeled using features based on articulatory gestures. We present results on the acquisition of lexicons and language models from raw speech, text, and phonetic transcripts, and demonstrate that our algorithm compares very favorably to other reported results with respect to segmentation performance and statistical efficiency."

The learning paradigm builds increasingly complex fields by allowing potential functions, or features, that are supported by increasingly large subgraphs. Each feature has a weight that is trained by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the model and the empirical distribution of the training data. A greedy algorithm determines how features are incrementally added to the field and an iterative scaling algorithm is used to estimate the optimal values of the weights. The random field models and techniques introduced in this paper differ from those common to much of the computer vision literature in that the underlying random fields are non-Markovian and have a large number of parameters that must be estimated. Relations to other learning approaches, including decision trees, are given. As a demonstration of the method, we describe its application to the problem of automatic word classification in natural language processing."

We present a multilevel bootstrapping algorithm that generates both the semantic lexicon and extraction patterns simultaneously. As input, our technique requires only unannotated training texts and a handful of seed words for a category. We use a mutual bootstrapping technique to alternately select the best extraction pattern for the category and bootstrap its extractions into the semantic lexicon, which is the basis for selecting the next extraction pattern. To make this approach more robust, we add a second level of bootstrapping (metabootstrapping) that retains only the most reliable lexicon entries produced by mutual bootstrapping and then restarts the process. We evaluated this multilevel bootstrapping technique on a collection of corporate web pages and a corpus of terrorism news articles. The algorithm produced high-quality dictionaries for several semantic categories."

The proposed architecture handles dependencies between neighboring labels using Viterbi decoding. In contrast to standard HMM training, the learning procedure is discriminative and is based on a maximum/soft margin criterion. Compared to previous methods like Conditional Random Fields, Maximum Entropy Markov Models and label sequence boosting, HM-SVMs have a number of advantages. Most notably, it is possible to learn non-linear discriminant functions via kernel functions. At the same time, HM-SVMs share the key advantages with other discriminative methods, in particular the capability to deal with overlapping features. We report experimental evaluations on two tasks, named entity recognition and part-of-speech tagging, that demonstrate the competitiveness of the proposed approach."

While regular Support Vector Machines (SVMs) try to induce a general decision function for a learning task, Transductive Support Vector Machines take into account a particular test set and try to minimize misclassi cations of just those particular examples. The paper presents an analysis of why TSVMs are well suited for text classi cation. These theoretical ndings are supported by experiments on three test collections. The experiments show substantial improvements over inductive methods, especially for small training sets, cutting the number of labeled training examples down to a twentieth on some tasks. This work also proposes an algorithm for training TSVMs e ciently, handling 10,000 examples and more."

We consider both a mostly-unsupervised approach, cotraining, in which two parsers are iteratively re-trained on each other's output; and a semi-supervised approach, corrected co-training, in which a human corrects each parser's output before adding it to the training data. The selection of labeled training examples is an integral part of both frameworks. We propose several selection methods based on the criteria of minimizing errors in the data and maximizing training utility. We show that incorporating the utility criterion into the selection method results in better parsers for both frameworks."

Conditional random fields offer several advantages over hidden Markov models and stochastic grammars for such tasks, including the ability to relax strong independence assumptions made in those models. Conditional random fields also avoid a fundamental limitation of maximum entropy Markov models (MEMMs) and other discriminative Markov models based on directed graphical models, which can be biased towards states with few successor states. We present iterative parameter estimation algorithms for conditional random fields and compare the performance of the resulting models to HMMs and MEMMs on synthetic and natural-language data."

The random walk representation exploits any low dimensional structure in the data in a robust, probabilistic manner. We develop and compare several estimation criteria/algorithms suited to this representation. This includes in particular multi-way classification with an average margin criterion which permits a closed form solution. The time scale of the random walk regularizes the representation and can be set through a margin-based criterion favoring unambiguous classification. We also extend this basic regularization by adapting time scales for individual examples. We demonstrate the approach on synthetic examples and on text classification problems."

Objects are modeled as flexible constellations of parts conditioned on local observations found by an interest operator. For each object class the probability of a given assignment of parts to local features is modeled by a Conditional Random Field (CRF). We propose an extension of the CRF framework that incorporates hidden variables and combines class conditional CRFs into a unified framework for part-based object recognition. The parameters of the CRF are estimated in a maximum likelihood framework and recognition proceeds by finding the most likely class under our model. The main advantage of the proposed CRF framework is that it allows us to relax the assumption of conditional independence of the observed data (i.e. local features) often used in generative approaches, an assumption that might be too restrictive for a considerable number of object classes."

The predominant approach in computational linguistics has been to use a parametric model with some variant of maximum-likelihood estimation. The assumptions under which maximum-likelihood estimation is justified are arguably quite strong. This chapter discusses the statistical theory underlying various parameter-estimation methods, and gives algorithms which depend on alternatives to (smoothed) maximum-likelihood estimation. We first give an overview of results from statistical learning theory. We then show how important concepts from the classification literature - specifically, generalization results based on margins on training data - can be derived for parsing models. Finally, we describe parameter estimation algorithms which are motivated by these generalization bounds."

Compared to Vapnik's algorithm, however, ours is much simpler to implement, and much more efficient in terms of computation time. We also show that our algorithm can be efficiently used in very high dimensional spaces using kernel functions. We performed some experiments using our algorithm, and some variants of it, for classifying images of handwritten digits. The performance of our algorithm is close to, but not as good as, the performance of maximal-margin classifiers on the same problem, while saving significantly on computation time and programming effort."

The prior is a bias for maximally structured and minimally ambiguous models. In conditional probability models with hidden state, iterative MAP estimation drives weakly supported parameters toward extinction, effectively turning them off. Thus, structure discovery is folded into parameter estimation. We then establish criteria for simplifying a probabilistic model's graphical structure by trimming parameters and states, with a guarantee that any such deletion will increase the posterior probability of the model. Trimming accelerates learning by sparsifying the model. All operations monotonically and maximally increase the posterior probability, yielding structure-learning algorithms only slightly slower than parameter estimation via expectation-maximization and orders of magnitude faster than search-based structure induction. When applied to hidden Markov model training, the resulting models show superior generalization to held-out test data. In many cases the resulting models are so sparse and concise that they are interpretable, with hidden states that strongly correlate with meaningful categories."

A representer theorem for conditional graphical models is given which shows how kernel conditional random fields arise from risk minimization procedures defined using Mercer kernels on labeled graphs. A procedure for greedily selecting cliques in the dual representation is then proposed, which allows sparse representations. By incorporating kernels and implicit feature spaces into conditional graphical models, the framework enables semi-supervised learning algorithms for structured data through the use of graph kernels. The framework and clique selection methods are demonstrated in synthetic data experiments, and are also applied to the problem of protein secondary structure prediction."

Rather than focusing on local features and their consistencies in the image data, our approach aims at extracting the global impression of an image. We treat image segmentation as a graph partitioning problem and propose a novel global criterion, the normalized cut, for segmenting the graph. The normalized cut criterion measures both the total dissimilarity between the different groups as well as the total similarity within the groups. We show that an efficient computational technique based on a generalized eigenvalue problem can be used to optimize this criterion. We have applied this approach to segmenting static images and found results very encouraging."

The FASTUS system was originally developed for participation in the MUC-4 evaluation [3] in 1992, and the performance of FASTUS in MUC-4 helped demonstrate the viability of finite state technologies in constrained natural-language understanding tasks. The system has undergone significant revision since MUC-4, and it is safe to say that the current system does not share a single line of code with the original. The fundamental ideas behind FASTUS, however, are retained in the current system: an architecture consisting of cascaded finite state transducers, each providing an additional level of analysis of the input, together with merging of the final results."
