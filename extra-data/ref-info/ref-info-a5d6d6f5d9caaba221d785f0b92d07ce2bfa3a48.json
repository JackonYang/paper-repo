The traditional approach to recognition and 3D reconstruction of human activity has been to track motion in 3D, mainly using advanced geometric and dynamic models. In this paper we reverse this process. View based activity recognition serves as an input to a human body location tracker with the ultimate goal of 3D reanimation in mind. We demonstrate that specific human actions can be detected from single frame postures in a video sequence. By recognizing the image of a person's posture as corresponding to a particular key frame from a set of stored key frames, it is possible to map body locations from the key frames to actual frames. This is achieved using a shape matching algorithm based on qualitative similarity that computes point to point correspondence between shapes, together with information about appearance. As the mapping is from fixed key frames, our tracking does not suffer from the problem of having to reinitialise when it gets lost. It is effectively a closed loop. We present experimental results both for recognition and tracking for a sequence of a tennis player."

We show how to find people by finding candidate body segments, and then constructing assemblies of segments that are consistent with the constraints on the appearance of a person that result from kinematic properties. Since a reasonable model of a person requires at least nine segments, it is not possible to inspect every group, due to the huge combinatorial complexity.We propose two approaches to this problem. In one, the search can be pruned by using projected versions of a classifier that accepts groups corresponding to people. We describe an efficient projection algorithm for one popular classifier, and demonstrate that our approach can be used to determine whether images of real scenes contain people.The second approach employs a probabilistic framework, so that we can draw samples of assemblies, with probabilities proportional to their likelihood, which allows to draw human-like assemblies more often than the non-person ones. The main performance problem is in segmentation of images, but the overall results of both approaches on real images of people are encouraging."

The basic approach is to store a number of exemplar 2D views of the human body in a variety of different configurations and viewpoints with respect to the camera. On each of these stored views, the locations of the body joints (left elbow, right knee, etc.) are manually marked and labelled for future use. The test shape is then matched to each stored view, using the technique of shape context matching in conjunction with a kinematic chain-based deformation model. Assuming that there is a stored view sufficiently similar in configuration and pose, the correspondence process will succeed. The locations of the body joints are then transferred from the exemplar view to the test shape. Given the joint locations, the 3D body configuration and pose are then estimated. We can apply this technique to video by treating each frame independently - tracking just becomes repeated recognition! We present results on a variety of datasets."

Because of many potentially important applications, \u201clooking at people\u201d is currently one of the most active application domains in computer vision. This survey identifies a number of promising applications and provides an overview of recent developments in this domain. The scope of this survey is limited to work on whole-body or hand motion; it does not include work on human faces. The emphasis is on discussing the various methodologies; they are grouped in 2-D approaches with or without explicit shape models and 3-D approaches. Where appropriate, systems are reviewed. We conclude with some thoughts about future directions."

We propose an integration model that incorporates both edge detection and object part detection results. It consists of two parallel processes: low-level pixel grouping and high-level patch grouping. We seek a solution that optimizes a joint grouping criterion in a reduced space enforced by grouping correspondence between pixels and patches. Using spectral graph partitioning, we show that a near global optimum can be found by solving a constrained eigenvalue problem. We report promising experimental results on a dataset of 15 objects under clutter and occlusion."

The training data include both useful \"foreground\" features as well as features that arise from irrelevant background clutter - the correspondence between parts and detected features is unknown. The joint probability density function of the parts is represented by a mixture of decomposable triangulated graphs which allow for fast detection. To learn the model structure as well as model parameters, an EM-like algorithm is developed where the labeling of the data (part assignments) is treated as hidden variables. The unsupervised learning technique is not limited to decomposable triangulated graphs. The efficiency and effectiveness of our algorithm is demonstrated by applying it to generate models of human motion automatically from unlabeled image sequences, and testing the learned models on a variety of sequences."

In this framework, the detection and recognition of objects proceed simultaneously with image segmentation in a competitive and cooperative manner. We illustrate our approach on natural images of complex city scenes where the objects of primary interest are faces and text. This method makes use of bottom-up proposals combined with top-down generative models using the Data Driven Markov Chain Monte Carlo (DDMCMC) algorithm which is guaranteed to converge to the optimal estimate asymptotically. More precisely, we define generative models for faces, text, and generic regions\u2013 e.g. shading, texture, and clutter. These models are activated by bottom-up proposals. The proposals for faces and text are learnt using a probabilistic version of AdaBoost. The DDMCMC combines reversible jump and diffusion dynamics to enable the generative models to explain the input images in a competitive and cooperative manner. Our experiments illustrate the advantages and importance of combining bottom-up and top-down models and of performing segmentation and object detection/recognition simultaneously."

The technique is demonstrated by developing a system that locates people in cluttered scenes. The system is structured with four distinct example-based detectors that are trained to separately find the four components of the human body: the head, legs, left arm, and right arm. After ensuring that these components are present in the proper geometric configuration, a second example-based classifier combines the results of the component detectors to classify a pattern as either a \"person\" or a \"nonperson.\" We call this type of hierarchical architecture, in which learning occurs at multiple stages, an adaptive combination of classifiers (ACC). We present results that show that this system performs significantly better than a similar full-body person detector. This suggests that the improvement in performance is due to the component-based approach and the ACC data classification architecture. The algorithm is also more robust than the full-body person detection method in that it is capable of locating partially occluded views of people and people whose body parts have little contrast with the background."

                "text": "This paper describes a pedestrian detection system that integrates image intensity information with motion information. We use a detection style algorithm that scans a detector over two consecutive frames of a video sequence. The detector is trained (using AdaBoost) to take advantage of both motion and appearance information to detect a walking person. Past approaches have built detectors based on motion information or detectors based on appearance information, but ours is the first to combine both sources of information in a single detector. The implementation described runs at about 4 frames/second, detects pedestrians at very small scales (as small as 20 \u00d7 15 pixels), and has a very low false positive rate.Our approach builds on the detection work of Viola and Jones. Novel contributions of this paper include: (i) development of a representation of image motion which is extremely efficient, and (ii) implementation of a state of the art pedestrian detection system which operates on low resolution images under difficult conditions (such as rain and snow)."
