This approach to language processing is distinguished by a minimal reliance on syntactic sentence analysis, along with a minimal dictionary customized to operate in a limited domain. Last year, the UMass/MUC-3 system demonstrated the viability of selective concept extraction, but serious questions were raised about the portability and scalability of the technology, particularly with respect to the creation of domain-dependent and task-dependent dictionaries. We estimated that 9 person/months went into the creation of the dictionary used by UMass/MUC-3, and we were unable to say how much domain-dependent lexicon was still missing. We were nevertheless sure that our dictionary coverage was incomplete."

The long term issue is that the understander must incorporate new words into its lexicon for future use. This paper describes an approach to constructing new lexical entries in a gradual process by analyzing a sequence of example texts. This approach permits the graceful tolerance of new words while enabling the automated extension of the lexicon. Each new acquired lexeme starts as a set of assumptions derived from the analysis of each word in a textual context. A variety of knowledge sources, including morphological, syntactic, semantic, and contextual knowledge, determine the assumptions. These assumptions, along with justifications and dependencies, are interpreted and refined by a learning program that ultimately updates the system's lexicon. This approach uses existing linguistic knowledge, and generalization of multiple occurrences, to create new operational lexical entries."

We use a well-known conceptual clustering system to create a case-based memory that predicts the antecedent of a wh-word given a description of the clause that precedes it. Our automated approach duplicates the performance of hand-coded rules. In addition, it requires only minimal syntactic parsing capabilities and a very general semantic feature set for describing nouns. Human intervention is needed only during the training phase. Thus, it is possible to compile relative pronoun disambiguation heuristics tuned to the syntactic and semantic preferences of a new domain with relative ease. Moreover, we believe that the technique provides a general approach for the automated acquisition of additional disambiguation heuristics for natural language systems, especially for problems that require the assimilation of syntactic and semantic knowledge."

Reports associated with terrorism were chosen as the target domain, and all systems were tested on a collection of previously unseen texts released by a government agency. Based on multiple strategies for computing each metric, the competing systems were evaluated for recall, precision, and overgeneration. The results support the claim that systems incorporating natural language\u2010processing techniques are more effective than systems based on stochastic techniques alone. A wide range of language-processing strategies was employed by the top-scoring systems, indicating that many natural language\u2010processing techniques provide a viable foundation for sophisticated text analysis. Further evaluation is needed to produce a more detailed assessment of the relative merits of specific technologies and establish true performance limits for automated information extraction."
