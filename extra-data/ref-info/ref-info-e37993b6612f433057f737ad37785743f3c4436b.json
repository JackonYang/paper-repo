This requires a representation above the level of pixels that can be endowed with high-level attributes such as class of object/region, its orientation, and (rough 3D) location within the scene. Towards this goal, we propose a region-based model which combines appearance and scene geometry to automatically decompose a scene into semantically meaningful regions. Our model is defined in terms of a unified energy function over scene appearance and structure. We show how this energy function can be learned from data and present an efficient inference technique that makes use of multiple over-segmentations of the image to propose moves in the energy-space. We show, experimentally, that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the tasks of both multi-class image segmentation and geometric reasoning. Finally, by understanding region classes and geometry, we show how our model can be used as the basis for 3D reconstruction of the scene."

Using perspective cues from the global scene geometry, we first develop a 3D based object detector. This detector is competitive with an image based detector built using state-of-the-art methods; however, combining the two produces a notably improved detector, because it unifies contextual and geometric information. We then use a probabilistic model that explicitly uses constraints imposed by spatial layout - the locations of walls and floor in the image - to refine the 3D object estimates. We use an existing approach to compute spatial layout [1], and use constraints such as objects are supported by floor and can not stick through the walls. The resulting detector (a) has significantly improved accuracy when compared to the state-of-the-art 2D detectors and (b) gives a 3D interpretation of the location of the object, derived from a 2D image. We evaluate the detector on beds, for which we give extensive quantitative results derived from images of real scenes."

We show that we can recognize the three dimensional structure of the interior of a building, even in the presence of occluding objects. Several physically valid structure hypotheses are proposed by geometric reasoning and verified to find the best fitting model to line segments, which is then converted to a full 3D model. Our experiments demonstrate that our structure recovery from line segments is comparable with methods using full image appearance. Our approach shows how a set of rules describing geometric constraints between groups of segments can be used to prune scene interpretation hypotheses and to generate the most plausible interpretation."

This ability is completely missing in most popular recognition algorithms, which pretend that the world is flat and/or view it through a patch-sized peephole. Yet it seems very likely that having a grasp of this \u201csurface layout\u201d of a scene should be of great assistance for many tasks, including recognition, navigation, and novel view synthesis.In this paper, we take the first step towards constructing the surface layout, a labeling of the image intogeometric classes. Our main insight is to learn appearance-based models of these geometric classes, which coarsely describe the 3D scene orientation of each image region. Our multiple segmentation framework provides robust spatial support, allowing a wide variety of cues (e.g., color, texture, and perspective) to contribute to the confidence in each geometric label. In experiments on a large set of outdoor images, we evaluate the impact of the individual cues and design choices in our algorithm. We further demonstrate the applicability of our method to indoor images, describe potential applications, and discuss extensions to a more complete notion of surface layout."

We propose accounting for the inherent structure of the visual world when trying to solve the scene reconstruction problem. Consequently, we identify geometric scene categorization as the first step toward robust and efficient depth estimation from single images. We introduce 15 typical 3D scene geometries called stages, each with a unique depth profile, which roughly correspond to a large majority of broadcast video frames. Stage information serves as a first approximation of global depth, narrowing down the search space in depth estimation and object localization. We propose different sets of low-level features for depth estimation, and perform stage classification on two diverse data sets of television broadcasts. Classification results demonstrate that stages can often be efficiently learned from low-dimensional image representations."

We believe that the amazing ability of humans to reason about occlusions from one image is based on an intrinsically 3D interpretation. In this paper, our goal is to recover the occlusion boundaries and depth ordering of free-standing structures in the scene. Our approach is to learn to identify and label occlusion boundaries using the traditional edge and region cues together with 3D surface and depth cues. Since some of these cues require good spatial support (i.e., a segmentation), we gradually create larger regions and use them to improve inference over the boundaries. Our experiments demonstrate the power of a scene-based approach to occlusion reasoning."

We also recognize different objects, decide on their orientations, and identify how they are connected to their environment. Focusing on the problem of autonomous 3d reconstruction of indoor scenes, in this paper we present a dynamic Bayesian network model capable of resolving some of these ambiguities and recovering 3d information for many images. Our model assumes a \"floorwall\" geometry on the scene and is trained to recognize the floor-wall boundary in each column of the image. When the image is produced under perspective geometry, we show that this model can be used for 3d reconstruction from a single image. To our knowledge, this was the first monocular approach to automatically recover 3d reconstructions from single indoor images."

In this paper, we are concerned with how these tasks can be combined in a way that improves the performance of each of them. Inspired by Barrow and Tenenbaum, we present a flexible framework for interfacing scene analysis processes using intrinsic images. Each intrinsic image is a registered map describing one characteristic of the scene. We apply this framework to develop an integrated 3D scene understanding system with estimates of surface orientations, occlusion boundaries, objects, camera viewpoint, and relative depth. Our experiments on a set of 300 outdoor images demonstrate that these tasks reinforce each other, and we illustrate a coherent scene understanding with automatically reconstructed 3D models."

Usually, these priors are used post-hoc in the process of resolving feature matches and obtaining final scene estimates, via `first get candidate matches, then resolve' consensus algorithms such as RANSAC. In this paper we show that the dramatically different approach of using priors dynamically to guide a feature by feature matching search can achieve global matching with much fewer image processing operations and lower overall computational cost. Essentially, we put image processing into the loopof the search for global consensus. In particular, our approach is able to cope with significant image ambiguity thanks to a dynamic mixture of Gaussians treatment. In our fully Bayesian algorithm, the choice of the most efficient search action at each step is guided intuitively and rigorously by expected Shannon information gain. We demonstrate the algorithm in feature matching as part of a sequential SLAM system for 3D camera tracking. Robust, real-time matching can be achieved even in the previously unmanageable case of jerky, rapid motion necessitating weak motion modelling and large search regions."

The presence of clutter is a major problem for existing single-view 3D reconstruction algorithms, most of which rely on finding the ground-wall boundary. In most rooms, this boundary is partially or entirely occluded. We gain robustness to clutter by modeling the global room space with a parameteric 3D \u201cbox\u201d and by iteratively localizing clutter and refitting the box. To fit the box, we introduce a structured learning algorithm that chooses the set of parameters to minimize error, based on global perspective cues. On a dataset of 308 images, we demonstrate the ability of our algorithm to recover spatial layout in cluttered rooms and show several examples of estimated free space."

The APO method aims to build a system that has the capability of observing a human performing an assembly task, understanding the task based on the observation, and subsequently generating a robot program to achieve the same task. This paper focuses on the task recognition module (TRM), the main component of a complete APO system. The TRM recognizes object configurations before and after an assembly task, detects a configuration transition, and infers the assembly task that causes such a configuration transition. We assume that each assembly task aims to achieve a face contact relation between an object that has just been manipulated and the stationary environmental objects. We prepare abstract task models that associate transitions of face contact relations with assembly tasks that achieve such transitions. Next, we implement TRM in order to verify two issues: 1) that such a contact transition can be recovered from the output of the object recognizer; and 2) that given these relation transitions, it is possible to use the abstract task models to generate robot motion commands. >"

These are ensembles of decision trees that act directly on image pixels, and therefore do not need the expensive computation of filter-bank responses or local descriptors. They are extremely fast to both train and test, especially compared with k-means clustering and nearest-neighbor assignment of feature descriptors. The nodes in the trees provide (i) an implicit hierarchical clustering into semantic textons, and (ii) an explicit local classification estimate. Our second contribution, the bag of semantic textons, combines a histogram of semantic textons over an image region with a region prior category distribution. The bag of semantic textons is computed over the whole image for categorization, and over local rectangular regions for segmentation. Including both histogram and region prior allows our segmentation algorithm to exploit both textural and semantic context. Our third contribution is an image-level prior for segmentation that emphasizes those categories that the automatic categorization believes to be present. We evaluate on two datasets including the very challenging VOC 2007 segmentation dataset. Our results significantly advance the state-of-the-art in segmentation accuracy, and furthermore, our use of efficient decision forests gives at least a five-fold increase in execution speed."

The chief novelty of this approach rests in its ability to derive an unsupervised contextual prior over image classes from unlabeled test data. Labeled training data is needed only to learn a local appearance model for image patches (although additional supervisory information can optionally be incorporated when it is available). Instead of assuming a parametric prior such as a Markov random field for the class labels, the proposed approach uses the empirical Bayes technique of statistical inversion to recover a contextual model directly from the test data, either as a spatially varying or as a globally constant prior distribution over the classes in the image. Results on two challenging datasets convincingly demonstrate that useful contextual information can indeed be learned from unlabeled data."

We present a framework to transform special classes of multi-label higher order functions to submodular second order Boolean functions (referred to as Fs 2), which can be minimized exactly using graph cuts and we characterize those classes. The basic idea is to use two or more Boolean variables to encode the states of a single multi-label variable. There are many ways in which this can be done and much interesting research lies in finding ways which are optimal or minimal in some sense. We study the space of possible encodings and find the ones that can transform the most general class of functions to Fs 2. Our main contributions are two-fold. First, we extend the subclass of submodular energy functions that can be minimized exactly using graph cuts. Second, we show how higher order potentials can be used to improve single view 3D reconstruction results. We believe that our work on exact minimization of higher order energy functions will lead to similar improvements in solutions of other labelling problems."

Most approaches use co-occurrence of \"nouns\" and image features over large datasets to determine the correspondence, but many correspondence ambiguities remain. We further constrain the correspondence problem by exploiting additional language constructs to improve the learning process from weakly labeled data. We consider both \"prepositions\" and \"comparative adjectives\" which are used to express relationships between objects. If the models of such relationships can be determined, they help resolve correspondence ambiguities. However, learning models of these relationships requires solving the correspondence problem. We simultaneously learn the visual features defining \"nouns\" and the differential visual features defining such \"binary-relationships\" using an EM-based approach."
