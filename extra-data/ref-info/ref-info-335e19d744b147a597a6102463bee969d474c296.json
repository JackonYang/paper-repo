In spite of the prevalence of vectorization and line detection methods, no standard for their performance evaluation protocol exists. We propose a protocol for evaluating both straight and circular line extraction to help compare, select, improve, and even design line detection algorithms to be incorporated into line drawing recognition and understanding systems. The protocol involves both positive and negative sets of indices, at pixel and vector levels. Time efficiency is also included in the protocol. The protocol may be extended to handle lines of any shape as well as other classes of graphic objects.\n"

In designing and building image analysis systems, comparison of several algorithms is often required. Unfortunately, many methods of comparison do not give quantitative performance measurements, but rather qualitative, and often subjective, evaluations. Our key observation is that there is a need for domain, or task-dependent evaluation of the output. By specifying the input data in the same parameter space as the intended output of the system, we are able to evaluate the quality of the output and how well it conforms to the intended representation. We provide a set of basic metrics, but we emphasize that in general, such metrics may be task-specific. In this paper, the performance of three approaches to raster-to-vector conversion \u2014 thinning, medial line finding, and line fitting \u2014 are compared using this methodology."
