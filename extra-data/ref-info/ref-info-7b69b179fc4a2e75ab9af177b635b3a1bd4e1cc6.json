This is a dicult problem due to lighting conditions, variation in font shape and color, and complex backgrounds. We present a word recognition system that addresses these diculties using an innovative technique to extract and recognize foreground text in an image. First, we develop a new method, called bilateral regression, for extracting and modeling one coherent (although not necessarily contiguous) region from an image. The method models smooth color changes across an image region without being corrupted by neighboring image regions. Second, rather than making a hard decision early in the pipeline about which region is foreground, we generate a set of possible foreground hypotheses, and choose among these using feedback from a recognition system. We show increased recognition performance using our segmentation method compared to the current state of the art. Overall, using our system we also show a substantial increase in word accuracy on the word spotting task over the current state of the art on the ICDAR 2003 word recognition data set."

Scene text recognition brings many new challenges. A central limitation of current approaches is a feed-forward, bottom-up, pipelined architecture that isolates the many tasks and information involved in reading. The result is a system that commits errors from which it cannot recover and has components that lack access to relevant information. \nWe propose a system for scene text reading that in its design, training, and operation is more integrated. First, we present a simple contextual model for text detection that is ignorant of any recognition. Through the use of special features and data context, this model performs well on the detection task, but limitations remain due to the lack of interpretation. We then introduce a recognition model that integrates several information sources, including font consistency and a lexicon, and compare it to approaches using pipelined architectures with similar information. Next we examine a more unified detection and recognition framework where features are selected based on the joint task of detection and recognition, rather than each task individually. This approach yields better results with fewer features. Finally, we demonstrate a model that incorporates segmentation and recognition at both the character and word levels. Text with difficult layouts and low resolution are more accurately recognized by this integrated approach. By more tightly coupling several aspects of detection and recognition, we hope to establish a new unified way of approaching the problem that will lead to improved performance. We would like computers to become accomplished grammar-school level readers."

Recognition methods must be robust to this variety or adapt to the query data's characteristics. To achieve this, we augment a semi-Markov model---integrating character segmentation and recognition---with a bigram model of character widths. Softly promoting segmentations that exhibit font metrics consistent with those learned from examples, we use the limited information available while avoiding error-prone direct estimates and hard constraints. Incorporating character width bigrams in this fashion improves recognition on low-resolution images of signs containing text in many fonts."

The problem is significantly more challenging than reading text in scanned documents, and has only recently gained attention from the computer vision community. Sub-components of the problem, such as text detection and cropped image word recognition, have been studied in isolation [7, 4, 20]. However, what is unclear is how these recent approaches contribute to solving the end-to-end problem of word recognition. We fill this gap by constructing and evaluating two systems. The first, representing the de facto state-of-the-art, is a two stage pipeline consisting of text detection followed by a leading OCR engine. The second is a system rooted in generic object recognition, an extension of our previous work in [20]. We show that the latter approach achieves superior performance. While scene text recognition has generally been treated with highly domain-specific methods, our results demonstrate the suitability of applying generic computer vision methods. Adopting this approach opens the door for real world scene text recognition to benefit from the rapid advances that have been taking place in object recognition."

Relative to document recognition, it is challenging because of font variability, minimal language context, and uncontrolled conditions. Much information available to solve this problem is frequently ignored or used sequentially. Similarity between character images is often overlooked as useful information. Because of language priors, a recognizer may assign different labels to identical characters. Directly comparing characters to each other, rather than only a model, helps ensure that similar instances receive the same label. Lexicons improve recognition accuracy but are used post hoc. We introduce a probabilistic model for STR that integrates similarity, language properties, and lexical decision. Inference is accelerated with sparse belief propagation, a bottom-up method for shortening messages by reducing the dependency between weakly supported hypotheses. By fusing information sources in one model, we eliminate unrecoverable errors that result from sequential processing, improving accuracy. In experimental results recognizing text from images of signs in outdoor scenes, incorporating similarity reduces character recognition error by 19 percent, the lexicon reduces word recognition error by 35 percent, and sparse belief propagation reduces the lexicon words considered by 99.9 percent with a 12X speedup and no loss in accuracy."

This paper proposes a novel method to recognize scene texts avoiding the conventional character segmentation step. The idea is to scan the text image with multi-scale windows and apply a robust recognition model, relying on a neural classification approach, to every window in order to recognize valid characters and identify non valid ones. Recognition results are represented as a graph model in order to determine the best sequence of characters. Some linguistic knowledge is also incorporated to remove errors due to recognition confusions. The designed method is evaluated on the ICDAR 2003 database of scene text images and outperforms state-of-the-art approaches."

Recognizing such text is a challenging problem, even more so than the recognition of scanned documents. In this work, we focus on the problem of recognizing text extracted from street images. We present a framework that exploits both bottom-up and top-down cues. The bottom-up cues are derived from individual character detections from the image. We build a Conditional Random Field model on these detections to jointly model the strength of the detections and the interactions between them. We impose top-down cues obtained from a lexicon-based prior, i.e. language statistics, on the model. The optimal word represented by the text image is obtained by minimizing the energy function corresponding to the random field model. We show significant improvements in accuracies on two challenging public datasets, namely Street View Text (over 15%) and ICDAR 2003 (nearly 10%)."

The proposed method is novel, as it (i) departs from a strict feed-forward pipeline and replaces it by a hypothesesverification framework simultaneously processing multiple text line hypotheses, (ii) uses synthetic fonts to train the algorithm eliminating the need for time-consuming acquisition and labeling of real-world training data and (iii) exploits Maximally Stable Extremal Regions (MSERs) which provides robustness to geometric and illumination conditions. \n \nThe performance of the method is evaluated on two standard datasets. On the Char74k dataset, a recognition rate of 72% is achieved, 18% higher than the state-of-the-art. The paper is first to report both text detection and recognition results on the standard and rather challenging ICDAR 2003 dataset.

The real-time performance is achieved by posing the character detection problem as an efficient sequential selection from the set of Extremal Regions (ERs). The ER detector is robust to blur, illumination, color and texture variation and handles low-contrast text. In the first classification stage, the probability of each ER being a character is estimated using novel features calculated with O(1) complexity per region tested. Only ERs with locally maximal probability are selected for the second stage, where the classification is improved using more computationally expensive features. A highly efficient exhaustive search with feedback loops is then applied to group ERs into words and to select the most probable character segmentation. Finally, text is recognized in an OCR stage trained using synthetic fonts. The method was evaluated on two public datasets. On the ICDAR 2011 dataset, the method achieves state-of-the-art text localization results amongst published methods and it is the first one to report results for end-to-end text recognition. On the more challenging Street View Text dataset, the method achieves state-of-the-art recall. The robustness of the proposed method against noise and low contrast of characters is demonstrated by \u201cfalse positives\u201d caused by detected watermark text in the dataset."

This paper presents a novel approach for combining features and relationships within the Conditional Random Field (CRF) framework. By a simple homogeneity measure, an input image is over segmented into perceptually meaningful super pixels and then the text extraction task is formulated as a problem of super pixel labeling. Such a formulation allows us to achieve parameter learning from training images and probabilistic inferences by combining all the features and relationships of the input image. The proposed method shows high performance, in terms of quality, on both the KAIST scene text DB and the ICDAR 2003 DB."

The proposed method consists of two WFSTs called WFST-OCR and WFST-Lexicon. WFST-OCR handles the multiple hypotheses caused by erroneous text location, character segmentation and character recognition processes. The following WFST-Lexicon and its convolution of WFST-OCR resolve the hypotheses. The WFSTs integrate the conventional OCR and post-processing processes into one process. The benefit from the proposed method is that all the ambiguities are held as WFST data, and solved in one integrated step, the system outputs texts that are statistically consistent with regard to segmentation possibilities and the given language model. An experimental system demonstrates practical performance in spite of the hypothesis complexity inherent in the ICDAR test set and Kanji character texts."

At one end of the spectrum, Optical Character Recognition (OCR) applied to scanned pages of well formatted printed text is one of the most successful applications of computer vision to date. At the other extreme lie visual CAPTCHAs - text that is constructed explicitly to fool computer vision algorithms. Both tasks involve recognizing text, yet one is nearly solved while the other remains extremely challenging. In this work, we argue that the appearance of words in the wild spans this range of difficulties and propose a new word recognition approach based on state-of-the-art methods from generic object recognition, in which we consider object categories to be the words themselves. We compare performance of leading OCR engines - one open source and one proprietary - with our new approach on the ICDAR Robust Reading data set and a new word spotting data set we introduce in this paper: the Street View Text data set. We show improvements of up to 16% on the data sets, demonstrating the feasibility of a new approach to a seemingly old problem."

Challenge 2 of the competition dealt specifically with detecting/recognizing text in natural scene images. This paper presents an overview of the approaches that the participants used, the evaluation measure, and the dataset used in the Challenge 2 of the contest. We also report the performance of all participating methods for text localization and word recognition tasks and compare their results using standard methods of area precision/recall and edit distance."

To have better accuracy, this paper presents a new gradient based method for words and character segmentation from text line of any orientation in video frames for recognition. We propose a Max-Min clustering concept to obtain text cluster from the normalized absolute gradient feature matrix of the video text line image. Union of the text cluster with the output of Canny operation of the input video text line is proposed to restore missing text candidates. Then a run length algorithm is applied on the text candidate image for identifying word gaps. We propose a new idea for segmenting characters from the restored word image based on the fact that the text height difference at the character boundary column is smaller than that of the other columns of the word image. We have conducted experiments on a large dataset at two levels (word and character level) in terms of recall, precision and f-measure. Our experimental setup involves 3527 characters of English and Chinese, and this dataset is selected from TRECVID database of 2005 and 2006."

A Conditional Random Field (CRF) model, considering the unary component property as well as binary neighboring component relationship, is then presented to label components as \"text\" or \"non-text\". Last, text components are grouped into text lines with an energy minimization approach. Experimental results show that the proposed method gives promising performance comparing with the existing methods on ICDAR 2003 competition dataset."

Recently, condition random field (CRF) has been used to give connected components (CCs) 'text' or 'non-text' labels. However, a burning issue in CRF model comes from multiple text lines extraction. In this paper, we propose a two-step iterative CRF algorithm with a Belief Propagation inference and an OCR filtering stage. Two kinds of neighborhood relationship graph are used in the respective iterations for extracting multiple text lines. Furthermore, OCR confidence is used as an indicator for identifying the text regions, while a traditional OCR filter module only considered the recognition results. The first CRF iteration aims at finding certain text CCs, especially in multiple text lines, and sending uncertain CCs to the second iteration. The second iteration gives second chance for the uncertain CCs and filter false alarm CCs with the help of OCR. Experiments based on the public dataset of ICDAR 2005 prove that the proposed method is comparative with the existing algorithms."

However, locating text from a complex background with multiple colors is a challenging task. In this paper, we explore a new framework to detect text strings with arbitrary orientations in complex natural scene images. Our proposed framework of text string detection consists of two steps: 1) image partition to find text character candidates based on local gradient features and color uniformity of character components and 2) character candidate grouping to detect text strings based on joint structural features of text characters in each text string such as character size differences, distances between neighboring characters, and character alignment. By assuming that a text string has at least three characters, we propose two algorithms of text string detection: 1) adjacent character grouping method and 2) text line grouping method. The adjacent character grouping method calculates the sibling groups of each character candidate as string segments and then merges the intersecting sibling groups into text string. The text line grouping method performs Hough transform to fit text line among the centroids of text candidates. Each fitted text line describes the orientation of a potential text string. The detected text string is presented by a rectangle region covering all characters whose centroids are cascaded in its text line. To improve efficiency and accuracy, our algorithms are carried out in multi-scales. The proposed methods outperform the state-of-the-art results on the public Robust Reading Dataset, which contains text only in horizontal orientation. Furthermore, the effectiveness of our methods to detect text strings with arbitrary orientations is evaluated on the Oriented Scene Text Dataset collected by ourselves containing text strings in nonhorizontal orientations."

The algorithm is intended for use by blind and visually impaired subjects walking through city scenes. We first obtain a dataset of city images taken by blind and normally sighted subjects. From this dataset, we manually label and extract the text regions. Next we perform statistical analysis of the text regions to determine which image features are reliable indicators of text and have low entropy (i.e. feature response is similar for all text images). We obtain weak classifiers by using joint probabilities for feature responses on and off text. These weak classifiers are used as input to an AdaBoost machine learning algorithm to train a strong classifier. In practice, we trained a cascade with 4 strong classifiers containing 79 features. An adaptive binarization and extension algorithm is applied to those regions selected by the cascade classifier. Commercial OCR software is used to read the text or reject it as a non-text region. The overall algorithm has a success rate of over 90% (evaluated by complete detection and reading of the text) on the test set and the unread text is typically small and distant from the viewer."

In order to address these problems, we propose a new cost function that considers the interactions between text lines and the curvilinearity of each text line. Precisely, we achieve this goal by introducing normalized measures for them, which are based on an estimated line spacing. We also present an optimization method that exploits the properties of our cost function. Experimental results on a database consisting of 853 handwritten Chinese document images have shown that our method achieves a detection rate of 99.52% and an error rate of 0.32%, which outperforms conventional methods."

With the rapid growth in research over thelast few years on recognizing text in natural scenes, thereis an urgent need to establish some common benchmarkdatasets, and gain a clear understanding of the current stateof the art. We use the term robust reading to refer to text imagesthat are beyond the capabilities of current commercialOCR packages. We chose to break down the robust readingproblem into three sub-problems, and run competitionsfor each stage, and also a competition for the best overallsystem. The sub-problems we chose were text locating,character recognition and word recognition.By breaking down the problem in this way, we hope togain a better understanding of the state of the art in eachof the sub-problems. Furthermore, our methodology involvesstoring detailed results of applying each algorithm toeach image in the data sets, allowing researchers to study indepth the strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm. Thetext locating contest was the only one to have any entries.We report the results of this contest, and show cases wherethe leading algorithms succeed and fail."

One example is the similarity between the elements from a novel source, such as a speaker, writer, or printed font. By comparing instances emitted by a source, we help ensure that similar instances are given the same label. Previous approaches have clustered instances prior to recognition. We propose a probabilistic framework that unifies similarity with prior identity and contextual information. By fusing information sources in a single model, we eliminate unrecoverable errors that result from processing the information in separate stages and improve overall accuracy. The framework also naturally integrates dissimilarity information, which has previously been ignored. We demonstrate with an application in printed character recognition from images of signs in natural scenes."

The system is conceptually simple, and straightforward to implement. It involves three stages of processing. The first stage extracts row-regions from the image, where each row is a hypothesized line of text. The next stage scans an OCR classifier over each row image, creating a character hypothesis graph in the process. This graph is then searched using a priority-queue based algorithm for the best matches with a set of words (lexicon). Performance evaluation on a set of museum archive cards indicates competitive accuracy and also reasonable throughput. The priority queue algorithm is over two hundred times faster than using flat dynamic programming on these graphs."

Thanks to effective pruning, it is able to exhaustively search the space of all character sequences in real time (200ms on a 640x480 image). The method exploits higher-order properties of text such as word text lines. We demonstrate that the grouping stage plays a key role in the text localization performance and that a robust and precise grouping stage is able to compensate errors of the character detector. The method includes a novel selector of Maximally Stable Extremal Regions (MSER) which exploits region topology. Experimental validation shows that 95.7% characters in the ICDAR dataset are detected using the novel selector of MSERs with a low sensitivity threshold. The proposed method was evaluated on the standard ICDAR 2003 dataset where it achieved state-of-the-art results in both text localization and recognition."

We represent the pixels in a document image as random variables in an MRF, and introduce a new energy (or cost) function on these variables. Each variable takes a foreground or background label, and the quality of the binarization (or labelling) is determined by the value of the energy function. We minimize the energy function, i.e. find the optimal binarization, using an iterative graph cut scheme. Our model is robust to variations in foreground and background colours as we use a Gaussian Mixture Model in the energy function. In addition, our algorithm is efficient to compute, and adapts to a variety of document images. We show results on word images from the challenging ICDAR 2003 dataset, and compare our performance with previously reported methods. Our approach shows significant improvement in pixel level accuracy as well as OCR accuracy."

Under the general integrated segmentation-and-recognition framework with character oversegmentation, we investigate three important issues: candidate path evaluation, path search, and parameter estimation. For path evaluation, we combine multiple contexts (character recognition scores, geometric and linguistic contexts) from the Bayesian decision view, and convert the classifier outputs to posterior probabilities via confidence transformation. In path search, we use a refined beam search algorithm to improve the search efficiency and, meanwhile, use a candidate character augmentation strategy to improve the recognition accuracy. The combining weights of the path evaluation function are optimized by supervised learning using a Maximum Character Accuracy criterion. We evaluated the recognition performance on a Chinese handwriting database CASIA-HWDB, which contains nearly four million character samples of 7,356 classes and 5,091 pages of unconstrained handwritten texts. The experimental results show that confidence transformation and combining multiple contexts improve the text line recognition performance significantly. On a test set of 1,015 handwritten pages, the proposed approach achieved character-level accurate rate of 90.75 percent and correct rate of 91.39 percent, which are superior by far to the best results reported in the literature."

In this paper, a method is proposed for segmenting colour natural scene texts which suffer from a wide range of degradations with complex background. A text image is firstly processed by two 3-means clustering operations with different distance measurements. Then, a modified connected component (CC)-based validation method is used to obtain the text area after clustering. Thirdly, a proposed objective segmentation evaluation method is utilised to choose the final segmentation result from the two segmented text images. The proposed method is compared with other existing methods based on the ICDAR2003 public database. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method."

The address phrases are recognized as a whole because there is no extra space between words. The lexicon contains 111,349 address phrases, which are stored in a trie structure. In recognition, the text line image is matched with the lexicon entries (phrases) to obtain reliable segmentation and retrieve valid address phrases. The paper first introduces some effective techniques for text line image preprocessing and presegmentation. In presegmentation, the text line image is separated into primitive segments by connected component analysis and touching pattern splitting based on contour shape analysis. In lexicon matching, consecutive segments are dynamically combined into candidate character patterns. An accurate character classifier is embedded in lexicon matching to select characters matched with a candidate pattern from a dynamic category set. A beam search strategy is used to control the lexicon matching so as to achieve real-time recognition. In experiments on 3,589 live mail images, the proposed method achieved correct rate of 83.68 percent while the error rate is less than 1 percent."

Three key technologies are required for this system: text detection, optical character recognition, and speech synthesis. Blind users and the mobile environment imply two strong constraints. First, pictures will be taken without control on camera settings and a priori information on text (font or size) and background. The second issue is to link several techniques together with an optimal compromise between computational constraints and recognition efficiency. We will present the overall description of the system from text detection to OCR error correction."

The proposed approach embeds multiresolution and multiscale edge detection, adaptive searching, color analysis, and affine rectification in a hierarchical framework for sign detection, with different emphases at each phase to handle the text in different sizes, orientations, color distributions and backgrounds. We use affine rectification to recover deformation of the text regions caused by an inappropriate camera view angle. The procedure can significantly improve text detection rate and optical character recognition (OCR) accuracy. Instead of using binary information for OCR, we extract features from an intensity image directly. We propose a local intensity normalization method to effectively handle lighting variations, followed by a Gabor transform to obtain local features, and finally a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) method for feature selection. We have applied the approach in developing a Chinese sign translation system, which can automatically detect and recognize Chinese signs as input from a camera, and translate the recognized text into English."

In this paper, by investigating the properties of single characters and text objects, we propose a new text extraction approach for scene images. First, character energy is computed based on the similarity of stroke edges to detect candidate character regions, then link energy is calculated based on the spatial relationship and similarity between neighboring candidate character regions to group characters and eliminate false positives. We applied the approach on ICDAR dataset 2003. The experimental results demonstrate the validity of our method."

Scene images are segmented into regions by an image segmentation method based on adaptive thresholding. Character candidate regions are detected by observing gray-level differences between adjacent regions. To ensure extraction of multisegment characters as well as single-segment characters, character pattern candidates are obtained by associating the detected regions according to their positions and gray levels. A character recognition process selects patterns with high similarities by calculating the similarities between character pattern candidates and the standard patterns in a dictionary and then comparing the similarities to the thresholds. A relaxational approach to determine character patterns updates the similarities by evaluating the interactions between categories of patterns, and finally character patterns and their recognition results are obtained. Highly promising experimental results have been obtained using the method on 100 images involving characters of different sizes and formats under uncontrolled lighting. >"

Touch TT then automatically estimates the text color and roughly locates the text regions. By inferring text characteristics from the estimated text color and text region, Touch TT can extract text components. Touch TT can also handle partially drawn lines which cover only a small section of text area. The proposed system achieves reasonable accuracy for text extraction from moderately difficult examples from the ICDAR 2003 database and our own database."

The first two modules are based on convolutional neural networks so that the proposed system automatically learns how to robustly perform segmentation and recognition. The proposed method is evaluated on the public ICDAR 2003 test word dataset."

The main result is that the leading 2005 entry has improved significantly on the leading 2003 entry, with an increase in average f-score from 0.5 to 0.62, where the f-score is the same adapted information retrieval measure used for the 2003 competition. The paper also discusses the Web-based deployment and evaluation of text locating systems, and one of the leading entries has now been deployed in this way. This mode of usage could lead to more complete and more immediate knowledge of the strengths and weaknesses of each newly developed system."

This paper describes a set of concrete bestpractices that document analysis researchers can use toget good results with neural networks. The mostimportant practice is getting a training set as large aspossible: we expand the training set by adding a newform of distorted data. The next most important practiceis that convolutional neural networks are better suited forvisual document tasks than fully connected networks. Wepropose that a simple \"do-it-yourself\" implementation ofconvolution with a flexible architecture is suitable formany visual document problems. This simpleconvolutional neural network does not require complexmethods, such as momentum, weight decay, structure-dependentlearning rates, averaging layers, tangent prop,or even finely-tuning the architecture. The end result is avery simple yet general architecture which can yieldstate-of-the-art performance for document analysis. Weillustrate our claims on the MNIST set of English digitimages."

A new segmentation algorithm based on mathematical morphology is used to translate the 2-D image into a 1-D sequence of sub-character symbols. This sequence of symbols is modeled by the CDVDHMM. Generally, there are two information sources associated with the written text. While the shape information of each character symbol is modeled as a mixture Gaussian distribution, the linguistic knowledge, i.e., constraint, is modeled as a Markov chain. In this context, the variable duration state is used to take care of the segmentation ambiguity among the consecutive characters. Some experimental results are described to demonstrate the success of the proposed scheme.<<ETX>>"

Given an appropriate network architecture, gradient-based learning algorithms can be used to synthesize a complex decision surface that can classify high-dimensional patterns, such as handwritten characters, with minimal preprocessing. This paper reviews various methods applied to handwritten character recognition and compares them on a standard handwritten digit recognition task. Convolutional neural networks, which are specifically designed to deal with the variability of 2D shapes, are shown to outperform all other techniques. Real-life document recognition systems are composed of multiple modules including field extraction, segmentation recognition, and language modeling. A new learning paradigm, called graph transformer networks (GTN), allows such multimodule systems to be trained globally using gradient-based methods so as to minimize an overall performance measure. Two systems for online handwriting recognition are described. Experiments demonstrate the advantage of global training, and the flexibility of graph transformer networks. A graph transformer network for reading a bank cheque is also described. It uses convolutional neural network character recognizers combined with global training techniques to provide record accuracy on business and personal cheques. It is deployed commercially and reads several million cheques per day."

The first is generation of tentatively binarized images via every dichotomization of k clusters obtained by k-means clustering in the HSI color space. The total number of tentatively binarized images equals 2^k\u22122. The second is use of support vector machines (SVM) to determine whether and to what degree each tentatively binarized image represents a character or non-character. We feed the SVM with mesh and weighted direction code histogram features to output the degree of \u201ccharacter-likeness.\u201d The third is selection of a single binarized image with the maximum degree of \u201ccharacter likeness\u201d as an optimal binarization result. Experiments using a total of 1000 single-character color images extracted from the ICDAR 2003 robust OCR dataset show that the proposed method achieves a correct binarization rate of 93.7%."

Firstly, it designs effective and well balanced Markov Chain dynamics to explore the solution space and makes the split and merge process reversible at a middle level vision formulation. Thus it achieves globally optimal solution independent of initial segmentations. Secondly, instead of computing a single maximum a posteriori solution, it proposes a mathematical principle for computing multiple distinct solutions to incorporates intrinsic ambiguities in image segmentation. A k-adventurers algorithm is proposed for extracting distinct multiple solutions from the Markov chain sequence. Thirdly, it utilizes data-driven (bottom-up) techniques, such as clustering and edge detection, to compute importance proposal probabilities, which effectively drive the Markov chain dynamics and achieve tremendous speedup in comparison to traditional jump-diffusion method. Thus DDM-CMC paradigm provides a unifying framework where the role of existing segmentation algorithms, such as; edge detection, clustering, region growing, split-merge, SNAKEs, region competition, are revealed as either realizing Markov chain dynamics or computing importance proposal probabilities. We report some results on color and grey level image segmentation in this paper and refer to a detailed report and a web site for extensive discussion."

In this paper, we present an approximate training algorithm called piecewise training (PW) that divides the factors into tractable subgraphs, which we call pieces, that are trained independently. Piecewise training can be interpreted as approximating the exact likelihood using belief propagation, and different ways of making this interpretation yield different insights into the method. We also present an extension to piecewise training, called piecewise pseudolikelihood (PWPL), designed for when variables have large cardinality. On several real-world natural language processing tasks, piecewise training performs superior to Besag\u2019s pseudolikelihood and sometimes comparably to exact maximum likelihood. In addition, PWPL performs similarly to PW and superior to standard pseudolikelihood, but is five to ten times more computationally efficient than batch maximum likelihood training."

In this paper, the Bayesian approach to regularization and model-comparison is demonstrated by studying the inference problem of interpolating noisy data. The concepts and methods described are quite general and can be applied to many other data modeling problems. Regularizing constants are set by examining their posterior probability distribution. Alternative regularizers (priors) and alternative basis sets are objectively compared by evaluating the evidence for them. Occam's razor is automatically embodied by this process. The way in which Bayes infers the values of regularizing constants and noise levels has an elegant interpretation in terms of the effective number of parameters determined by the data set. This framework is due to Gull and Skilling."

Weight decay has a Bayesian interpretation with the decay function corresponding to a prior over weights. The method of transformation groups and maximum entropy suggests a Laplace rather than a gaussian prior. After training, the weights then arrange themselves into two classes: (1) those with a common sensitivity to the data error and (2) those failing to achieve this sensitivity and that therefore vanish. Since the critical value is determined adaptively during training, pruningin the sense of setting weights to exact zerosbecomes an automatic consequence of regularization alone. The count of free parameters is also reduced automatically as weights are pruned. A comparison is made with results of MacKay using the evidence framework and a gaussian regularizer."

Inference consists in clamping the value of observed variables and finding config urations of the remaining variables that minimize the energy. Learning consists in finding an energy function in which observed configurations of the variables a re given lower energies than unobserved ones. The EBM approach provides a common theoretical framework for many learning models, including traditional discr iminative and generative approaches, as well as graph-transformer networks, co nditional random fields, maximum margin Markov networks, and several manifold learning methods. Probabilistic models must be properly normalized, which sometimes requires evaluating intractable integrals over the space of all poss ible variable configurations. Since EBMs have no requirement for proper normalization, this problem is naturally circumvented. EBMs can be viewed as a form of non-probabilistic factor graphs, and they provide considerably more flexibility in th e design of architectures and training criteria than probabilistic approaches ."
