Text in real world environments appears in arbitrary colors, font sizes and typefaces, often affected by perspective distortion, lighting effects, textures or occlusion. Currently there is no dataset publicly available that covers all aspects of natural image OCR. A comprehensive well-annotated configurable dataset for optical character recognition in natural images is defined and created for the evaluation and comparison of approaches tackling with natural-image text OCR. Furthermore, current open source and commercial OCR tools have been analyzed in various test scenarios using the proposed NEOCR dataset. Based on the results further steps to be addressed by the OCR community are concluded towards allembracing natural-image text recognition."

In particular, we focus on recognizing characters in situations that would traditionally not be handled well by OCR techniques. We present an annotated database of images containing English and Kannada characters. The database comprises of images of street scenes taken in Bangalore, India using a standard camera. The problem is addressed in an object cateogorization framework based on a bag-of-visual-words representation. We assess the performance of various features based on nearest neighbour and SVM classification. It is demonstrated that the performance of the proposed method, using as few as 15 training images, can be far superior to that of commercial OCR systems. Furthermore, the method can benefit from synthetically generated training data obviating the need for expensive data collection and annotation."

At one end of the spectrum, Optical Character Recognition (OCR) applied to scanned pages of well formatted printed text is one of the most successful applications of computer vision to date. At the other extreme lie visual CAPTCHAs - text that is constructed explicitly to fool computer vision algorithms. Both tasks involve recognizing text, yet one is nearly solved while the other remains extremely challenging. In this work, we argue that the appearance of words in the wild spans this range of difficulties and propose a new word recognition approach based on state-of-the-art methods from generic object recognition, in which we consider object categories to be the words themselves. We compare performance of leading OCR engines - one open source and one proprietary - with our new approach on the ICDAR Robust Reading data set and a new word spotting data set we introduce in this paper: the Street View Text data set. We show improvements of up to 16% on the data sets, demonstrating the feasibility of a new approach to a seemingly old problem."

Such data is useful for supervised learning and quantitative evaluation. To achieve this, we developed a web-based tool that allows easy image annotation and instant sharing of such annotations. Using this annotation tool, we have collected a large dataset that spans many object categories, often containing multiple instances over a wide variety of images. We quantify the contents of the dataset and compare against existing state of the art datasets used for object recognition and detection. Also, we show how to extend the dataset to automatically enhance object labels with WordNet, discover object parts, recover a depth ordering of objects in a scene, and increase the number of labels using minimal user supervision and images from the web.\n"

Extensive testing shows that the suggested scheme outperforms the latest published algorithms. Its simplicity allows the algorithm to detect texts in many fonts and languages."

In this paper, we describe a multimodal fusion scheme which improves the image classification accuracy by incorporating the information derived from the embedded texts detected in the image under classification. Specific to each image category, a text concept is first learned from a set of labeled texts in images of the target category using Multiple Instance Learning [1]. For an image under classification which contains multiple detected text lines, we calculate a weighted Euclidian distance between each text line and the learned text concept of the target category. Subsequently, the minimum distance, along with low-level visual cues, are jointly used as the features for SVM-based classification. Experiments on a challenging image database demonstrate that the proposed fusion framework achieves a higher accuracy than the state-of-art methods for image classification."

Relative to document recognition, it is challenging because of font variability, minimal language context, and uncontrolled conditions. Much information available to solve this problem is frequently ignored or used sequentially. Similarity between character images is often overlooked as useful information. Because of language priors, a recognizer may assign different labels to identical characters. Directly comparing characters to each other, rather than only a model, helps ensure that similar instances receive the same label. Lexicons improve recognition accuracy but are used post hoc. We introduce a probabilistic model for STR that integrates similarity, language properties, and lexical decision. Inference is accelerated with sparse belief propagation, a bottom-up method for shortening messages by reducing the dependency between weakly supported hypotheses. By fusing information sources in one model, we eliminate unrecoverable errors that result from sequential processing, improving accuracy. In experimental results recognizing text from images of signs in outdoor scenes, incorporating similarity reduces character recognition error by 19 percent, the lexicon reduces word recognition error by 35 percent, and sparse belief propagation reduces the lexicon words considered by 99.9 percent with a 12X speedup and no loss in accuracy."

Digital cameras attached to cellular phones, PDAs, or wearable computers, and standalone image or video devices are highly mobile and easy to use; they can capture images of thick books, historical manuscripts too fragile to touch, and text in scenes, making them much more versatile than desktop scanners. Should robust solutions to the analysis of documents captured with such devices become available, there will clearly be a demand in many domains. Traditional scanner-based document analysis techniques provide us with a good reference and starting point, but they cannot be used directly on camera-captured images. Camera-captured images can suffer from low resolution, blur, and perspective distortion, as well as complex layout and interaction of the content and background. In this paper we present a survey of application domains, technical challenges, and solutions for the analysis of documents captured by digital cameras. We begin by describing typical imaging devices and the imaging process. We discuss document analysis from a single camera-captured image as well as multiple frames and highlight some sample applications under development and feasible ideas for future development."

With the rapid growth in research over the last few years on recognizing text in natural scenes, there is an urgent need to establish some common benchmark datasets and gain a clear understanding of the current state of the art. We use the term \u2018robust reading\u2019 to refer to text images that are beyond the capabilities of current commercial OCR packages. We chose to break down the robust reading problem into three subproblems and run competitions for each stage, and also a competition for the best overall system. The subproblems we chose were text locating, character recognition and word recognition. By breaking down the problem in this way, we hoped to gain a better understanding of the state of the art in each of the subproblems. Furthermore, our methodology involved storing detailed results of applying each algorithm to each image in the datasets, allowing researchers to study in depth the strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm. The text-locating contest was the only one to have any entries. We give a brief description of each entry and present the results of this contest, showing cases where the leading entries succeed and fail. We also describe an algorithm for combining the outputs of the individual text locators and show how the combination scheme improves on any of the individual systems."

While existing search engines index a page based on the text that is readily extracted from its HTML encoding, an increasing amount of the information on the Web is embedded in images. This situation presents a new and exciting challenge for the fields of document analysis and information retrieval, as WWW image text is typically rendered in color and at very low spatial resolutions. In this paper, we survey the results of several years of our work in the area. For the problem of locating text in Web images, we describe a procedure based on clustering in color space followed by a connected-components analysis that seems promising. For character recognition, we discuss techniques using polynomial surface fitting and \u201cfuzzy\u201d n-tuple classifiers. Also presented are the results of several experiments that demonstrate where our methods perform well and where more work needs to be done. We conclude with a discussion of topics for further research."

With the rapid growth in research over thelast few years on recognizing text in natural scenes, thereis an urgent need to establish some common benchmarkdatasets, and gain a clear understanding of the current stateof the art. We use the term robust reading to refer to text imagesthat are beyond the capabilities of current commercialOCR packages. We chose to break down the robust readingproblem into three sub-problems, and run competitionsfor each stage, and also a competition for the best overallsystem. The sub-problems we chose were text locating,character recognition and word recognition.By breaking down the problem in this way, we hope togain a better understanding of the state of the art in eachof the sub-problems. Furthermore, our methodology involvesstoring detailed results of applying each algorithm toeach image in the data sets, allowing researchers to study indepth the strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm. Thetext locating contest was the only one to have any entries.We report the results of this contest, and show cases wherethe leading algorithms succeed and fail."

OCR application on mobile devices is no longer a dream due to the advancement in mobile technology. There are many ongoing researches in this field. Most of the researches focus on the OCR engine of the application and there is not much focus on the processing stage of the OCR application. Pre-processing plays a major role in optimizing the image for character recognition. Thus, in this paper, two pre-processing techniques are proposed for the mobile OCR application. The first technique helps to locate a sign in a natural image efficiently, while the second technique implements Otsu's threshold algorithm to convert images into binary image. These techniques are implemented in an OCR mobile application which is developed using desktop open sources library. After implementation, the OCR application is tested with 50 sign images to verify the accuracy. Experimental results have demonstrated that these techniques can significantly improve the OCR accuracy and decrease the overall computation time."

The method is based on a segmentation energy defined over all images at the same time, which can be optimized efficiently by techniques used before in interactive segmentation. Over iterations, our method progressively learns a class model by integrating observations over all images. In addition to appearance, this model captures the location and shape of the class with respect to an automatically determined coordinate frame common across images. This frame allows us to build stronger shape and location models, similar to those used in object class detection. Our method is inspired by interactive segmentation methods [1], but it is fully automatic and learns models characteristic for the object class rather than specific to one particular object/image. We experimentally demonstrate on the Caltech4, Caltech101, and Weizmann horses datasets that our method (a) transfers class knowledge across images and this improves results compared to segmenting every image independently; (b) outperforms Grabcut [1] for the task of unsupervised segmentation; (c) offers competitive performance compared to the state-of-the-art in unsupervised segmentation and in particular it outperforms the topic model [2]."

First, the framework applies a Divide-and-Conquer strategy to decompose the original task into two sub-tasks, that is, localization of road signs and detection of text. The algorithms for the two sub-tasks are smoothly incorporated into a unified framework through a real time tracking algorithm. Second, the framework provides a novel way for text detection from video by integrating 2D features in each video frame (e.g., color, edges, texture) with 3D information available in a video sequence (e.g., object structure). The feasibility of the proposed framework has been evaluated on the video sequences captured from a moving vehicle. The new framework can be applied to a driving assistant system and other tasks of text detection from video."
