The resulting feature extractor consists of multiple convolution filters, followed by a feature-pooling layer that computes the max of each filter output within adjacent windows, and a point-wise sigmoid non-linearity. A second level of larger and more invariant features is obtained by training the same algorithm on patches of features from the first level. Training a supervised classifier on these features yields 0.64% error on MNIST, and 54% average recognition rate on Caltech 101 with 30 training samples per category. While the resulting architecture is similar to convolutional networks, the layer-wise unsupervised training procedure alleviates the over-parameterization problems that plague purely supervised learning procedures, and yields good performance with very few labeled training samples."

As in that work, we first apply Gabor filters at all positions and scales; feature complexity and position/scale invariance are then built up by alternating template matching and max pooling operations. We refine the approach in several biologically plausible ways, using simple versions of sparsification and lateral inhibition. We demonstrate the value of retaining some position and scale information above the intermediate feature level. Using feature selection we arrive at a model that performs better with fewer features. Our final model is tested on the Caltech 101 object categories and the UIUC car localization task, in both cases achieving state-of-the-art performance. The results strengthen the case for using this class of model in computer vision."

Each element of this set is a complex feature obtained by combining position- and scale-tolerant edge-detectors over neighboring positions and multiple orientations. Our system's architecture is motivated by a quantitative model of visual cortex. We show that our approach exhibits excellent recognition performance and outperforms several state-of-the-art systems on a variety of image datasets including many different object categories. We also demonstrate that our system is able to learn from very few examples. The performance of the approach constitutes a suggestive plausibility proof for a class of feedforward models of object recognition in cortex."

We present a hybrid system where a convolutional network is trained to detect and recognize generic objects, and a Gaussian-kernel SVM is trained from the features learned by the convolutional network. Results are given on a large generic object recognition task with six categories (human figures, four-legged animals, airplanes, trucks, cars, and \"none of the above\"), with multiple instances of each object category under various poses, illuminations, and backgrounds. On the test set, which contains different object instances than the training set, an SVM alone yields a 43.3% error rate, a convolutional net alone yields 7.2% and an SVM on top of features produced by the convolutional net yields 5.9%."

A large dataset comprising stereo image pairs of 50 uniform-colored toys under 36 azimuths, 9 elevations, and 6 lighting conditions was collected (for a total of 194,400 individual images). The objects were 10 instances of 5 generic categories: four-legged animals, human figures, airplanes, trucks, and cars. Five instances of each category were used for training, and the other five for testing. Low-resolution grayscale images of the objects with various amounts of variability and surrounding clutter were used for training and testing. Nearest neighbor methods, support vector machines, and convolutional networks, operating on raw pixels or on PCA-derived features were tested. Test error rates for unseen object instances placed on uniform backgrounds were around 13% for SVM and 7% for convolutional nets. On a segmentation/recognition task with highly cluttered images, SVM proved impractical, while convolutional nets yielded 16/7% error. A real-time version of the system was implemented that can detect and classify objects in natural scenes at around 10 frames per second."

We study the influence of each stage of the computation on performance, concluding that fine-scale gradients, fine orientation binning, relatively coarse spatial binning, and high-quality local contrast normalization in overlapping descriptor blocks are all important for good results. The new approach gives near-perfect separation on the original MIT pedestrian database, so we introduce a more challenging dataset containing over 1800 annotated human images with a large range of pose variations and backgrounds."

The top-level model is a third-order Boltzmann machine, trained using a hybrid algorithm that combines both generative and discriminative gradients. Performance is evaluated on the NORB database (normalized-uniform version), which contains stereo-pair images of objects under different lighting conditions and viewpoints. Our model achieves 6.5% error on the test set, which is close to the best published result for NORB (5.9%) using a convolutional neural net that has built-in knowledge of translation invariance. It substantially outperforms shallow models such as SVMs (11.6%). DBNs are especially suited for semi-supervised learning, and to demonstrate this we consider a modified version of the NORB recognition task in which additional unlabeled images are created by applying small translations to the images in the database. With the extra unlabeled data (and the same amount of labeled data as before), our model achieves 5.2% error."

While feature-learning machines in the form of hierarchial feed-forward models (e.g., convolutional neural networks) showed promise in this direction, they are still difficult to train especially when few training examples are available. In this paper, we present a framework for training hierarchical feed-forward models for visual recognition, using transfer learning from pseudo tasks. These pseudo tasks are automatically constructed from data without supervision and comprise a set of simple pattern-matching operations. We show that these pseudo tasks induce an informative inverse-Wishart prior on the functional behavior of the network, offering an effective way to incorporate useful prior knowledge into the network training. In addition to being extremely simple to implement, and adaptable across different domains with little or no extra tuning, our approach achieves promising results on challenging visual recognition tasks, including object recognition, gender recognition, and ethnicity recognition."

Specifically, our proposed method exceeds the state of the art on the Caltech-101 database and achieves high accuracy on a large database of fifteen natural scene categories.

The system can differentiate outdoor scenes from various sites on a college campus using a multiscale set of early-visual features, which capture the \"gist\" of the scene into a low-dimensional signature vector. Distinct from previous approaches, the algorithm presents the advantage of being biologically plausible and of having low-computational complexity, sharing its low-level features with a model for visual attention that may operate concurrently on a robot. We compare classification accuracy using scenes filmed at three outdoor sites on campus (13,965 to 34,711 frames per site). Dividing each site into nine segments, we obtain segment classification rates between 84.21 percent and 88.62 percent. Combining scenes from all sites (75,073 frames in total) yields 86.45 percent correct classification, demonstrating the generalization and scalability of the approach"

The next most important practiceis that convolutional neural networks are better suited forvisual document tasks than fully connected networks. Wepropose that a simple \"do-it-yourself\" implementation ofconvolution with a flexible architecture is suitable formany visual document problems. This simpleconvolutional neural network does not require complexmethods, such as momentum, weight decay, structure-dependentlearning rates, averaging layers, tangent prop,or even finely-tuning the architecture. The end result is avery simple yet general architecture which can yieldstate-of-the-art performance for document analysis. Weillustrate our claims on the MNIST set of English digitimages."

Usually, these priors are used post-hoc in the process of resolving feature matches and obtaining final scene estimates, via `first get candidate matches, then resolve' consensus algorithms such as RANSAC. In this paper we show that the dramatically different approach of using priors dynamically to guide a feature by feature matching search can achieve global matching with much fewer image processing operations and lower overall computational cost. Essentially, we put image processing into the loopof the search for global consensus. In particular, our approach is able to cope with significant image ambiguity thanks to a dynamic mixture of Gaussians treatment. In our fully Bayesian algorithm, the choice of the most efficient search action at each step is guided intuitively and rigorously by expected Shannon information gain. We demonstrate the algorithm in feature matching as part of a sequential SLAM system for 3D camera tracking. Robust, real-time matching can be achieved even in the previously unmanageable case of jerky, rapid motion necessitating weak motion modelling and large search regions."

We describe a new hierarchical model consistent with physiological data from inferotemporal cortex that accounts for this complex visual task and makes testable predictions.

The method employs a convolutional network to map face images to points on a manifold, parametrized by pose, and non-face images to points far from that manifold. This network is trained by optimizing a loss function of three variables: image, pose, and face/non-face label. We test the resulting system, in a single configuration, on three standard data sets - one for frontal pose, one for rotated faces, and one for profiles - and find that its performance on each set is comparable to previous multi-view face detectors that can only handle one form of pose variation. We also show experimentally that the system's accuracy on both face detection and pose estimation is improved by training for the two tasks together."

Even if one of the patterns to which the model is paying selective attention is affected by noise or defects, the model can recall the complete pattern from which the noise has been eliminated and the defects corrected. It is not necessary for perfect recall that the stimulus pattern should be identical in shape to the training pattern. Even though the pattern is distorted in shape or changed in size, it can be correctly recognized and the missing portions restored.The model consists of a hierarchical neural network which has efferent as well as afferent connections between cells. The afferent and the efferent signals interact with each other in the network: the efferent signals, that is, the signals for selective attention, have a facilitating effect on the afferent ones, and, at the same time, the afferent signals gate efferent signal flow. When some feature in the stimulus is not extracted in the afferent paths, the threshold for detection of that feature is automatically lowered by decreasing the efficiency of inhibition, and the model tries to extract even vague traces of the undetected feature."

These latent structures can then serve as a basis for supervised classification methods. A common choice for unsupervised feature discovery is the Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM). Since the RBM is a general purpose learning machine, it is not particularly tailored for image data. Representations found by RBMs are consequently not image-like. Since it is essential to exploit the known topological structure for image analysis, it is desirable not to discard the topology property when learning new representations. Then, the same learning methods can be applied to the latent representation in a hierarchical manner. In this work, we propose a modification to the learning rule of locally connected RBMs, which ensures that topological image structure is preserved in the latent representation. To this end, we use a Gaussian kernel to transfer topological properties of the image space to the feature space. The learned model is then used as an initialization for a neural network trained to classify the images. We evaluate our approach on the MNIST and Caltech 101 datasets and demonstrate that we are able to learn topological feature maps."

For a detailed discussion see also 1], 2], 3]. The basic principle of Rprop is to eliminate the harmful innuence of the size of the partial derivative on the weight step. As a consequence, only the sign of the derivative is considered to indicate the direction of the weight update. The size of the weight change is exclusively determined by a weight-speciic, so-called 'update-value' 4 (t) ij : 4w (t) ij = (t) ij ; if @E @wij (t) > 0 +4 (t) ij ; if @E @wij (t) < 0 0 ; else (1) where @E @wij (t) denotes the summed gradient information over all patterns of the pattern set ('batch learning'). It should be noted, that by replacing the 4 ij (t) by a constant update-value 4, equation (1) yields the so-called 'Manhattan'-update rule. The second step of Rprop learning is to determine the new update-values 4 ij (t). This is based on a sign-dependent adaptation process, similar to the learning-rate adaptation in 4], 5]."

Patterns of light stimuli most effective in influencing units at one level may no longer be the most effective at the next. From differences in responses at successive stages in the pathway one may hope to gain some understanding of the part each stage plays in visual perception. By shining small spots of light on the light-adapted cat retina Kuffler (1953) showed that ganglion cells have concentric receptive fields, with an 'on' centre and an 'off ' periphery, or vice versa. The 'on' and 'off' areas within a receptive field were found to be mutually antagonistic, and a spot restricted to the centre of the field was more effective than one covering the whole receptive field (Barlow, FitzHugh & Kuffler, 1957). In the freely moving lightadapted cat it was found that the great majority of cortical cells studied gave little or no response to light stimuli covering most of the animal's visual field, whereas small spots shone in a restricted retinal region often evoked brisk responses (Hubel, 1959). A moving spot of light often produced stronger responses than a stationary one, and sometimes a moving spot gave more activation for one direction than for the opposite. The present investigation, made in acute preparations, includes a study of receptive fields of cells in the cat's striate cortex. Receptive fields of the cells considered in this paper were divided into separate excitatory and inhibitory ('on' and 'off') areas. In this respect they resembled retinal ganglion-cell receptive fields. However, the shape and arrangement of excitatory and inhibitory areas differed strikingly from the concentric pattern found in retinal ganglion cells. An attempt was made to correlate responses to moving stimuli"

In the process of gathering images of public spaces, these projects also capture license plates, faces, and other information considered sensitive from a privacy standpoint. In this work, we present a system that addresses the challenge of automatically detecting and blurring faces and license plates for the purpose of privacy protection in Google Street View. Though some in the field would claim face detection is \u201csolved\u201d, we show that state-of-the-art face detectors alone are not sufficient to achieve the recall desired for large-scale privacy protection. In this paper we present a system that combines a standard sliding-window detector tuned for a high recall, low-precision operating point with a fast post-processing stage that is able to remove additional false positives by incorporating domain-specific information not available to the sliding-window detector. Using a completely automatic system, we are able to sufficiently blur more than 89% of faces and 94 \u2013 96% of license plates in evaluation sets sampled from Google Street View imagery."
