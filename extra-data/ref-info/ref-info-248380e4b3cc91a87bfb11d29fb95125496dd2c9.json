Previous reports indicate that human-engineered rule-based systems, requiring many man-years of developmental efforts, have been successfully built to \u201cread\u201d documents and assign topics to them. We show that machine-generated decision rules appear comparable to human performance, while using the identical rule-based representation. In comparison with other machine-learning techniques, results on a key benchmark from the Reuters collection show a large gain in performance, from a previously reported 67% recall/precision breakeven point to 80.5%. In the context of a very high-dimensional feature space, several methodological alternatives are examined, including universal versus local dictionaries, and binary versus frequency-related features."

Categorization of text is of increasing importance in information retrieval and natural language processing systems. Previous research on automated text categorization has mixed machine learning and knowledge engineering methods, making it diicult to draw conclusions about the performance of particular methods. In this paper we present empirical results on the performance of a Bayesian classiier and a decision tree learning algorithm on two text categorization data sets. We nd that both algorithms achieve reasonable performance and allow controlled tradeoos between false positives and false negatives. The stepwise feature selection in the decision tree algorithm is particularly eeective in dealing with the large feature sets common in text categorization. However, even this algorithm is aided by an initial preeltering of features, connrming the results found by Almuallim and Dietterich on artiicial data sets. We also demonstrate the impact of the time-varying nature of category deenitions."

Using an already coded training database of about 50,000 stories from the Dow Jones Press Release News Wire, and SEEKER [Stanfill] (a text retrieval system that supports relevance feedback) as the underlying match engine, codes are assigned to new, unseen stories with a recall of about 80% and precision of about 70%. There are about 350 different codes to be assigned. Using a massively parallel supercomputer, we leverage the information already contained in the thousands of coded stories and are able to code a story in about 2 seconds. Given SEEKER, the text retrieval system, we achieved these results in about two person-months. We believe this approach is effective in reducing the development time to implement classification systems involving large number of topics for the purpose of classification, message routing etc."

In this paper we study the properties of phrasal and clustered indexing languages on a text categorization task, enabling us to study their properties in isolation from query interpretation issues. We show that optimal effectiveness occurs when using only a small proportion of the indexing terms available, and that effectiveness peaks at a higher feature set size and lower effectiveness level for a syntactic phrase indexing than for word-based indexing. We also present results suggesting that traditional term clustering method are unlikely to provide significantly improved text representations. An improved probabilistic text categorization method is also presented."

This book is a complete guide to the C4.5 system as implemented in C for the UNIX environment. It contains a comprehensive guide to the system's use , the source code (about 8,800 lines), and implementation notes. The source code and sample datasets are also available on a 3.5-inch floppy diskette for a Sun workstation. \n \nC4.5 starts with large sets of cases belonging to known classes. The cases, described by any mixture of nominal and numeric properties, are scrutinized for patterns that allow the classes to be reliably discriminated. These patterns are then expressed as models, in the form of decision trees or sets of if-then rules, that can be used to classify new cases, with emphasis on making the models understandable as well as accurate. The system has been applied successfully to tasks involving tens of thousands of cases described by hundreds of properties. The book starts from simple core learning methods and shows how they can be elaborated and extended to deal with typical problems such as missing data and over hitting. Advantages and disadvantages of the C4.5 approach are discussed and illustrated with several case studies. \n \nThis book and software should be of interest to developers of classification-based intelligent systems and to students in machine learning and expert systems courses."
