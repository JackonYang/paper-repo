The layout of a document contains a significant amount of information that can be used to classify it by type in the absence of domain-specific models. Our approach to classification is based on \u201cvisual similarity\u201d of layout structure and is implemented by building a supervised classifier, given examples of each class. We use image features such as percentages of text and non-text (graphics, images, tables, and rulings) content regions, column structures, relative point sizes of fonts, density of content area, and statistics of features of connected components which can be derived without class knowledge. In order to obtain class labels for training samples, we conducted a study where subjects ranked document pages with respect to their resemblance to representative page images. Class labels can also be assigned based on known document types, or can be defined by the user. We implemented our classification scheme using decision tree classifiers and self-organizing maps."

Given the segmented document zones, correctly determining the zone content type is very important for the subsequent processes within any document image understanding system. This paper describes an algorithm for the determination of zone type of a given zone within an input document image. In our zone classification algorithm, zones are represented as feature vectors. Each feature vector consists of a set of 25 measurements of pre-defined properties. A probabilistic model, decision tree, is used to classify each zone on the basis of its feature vector. Two methods are used to optimize the decision tree classifier to eliminate the data over-fitting problem. To enrich our probabilistic model, we incorporate context constraints for certain zones within their neighboring zones. We also model zone class context constraints as a Hidden Markov Model and usedViterbi algorithm to obtain optimal classification results. The training, pruning and testing data set for the algorithm include 1, 600 images drawn from the UWCDROM-III document image database. With a total of 24, 177 zones within the data set, the cross-validation method was used in the performance evaluation of the classifier. The classifier is able to classify each given scientific and technical document zone into one of the nine classes, 2 text classes (of font size 4-18pt and font size 19-32 pt), math, table, halftone, map/drawing, ruling, logo, and others. A zone content classification performance evaluation protocol is proposed. Using this protocol, our algorithm accuracy is 98.45% with a mean false alarm rate of 0.50%."

In this paper, the problem is formulated in the framework of concept learning and each category corresponds to the set of image documents with similar physical structure. We propose a solution based on two algorithmic ideas. First, we obtain a structured representation of images based on labeled XY-trees (this representation informs the learner about important relationships between image subconstituents). Second, we propose a probabilistic architecture that extends hidden Markov models for learning probability distributions defined on spaces of labeled trees. Finally, a successful application of this method to the categorization of commercial invoices is presented."

The layout is described by means of a hierarchical description, the modified X-Y tree, that is derived from the classical X-Y tree segmentation algorithm taking into account cuts along lines in addition to cuts along white spaces between blocks. In order to reduce problems due to noise and the skew of the input image, the modified X-Y tree is built on top of regions extracted by a commercial OCR package. The tree is afterwards coded into a fixed-size representation that takes into account occurrences of tree patterns in the tree representing the page. Lastly, this feature vector is fed to an artificial neural network that is trained to classify document images. The system is applied to the classification of documents belonging to digital libraries. Examples of classes taken into account are \"title page\", \"index\" and \"regular page\". Many tests have been carried out on a data set of more than 600 pages from an online digital library. These tests allowed us to conclude that the use of modified X-Y trees is advantageous with respect to the classical X-Y decomposition for this classification task."

The most important features of the presented system are learning capability, handling large volumes of highly variant documents, and high performance. IDC learns new document types (variants) from examples. To this end, it automatically extracts discriminatory features from images of various document types, generates generalized descriptions, and stores them in the knowledge base. The classification of an unknown document is based on matching its description to all general rules in the knowledge base, and selecting the best matching document types as final classifications. Both learning and identification processes are fast and accurate. The speed is gained due to optimal image processing and feature construction procedures. Identification accuracy is very high despite the fact that the discriminatory features are generated solely based on page layout information. IDC operates in two separate components of an EDMS: Knowledge Base Maintainer (KBM) and Production Identifier (PI). KBM builds a knowledge base and maintains its integrity. PI utilizes learned knowledge during the identification processes."

This research aims to analyze and classify scientific papers. We conduct the experiments on documents from the proceedings of various conferences to show the performance of the proposed method.

The goal is to develop fast algorithms for initial document type classification without OCR, which can then be verified using more elaborate methods based on more detailed geometric and syntactic models. A novel feature set called interval encoding is introduced to capture elements of spatial layout. This feature set encodes region layout information in fixed-length vectors by capturing structural characteristics of the image. We demonstrate the usefulness of these features derived from interval coding, in a hidden Markov model based page layout classification system that is trainable and extendible."

However, an extensive and systematic evaluation of the various approaches has not been done yet. In order to investigate different text representations for document classification, we have developed a tool which transforms documents into feature-value representations that are suitable for standard learning algorithms. In this paper, we investigate seven document representations for German texts based on n-grams and single words. We compare their effectiveness in classifying OCR texts and the corresponding correct ASCII texts in two domains: business letters and abstracts of technical reports. Our results indicate that the use of n-grams is an attractive technique which can even compare to techniques relying on a morphological analysis. This holds for OCR texts as well as for correct ASCII texts."

In the research community the dominant approach to this problem is based on machine learning techniques: a general inductive process automatically builds a classifier by learning, from a set of preclassified documents, the characteristics of the categories. The advantages of this approach over the knowledge engineering approach (consisting in the manual definition of a classifier by domain experts) are a very good effectiveness, considerable savings in terms of expert labor power, and straightforward portability to different domains. This survey discusses the main approaches to text categorization that fall within the machine learning paradigm. We will discuss in detail issues pertaining to three different problems, namely, document representation, classifier construction, and classifier evaluation."

This system, named STRETCH (STorage and RETrieval by Content of imaged documents), is based on an Archiving and Retrieval Engine, which overcomes the bottleneck of document profiling bypassing some limitations of existing pre-defined indexing schemes. The engine exploits a structured document representation and can activate appropriate methods to characterise and automatically index heterogeneous documents with variable layout. The originality of STRETCH lies principally in the possibility for unskilled users to define the indexes relevant to the document domains of their interest by simply presenting visual examples and applying reliable automatic information extraction methods (document classification, flexible reading strategies) to index the documents automatically, thus creating archives as desired. STRETCH offers ease of use and application programming and the ability to dynamically adapt to new types of documents. The system has been tested in two applications in particular, one concerning passive invoices and the other bank documents. In these applications, several classes of documents are involved. The indexing strategy first automatically classifies the document, thus avoiding pre-sorting, then locates and reads the information pertaining to the specific document class. Experimental results are encouraging overall; in particular, document classification results fulfill the requirements of high-volume application. Integration into production lines is under execution."

In this model, document processing can be divided into two phases: document analysis and document understanding. A document has two structures: geometric (layout) structure and logical structure. Extraction of the geometric structure from a document refers to document analysis; mapping the geometric structure into logical structure deals with document understanding. Both types of document structures and the two areas of document processing are discussed in this chapter. Two categories of methods have been used in document analysis, namely, (1) hierarchical methods including top-down and bottom-up approaches, (2) no-hierarchical methods including modiied fractal signature. Tree transform, formatting knowledge and description language approaches have been used in document understanding. All the above approaches are presented in this chapter. A particular case-form document processing is discussed. Form description and form registration approaches are presented. A form processing system is also introduced. Finally, many techniques, such as skew detection, Hough transform, Gabor lters, projection, crossing counts, form deenition language, etc. which have been used in these approaches are discussed in this chapter."

Previous work on the categorization of document images has relied on Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to provide the transformation between the image domain and a domain where pattern recognition techniques are more readily applied. Our work uses a different technology to provide this transformation. Character shape coding is a computationally efficient, extraordinarily robust, means of providing access to the character content of document images. While this transform is lossy, sufficient salient information is retained to support many applications. Furthermore, the use of shape coding is particularly advantageous over OCR in the processing of page images of poor quality. In this study we found that topic identification performance was maintained or slightly improved using character shape codes derived from images."

However, these approaches are applicable to only the same kind of documents because they are based on the paradigm that specifies the structure definition information in advance so as to be able to analyze a particular class of documents intelligently. In this paper, the authors propose a method to recognize the layout structures of multi-kinds of table-form document images. For this purpose, the authors introduce a classification tree to manage the relationships among different classes of layout structures. The authors' recognition system has two modes: layout knowledge acquisition and layout structure recognition. In the layout knowledge acquisition mode, table-form document images are distinguished according to this. Classification tree and then the structure description trees which specify the logical structures of table-form documents are generated automatically. While, in the layout structure recognition mode, individual item fields in the table-form document images are extracted and classified successfully by searching the classification tree and interpreting the structure description tree. >"

Among the various frameworks in which pattern recognition has been traditionally formulated, the statistical approach has been most intensively studied and used in practice. More recently, neural network techniques and methods imported from statistical learning theory have been receiving increasing attention. The design of a recognition system requires careful attention to the following issues: definition of pattern classes, sensing environment, pattern representation, feature extraction and selection, cluster analysis, classifier design and learning, selection of training and test samples, and performance evaluation. In spite of almost 50 years of research and development in this field, the general problem of recognizing complex patterns with arbitrary orientation, location, and scale remains unsolved. New and emerging applications, such as data mining, web searching, retrieval of multimedia data, face recognition, and cursive handwriting recognition, require robust and efficient pattern recognition techniques. The objective of this review paper is to summarize and compare some of the well-known methods used in various stages of a pattern recognition system and identify research topics and applications which are at the forefront of this exciting and challenging field."

                "text": "Text categorization is a fundamental task in document processing, allowing the automated handling of enormous streams of documents in electronic form. One difficulty in handling some classes of documents is the presence of different kinds of textual errors, such as spelling and grammatical errors in email, and character recognition errors in documents that come through OCR. Text categorization must work reliably on all input, and thus must tolerate some level of these kinds of problems. We describe here an N-gram-based approach to text categorization that is tolerant of textual errors. The system is small, fast and robust. This system worked very well for language classification, achieving in one test a 99.8% correct classification rate on Usenet newsgroup articles written in different languages. The system also worked reasonably well for classifying articles from a number of different computer-oriented newsgroups according to subject, achieving as high as an 80% correct classification rate. There are also several obvious directions for improving the system`s classification performance in those cases where it did not do as well. The system is based on calculating and comparing profiles of N-gram frequencies. First, we use the system to compute profiles on training set data that represent the variousmore\u00a0\u00bb categories, e.g., language samples or newsgroup content samples. Then the system computes a profile for a particular document that is to be classified. Finally, the system computes a distance measure between the document`s profile and each of the category profiles. The system selects the category whose profile has the smallest distance to the document`s profile. The profiles involved are quite small, typically 10K bytes for a category training set, and less than 4K bytes for an individual document. Using N-gram frequency profiles provides a simple and reliable way to categorize documents in a wide range of classification tasks.\u00ab\u00a0less"

The system is composed of two main modules: the central indexer (extraction and weighting of indexing terms) and the classifier (classification of business letters into given types). The system employs several knowledge sources including a letter database, word frequency statistics for German, lists of message type specific words, morphological knowledge as well as the underlying document structure. As output, the system evaluates a set of weighted hypotheses about the type of the actual letter. Classification of documents allow the automatic distribution or archiving of letters and is also an excellent starting point for higher-level document analysis.1"

Layout is a critical factor in recognizing fine-grained genres, as document content features are similar. Document genre is determined from the layout structure detected from scanned binary images of the document pages, using no OCR results and minimal a priori knowledge of document logical structures. Our method uses the attributed relational graphs (ARGs) to represent the layout structure of document instances, and the first order random graphs (FORGs) to represent document genres. In this paper we develop our FORG-based genre classification method and present a comparative evaluation between our technique and a variety of statistical pattern classifiers. FORGs are capable of modeling common layout structure within a document genre and are shown to significantly outperform traditional pattern classification techniques when fine-grained genre distinctions must be drawn."

In intelligent systems for paper document processing this information capture process is based on knowledge of the specific layout and logical structures of the documents. This article proposes the application of machine learning techniques to acquire the specific knowledge required by an intelligent document processing system, named WISDOM++, that manages printed documents, such as letters and journals. Knowledge is represented by means of decision trees and first-order rules automatically generated from a set of training documents. In particular, an incremental decision tree learning system is applied for the acquisition of decision trees used for the classification of segmented blocks, while a first-order learning system is applied for the induction of rules used for the layout-based classification and understanding of documents. Issues concerning the incremental induction of decision trees and the handling of both numeric and symbolic data in first-order rule learning are discussed, and the validity of the proposed solutions is empirically evaluated by processing a set of real printed documents."

The individual classifiers differ strongly in their basic assumptions: While the first one considers layout and typographic information with respect to certain keywords the second one is a more conventional text categorization approach which merely incorporates textual features. Since this whole categorization tool is embedded into a document analysis system, a highly precise classification is essential for a subsequent goal-directed extraction of structured information aimed at the integration of the document into the current business workflow of a company."

This approach considers visual human-based predicates to describe and identify text units according to their visual saliency and their perceptual attraction power on the reader\u2019s eye. It supports a quick and robust process of functional labeling used to characterize text regions of document pages. The test databases are the Finland MTDB Oulu base J. Sauvola and H. Kauniskangas (1999) MediaTeam Document Database II, a CD-ROM document image collection, Oulu University, Finland that provides a great panel of document layouts and contents and our laboratory corpus that contains a large variety of composite documents (about 200 pages). The performance of the method gives very promising results."

In the survey presented, we restrict ourselves to documents such as business letters, forms, and scientific and technical articles such as those found in archival journals and technical conferences. Understanding such documents involves estimating the rotation skew of each document page, determining the geometric page layout, labeling blocks as text or non-text, determining the read order for text blocks, recognizing the text of text blocks through an OCR system, determining the logical page layout, and formatting the data and information of the document in a suitable way for use by a word processing system or by an information retrieval system.<<ETX>>"

We compare the classification accuracy of the vector model approach using the k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) algorithm to a novel approach which allows the use of graphs for document representation in the k-NN algorithm. The proposed method is evaluated on three different Web document collections using the leave-one-out approach for measuring classification accuracy. The results show that the graph-based k-NN approach can outperform traditional vector-based k-NN methods in terms of both accuracy and execution time."

This book is a complete guide to the C4.5 system as implemented in C for the UNIX environment. It contains a comprehensive guide to the system's use , the source code (about 8,800 lines), and implementation notes. The source code and sample datasets are also available on a 3.5-inch floppy diskette for a Sun workstation. \n \nC4.5 starts with large sets of cases belonging to known classes. The cases, described by any mixture of nominal and numeric properties, are scrutinized for patterns that allow the classes to be reliably discriminated. These patterns are then expressed as models, in the form of decision trees or sets of if-then rules, that can be used to classify new cases, with emphasis on making the models understandable as well as accurate. The system has been applied successfully to tasks involving tens of thousands of cases described by hundreds of properties. The book starts from simple core learning methods and shows how they can be elaborated and extended to deal with typical problems such as missing data and over hitting. Advantages and disadvantages of the C4.5 approach are discussed and illustrated with several case studies. \n \nThis book and software should be of interest to developers of classification-based intelligent systems and to students in machine learning and expert systems courses."

This paper addresses such a subject. Generally, the documents can be categorized into the appropriate document types on a basis of the features of layout structures. Then, the processing mechanisms are assessed with a view to establishing the criteria for selecting the knowledge representation means appropriate to the document types. First, we define the physical layout structure and logical layout structure in addition to the traditional concepts of layout structure and logical structure. Second, we define the document type on the basis of the relationship between the physical layout structure and logical layout structure. Third, we make the knowledge representation means and the processing mechanisms clear under the document types. Finally, we show a criterion or guideline for knowledge representation means and processing mechanisms with respect to the logical layout structure and physical layout structure. For this discussion, our basic view is derived from our document understanding methods which we have developed for several different documents."

It is the author's job to design the document so that the information it contains can be interpreted accurately and efficiently. To do this, the author can make use of a set of stylistic tools. In this paper, we introduce the concept of document functionality, which attempts to describe the roles of documents and their components in the process of transferring information. A functional description of a document provides insight into the type of the document, into its intended uses, and into strategies for automatic document interpretation and retrieval. To demonstrate these ideas, we define a taxonomy of functional document components and show how functional descriptions can be used to reverse-engineer the intentions of the author, to navigate in document space, and to provide important contextual information to aid in interpretation."

We consider a setting in which the learner responds to each example according to a current hypothesis. Then the learner updates the hypothesis, if necessary, based on the correct classification of the example. One natural measure of the quality of learning in this setting is the number of mistakes the learner makes. For suitable classes of functions, learning algorithms are available that make a bounded number of mistakes, with the bound independent of the number of examples seen by the learner. We present one such algorithm that learns disjunctive Boolean functions, along with variants for learning other classes of Boolean functions. The basic method can be expressed as a linear-threshold algorithm. A primary advantage of this algorithm is that the number of mistakes grows only logarithmically with the number of irrelevant attributes in the examples. At the same time, the algorithm is computationally efficient in both time and space."

A document recognition problem is viewed as consisting of three elements-an image generator, a noisy channel, and an image decoder. A document image generator is a Markov source which combines a message source with an imager. The message source produces a string of symbols which contains the information to be transmitted. The imager is modeled as a finite-state transducer, which converts the message into an ideal bitmap. The channel transforms the ideal image into a noisy observed image. The decoder estimates the message from the observed image by finding the a posteriori most probable path through the combined source and channel models using a Viterbi-like algorithm. Application of the proposed method to decoding telephone yellow pages is described.<<ETX>>"

This paper proposes a novel approach for form identification using strings. This application can be used as a basis for extension to other \"linear\" documents such as logos or line drawings. A set of known blank forms is stored in a database and incoming forms are automatically matched to one of these. In addition, forms which are not in the database can also be detected. A novel and simple method is used for matching by considering a distinctive \"signature\" for each document. This takes the shape of a string which describes the elements present on the form. Included are the location and size of lines, corners and blocks of text, quantised as discrete symbols. A specially adapted and efficient string edit distance calculation is then applied for matching. Unregistered forms can be detected by examining the unmatched elements between two strings. This novel string format makes it possible to extend the conventional one-dimensional representation possibilities of strings to a richer \"one-and-a-half dimensional\" structure and requires no training."

Thistechnology can solve difficulties in variety for readingdifferent items on fairly large number of different types offorms. The form-type identification consists of two parts:(i) extraction of targets such as important keywords in aform by matching between recogised characters and wordstrings in a keyword dictionary, and (ii) analysis ofpositional or semantic relationship between the targets byconstellation matching between these targets and wordlocation information in the keyword dictionary. The formdatarecognition consists of two parts: (i) extraction of aregion of interest (ROI) contained a character string of theitem by using a layout knowledge of the very form-type,and (ii) character string recognition of the item by usingthe linguistic constraint which can be obtained from acontent knowledge of the form-type. A experiment using642 sample forms with 107 different types in totalconfirmed that the form-type identification method cancorrectly identify 97% of 642 form samples at a rejectionrate 3%. Another experiment confirmed that the form-data recognition method can correctly read 95% of thenumber of items on the form samples."

Layout is represented by a fully connected attributed relational graph that is matched to the graph of an unknown document, achieving classification and labelling simultaneously. By incorporating global constraints in an integrated fashion, ambiguity at the zone level can be reduced, providing robustness to noise and variation. Models are automatically trained from sample documents. Experimental results show promise for the classification and labelling of technical article title pages, and supports the idea of a hierarchical model base."

In many applications, for example, in pattern recognition and computer vision, it is required to measure the similarity of objects. When graphs are used for the representation of structured objects, then the problem of measuring object similarity turns into the problem of computing the similarity of graphs, which is also known as graph matching. In this paper, similarity measures on graphs and related algorithms are reviewed. Also theoretical work showing various relations between different similarity measures is discussed. Other topics to be addressed include graph clustering and efficient indexing of large databases of graphs."

The system including the image-ATM captures the paper forms brought by the clients at the very front-end, identifies the type of forms, and recognizes the data on the form automatically. The image-ATM can accept over 400 different kinds of forms. The system is presently in operation at some of the Japanese major banks. They could reduce considerable human workforce for their branch offices by introducing the image workflow system and by centralizing the back-office work at a few operation centers. Technically, form recognition, especially form type identification, was one of the keys for this success. This paper discusses a method for form type identification and its technical issues."

This survey article discusses some of the results, models, and open problems from Computational Learning Theory that seem particularly interesting from the point of view of on-line algorithms research. The emphasis in this article is on describing some of the simpler, more intuitive results, whose proofs can be given in their entirety.

The proposed method represents the cell structure by the location of the center points of each cell. This representation allows the form identification to be realized by a process of matching the points in an input image to the points in registered forms. We have implemented the point matching process using the two-dimensional hash table. This implementation enables the system to robustly identify an input form even if it is skewed or deformed by a scanning process, and to reduce the time for the identification. Moreover, the similarity between two forms defined by the implementation can be used to evaluate the identification ability when a set of registered forms is specified. Experimental results show the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed technique."

In this expository article, we address the role of statistical methods in this powerful technology as applied to speech recognition and discuss a range of theoretical and practical issues that are as yet unsolved in terms of their importance and their effect on performance for different system implementations."

The analogous question for prunings as for subtrees is answered.A dynamic programming algorithm is presented to solve the three questions in sequential time $O(|T_1 | \\times |T_2 | \\times \\min ({\\textit{depth}}(T_1 ),{\\textit{leaves}}(T_1 )) \\times \\min ({\\textit{depth}}(T_2 ),{\\textit{leaves}}(T_2 )))$ and space $O(|T_1 | \\times |T_2 |)$ compared with $O(|T_1 | \\times |T_2 | \\t..."
