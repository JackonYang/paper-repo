The suggestion is that the brain represents reality by means of positions in suitably constitutes phase spaces; and the brain performs computations on these representations by means of coordinate transformations from one phase space to another. This scheme may be implemented in the brain in two distinct forms: (1) as a \u201cphase-space sandwich\u201d, which may explain certain laminar structures, such as cerebral cortex and the superior colliculus; and (2) as a \u201cneural matrix\u201d, which may explain other structures, such as the beautifully orthogonal architecture of the cerebellum."

It is then assumed that state vectors, large patterns of activity of groups of individual somewhat selective neurons, are the appropriate elementary entities to use for cognitive computation. Simple neural models using this approach are presented that will associate and will respond to prototypes of sets of related inputs. Some experimental evidence supporting the latter model is discussed. A model for categorization is then discussed. Educating the resulting systems and the use of error correcting techniques are discussed, and an example is presented to the behavior of the system when diffuse damage occurs to the memory, with and without compensatory learning. Finally, a simulation is presented which can learn partial information, integrate it with other material, and use that information to reconstruct missing information."

At the early stages of visual processing, individual units can represent hypotheses about how small local fragments of the visual input should be interpreted, and interactions between units can encode knowledge about the constraints between local interpretations. Higher up in the visual system, the representational issues are more complex. This paper considers the difficulties involved in representing shapes in parallel systems, and suggests ways of overcoming them. In doing so, it provides a mechanism for shape perception and visual attention which allows a novel interpretation of the Gestalt slogan that the whole is more than the sum of its parts."

Much of this progress has been the result of applications of the relatively new and powerful autoradiographic and histochemical tracing methods that reveal connections in great detail and clarity. The major limitation on further understanding of visual system connections does not seem to be technical at this time, but rather it is our incomplete knowledge of the functional subdivisions of the primate visual system. It is difficult to study connections of parts of the brain for which the organization and divisions into separate areas or nuclei are still unclear. Quite different schemes of cortical organization have been proposed for visual cortex of New World (5\u20137) and Old World monkeys (96, 111, 116\u2013118) and neither of these schemes includes all of visually responsive cortex. For example, neither organization deals with subdivisions of inferotemporal cortex, a visually responsive region of cortex that in Old World monkeys has received detailed attention (33, 34, 59), without completely resolving the issue of number and boundaries of subdivisions. Efforts have been made to show similarites in cortical organization between Old and New World primates (1, 95, 99), but how similar or dissimilar the two groups of primates are presently remains uncertain."

                "text": "Strictly sequential approaches to computer vision are at best slow and cumbersome, at worst impossible. In this thesis, a massively parallel, connectionist approach is brought to bear on the problem of visual recognition. \nComputing with connections is a synthesis of results from Neuroscience, Computer Science, and Psychology. The fundamental assumption of connectionism is that individual computing units do not transmit large amounts of symbolic information. Instead, these units compute by being appropriately connected in a network of similar units. Using the communication pathways (connections) defined by the arcs of the network, the units cooperate and compete towards a globally consistent interpretation of the input scene. \nThe problem, visual recognition, is defined as matching instances of predefined objects in the input with a fixed set of internal models. Predefined objects come from Kanade's Origami World{Kanade78}. The program represents and recognizes such pre-defined objects from line drawing input. \nTo organize these networks, conceptual hierarchies are defined. A conceptual hierarchy is a semantic network hierarchically arranged according to abstraction levels. Levels represent the extraction of progressively more complex features. A node on a level, a computing unit, represents an instantiation of a feature defined on that level. Connections represent the composition and competition relations between feature units. \nIterative relaxation is the form of control in the network. Each unit iteratively computes activation levels, a reflection of current confidence in the associated feature. Numerous testcases illustrate network behavior in presence of perfect, noised, incomplete and occluded input. \nThe greatest benefits of this approach are seen in the systems ability to cope with incomplete and occluded input. Another advantage is an inherently parallel approach that eliminates the need for establishing a search order on exploring interpretations. The system exhibits many similarities with the structure and behavior of animal vision systems."

It is now clear that the retina and visual pathways do not simply transmit a mosaic of Iight and dark to some central sensorium. Rather, even at the retinal level, specific features of visual stimuli are detected and their presence communicated to the next level. In cats and monkeys, the geniculostriate visual system consists of a series of converging and diverging connections such that at each successive tier of processing mechanism, single neurons respond to increasingly more specific visual stimuli falling on an increasingly wider area of the retina (19-Z). How far does this analytical-synthetic process continue whereby individual cells have more and more specific trigger features? Are there regions of the brain beyond striate and prestriatel cortex where this processing of visual information is carrie,d further? If so, how far and in what way? Are there cells that are concerned with the storage of visual information as well as its analysis? There are several lines of evidence suggesting that a possible site for further processing of visual information and perhaps even for storage of such information might, in the monkey, be inferotemporal cortexthe cortex on the inferior convexity of the temporal lobe. First, this area receives afferents from prestriate cortex which itself processes visual information received from"

In the present study we have found that individual neurons in the cat primary visual cortex can communicate over suprisingly long distances horizontally (up to 4 mm), in directions parallel to the cortical surface. For all of the cells having widespread projections, the collaterals within their axonal fields were distributed in repeating clusters, with an average periodicity of 1 mm. This pattern of extensive clustered projections has been revealed by combining the techniques of intracellular recording and injection of horseradish peroxidase with three- dimensional computer graphic reconstructions. The clustering pattern was most apparent when the cells were rotated to present a view parallel to the cortical surface. The pattern was observed in more than half of the pyramidal and spiny stellate cells in the cortex and was seen in all cortical layers. In our sample, cells made distant connections within their own layer and/or within another layer. The axon of one cell had clusters covering the same area in two layers, and the clusters in the deeper layer were located under those in the upper layer, suggesting a relationship between the clustering phenomenon and columnar cortical architecture. Some pyramidal cells did not project into the white matter, forming intrinsic connections exclusively. Finally, the axonal fields of all our injected cells were asymmetric, extending for greater distances along one cortical axis than along the orthogonal axis. The axons appeared to cover areas of cortex representing a larger part of the visual field than that covered by the excitatory portion of the cell's own receptive field. These connections may be used to generate larger receptive fields or to produce the inhibitory flanks in other cells' receptive fields."

It would be astonishing if such a structure did not profoundly modify the response patterns of fibres coming into it. In the cat's visual cortex, the receptive field arrangements of single cells suggest that there is indeed a degree of complexity far exceeding anything yet seen at lower levels in the visual system. In a previous paper we described receptive fields of single cortical cells, observing responses to spots of light shone on one or both retinas (Hubel & Wiesel, 1959). In the present work this method is used to examine receptive fields of a more complex type (Part I) and to make additional observations on binocular interaction (Part II). This approach is necessary in order to understand the behaviour of individual cells, but it fails to deal with the problem of the relationship of one cell to its neighbours. In the past, the technique of recording evoked slow waves has been used with great success in studies of functional anatomy. It was employed by Talbot & Marshall (1941) and by Thompson, Woolsey & Talbot (1950) for mapping out the visual cortex in the rabbit, cat, and monkey. Daniel & Whitteiidge (1959) have recently extended this work in the primate. Most of our present knowledge of retinotopic projections, binocular overlap, and the second visual area is based on these investigations. Yet the method of evoked potentials is valuable mainly for detecting behaviour common to large populations of neighbouring cells; it cannot differentiate functionally between areas of cortex smaller than about 1 mm2. To overcome this difficulty a method has in recent years been developed for studying cells separately or in small groups during long micro-electrode penetrations through nervous tissue. Responses are correlated with cell location by reconstructing the electrode tracks from histological material. These techniques have been applied to"

                "text": "Abstract Posterior parietal cortex has traditionally been considered to be a sensory association area in which higher-order processing and intermodal integration of incoming sensory information occurs. In this paper, evidence from clinical reports and from lesion and behavioral-electrophysiological experiments using monkeys is reviewed and discussed in relation to the overall functional organization of posterior parietal association cortex, and particularly with respect to a proposed posterior parietal mechanism concerned with the initiation and control of certain classes of eye and limb movements. Preliminary data from studies of the effects of posterior parietal lesions on oculomotor control in monkeys are reported. The behavioral effects of lesions of posterior parietal cortex in monkeys have been found to be similar to those which follow analogous damage of the minor hemisphere in humans, while behavioral-electrophysiological experiments have disclosed classes of neurons in this area which have functional properties closely related to the behavioral acts that are disrupted by lesions of the area. On the basis of current data from these areas of study, it is proposed that the sensory association model of posterior parietal function is inadequate to account for the complexities of the present evidence. Instead, it now appears that many diverse neural mechanisms are located in part in parietal cortex, that some of these mechanisms are involved in sensory processing and perceptual functions, but that others participate in motor control, and that still others are involved in attentional, motivational, or emotional processes. It is further proposed that the elementary units of these various neural mechanisms are distributed within posterior parietal cortex according to the columnar hypothesis of Mountcastle."

The electrical signs of the activity of single cortical cells were recorded with microelectrodes in waking animals as they carried out certain behavioral acts in response to a series of sensory cues. The behavioral paradigms were one for detection alone, and a second for detection plus projection of the arm to contact a stationary or moving target placed at arm's length. Of the 125 microelectrode penetrations made, 1,451 neurons were identified in terms of the correlation of their activity with the behavioral acts and their sensitivity or lack of it to sensory stimuli delivered passively; 180 were studied quantitatively. The locations of cortical neurons were identified in serial sections; 94 penetrations and 1,058 neurons were located with certainty. About two-thirds of the neurons of area 5 were activated by passive rotation of the limbs at their joints; of these, 82% were related to single, contralateral joints, 10% to two or more contralateral joints, 6% to ipsilateral, and 2% to joints on both sides of the body. A few of the latter were active during complex bodily postures. A large proportion of area 5 neurons were relatively insensitive to passive joint rotations, as compared with similar neurons of the postcentral gyrus, but were driven to high rates of discharge when the same joint was rotated during an active movement of the animal..."

                "text": "The internal organization of the cerebral cortex has been extensively studied by numerous investigators (see Sholl, 1956). All existing detailed morphological descriptions of cortical neurons, however, draw their information only from sections cut at right angles to the pial surface. Each one of such sections shows only one dimension of the spread of fibres tangential to the pial surface. Although theoretically the total tangential organization could be reconstructed from this material, this organization has never been adequately described and indeed it can only be directly visualized and ultimately confirmed on sections cut tangential to the pial surface. Study of such sections is essential for an adequate three dimensional description of cortical neurons and their branches. A better understanding of the tangential organization is particulary important in such situations as the primary visual cortex where the topographical projection of the retina upon the cortex is such that a map of the 'cortical retina' is displayed tangential to the pial surface. The relationships between the various points of the map can only be adequately seen in sections cutting successively through each 'horizontal' cortical layer in that plane. A study of the dendritic fields of the neurons of the optic lobe of the octopus has shown that they are elongated in shape in the tangential plane with orientations mainly in two directions at right angles to each other, with few obliques (Young, 1960). The author has related this morphological organization to the mechanism of pattern discrimination suggested by the behavioural evidence in this animal which has difficulty in discriminating between two obliquely orientated rectangles but can easily distinguish between a horizontal and a vertical rectangle (Sutherland, 1957). A similar study is rendered particularly interesting in the cat in view of the physiological properties of individual cortical cells recently described by Hubel & Wiesel (1959, 1962). The authors have shown that, though the visual fields of individual cells of the retina and lateral geniculate body are circular in shape, the centre and periphery having different excitatory and inhibitory polarities (Hubel, 1960), those of cortical cells are elongated in shape. They have suggested that the mechanism responsible for this transformation lies in the convergence of lateral geniculate cell axons, having receptive fields arranged along a straight line on the retina, upon a single cortical cell ('simple fields'). This convergence could be achieved in either of two ways. Either: (1) the axons from a specific set of geniculate neurons (say a row) make their own way to each"

(1982) Science 215, 1532-1534] have recently observed that an injection of horseradish peroxidase into the striate cortex of the tree shrew produces a patchy distribution of label adjacent to the injection site. They proposed that this pattern might be due to populations of neurons with long-range cortico-cortical connections that are interspersed with populations having no such connections. We suggest here an alternative explanation. We can account for the pattern by supposing that the label is carrier by a system of oriented axons. We suppose that these axons link cells with similar orientation preferences and make their connections within a narrow strip of cortex whose direction is related to the orientation of the cells in question. We suggest that such connections could be involved in generating complex receptive fields from simple ones. Other possibilities are that they are used to generate very elongated receptive fields, inhibitory flanks, or end-stopping. We suggest a number of experimental tests of these ideas."

The common computational structure of many early vision problems is that they are mathematically ill-posed in the sense of Hadamard. Regularization analysis can be used to solve them in terms of variational principles of a specific type that enforce constraints derived from a physical analysis of the problem. Studies of human perception may reveal whether principles of a similar type are exploited by biological vision. We also show that the corresponding variational principles can be implemented in a natural way by analogue networks. Specific electrical and chemical networks for localizing edges and computing visual motion are derived. We suggest that local circuits of neurons may exploit this unconventional model of computation."

The model tries to cover the entire range from behavior and phenomenological experience to detailed neural encodings in crude but computationally plausible reductive steps. The problems addressed include perceptual constancies, eye movements and the stable visual world, object descriptions, perceptual generalizations, and the representation of extrapersonal space. The entire development is based on an action-oriented notion of perception. The observer is assumed to be continuously sampling the ambient light for information of current value. The central problem of vision is taken to be categorizing and locating objects in the environment. The critical step in this process is the linking of visual information to symbolic object descriptions; this is called indexing, from the analogy of identifying a book from index terms. The system must also identify situations and use this knowledge to guide movement and other actions in the environment. The treatment focuses on the different representations of information used in the visual system. The four representational frames capture information in the following forms: retinotopic, head-based, symbolic, and allocentric. The functional roles of the four frames, the communication among them, and their suggested neurophysiological realization constitute the core of the paper. The model is perforce crude, but appears to be consistent with all relevant findings."

                "text": "We perceive the visual world as a unitary whole, yet one of the guiding principles of nearly a half century of neurophysiological research since the early recordings by Hartline (1938) has been that the visual system consists of neurons that are driven by stimulation within small discrete portions of the total visual field. These classical receptive fields (CRFs) have been mapped with the excitatory responses evoked by a flashed or moving stimulus, usually a spot or bar of light. Most of the visual neurons, in turn, are organized in a series of maps of the visual field, at least 10 of which exist in the visual cortex in primates as well as additional topographic representations in the lateral geniculate body, pulvinar and optic tectum (Allman 1977, Newsome & Allman 1980, Allman & Kaas 1984). It has been widely assumed that perceptual functions that require the integration of inputs over large portions of the visual field must be either collective properties of arrays of neurons representing the visual field, or features of those neurons at the highest processing levels in the visual system, such as the cells in inferotemporal or posterior parietal cortex that typically possess very large receptive fields and do not appear to be organized in visuotopic maps. These assumptions have been based on the results of the many studies in which receptive fields were mapped with conventional stimuli, presented one at a time, against a featureless background. However, unlike the neurophysiologist's tangent screen, the natural visual scene is rich in features, and there is a growing body of evidence that in many visual neurons stimuli presented outside the CRF strongly and selectively influence neural responses to stimuli presented within the CRF. These results suggest obvious mechanisms for local-global comparisons within visuotopically organized structures. Such broad and specific surround mechanisms could participate in many functions that require the integration of inputs over wide regions of the visual space such as the perceptual constancies, the segregation of figure from ground, and depth perception through motion parallax. In the first section of this paper, we trace the historical development of the evidence of response selectivity for visual stimuli presented beyond the CRF; in the second, examine the anatomical pathways that sub serve these far-reaching surround mechanisms; and in the third, explore the possible relationships between these mechanisms and perception."

The electrical signs of the impulse discharges of single cortical cells were recorded as the monkeys executed tasks requiring them to fixate stationary visual targets, track those which moved slowly, and to make saccadic movements to foveate those which suddenly jumped from one locus to another within the field of view. A total of 907 neurons of area 7 were identified in terms of their physiological properties, particularly the correlation of their activity with the oculomotor components of these behavioral acts of directed visual attention; 480 of these were located by cytoarchitectural layer. Most identifiable cells of area 7 are visuomotor neurons, in a special and conditional sense. Their discharge frequencies increase before and during those steady fixations and movements of the eyes which secure and maintain foveation of objects, but only if the visual targets engaged are linked by a strong motivational drive; in our experiments, one between thirst and the light whose dimming the animal has learned to detect for liquid reward. We have identified and studied three major classes of neurons in area 7. 2. The visual fixation neurons (57%) accelerate discharge synchronously with fixation of a visual object the animal desires. The incremented discharge continues until reward, but then declines abruptly even when there is no immediate shift of the line of gaze. Fixation neurons are relatively inactive during those casual fixations by which the animal insepcts the surrounding environment. Mist fixation neurons subtend gaze fields limited to one quadrant or half of the total gaze field. The sum of the gaze fields of the fixation neurons in one hemisphere is weighted moderately toward the contralateral side. Fixation cells also discharge during slow pursuit movements in any direction so long as the movement stays within the gaze field of the neuron under study. About 40% of fixation cells are suppressed before and during saccadic movements of the eyes to a new target within the gaze field of the fixation cell. Those suppressed are located preferentially in layer V of the cortex. Suppression is maximal for saccades directed contralaterally to the hemisphere under study. 3. Visual tracking neurons are active during oculomotor pursuit of slowly moving visual objects, not during steady fixations. They show a marked directional but no laterality relation, and are suppressed before and during a visually evoked saccade superimposed on the smooth pursuit movement. The rate of discharge is a flat function of tracking speed so that these cells do not appear to emit signals which specify the speed of smooth pursuit movements. 4. The saccade neurons are active before and during visually evoked saccadic movements of the eyes but not before spontaneous saccades, no matter whether made in light or near darkness. The discharge of saccade neurons leads the eye movement by as much as 150 ms (mean, 73 ms)..."

                "text": "From the Author's Introduction \n \nSince I am neither a neurologist nor a psychiatrist, but a mathematician, the work that follows requires some explanation and justification. It is an approach toward the understanding of the nervous system from the mathematician's point of view. However, this statement must immediately be qualified in both of its essential parts. \n \nFirst, it is an overstatement to describe what I am attempting here as an \"approach toward the understanding\"; it is merely a somewhat systematized set of speculations as to how such an approach ought to be made. That is, I am trying to guess which of the---mathematically guided--lines of attack seem, from the hazy distance in which we see most of theme a priori promising, and which ones have the opposite appearance. I will also offer some rationalizations of these guesses. \n \nSecond, the \"mathematician's point of view,\" as I would like to have it understood in this contexts carries a distribution of emphases that differs from the usual one: apart from the stress on the general mathematical techniques, the logical and the statistical aspects will be in the foreground. Furthermore, logics and statistics should be primarily, although not exclusively, viewed as the basic tools of \"information theory.\" Also, that body of experience which has grown up around the planning, evaluating, and coding of complicated logical and mathematical automata will be the focus of much of this information theory. The most typical, but not the only, such automata are, of course, the large electronic computing machines. \n \nLet me note, in passing, that it would be very satisfactory if one could talk about a \"theory\" of such automata. Regrettably, what at this moment exists---and to what I must appeal--can as yet be described only as an imperfectly articulated and hardly formalized \"body of experience.\" \n \nLastly, my main aim is actually to bring out a rather different aspect of the matter. I suspect that a deeper mathematical study of the nervous system --\"mathematical\" in the sense outlined above--- will affect our understanding of the aspects of mathematics itself that are involved. In fact, it may alter the way in which we look on mathematics and logics proper. I will try to explain my reasons for this belief later."

Specifically, such a mechanism exploits dynamic collective behavior of a system with attractive fixed points in its phase space. In contrast to the usual methods of reliable computation involving a large number of redundant elements, this technique of self-repair only requires collective computation with a few units, and it is amenable to quantitative investigation. Experiments on parallel computing arrays show that this mechanism leads naturally to rapid self-repair, adaptation to the environment, recognition and discrimination of fuzzy inputs, and conditional learning, properties that are commonly associated with biological computation."

The first mechanism averages an apparition over a group, and in the treatment of this mechanism it is suggested that scansion plays a significant part. The second mechanism reduces an apparition to a standard selected from among its many legitimate presentations. The former mechanism is exemplified by the recognition of chords regardless of pitch and shapes regardless of size. The latter is exemplified here only in the reflexive mechanism translating apparitions to the fovea.

First, the incoming information from the lateral geniculate bodies is rearranged so that most cells in the striate cortex respond to specifically oriented line segments, and, second, information originating from the two eyes converges upon single cells. The rearrangement and convergence do not take place immediately, however: in layer IV c, where the bulk of the afferents terminate, virtually all cells have fields with circular symmetry and are strictly monocular, driven from the left eye or from the right, but not both; at subsequent stages, in layers above and below IV c, most cells show orientation specificity, and about half are binocular. In a binocular cell the receptive fields in the two eyes are on corresponding regions in the two retinas and are identical in structure, but one eye is usually more effective than the other in influencing the cell; all shades of ocular dominance are seen. These two functions are strongly reflected in the architecture of the cortex, in that cells with common physiological properties are grouped together in vertically organized systems of columns. In an ocular dominance column all cells respond preferentially to the same eye. By four independent anatomical methods it has been shown that these columns have the"

                "text": "Of the many possible functions of the macaque monkey primary visual cortex (striate cortex, area 17) two are now fairly well understood. First, the incoming information from the lateral geniculate bodies is rearranged so that most cells in the striate cortex respond to specifically oriented line segments, and, second, information originating from the two eyes converges upon single cells. The rearrangement and convergence do not take place immediately, however: in layer IVc, where the bulk of the afferents terminate, virtually all cells have fields with circular symmetry and are strictly monocular, driven from the left eye or from the right, but not both; at subsequent stages, in layers above and below IVc, most cells show orientation specificity, and about half are binocular. In a binocular cell the receptive fields in the two eyes are on corresponding regions in the two retinas and are identical in structure, but one eye is usually more effective than the other in influencing the cell; all shades of ocular dominance are seen. These two functions are strongly reflected in the architecture of the cortex, in that cells with common physiological properties are grouped together in vertically organized systems of columns. In an ocular dominance column all cells respond preferentially to the same eye. By four independent anatomical methods it has been shown that these columns have the form of vertically disposed alternating left-eye and right-eye slabs, which in horizontal section form alternating stripes about 400 \u03bcm thick, with occasional bifurcations and blind endings. Cells of like orientation specificity are known from physiological recordings to be similarly grouped in much narrower vertical sheeet-like aggregations, stacked in orderly sequences so that on traversing the cortex tangentially one normally encounters a succession of small shifts in orientation, clockwise or counterclockwise; a 1 mm traverse is usually accompanied by one or several full rotations through 180\u00b0, broken at times by reversals in direction of rotation and occasionally by large abrupt shifts. A full complement of columns, of either type, left-plus-right eye or a complete 180\u00b0 sequence, is termed a hypercolumn. Columns (and hence hypercolumns) have roughly the same width throughout the binocular part of the cortex. The two independent systems of hypercolumns are engrafted upon the well known topographic representation of the visual field. The receptive fields mapped in a vertical penetration through cortex show a scatter in position roughly equal to the average size of the fields themselves, and the area thus covered, the aggregate receptive field, increases with distance from the fovea. A parallel increase is seen in reciprocal magnification (the number of degrees of visual field corresponding to 1 mm of cortex). Over most or all of the striate cortex a movement of 1-2 mm, traversing several hypercolumns, is accompanied by a movement through the visual field about equal in size to the local aggregate receptive field. Thus any 1-2 mm block of cortex contains roughly the machinery needed to subserve an aggregate receptive field. In the cortex the fall-off in detail with which the visual field is analysed, as one moves out from the foveal area, is accompanied not by a reduction in thickness of layers, as is found in the retina, but by a reduction in the area of cortex (and hence the number of columnar units) devoted to a given amount of visual field: unlike the retina, the striate cortex is virtually uniform morphologically but varies in magnification. In most respects the above description fits the newborn monkey just as well as the adult, suggesting that area 17 is largely genetically programmed. The ocular dominance columns, however, are not fully developed at birth, since the geniculate terminals belonging to one eye occupy layer IVc throughout its length, segregating out into separate columns only after about the first 6 weeks, whether or not the animal has visual experience. If one eye is sutured closed during this early period the columns belonging to that eye become shrunken and their companions correspondingly expanded. This would seem to be at least in part the result of interference with normal maturation, though sprouting and retraction of axon terminals are not excluded."

MT is a small, elliptically shaped area on the posterior bank of the superior temporal sulcus which can be identified by its direct inputs from striate cortex and by its distinctive pattern of heavy myelination. Its average surface area is 33 mm2, which is less than 3% of the size of striate cortex. It contains a complete, topographically organized representation of the contralateral visual hemifield. There are substantial irregularities in the detailed pattern of topographic organization, however, and the representation is significantly more complex than that found for MT in other primates. Much of MT is devoted to the representation of central visual fields, with the emphasis on central vision being similar to that found in striate cortex."

It is argued that the critical factor that hinders development of better resolving power is the difficulty of confining light within the waveguide-like outer segment, and that for sensitivity this critical factor is the thermal decomposition of photosensitive pigments. Knowledge of these limits makes many surprising details of the eye intelligible. Understanding the difficulties posed by the narrow dynamic range of nerve fibres may give similar insight into the coding of the retinal image for transmission to the brain. Our level of understanding changes when we come to the visual cortex, for although we do not lack good anatomical and neurophysiological data, these do not make the principles of operation self-evident in the way that the structure of the eye immediately suggests that it is an image-forming device. The cortex converts the representation of the visual field that it receives into reliable knowledge of the world around us, and the trouble may be that we lack good models of how this can be done. A system that can respond to single quanta and resolve almost to the diffraction limit is unlikely to employ grossly inefficient methods for those higher functions upon which its whole utility depends, and so it is worth seeking out the limiting factors. The quality of human performance at certain higher perceptual tasks is high compared with the limit of reliable statistical inference; hence much of the sample of information available in a visual image must be effectively utilized. But there are strong limitations on the connectivity in the cortex, so that one is forced to consider how the relevant information can be collected together. Three stages of dealing with the visual image are proposed: the improvement of the cortical map in primary visual cortex by processes analogous to spatial and temporal interpolation ; the detection of linking features in this map; and the concentration of this information by non-topographical mapping in adjacent visual areas."

This book examines the measurement of this movement and the use of relative movement to locate the boundaries of physical objects in the environment. It investigates the nature of the computations that are necessary to perform this analysis by any vision system, biological or artificial. \nThe author first defines the goals of these visual tasks, reveals the properties of the physical world that a vision system can rely upon to achieve such goals, and suggests general methods that can be used to carry out the tasks. From the general methods, she designs algorithms specifying a particular sequence of computations that a vision system can execute to perform these visual tasks. These algorithms are implemented on a computer system under a variety of circumstances. Combined with the traditional approaches of psychology and neurophysiology, this computational approach provides an exciting analysis of visual function, raising many new questions about the human vision system for further investigation. \nEllen Catherine Hildreth received her doctorate from MIT. She is a Research Scientist in the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory and associate director of theCenter for Biological Information Processing at the Whitaker College of Health Sciences, Technology, and Management.

                "text": "1. Recordings were made from single units in the middle temporal visual area (MT) of anesthetized, paralyzed macaque monkeys. A computer-driven stimulator was used to make quantitative tests of selectivity for stimulus direction, speed, and orientation. The data were taken from 168 units that were histologically identified as being in MT. 2. The results confirm previous reports of a high degree of direction selectivity in MT. The response above background to stimuli moving in a unit's preferred direction was, an average, 10.9 times that to stimuli moving in the opposite direction. There was a marked tendency for nearby units to have similar preferred directions. 3. Most units were also sharply tuned for the speed of stimulus motion. For some cells the response fell to less than half-maximal at speeds only a factor of two from the optimum; on average, responses were greater than half-maximal only over a 7.7-fold range of speed. The distribution of preferred speeds for different units was unimodal, with a peak near 32 degrees/s; the total range of preferred speeds extended from 2 to 256 degrees/s. Nearby units generally responded best to similar speeds of motion. 4. Most units in MT showed selectivity for stimulus orientation when tested with stationary, flashed bars. However, stationary stimuli generally elicited only brief responses; when averaged over the duration of the stimulus, the responses were much less than those to moving stimuli. The preferred orientation was usually, but not always, perpendicular to the preferred direction of movement. 5. A comparison of the results of the present study with a previous quantitative investigation in the owl monkey shows a striking similarity in response properties in MT of the two species. 6. The presence of both direction and speed selectivity in MT of the macaque suggests that this area is more specialized for the analysis of visual motion than has been previously recognized."

It is argued that the critical factor that hinders development of better resolving power is the difficulty of confining light within the waveguide-like outer segment, and that for sensitivity this critical factor is the thermal decomposition of photosensitive pigments. Knowledge of these limits makes many surprising details of the eye intelligible. Understanding the difficulties posed by the narrow dynamic range of nerve fibres may give similar insight into the coding of the retinal image for transmission to the brain. Our level of understanding changes when we come to the visual cortex, for although we do not lack good anatomical and neurophysiological data, these do not make the principles of operation self-evident in the way that the structure of the eye immediately suggests that it is an image-forming device. The cortex converts the representation of the visual field that it receives into reliable knowledge of the world around us, and the trouble may be that we lack good models of how this can be done. A system that can respond to single quanta and resolve almost to the diffraction limit is unlikely to employ grossly inefficient methods for those higher functions upon which its whole utility depends, and so it is worth seeking out the limiting factors. The quality of human performance at certain higher perceptual tasks is high compared with the limit of reliable statistical inference; hence mnuch of the sample of information available in a visual image must be effectively utilized. But there are strong limitations on the connectivity in the cortex, so that one is forced to consider how the relevant information can be collected together. Three stages of dealing with the visual image are proposed: the improvement of the cortical map in primary visual cortex by processes analogous to spatial and temporal interpolation; the detection of linking features in this map; and the concentration of this information by non-topographical mapping in adjacent visual areas."

The fundamental issue involves the interaction of different levels of representation of visual information. The technical and theoretical problems that must be addressed in specifying this interaction arise in any attempt to model visual object perception. We attempt to deal with some difficult aspects of this process within the context of Feldman's Four Frames model of visual perception. The model consists of four continually interacting representational frames, expressed in terms of a massively parallel, connectionist formalism. Within the Four Frames model, the problem of accessing object representations using visual feature information can be defined in specific computational terms. This paper presents the detailed design of a connectionist model as a possible solution to some of the major problems in the visual recognition of objects. The model proposes that an object is represented as a hierarchical structure of geometric subparts. Recognition proceeds by determining in parallel that all subparts of an object are present in the image, and then sequentially verifying that each subpart is in the proper spatial relation to the others. Implementation results demonstrate that the model can recognize any of a set of simple objects given fairly general feature input. Although the model is developed in the context of a drastically simplified visual domain, the principles it embodies are argued to adhere to many of the behavioral and biological constraints of real-world vision."

In the first part of this paper the events of that meeting are recalled. Goltz was reluctant to accept the idea of localization because of the restitution of function after injury to the cortex, and because of the general rather than specific residual disabilities of his lesioned dogs. On the other hand, Ferrier's monkeys with cortical lesions demonstrated convincingly that local lesions can produce loss of specific functions. One hundred years later a meeting was held in Oxford on the same topic, and the discussions that took place are summarized in the second part of this paper. No-one doubted the doctrine of localization, namely that different parts of the cerebral cortex normally perform different specialized roles. However, there was no unanimity about how to separate or count the number of different parts of the cortex, nor about the nature of the specialized roles of the parts, nor about any common characteristics of the functions of different parts. In other words, though localization was agreed upon, precisely what the functions are that are localized remained obscure. The third section of this paper advances some speculations on this point. Is a theory of cortical function that would encompass the diverse roles of different parts perhaps within sight, which might even explain the plasticity that must underlie the restitution of function that so impressed Goltz one hundred years ago?"

                "text": "We describe in this paper the results of a new study of the inferior parietal lobule in 10 waking monkeys combining the methods of behavioral control, visual stimulation, and single neuron analysis. In this study, 1682 neurons were identified; 804 were studied in detail. Neurons insensitive to visual stimuli comprise the fixation, oculomotor, and projection-manipulation classes thought to be involved in initiatives toward action. The largest group of the light-sensitive (LS) neurons were activated from large and frequently bilateral response areas that excluded the foveal region; we term this foveal sparing. The remaining cells subtended areas including the fovea, when tested with large stimuli (6 degrees X 6 degrees), but only 8 of 216 cells studied in detail responded to the small fixation target light. We propose that a dynamic central neural process associated with the acts of fixation and visual attention suppresses responses to foveal stimuli. Parietal LS neurons are sensitive to stimulus movement and direction over a wide range of velocities. The vectors point either inward toward the center or outward toward the perimeter of the visual field, and for neurons with bilateral response areas, the vectors commonly point in opposite directions in the two half-fields; we term this opponent vector organization. The functional properties of area 7 LS neurons are such that they could signal motion in the immediate surround and the apparent motion accompanying head movements and forward locomotion. We surmise that they contribute to a central neural image of immediately surrounding space and to the perceptual constancy of that space obtaining during bodily movement. These properties are suitable for the attraction of gaze and attention to objects and events in the peripheral visual fields. It is this system, together with the classes of parietal neurons concerned with action initiatives, whose destruction is thought to account for the hemi-inattention and neglect of the parietal lobe syndrome in primates."

This somato-sensory representation was called the second somatic sensory area (S II) since it was discovered subsequent to the first somatic sensory area in most species that contained multiple cortical somatosensory representations. According to some investigators, the effective somatic stimuli for activating evoked potential or single neuron recording sites in SII in animals anesthetized with barbiturates were considerably different from the adequate stimulus parameters for eliciting activity in S I. Receptive fields in primates (1,76-79) and subprimates (4,45,58,60,81) were larger, often bilateral, poorly demarcated and extensively overlapping. Activity in the primate SII was also found to be more susceptible to the level of barbiturate anesthesia (77, 78). As a consequence, the topographic representation of the body in S II was found to be coarser and more difficult to define. In addition, the receptors associated with the sense of position and movement were said not to be represented in S II according to some (76), but not all investigators (41)."

If the stimuli are presented very briefly, eye movements are not possible. The time during which the after-image of the stimulus is available for inspection is terminated by presentation of a masking pattern. We show here that in these conditions a small pattern is easily detected against a background made up of many others, only if this target pattern differs from the background patterns in certain local features. In this case the detectability of the target is almost independent of the number of background elements, suggesting that a parallel process is operating. Detection of patterns not differing from their backgrounds in such features requires focal attention which is a serial process. The aperture of this attention is scaled to minimize the number of shifts of attention required."

                "text": "The electrical properties of the different anatomical types of retinal ganglion cells in the cat were calculated on the basis of passive cable theory from measurements made on histological material. Standard values for the electrical parameters were assumed (R $\\_i$ = 70 $\\Omega$ cm, C $\\_m$ = 2 $\\mu$ F cm $^{-2}$ , R $\\_m$ = 2500 $\\Omega$ cm $^2$ ). We conclude that these neurons need not be equipotential despite their small dimensions, mainly because of their extensive branching. The interactions between excitation and inhibition when the inhibitory battery is near the resting potential can be strongly nonlinear in these cells. To characterize the different types of ganglion cells in terms of this property we introduce F, the factor by which the soma depolarization induced by a given excitatory input is reduced by inhibition. In this framework we analyse some of the integrative properties of an arbitrary passive dendritic tree and we then derive the functional properties that are characteristic for the various types of ganglion cells. Our main results are: (i) Nonlinear saturation at the synapses may be made effectively smaller by spreading the same (conductance) input among several subunits on the dendritic field. Subunits are defined as regions of the dendritic field that are somewhat isolated from each other and roughly equipotential within. (ii) Shunting inhibition can specifically veto an excitatory input, if it is located on the direct path to the soma. The F values can then be very high even when the excitatory inputs are much larger than the inhibitory, as long as the absolute value of inhibition is not too small. Inhibition more distal than excitation is much less effective. (iii) Specific branching patterns coupled with suitable distribution of synapses are potentially able to support complex information processing operations on the incoming excitatory and inhibitory signals. The quantitative analysis of the morphology of cat retinal ganglion cells leads to the following specific conclusions: (i) None of the cells examined satisfies Rall's equivalent cylinder condition. The dendritic tree cannot be satisfactorily approximated by a non-tapering cylinder. (ii) Under the assumption of a passive membrane, the dendritic architecture of the different types of retinal ganglion cells reflects characteristically different electrical properties, which are likely to be relevant for their physiological function and their information processing role: (a) $\\alpha$ cells have spatially inhomogeneous electrical properties, with many subunits. Within each subunit nonlinear effects may take place; between subunits good linear summation is expected. F values are relatively low. (b) $\\beta$ cells at small eccentricities have rather homogeneous electrical properties. Even distal inputs are weighted rather uniformly. Electrical inhomogeneities of the $\\alpha$ type appear for $\\beta$ cells at larger eccentricities. F values are low. (c) $\\gamma$ -like cells have few subunits, each with high input resistance underlying nonlinear saturation effects possibly related to a sluggish character. F values are high: inhibition of the shunting type can interact in a strongly nonlinear way with excitatory conductance inputs. (d) $\\delta$ -like cells show many subunits with a high input resistance, covering well the dendritic area. Within each subunit inhibition on the direct path to the soma can specifically veto a more distal excitation. It is conjectured that such a synaptic organization superimposed on the $\\delta$ cell morphology underlies directional selectivity to motion. (iii) Most of our data refer to steady-state properties. They probably apply, however, to all light evoked signals, since transient inputs with time to peak of 30 ms or more can be treated in terms of steady-state properties of the ganglion cells studied. (iv) All our results are affected only slightly by varying the parameter values within reasonable ranges. If, however, the membrane resistance were very high, all ganglion cells would approach equipotentiality. For R $\\_m$ = 8000 $\\Omega$ cm $^2$ subunits essentially disappear in all types of ganglion cells (for steady state inputs). Our results concerning nonlinear interaction of excitation and inhibition (F values) would, however, remain valid even for much larger values of R $\\_m$ and for any value of R $\\_i$ larger than 30-50 $\\Omega$ cm. The critical requirement is that peak inhibitory conductance changes must be sufficiently large (around 5 x 10 $^{-8}$ S) with an equilibrium potential close to the resting potential. Underestimation of the diameters of the dendritic branches may affect these conclusions (F could be significantly lower)."

                "text": "1. Recordings were made from single neurones, or small clusters of cells, in five prestriate visual areas of rhesus monkey cortex. The cells were studied for their binocularity, as well as for their orientational, motion and colour preferences. In all, 1500 cells were studied, 250 cells for each of the areas V2, V3, V3A and the motion area of the posterior bank of the superior temporal sulcus, and 500 cells for V4. All the cells referred to in this study can be placed in one prestriate area or another unambiguously. 2. The great majority of cells in all areas were binocularly driven, without monocular preferences. Within each area, there were cells that either preferred binocular stimulation markedly, or were responsive to binocular stimulation only. The ocular interaction histograms for all areas are remarkably similar when tested at a fixed disparity. 3. Over 70% of the cells in areas V2, V3 and V3A were selective for orientation. The receptive fields of cells were larger in V3 and V3A than in V2. By contrast, less than 50% of the cells in V4 and the motion area of the superior temporal sulcus were orientation selective. 4. Directionally selective cells were found in all areas. But they were present in small numbers (less than 15%) in areas V2, V3, V3A and V4. By contrast, 90% of the cells in the motion area of the superior temporal sulcus were directionally selective. 5. 8% of the cells in V2 had opponent colour properties. Cells with such properties were not found in V3, V3A or in the motion area of the superior temporal sulcus. By contrast, 54% of the cells in the V4 complex had opponent colour properties. 6. It is argued that despite its uniformity in cytoarchitectural appearance and in ocular interaction patterns, there is a functional division of labour within the prestriate cortex. Evidence for this is seen not only in the different concentrations of functional cell types in distinct areas of the prestriate cortex, but also in the differential anatomical and callosal connexions of each area."

A feature of the mathematical model is that a concise description of the behavioral organization of the movement has been formulated which is separate and distinct from the description of the dynamics of movement execution. Based on observations of voluntary movements in primates, the organization has been described as though the goal were to make the smoothest movement possible under the circumstances, i.e., to minimize the accelerative transients. This has been formalized by using dynamic optimization theory to determine the movement which minimizes the rate of change of acceleration (jerk) of the limb. Based on observations of muscle mechanics, the concept of a \u201cvirtual position\u201d determined by the active states of the muscles is rigorously defined as one of the mechanical consequences of the neural commands to the muscles. This provides insight into the mechanics of perturbed and unperturbed movements and is a useful aid in the separation of the descriptions of movement organization and movement execution."

                "text": "In the central nervous system the visual pathway from retina to striate cortex provides an opportunity to observe and compare single unit responses at several distinct levels. Patterns of light stimuli most effective in influencing units at one level may no longer be the most effective at the next. From differences in responses at successive stages in the pathway one may hope to gain some understanding of the part each stage plays in visual perception. By shining small spots of light on the light-adapted cat retina Kuffler (1953) showed that ganglion cells have concentric receptive fields, with an 'on' centre and an 'off ' periphery, or vice versa. The 'on' and 'off' areas within a receptive field were found to be mutually antagonistic, and a spot restricted to the centre of the field was more effective than one covering the whole receptive field (Barlow, FitzHugh & Kuffler, 1957). In the freely moving lightadapted cat it was found that the great majority of cortical cells studied gave little or no response to light stimuli covering most of the animal's visual field, whereas small spots shone in a restricted retinal region often evoked brisk responses (Hubel, 1959). A moving spot of light often produced stronger responses than a stationary one, and sometimes a moving spot gave more activation for one direction than for the opposite. The present investigation, made in acute preparations, includes a study of receptive fields of cells in the cat's striate cortex. Receptive fields of the cells considered in this paper were divided into separate excitatory and inhibitory ('on' and 'off') areas. In this respect they resembled retinal ganglion-cell receptive fields. However, the shape and arrangement of excitatory and inhibitory areas differed strikingly from the concentric pattern found in retinal ganglion cells. An attempt was made to correlate responses to moving stimuli"

The strategy of mental rotation (of the type used in most mental rotation experiments and in some psychometric tests of spatial ability) uses a coordinate system defined by the standard axes of our visual world (i.e. horizontal, vertical, and depth axes). Within this strategy, rotations are performed around one or more of the standard axes. The paper provides a detailed theoretical account of the mental rotation of individuals of low and high spatial ability as they solve problems taken from psychometric tests. The theory is instantiated as two related computer simulation models that not only solve the problems, but also match the response times for the two groups. The simulation models contain modularized units of procedural knowledge called productions, that select and execute the appropriate actions at each knowledge state. Small localized differences between the two models simulate the large quantitative and qualitative differences between the two groups of subjects."

                "text": "This paper examines the idea that ordered patterns of nerve connections are set up by means of markers carried by the individual cells. The case of the ordered retinotectal projection in amphibia and fishes is discussed in great detail. It is suggested that retinotectal mappings are the result of two mechanisms acting in concert. One mechanism induces a set of retinal markers into the tectum. By this means, an initially haphazard pattern of synapses is transformed into a continuous or piece-wise continuous projection. The other mechanism places the individual pieces of the map in the correct orientation. The machinery necessary for this inductive scheme has been expressed in terms of a set of differential equations, which have been solved numerically for a number of cases. Straightforward assumptions are made as to how markers are distributed in the retina; how they are induced into the tectum; and how the induced markers bring about alterations in the pattern of synaptic contacts. A detailed physiological interpretation of the model is given. The inductive mechanism has been formulated at the level of the individual synaptic interactions. Therefore, it is possible to specify, in a given situation, not only the nature of the end state of the mapping but also how the mapping develops over time. The role of the modes of growth of retina and tectum in shaping the developing projection becomes clear. Since, on this model, the tectum is initially devoid of markers, there is an important difference between the development and the regeneration of ordered mappings. In the development of duplicate maps from various types of compound-eyes, it is suggested that the tectum, rather than the retina, contains an abnormal distribution of markers. An important parameter in these experiments, and also in the regeneration experiments where part-duplication has been found, is the range of interaction amongst the retinal cells. It is suggested that the results of many of the regeneration experiments (including apparently contradictory ones) are manifestations of a conflict between the two alternative ways of specifying the orientation of the map: through the information carried by the markers previously induced into the tectum and through the orientation mechanism itself."

                "text": "Cells in the cat's striate cortex show marked specificity in their responses to restricted retinal stimulation (Hubel & Wiesel, 1959, 1962). The most effective stimulus shapes are long narrow rectangles of light ('slits'), dark bars against a light background ('dark bars'), and straight-line borders separating areas of different brightness ('edges'). A given cell responds vigorously when an appropriate stimulus is shone on the receptive field or moved across it, provided the stimulus is presented in a specific orientation. This orientation is termed the 'receptive-field axis orientation'. It is critical, and constant for any particular cell, but may differ for different cells. The visual cortex is subdivided into discrete regions or columns extending from surface to white matter, in which all cells have the same receptivefield axis orientation (Hubel & Wiesel, 1962). The present experiments were undertaken with the object of learning more about the anatomical configuration of the columns. We wished to have a clearer idea of their shape, especially if the walls of a column were, as previous work suggested, parallel to the radial fibre bundles of the cortex and perpendicular to the cortical layers, and whether the columns were uniform or irregular in their cross-sectional shape and size. Furthermore, we were curious to know if there was any relationship between the receptive-field axis orientations of neighbouring columns, or whether, on the contrary, the different columns were intermixed in a random way throughout the cortex. These questions were approached: (1) by making several deep, closely spaced, parallel micro-electrode penetrations, placing electrolytic lesions at every shift in receptive-field orientation, and(2) by making many short penetrations in a small cortical area, noting the axis orientation of cells lying in the upper one or two layers of cortex."

Interaction in this dendritic network proceeds without spike action potentials. Interaction is mediated by graded electrotonic changes of potential and is transmitted through high sensitivity (submillivolt threshold) synapses rather than by lower sensitivity (20 to 100-mv threshold) synapses typical of projection neurons. A crucial feature of local circuits is their high degree of interaction both through specialized junctional structures and through the extracellular fields generated by local and more distant brain regions. The anatomical evidence for the nature and distribution of neuronal local circuits in the nervous system is surveyed. Bioelectric mechanisms are discussed in relation to the special properties of local circuits, including dendrodendritic synapses, synaptic sensitivity, electrotonic coupling, and field effects. Intraneuronal and interneuronal transport of various types of substances suggests that the biochemical and the bioelectrical parameters are functionally interwoven. Through such interactions neuronal local circuits, with their distinctive properties, may play an essential role in higher brain function."

All three markers revealed strips running throughout the area, parallel to the cortical surface. The boundaries of these strips provide an anatomical criterion for defining the borders of this extrastriate region. Further, the demonstration of these strips allows a functional and anatomical analysis of modules in the area, just as the recent demonstration of spots in the primary visual cortex has allowed an analysis of modules there. The strips differ structurally and functionally from interstrip regions and these differences are similar to those seen between the spots and the interspot regions in the primary visual cortex. In the macaque the strips and spots differ with regard to binocular organization."

The study of cortico-cortical connections arising from these points revealed several retinotopic arrangements in the distribution of these connections and, it is argued, of the extrastriate cortical recipient areas themselves. On retinotopic distribution exists along the banks of the middle suprasylvian sulcus, in which lower and upper visual fields are rostral and caudal, respectively, and central and peripheral visual fields are ventral (or lateral) and dorsal (or medial), respectively, in the banks. This arrangement is called the lateral suprasylvian area (LS). Another retinotopic distribution exists along the caudal bank of the posterior suprasylvian sulcus. In this region, called the posteroior suprasylvania area(PS), points at, or near, the horizontal meridian are mainly represented, central and peripheral parts of which are located dorsaly and ventrally in the sulcus, respectively. Two other retinotopic distributions of connected exist in visual areas 2(V2) and 3 (V3) of Hubel and Wiesel, in which lower and upper visual fields are situated rostrally and caudally in these areas, respectively. Along the horizontal meridian, central is lateral in V3 and medial in V2, while more peripheral points, (15 degrees, 45 degrees) of V3 and V2 approach each other, in a mirror image fashion, along the coronal plane. However, representations of these peripheral parts of the horizontal meridian are repeated twice again: extensively, caudally along the lateral border of area 18, and more restrictively rostrally, along the lateral border of area 18."

The term 'directionally selective' means that a unit gives a vigorous discharge of impulses when a stimulus object is moved through its receptive field in one direction (called the preferred direction), whereas motion in the reverse direction (called null) evokes little or no response. The preferred direction differs in different units, and the activity of a set of such units signals the direction of movement of objects in the visual field. In the rabbit the preferred and null directions cannot be predicted from a map of the receptive field showing the regions yielding on or off-responses to stationary spots. Furthermore, the preferred direction is unchanged by changing the stimulus; in particular, reversing the contrast of a spot or a black-white border does not reverse the preferred direction. Hubel & Wiesel (1962) thought that the directional selectivity of the cat's cortical neurons could be explained by the asymmetrical arrangement of on and off zones in the receptive field, and the simple interaction of effects summated over these zones, but the foregoing results rule out this explanation, at least in the rabbit's retina (Barlow & Hill, 1963). In the present paper we go on from this point to describe experiments which show, first, that directional selectivity is not due to optical aberrations of some kind and, secondly, that it is not a simple matter of the latency of response varying systematically across the receptive field. After these negative results we describe experiments upon the organization of directional selectivity within the receptive field, and upon its mechanism. These lead us to the conclusion that the ganglion cells responding to a"

They have identified three problem areas that are expected to be particularly noticeable as larger assemblies are studied for long periods under conditions where the subject brain is engaged in a behavioral or learning task. The first concerns monitoring a moving animal. It is necessary to develop better multielectrode systems as well as appropriate manipulators for the high degree of stability that is required. Multichannel amplification (perhaps multiplexing with telemetry) must be developed in sizes that can be carried on the head. Second, meaningful feedback must be given to the experiments in time to help modify the conditions of the experiment. Full cross correlation analysis of simultaneously recorded neurons takes a large amount of capacity and time, which slows experimentation. New reduction or abstraction measurement that is practical for rapid feedback is needed. Finally, a better description of a neuronal assembly is needed. A series of new tools deployed to carry out multineuron experiments are described, including electrodes and computer analysis techniques."

In the primary visual cortex (area 17, the first cortical receiving area for visual information) these histological differences correspond to functional subdivisions1\u20136, cytochrome-dark regions being concerned with information about colour and cytochrome-light regions concerned with form. Here we report that the second visual area, area 18, which receives its main cortical input from area 17 (refs 7,8), similarly has functional subdivisions that correspond to the cytochrome oxidase staining pattern. In area 18 the segregation between form and colour is maintained, reinforcing our notion that form and colour information follow parallel pathways. The specific differences between cells in areas 17 and 18 suggest that a possible step in hierarchical information processing is spatial generalization, analogous to the difference between simple and complex cells."

                "text": "The distribution of interhemispheric connections was studied in extrastriate visual cortex of the macaque monkey. Callosal fiber terminations were identified by staining for anterograde degeneration following transection of the splenium of the corpus callosum. Retrogradely labeled cell bodies of callosal projection neurons were identified histochemically following application of horseradish peroxidase to the cut surface of the callosum. Results were displayed on unfolded, two-dimensional representations of the cortex, which permitted spatial and topological relationships between callosal recipient and callosal free cortical regions to be discerned readily. The overall pattern of callosal inputs to visual cortex can be subdivided into nine callosal recipient zones which surround seven callosal free regions in the occipital, temporal, and parietal lobes. This pattern provides reliable and useful landmarks for identifying the borders of at least five topographically organized extrastriate visual areas. There is a pronounced dorsoventral asymmetry in callosal projections, not recognized in previous studies, which reflects an asymmetry in the organization of visual areas in dorsal versus ventral halves of the occipital lobe. The pattern of callosal fiber terminations is mirrored by a very similar distribution of callosal projection neurons. There are significant regional differences in the laminar distribution of callosal projection cells, and these differences may reflect functionally distinct cortical subdivisions. A considerable degree of individual variability was found in the relationship of callosal connections to gyral and sulcal landmarks as well as in the fine structure of individual callosal recipient strips, suggesting that each animal has a unique \u201ccallosal fingerprint.\u201d These findings emphasize the usefulness of the callosal pathway in elucidating the functional organization of extrastriate visual cortex."

In the pesent paper these paterns have been examined by the 2\u2010deoxyuglucose autoradiographic method developed by Sokoloff and his group (Kennedy et al, '76). An anesthetized monkey was given an injection of 14C 2\u2010deoxyglucose and then visually stimulated for 45 minues with a large array of moving vertical stripes, with both eyes open. The 14C autoradiographs of striate cortex showed vertical bands of label extending through the full cortical thickness. Layer I was at most only lightly labelled, and layers IV b and VI wee the most dense. Layer IV c (the site of terminations of most geniculate afferents) was labelled uniformly along its length, as expected from the lack of orientation specificity of units recorded in that leyer. In the other layers the pattern seen in tangential sections was complex, consisting of swirling stripes with many bifurcations and blind endings, but with occasional more regular regions whee the stripes wee roughly parallel. Interstripe distance was rather constant, at 570 \u03bcm. Ocular dominance columns were examined in this same monkey, in the same region, by injecting one eye with 3H\u2010proline two weeks before the deoxyglucose experiment, and preparing a second set of autoradiographs of the sections after prolonged washing to remove the 14C\u2010deoxyglucose. As seen in tangential sections through layer IV c, these columns had the usual stripe\u2010like form, with a period of 770 \u03bcm, but were simpler in their pattern than the orientation stripes, with fewer bifurcations and less swirling. A comparison of the two sets of columns in the same area showed many intersections, but no strict or consistent relationships: angles of intersection showed a distribution that was not obviously different from that expected for any two randomly superimposed sets of lines."

                "text": "1. Single-unit activity was recorded from the superior colliculus (SC) of monkeys trained to look to visual targets presented on an oscilloscope screen. On one task, target localization required that information concerning the retinal position of the target be combined with information concerning current or future eye position. This task also permitted a dissociation between the site of retinal stimulation and the metrics of the saccade triggered by the stimulation. 2. Vigorous visual responses of superficial SC neurons may occur that do not result in the activation of underlying saccade-related cells. The activity of these neurons signals the occurrence of a visual stimulus, whether or not the stimulus is selected for foveal viewing. 3. Saccade-related (SR) discharges of most intermediate and deep-layer SC neurons precede saccades with particular vectors, regardless of the region of retinal activation initiating the saccade. The discharge of these neurons is tightly coupled to saccade onset, even if changes in eye position have occurred since target appearance. Thus, the discharge of these SR neurons must occur after retinal error and eye-position signals have been combined to compute the necessary saccade vector. For most SR neurons, direct retinal activation of overlying visual neurons had no effect on either the vigor or probability of a SR discharge. The discharge of overlying visual cells is neither necessary nor sufficient to activate most SR cells. 4. The discharge of some SR cells is dependent on prior activation of overlying visual cells. Of 53 SR cells, only 3 were completely dependent on visual stimulation, while another 8 discharged less vigorously if corresponding visual activation failed to occur. 5. About one-quarter of the SR cells showed long-lead preburst activity. This activation was characterized by a low level of firing, which began after the saccade signal and continued until a saccade-linked burst occurred. 6. Cells were isolated that were visually responsive yet discharged prior to saccades in the absence of appropriate retinal stimulation. No component of the discharge of these quasi-visual (QV) cells appeared to be motor in the usual sense. The activity of these neurons appears to reflect eye-position error (the difference between actual and desired eye position) and to hold this information in spatial register until a saccade occurs or is cancelled. 7. It is concluded that the presumed linkage, implied in earlier versions of the foveation hypothesis, between the superficial layers (receiving direct retinal inputs) and the deeper layers of the SC is not necessary for the activation of SR neurons. Results suggest that the SC must generate or receive a signal that combines retinal error and eye-position information. These findings are discussed in terms of current models of the saccadic-control system."

                "text": "1. A systematic study of the positional selectivity of visual fixation (VF) neurons of the posterior parietal association cortex (area 7a or PG) was made in seven hemispheres of four alert behaving monkeys. By gaze fixation on a small spot of light in space, 125 units were identified as VF neurons. the position of the fixation target was varied not only in the frontal plane, but also in depth. 2. Microelectrode penetrations were made in the anterior and posterior part of area 7a. The recording sites of 104 VF neurons, determined histologically, were distributed mainly in the posterior part: the caudal part of the posterior bank of the intraparietal sulcus and the caudal third of the anterior bank of the superior temporal sulcus. The following conclusions are based mainly on the observations of the VF neurons in the posterior part of area 7a. 3. Most of the VF neurons examined in the frontal plane (86/93) had a preferred direction of gaze along the horizontal (39/86), vertical (38/86), or diagonal axis (9/86), and their discharge rates were monotonic increasing functions of the angle of deviation from the center. 4. Many VF neurons had selectivity in the depth of fixation. The majority (41/63) were activated more intensely when the fixation point was nearer to the animal (less than 50 cm), whereas a considerable number (18/63) were activated better when the fixation point was further from the animal (100 cm or more). There were a few units (4/63) that discharged maximally at intermediate distances. 5. Thirty-two VF neurons were studied in detail along all three axes: vertical, horizontal, and depth. About half of them (17/32) were found to be selective both in the radial direction and the distance of fixation, while the others displayed selectivity in the direction of gaze alone (11/32) or in depth alone (4/32). 6. The activity of VF neurosis in the dark was compared to that in a lighted room in order to examine their relationship to eye position in detail. Half of the VF neurons tested (25/50) showed almost the same discharge rate in the dark as in the lighted room in spite of the absence of visual stimuli other than the target light in the fovea. Moreover, the discharge rate of the majority of these VF neurons displayed a close correlation with eye position, even in complete darkness. On the other hand nearly half of the VF neurons (22/50) showed a decrease in discharge rate in the dark during fixation at preferred positions suggesting that visual stimuli in the surroundings have some excitatory effects on these neurons. There were also some VF neurons whose activity decreased when the target light was interrputed. Even in such visually sensitive VF neurons, their positional selectivity depended mainly on eye position. 7..."

Several features of the two complete and separate representations of the contralateral body surface in cortical areas 3b and 1 of somatosensory cortex in owl monkeys were quantitatively studied. 2. Area1 magnification factors for different body regions in the two representations were obtained. The glabrous hand and foot regions were found to occupy nearly 100 times more cortical tissue per unit body-surface area than the trunk or upper arm. 3. In the representations of the hand digits, inverse magnification was linearly related to distance from the digit tips. 4. Receptive-field size was found to be proportional to inverse magnification over the entire body-surface representation as well as over the local region of the glabrous hand digits. The relation between receptive-field size and inverse magnification appears to be linear; specification of one would specify the other over the representation in one area. 5. By relating receptive-field overlap to distance separating recording sites, the area of cortex presumed to receive all fibers from any given receptive field was obtained and found to be independent of the body surface represented. Such an area of somatosensory cortex, about l1.5 mm in diameter, may be akin to the \u201chypercolumn\u201d proposed for primary visual cortex (6)."

Zero-crossings in each channel are then a set of discrete symbols which may be used for later processing such as contour extraction and stereopsis. A formulation of Logan's zero-crossing results is proved for the case of Fourier polynomials an extension of Logan's theorem to 2-dimensional functions is also proved. Within this framework, we shall describe an experimental and theoretical approach (developed by one of us with M. Fahle) to the problem of visual acuity and hyperacuity of human vision. The positional accuracy achieved, for instance, in reading a vernier is astonishingly high, corresponding to a fraction of the spacing between adjacent photoreceptors in the fovea. Stroboscopic presentation of a moving object can be interpolated by our visual system into the perception of continuous motion; and this 'spatiotemporal' interpolation also can be very accurate. It is suggested that the known spatiotemporal properties of the channels envisaged by the theory of visual processing outlined above implement an interpolation scheme which can explain human vernier acuity for moving targets."

Thus, it is unlikely that they should be fed the same information for further processing, yet both receive a strong input from patches of the upper layers of V2 (refs 10, 11), the area immediately adjoining the primary visual cortex, V1. V2, however, seems to comprise functionally distinct subregions, which can be revealed by staining the tissue for the mitochondrial enzyme cytochrome oxidase12\u201315. Here we report that V4 and V5 are connected with separate cytochrome oxidase-defined subregions of V2, suggesting that cortical pathways dealing with motion and colour perception are segregated in their passage through V2, and reinforcing evidence for functional specialization in the visual cortex16\u201318."

Binocularity and selectivity for disparity were examined using a computer-driven stimulator to activate each eye independently. Results were obtained from 91 single units in MT. 2. Most units in MT receive approximately balanced inputs from the two eyes, and very few could be driven through only one eye. 3. In one type of test for disparity selectivity, units were examined with stimuli that had different but fixed horizontal disparities, thereby simulating frontoparallel movements at different distances from the animal. About two-thirds of ;the units tested for fixed disparity selectivity (52/76) showed pronounced sensitivity to horizontal disparity. Most of these units could be grouped into the same four classes of disparity-tuned units that have previously been described in V1 and V2 of the macaque: near, far, tuned excitatory, and tuned inhibitory. 4. Twenty units were tested for sensitivity to vertical stimulus disparity, which does not normally contribute to stereopsis. Most were as sensitive to vertical disparities as to horizontal. 5. Units were also tested for selectivity for stimuli that moved with changing disparity, simulating trajectories with components of motion toward or away from the animal (motion in depth). No units were found to be truly selective for motion in depth. Units tuned for fixed disparity could appear to prefer motion in depth if tested only with trajectories whose common center point was far from the unit's optimal fixed disparity. However, we do not consider this to represent genuine selectivity for motion in depth, since 1) the responses ara adequately and more easily explained in terms of selectivity for fixed disparity and 2) the best overall response of these units is to frontoparallel motion at the optimal fixed disparity. This observation bears importantly on the interpretation of motion in depth selectivity in previous investigations. 6. The presence of a substantial degree of selectivity for fixed disparity in MT, together with previously demonstrated selectivities for direction and speed, indicates that MT is well suited for the analysis of motion in three-dimensional space."

Such images are known as intrinsic images, and examples are images of velocity (optical flow), surface orientation, occluding contour, and disparity. While intrinsic images are not segmented, they are distinctly easier to segment than the original intensity image. Segments can be detected by a general Hough transform technique. Networks of feature parameters are appended to the intrinsic image organization. Then the intrinsic image points are mapped into these networks. This mapping will be many-to-one onto parameter values that represent segments. \n \nThis basic method is extended into a general representation and control technique with the addition of three main ideas: abstraction levels; sequential search; and tight counting These ideas are a nucleus of a connectionist theory of low 'eve and m'ermediate-level vision. This theory explains segmentation in terms of massively parallel cooperative computation among intrinsic images and a set of parameter spaces at different levels of abstraction."

These two areas each contain a single representation of the visual hemifield and each has a distinctive cytoarchitecture. The visual hemifield representations in these two areas are nearly mirror images of each other. Compared to area 17, areas 18 and 19 have less cortical surface area, have a lower cortical magnification factor, contain less of the visual field and contain second order instead of first order transformations of the visual hemifield. An unusual asymmetry was found between the representations of the upper and lower visual quadrants not seen before in maps of other areas of cat or other species. A considerable amount of variability in the retinotopic organization of these two areas was found among cats."

A frame primitive is a local coordinate frame attached to certain more primitive perceptual data. The idea of assigning coordinate frames to objects and the role of such frames in gestalt phenomena is appreciated but has not been extensively modeled. We show that an implementation of frame primitives in a parallel, connectionist model has special virtues in understanding many aspects of perceptual dynamics. (Author)"

This theory describes adaptive processes which overcome limitations of the visual uptake process to synthesize informative visual representations of the external world. The brightness data include versions of the Craik-O\u2019Brien-Cornsweet effect and its exceptions, Bergstrom\u2019s demonstrations comparing the brightnesses of smoothly modulated and step-like luminance profiles, Hamada\u2019s demonstrations of nonclassical differences between the perception of luminance decrements and increments, Fechner\u2019s paradox, binocular brightness averaging, binocular brightness summation, binocular rivalry, and fading of stabilized images and ganzfelds. Familiar concepts such as spatial frequency analysis, Mach bands, and edge contrast are relevant but insufficient to explain the totality of these data. Two parallel contour-sensitive processes interact to generate the theory\u2019s brightness, color, and form explanations. A boundary-contour process is sensitive to the orientation and amount of contrast but not to the direction of contrast in scenic edges. It generates contours that form the boundaries of monocular perceptual domains. The spatial patterning of these contours is sensitive to the global configuration of scenic elements. A feature-contour process is insensitive to the orientation of contrast, but is sensitive to both the amount of contrast and to the direction of contrast in scenic edges. It triggers a diffusive filling-in reaction of featural quality within perceptual domains whose boundaries are dynamically defined by boundary contours. The boundary-contour system is hypothesized to include the hypercolumns in visual striate cortex. The feature-contour system is hypothesized to include the blobs in visual striate cortex. These preprocessed monocular activity patterns enter consciousness in the theory via a process of resonant binocular matching that is capable of selectively lifting whole monocular patterns into a binocular representation of form-and-color-in-depth. This binocular process is hypothesized to occur in area V4 of the visual pre striate cortex."

Cortical connections were assigned to specific visual areas on the basis of their relationship to the pattern of interhemispheric connections, revealed by staining for degeneration following callosal transection. MT was shown to be reciprocally connected with many topographically organized cortical visual areas, including V1, V2, V3, and V4. These pathways link regions representing corresponding portions of the visual field in the different areas. In addition, MT has reciprocal connections with two previously unidentified cortical areas, which we have designated the medial superior temporal area (MST) and the ventral intraparietal area (VIP). The laminar distribution of terminals and cell bodies in cortical areas connected with MT follows a consistent pattern. In areas V1, V2, and V3, the projections to MT arise largely or exclusively from cells in supragranular layers, and the reciprocal connections from MT terminate mainly in supragranular and infragranular layers. In contrast, the projections to MST and VIP terminate mainly in layer IV, and the reciprocal pathways originate from cells in both superficial and deep layers. On the basis of this pattern, each connection can be designated as forward or feedback in nature, and a hierarchical arrangement of visual areas can be determined. In this hierarchy, MT is at a higher level than V1, V2, and V3, and at a lower level than MST and VIP. Subcortical projections were seen from MT to the claustrum, the putamen, the caudate nucleus, the inferior and lateral subdivisions of the pulvinar complex, the ventral lateral geniculate nucleus, the reticular nucleus of the thalamus, the superior colliculus, and the pontine nuclei."

There were major differences in the distribution of cells pro\u2010 jecting to the caudal and rostral parts of area 8. The majority (53%) of labeled cortical cells projecting to caudal regions were in visual association areas, and an additional 23% were in the ventral bank of the intraparietal sulcus, where neurons may have predominantly visual and visuomotor properties. In contrast, rostral area 8 had a much lower percentage of its cortical input originating in visual association areas (5%) or in the ventral bank ofthe intraparietal sulcus (8%). After HRP injection in this rostral part, 21% of labeled cells were in auditory association areas and 13% in paralimbic regions, whereas labeling in these two types of cortex was negligible after HRP administration to caudal parts of area 8. The percentage of cells in other association regions (portions of the banks of the superior temporal sulcus, dorsolateral parietal, medial parietal, and prefrontal cortices) was higher in the rostral (53%) than in the caudal case (21%). The results suggest that caudal area 8 may be involved in head and eye movements in response to visual stimuli, while its anterior subdivisions may be involved in directing the head and eyes in response to auditory stimuli. Furthermore, limbic input may also be relevant to the neural processing occurring in rostral frontal eye fields, perhaps by directing attention toward motivationally relevant stimuli."

The arrangement of the columns is highly ordered; in the great majority of oblique or tangential microelectrode penetrations the preferred orientations of cells changed systematically with electrode position, in a clockwise or counterclockwise direction. Graphs of orientation vs. electrode track distance were virtually straight lines over distances of up to several millimeters; such orderly sequences were often terminated by sudden changes in the direction of orientation shifts, from clockwise to counterclockwise or back. The orientations at which these reversals occurred were quite unpredictable. Total rotations of 180\u2013360\u00b0 were frequently seen between reversals. In tangential or almost tangential penetrations orientation shifts occurred almost every time the electrode was moved forward, indicating that the columns were either not discrete or had a thickness of less than 25\u201350 \u03bc, the smallest order of distance that our methods could resolve. In penetrations that were almost perpendicular to the surface, the graphs of orientation vs. track distance were relatively flatter, as expected if the surfaces of constant orientation are perpendicular to the cortical surface. Stepwise changes in orientation of about 10\u00b0 could sometimes be seen in perpendicular penetrations, each orientation persisting through several clear advances of the electrode, suggesting a set of discrete columnar subdivisions. The possibility of some kind of continuous variation in orientation with horizontal distance along the cortex was not, however, completely ruled out. Occasionally a highly ordered sequence was broken by an abrupt large shift in orientation of up to 90\u00b0. Shifts in ocular dominance occurred roughly every 0.25\u20130.5 mm and were independent of orientation shifts. In multiple parallel penetrations spaced closer than about 250 \u03bc the slopes of the orientation vs. track distance curves were almost the same; reconstruction of these penetrations indicated that the regions of constant orientation are parallel sheets. On crossing perpendicular to these sheets, a total orientation shift of 180\u00b0 took place over a distance of 0.5\u20131.0 mm. Column thickness, size of shifts in orientation, and the rate of change of orientation with distance along the cortex seemed to be independent of eccentricity, at least between 2\u00b0 and 15\u00b0 from the fovea. A few penetrations made in area 17 of the cat and in area 18 of the monkey showed similar orderly sequences of receptive\u2010field orientation shifts."

A description of this movement is not provided to our visual system directly, however; it must be inferred from the pattern of changing intensity that reaches the eye. This paper examines the problem of motion measurement, which we formulate as the computation of an instantaneous two-dimensional velocity field from the changing image. Initial measurements of motion take place at the location of significant intensity changes. These measurements provide only one component of local velocity, and must be integrated to compute the two-dimensional velocity field. A fundamental problem for this integration stage is that the velocity field is not determined uniquely from information available in the changing image. We formulate an additional constraint of smoothness of the velocity field, based on the physical assumption that surfaces are generally smooth, which allows the computation of a unique velocity field. A theoretical analysis of the conditions under which this computation yields the correct velocity field suggests that the solution is physically plausible. Empirical studies show the predictions of this computation to be consistent with human motion perception."

The postsynaptic rule proposes that coactivated heterosynaptic inputs to a neuron alter the states of ion channels at a given synapse, thereby changing the susceptibility of these channels to local biochemical alterations. The resultant change in the population distribution of local channel states affects the postsynaptic potential produced at the synapse by subsequent inputs. This postsynaptic rule applies, in general, to short-term changes at specific individual synapses. In contrast, the presynaptic rule applies in general to long-term changes in the whole neuron, resulting in an altered probability of transmitter release. Because of neuroanatomical constraints, the presynaptic rule affects large numbers of synapses defined by the connectivity of that neuron and distributed nonspecifically over the population. We show that the combined action of the two independent rules upon populations of neurons arrayed in interconnected neuronal groups leads to consistent alterations of the probability of firing of certain circuits while maintaining variability in the response of the population to novel input. This \"dual rules\" model fulfills the requirements of the theory of neuronal group selection."

Horizontal visual tracking neurons were classified into three groups, A, B, and C, on the basis of the following two discharge characteristics: directional preference for visual tracking and response to horizontal sinusoidal oscillation of the chair in the dark. Those neurons that did not respond to chair oscillations in the dark were classified as type A (26/53). Of the remainder, those that responded with the same directional preference as during visual tracking were classified as type B (19/53), and those that showed the opposite directional preference were classified as type C (8/53). When the target and the chair were oscillated together and the monkey canceled the vestibuloocular reflex (VOR) (combined eye and head tracking), most of the visual tracking neurons (types A and B, 32/38) continued to respond in the same way as during visual tracking when the chair was stationary. Type C neurons showed only weak responses. When the monkey fixated an earth-fixed target while the chair was oscillated sinusoidally (VOR target task), responses of the types A and B neurons were much smaller than during visual tracking, while type C neurons were clearly modulated. The results suggest that visual tracking neurons receive information concerning the smooth-pursuit command during combined eye and head (gaze) movements; some also receive vestibular information in addition to the pursuit command information."

The responses of parietal LS neurons to visual stimuli are facilitated during the state of attentive fixation of a target light as compared to their responses to physically and retinotopically identical test stimuli delivered during the eye pauses of alert wakefulness. Seventy percent of the neurons tested (n = 55) showed significant increments in responses in the state of attentive fixation; the median value of the increments was 3.5 times. Only 4 of the 55 cells examined completely showed the reverse relation. Three sets of control experiments were done. The facilitation occurred when the responses evoked during the trials of a reaction task with attentive fixation of a target were compared with those evoked by identical stimuli delivered to the same retinotopic locations at the end of each intertrial interval: the facilitation of attentive fixation is not due to a shift in the general level of arousal. The facilitation occurred when the animal maintained attentive fixation of a spot of the tangent screen without a target light or when an additional light mimicking the target light was presented along with testing stimuli in the state of alert wakefulness without attentive fixation: the facilitation is not produced by a sensory-sensory interaction between target and testing lights. Finally, the facilitation was observed whether or not the test stimuli were behaviorally relevant. We conclude that the act of attentive fixation exerts a specific and powerful effect upon the excitability of the neural systems linking the retinae and the inferior parietal lobule and that the facilitation plays an important role in visually guided behavior."

Moreover, there is often little time available to pick up the visual information to organize the action. Consider, for instance, a batsman hitting a fast bowler or a bird alighting on a twig swaying in the wind. The visual and motor systems evidently work in close harmony, vision rapidly and directly providing the information for controlling the action. Here, we present evidence in support of a theory to explain how actions are visually tuned. The evidence derives from a film analysis of the spectacular plunge dive of one of Britain's largest seabirds, the gannet (Sula bassana)."

An important aspect of vision is the choice of representations for the different kinds of information in a visual scene. In the early stages of the analysis of an image, the representations used depend more on what it is possible to compute from an image than on what is ultimately desirable, but later representations can be more sensitive to the specific needs of recognition. This essay surveys recent work in vision at M.I.T. from a perspective in which the representational problems assume a primary importance. An overall framework is suggested for visual information processing, in which the analysis proceeds through three representations; (1) the primal sketch, which makes explicit the intensity changes and local two-dimensional geometry of an image, (2) the 2 1/2-D sketch, which is a viewer-centered representation of the depth, orientation and discontinuities of the visible surfaces, and (3) the 3-D model representation, which allows an object-centered description of the three-dimensional structure and organization of a viewed shape. Recent results concerning processes for constructing and maintaining these representations are summarized and discussed. (Author)"

In the primary somatic sensory cortex (SI) VPL cells terminated in different cytoarchitectonic areas according to their receptive field modality. Fibers excited by deep tissues or joint rotation arborized preferentially in area 3a. Those responding tonically to cutaneous stimuli were located in the anterior part of area 3b; hairdriven cells terminated in area 3b and in the rostral pole of area 1. All fibers had a similar laminar distribution within SI. Axons terminated mostly in layers VI, IV, and the lower part of layer III. None terminated in layers I and II. Most terminal arbors were oriented along the mediolateral axis of the brain. The main arborization of a single VPL cell formed a bush of about 500 \u03bcm in diameter. Some fibers generated two such bushes with an uninvaded region of about 300 \u03bcm between them. It is proposed that this patchy organization underlies in part the columnar organization of area SI. Many VPL cells had secondary projection sites in SI. These were issued from smaller\u2010sized collaterals and were located in a different cytoarchitectonic area than that of the main terminal plexuses. A significant number of these collaterals projected to area 4. Insufficient filling of the collaterals by HRP prevented a more complete characterization of the secondary arbors."

The operator ensures that the probability of discovering a particular combination of hypothcscs is a simplc function of how good that combination is. Wc show that thcrc is a simple relationship bctween this operator and Bayesian inference, and we describe a learning rule which allows a parallel system to converge on a set ofweights that optimizes its perccptt~al inferences."

                "text": "The title of Cottrell's book mentions only two concepts: connectionism and lexical disambiguation. That's misleading, because the book has much more to offer than just that. Among the topics addressed are parsing, agrammatism, connectionist inheritance hierarchies, and structural ambiguity, and it is the integration of this wide-ranging set of topics that is one of the strengths of the work. The book appears four years after the 1985 University of Rochester dissertation upon which it is based. Thus the flavor of connectionism that Cottrell uses is the coarsegrained localist representations used at Rochester in the early 1980s, in which each node in the network represents a concept. This is in contrast to the distributed representations (\"PDP\") that became popular in the latter part of the decade, in which many nodes may contribute to the representation of a concept (Rumelhart and McClelland 1986). Cottrell has taken advantage of the delay in publication to restructure the work substantially and to add discussions of the later research. He seems to suggest (p. 7) that distributed representations are generally preferable because they can learn, whereas localist networks like his own need to be individually hand designed. Nevertheless, this research shows that there is considerable appeal in hand-designed, localist networks. Cottrell takes work in psycholinguistics as the starting point for his model of lexical access and disambiguation. In the early 1980s, it was discovered that in many circumstances, people subconsciously consider all meanings of an ambiguous word, even if the preceding context makes one alternative preferable a priori. For example, the floral sense of the word rose is activated even when one hears The congregation rose. Within a few hundred milliseconds all senses but the one chosen as correct become deactivated again. (While subsequent research has qualified these resuits somewhat--see Gorfein 1989--the basic principle has proven to be robust.) The usual explanation for these results is in terms of priming and spreading activation in a semantic network, so a localist model is very natural. The input to Cottrelrs networks is a string of words forming a syntactically simple sentence, such as Bob threw a ball to the dog. This is done by activating the nodes corresponding to the words. The activation of a node causes the activation of those other nodes in the network to which it is connected by excitory links and the deactivation of those to which it is connected by inhibitory links. A node can receive activation and inhibition at the same time; for example, an ambiguous word will send activation to all its senses, but the senses will be mutally inhibitory. Thus the network may be unstable for some time until it settles down into a pattern of activation that represents its \"output\"; the nodes representing the relevant concepts are activated and other nodes aren't. In the case of an ambiguous word, the correct meaning in context will presumably receive activation from more sources, or be pre-activated by the preceding context, and thus be able eventually to force its competitors into inhibition. This final pattern of activation may be construed as the interpretation of the sentence. After the word-sense selection network, there are two more networks, running in parallel with one another: one for determining case roles and one for syntactic analysis. The case role network uses an \"exploded\" notion of cases; that is, rather than having one node representing, say, the agent role, Cottrell has one node for the agent of a propel action, one for the agent of a vomit action, and so on. (The topic area of Cottrell's example sentences ranges from baseball to emesis.) This seems counter-intuitive, or unparsimonious at the very least; but I must admit that, modern linguistic theory notwithstanding, I know of no particular psycholinguistic evidence for the reality of a single concept of, say, agency that is activated for any and every sentence that involves an agent. A feature of the parsing network is that it need not be constructed by hand; rather, it is automatically generated from a grammar and lexicon by a Lisp program. It parses only the very simple one-clause sentences needed to test the other parts of the system. Unlike the other parts of the system, the parser has no special claim to psychological reality. However, the minimal-attachment strategy of structural ambiguity resolution (namely, to attach a new constituent in the way that creates the fewest new nodes) \"falls out\" as a natural consequence of the design. Cottrell includes an interesting discussion of his system's predictions for aphasia. If the system has some psychological reality, then one would expect that \"damage\" to the network would result in behavior similar to that of aphasic patients. For example, if the connection between the case"

These spines are known to be sites of synaptic connections, but the physiological properties of the spines and the functional significance of their responses are still largely unknown. The main function attributed thus far to these synaptic responses, situated at a great distance from the neuronal cell body, is slow background modulation of impulse output in the axon. In pursuing computer simulation analysis of electrical properties of dendrites, we have obtained results suggesting interactions between distal dendritic spines. If the heads of dendritic spines have excitable membrane properties, the spread of current from one or several spines could bring adjacent spines to their thresholds for impulse generation. This could give rise to a sequence of spine head action potentials, representing a saltatory propagation, from one or more excitable spine heads to nearby excitable spine heads, in the distal dendritic branches. Both the amplification due to several spine action potentials and the possibility of propagation into more proximal branches would increase the efficacy of distal synaptic inputs. Because of nonlinear dependence upon several modifiable parameters (such as spine stem resistance and membrane excitability) and upon the spatio-temporal pattern of synaptic input, such contingent synaptic enhancement would be particularly relevant to cortical functions underlying information processing and to plasticity underlying learning and memory."

We recorded from single neurons in the dorsal bank and fundus of the anterior portion of the superior temporal sulcus, an area we term the superior temporal polysensory area (STP). Five macaques were studied under anesthesia ( N20) and immobilization in repeated recording sessions. 2. Almost all of the neurons were visually responsive, and over half responded to more than one sensory modality; 21% responded to visual and auditory stimuli, 17% responded to visual and somesthetic stimuli, 17% were trimodal, and 41% were exclusively visual. 3. Almost all the visual receptive fields extended into both visual half-fields, and the majority approached the size of the visual field of the monkey, including both monocular crescents. Somesthetic receptive fields were also bilateral and usually included most of the body surface. 4. Virtually all neurons responded better to moving visual stimuli than to stationary visual stimuli, and almost half were sensitive to the direction of movement. Several classes of directional neurons were found, including a) neurons selective for a single direction of movement throughout their receptive field, b) neurons selective for directions of movement radially symmetric about the center of gaze, and c) neurons selective for movement in depth. 5. The majority of neurons (70%) had little or no preference for stimulus size, shape, orientation, or contrast. The minority (30%) responded best to particular stimuli. Some of these appeared to be selective for faces. 6. The properties of most STP neurons, such as large receptive fields, sensitivity to movement, insensitivity to form, and polymodal responsiveness, suggest that STP is more involved in orientation and spatial functions than in pattern recognition."

Our results indicate that dorsal V1 (representing the inferior contralateral visual quadrant) consistently projects in topographically organized fashion to V3 in the lunate and parietooccipital sulci as well as to the middle temporal area (MT) and dorsal V2. In contrast, ventral V1 (representing the superior contralateral quadrant) projects only to MT and ventral V2. A corresponding dorsoventral asymmetry in myeloarchitecture supports the idea that V3 is an area that is restricted to dorsal extrastriate cortex and lacks a complete representation of the visual field. The average surface area of myeloarchitectonically identified V3 was 89 mm2. Additional information was obtained concerning the laminar distribution of connections from V1 to V2 and V3, the patchiness of these projections, and the consistency of projections to other extrastriate areas, including V4 and V3A."

Although the topography of the visual field representations in this region of cortex is more complex than that found in areas 17, 18, and 19, this region appears to contain four representations of the visual hemifield. The four cortical areas these visual field representations occupy have been labeled 20a, 20b, 21a, and 21b. These representations are not as precise as those found in areas 17, 18, and 19; the receptive fields in areas 20a, 20b, 21a, and 21b are larger and there is more scatter in receptive field location among adjacent cells. The upper visual hemifield is emphasized in all four of these areas, but the extent of the representation ranges from just the central 20\u00b0 found in area 21a to nearly the entire upper visual quadrant found in area 20b. The peak areal magnification factors found in these areas are all at least one order of magnitude less than those found in area 17. The visual field transformations from retina onto cortex in areas 20a, 20b, 21a, and 21b are similar to the types we found in other cortical visual areas, and the significance of these transformations for visual processing is discussed."

To illustrate some of the characteristics of the scheme, o CID version of the interactive CICtivation model of word recognition is described.

One proposed explanation for the fineness of orientation discrimination is that, while detection is determined by the most excited orientation-tuned neural elements, superthreshold orientation discrimination is determined by difference signals between these elements [Westheimer et al., J. Opt. Soc. Am. 66, 332 (1976)]. This implies that, if stimulus orientation is changed slightly, the most important elements for discriminating this change will be those whose relative activity changes most, even though the excitation of these elements may be comparatively weak. In accord with this prediction, we found that adapting to a high-contrast grating degraded discrimination for test gratings inclined at about 10-20 deg to the adapting grating while having little effect on the detection of these inclined gratings. For test gratings parallel to the adapting grating, discrimination was improved, but detection was degraded. Either an opponent-process or a line-element model can account for these effects of adaptation. An opponent model can also explain our findings that subjects do not confound orientation change with contrast change and that suprathreshold orientation discrimination is almost independent of contrast, varying by only +/- 10% from about 3 to about 25 times contrast threshold. A discrimination model must incorporate reliable storage of spatial frequency, because discrimination was not affected by increasing the interval between grating presentations from 1 to 10 sec.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

                "text": "Saccades are rapid shifts in the direction of gaze. They include the fast (reset) phases of nystagmus generated by vestibular or optokinetic stimuli, the catch\u00ad up movements required in the pursuit of a small moving target, and the scan\u00ad ning movements used to explore a stationary visual scene . All these rapid eye movements have a similar trajectory composed of a rapid acceleration to peak velocity followed by a deceleration that brings the eye to its final position. Primate saccades usually last between 15 and 100 msec and can reach peak velocities in excess of 500 deglsec. Because they have such similar time courses, all rapid eye movements are thought to share a common neural saccade generator. If a saccade is made to a visual target, several steps are presumed to precede the activation of the saccade generator. After the target and its visual sur\u00ad roundings fall on the retina and are detected by the visual system, the target is selected from its surroundings , its location is calculated, and a decision is made as to whether the target is worthy of a saccade. The saccade is triggered and appropriate commands are passed first to brains tern centers , then to ocular motoneurons, and finally to the extraocular muscles. Although we know rel\u00ad atively little about the early stages of the process that leads to a saccade, experiments in the last 15 years have provided an understanding of the brain\u00ad stem circuitry involved in saccade production. The relative simplicity of the oculomotor periphery and the easy access to premotor elements in the brain\u00ad stem have provided a unique opportunity to probe into the more central struc\u00ad tures that generate movement . In this review we summarize what is known about the brainstem saccade generator by starting at the motor periphery and moving centrally. We empha\u00ad size new data, particularly from primates, and structure our discussion in terms"

The special advantages of the case are that the patient is a young, relatively healthy person of normal IQ. The angioma had not interfered with interhemispheric transmission and the patient was described as neurologically normal before operation. After operation left-side neglect and extensive somatic disconnection were seen. A change in the balance between the hemispheres for handedness and ear superiority in dichotic listening was observed. The patient developed an aphasia after operation characterized by a simplification of language, the inavailability of complex ideas and emotional communication. He showed a disorder of memory--'autopragmatic amnesia'--in whice. The patient showed disorders of visuo-spatial transfer. These symptoms are thought to typify a syndrome of the centre trunk region of the corpus callosum, to follow as a direct function of the operation performed upon the callosum, and to illustrate the function of this region of the brain."

In the previous part we developed the basic form of the model and showed how it accounts for several of the fundamental phenomena of work perception. In this part, we first present a number of new experiments and show how the model accounts for these experiments. Then we propose a number of extensions of the model to such cases as spoken input, pronunciation tasks, and words embedded in sentential context. Finally, we discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the model, pointing out further possible extensions of the model to account for aspects of word perception currently ignored. The new experiments all revolve around what we call the 'context enhancement effect.' These experiments are designed to assess the roles of direct and indirect evidence concerning the identity of a letter in an input string."

                "text": "We studied the activity of single neurons in the frontal eye fields of awake macaque monkeys trained to perform several oculomotor tasks. Fifty-four percent of neurons discharged before visually guided saccades. Three different types of presaccadic activity were observed: visual, movement, and anticipatory. Visual activity occurred in response to visual stimuli whether or not the monkey made saccades. Movement activity preceded purposive saccades, even those made without visual targets. Anticipatory activity preceded even the cue to make a saccade if the monkey could reliably predict what saccade he had to make. These three different activities were found in different presaccadic cells in different proportions. Forty percent of presaccadic cells had visual activity (visual cells) but no movement activity. For about half of the visual cells the response was enhanced if the monkey made saccades to the receptive-field stimulus, but there was no discharge before similar saccades made without visual targets. Twenty percent of presaccadic neurons discharged as briskly before purposive saccades made without a visual target as they did before visually guided saccades, and had weak or absent visual responses. These cells were defined as movement cells. Movement cells discharged much less or not at all before saccades made spontaneously without a task requirement or an overt visual target. The remaining presaccadic neurons (40%) had both visual and movement activity (visuomovement cells). They discharged most briskly before visually guided eye movements, but also discharged before purposive eye movements made in darkness and responded to visual stimuli in the absence of saccades. There was a continuum of visuomovement cells, from cells in which visual activity predominated to cells in which movement activity predominated. This continuum suggests that although visual cells are quite distinct from movement cells, the division of cell types into three classes may be only a heuristic means of describing the processing flow from visual input to eye-movement output. Twenty percent of visuomovement and movement cells, but fewer than 2% of visual cells, had anticipatory activity. Only one cell had anticipatory activity as its sole response. When the saccade was delayed relative to the target onset, visual cells responded to the target appearance, movement cells discharged before the saccade, and visuomovement cells discharged in different ways during the delay, usually with some discharge following the target and an increase in rate immediately before the saccade. Presaccadic neurons of all types were actively suppressed following a saccade into their response fields.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

                "text": "This paper presents an evidential approach to knowledge representation and inference wherein the principle of maximum entropy is applied to deal with uncertainty and incompleteness. It focuses on a restricted representation language - similar in expressive power to semantic network formalisms, and develops a formal theory of evidential inheritance within this language. The theory applies to a limited, but we think interesting, class of inheritance problems including those that involve exceptions and multiple inheritance hierarchies. The language and the accompanying evidential inference structure provide a natural treatment of defaults and conflicting information. The evidence combination rule proposed in this paper is incremental, commutative and associative and hence, shares most of the attractive features of the Dempster-Shafer evidence combination rule. Furthermore, it is demonstrably better than the Dempster-Shafer rule in the context of the problems addressed in this paper. The resulting theory can be implemented as a highly parallel (connectionist) network made up of active elements that can solve inheritance problems in time proportional to the depth of the conceptual hierarchy."

                "text": "The electroresponsive properties of guinea\u2010pig thalamic neurones were studied using an in vitro slice preparation. A total of 650 cells were recorded intracellularly comprising all regions of the thalamus; of these 229 fulfilled our criterion for recording stability and were used as the data base for this report. The resting membrane potential for thirty\u2010four representative neurones which were analysed in detail was \u201064 +/\u2010 5 mV (mean +/\u2010 S.D.), input resistance 42 +/\u2010 18 M omega, and action potential amplitude 80 +/\u2010 7 mV. Intracellular staining with horseradish peroxidase and Lucifer Yellow revealed that the recorded cells had different morphology. In some their axonal trajectory characterized them as thalamo\u2010cortical relay cells. Two main types of neuronal firing were observed. From a membrane potential negative to \u201060 mV, anti\u2010 or orthodromic and direct activation generated a single burst of spikes, consisting of a low\u2010threshold spike (l.t.s.) of low amplitude and a set of fast superimposed spikes. Tonic repetitive firing was observed if the neurones were activated from a more positive membrane potential; this was a constant finding in all but two of the cells which fulfilled the stability criteria. The l.t.s. response was totally inactivated at membrane potentials positive to \u201055 mV. As the membrane was hyperpolarized from this level the amplitude of the l.t.s. increased and became fully developed at potentials negative to \u201070 mV. This increase is due to a de\u2010inactivation of the ionic conductance generating this response. After activation the l.t.s. showed refractoriness for approximately 170 ms. Deinactivation of l.t.s. is a voltage\u2010 and time\u2010dependent process; full de\u2010inactivation after a step hyperpolarization to maximal l.t.s. amplitude (\u201075 to \u201080 mV) requires 150\u2010180 ms. Membrane depolarization positive to \u201055 mV generated sudden sustained depolarizing 'plateau potentials', capable of supporting repetitive firing (each action potential being followed by a marked after\u2010hyperpolarization, a.h.p.). The a.h.p. and the plateau potential controlled the voltage trajectory during the interspike interval and, with the fast spike, constitute a functional state where the thalamic neurone displayed oscillatory properties. Frequency\u2010current (f\u2010I) plots from different initial levels of membrane potential were obtained by the application of square current pulses of long duration (2s). From resting membrane potential and from hyperpolarized levels a rather stereotyped onset firing rate was observed due to the presence of the l.t.s.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

Pixel gray levels and the presence and orientation of edges are viewed as states of atoms or molecules in a lattice-like physical system. The assignment of an energy function in the physical system determines its Gibbs distribution. Because of the Gibbs distribution, Markov random field (MRF) equivalence, this assignment also determines an MRF image model. The energy function is a more convenient and natural mechanism for embodying picture attributes than are the local characteristics of the MRF. For a range of degradation mechanisms, including blurring, nonlinear deformations, and multiplicative or additive noise, the posterior distribution is an MRF with a structure akin to the image model. By the analogy, the posterior distribution defines another (imaginary) physical system. Gradual temperature reduction in the physical system isolates low energy states (``annealing''), or what is the same thing, the most probable states under the Gibbs distribution. The analogous operation under the posterior distribution yields the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the image given the degraded observations. The result is a highly parallel ``relaxation'' algorithm for MAP estimation. We establish convergence properties of the algorithm and we experiment with some simple pictures, for which good restorations are obtained at low signal-to-noise ratios."

A set of chemical markers that express the neighborhood relationships within the presynaptic sheet is induced by the fibers into the postsynaptic sheet. The markers are used to guide the fibers to their terminal sites. A case for which this idea may be relevant is the retinotectal projection; our model exhibits types of plasticity found experimentally. The fact that the postsynaptic markers remain after removal of the projecting fibers suggests an important difference between development and regeneration. This paper concentrates on explaining the basic idea, and in addition presents a set of preliminary computer simulations."

The constraints on the parameters of rigid motion (i.e., three-dimensional velocities) obtained from image motion data (two-dimensional projected velocities) are analyzed. A brief survey of related work shows the lacunae in the existing body of research in this area. Uniqueness results and computational algorithms are presented to compute the rigid motion parameters from retinal velocities. The approximations involved in the velocity representation are stated. Algorithms and constraints to permit cooperative computation of motion and shape are described."

These synaptically deprived fibers can obtain termination space in a retinotopic and highly stereotyped manner. Each of the two eyes can share the undisturbed tectum by terminating in mutually exclusive, eye-specific stripes that alternate across the medial-lateral extent of the tectal lobe. Invading axons from the ipsilateral eye must actively displace established synapses from the contralateral eye in order to form these exclusive termination zones because the normal projection to the intact tectum is not severed in these experiments. In animals in which a large proportion of anomalous fibers do not reach the undisturbed tectum, only a few ipsilateral eye bands are observed. Nevertheless, these bands have the same width, periodicity, and orientation as those observed in fully banded preparations. When ipsilateral eye terminal density is extremely low, banding is absent. The completely striped termination pattern of unitectal animals is identical to the pattern previously reported in the dually innervated tecta of three-eyed R. pipiens. We theorize that this pattern results from a compromise between two synaptogenic forces that are active in regeneration as well as in development."

The behavioral paradigm permitted independent quantitative assessment of a fiber's response to eye or head movements. 2. According to their discharge pattern, almost all MLF fibers were placed in one of two classes: 1) Horizontal burst-tonic fibers (n = 20). During both vestibular and visually evoked eye movements, burst-tonic fibers discharged in strict relation to horizontal eye movements, exhibiting a burst of activity prior to on-direction saccades and steady firing related to horizontal eye position during fixations. 2) Vertical vestibular plus eye-position fibers (n = 14). Vertical fibers discharged in relation to vertical head velocity in the absence of eye movements and in relation to vertical eye position in the absence of head movement, and paused with saccades in any direction. 3. The quantitative similarity of horizontal burst-tonic fiber discharge to that of ipsilateral medial rectus oculomotoneurons suggests that burst-tonic fibers provide the major excitatory synaptic drive to medial rectus motoneurons during conjugate eye movements of vestibular or visual origin. 4. The discharge pattern of vertical vestibular plus eye-position fibers is significantly different from that of oculomotoneurons, suggesting that additional neural processing of vertical fiber information must occur in the mesencephalon. 5. The functional dichotomy of horizontal and vertical MLF fibers and their contrasting discharge patterns provide new evidence for the anatomic and functional separation of horizontal and vertical eye movement mechanisms in the pons and mesencephalon, respectively."

Frequently, processes are needed which reduce ambiguity and noise, and select the best label among several possible choices. Relaxation labeling processes are just such a class of algorithms. They are based on the parallel use of local constraints between labels. This paper develops a theory to characterize the goal of relaxation labeling. The theory is founded on a definition of con-sistency in labelings, extending the notion of constraint satisfaction. In certain restricted circumstances, an explicit functional exists that can be maximized to guide the search for consistent labelings. This functional is used to derive a new relaxation labeling operator. When the restrictions are not satisfied, the theory relies on variational cal-culus. It is shown that the problem of finding consistent labelings is equivalent to solving a variational inequality. A procedure nearly identical to the relaxation operator derived under restricted circum-stances serves in the more general setting. Further, a local convergence result is established for this operator. The standard relaxation labeling formulas are shown to approximate our new operator, which leads us to conjecture that successful applications of the standard methods are explainable by the theory developed here. Observations about con-vergence and generalizations to higher order compatibility relations are described."

The general 3-D object recognition task can be thought of as building a description of the object that must have at least two parts: 1) the internal description of the object itself (with respect to an object-centered frame); and 2) the transformation of the object-centered frame to the viewer-centered (image) frame. The reason for this decomposition is parsimony: different views of the object should have minimal impact on its description. This is achieved by factoring the object's description into two sets of parameters, one which is view-independent (the object-centered component) and one which is view-varying (the viewing transformation). Often a description of the object is known beforehand and the task reduces to finding the objectframe to viewer-frame transformation. This paper describes a method for handling this case: a known object is detected by finding changes in orientation, translation, and scale of the object from its canonical description. The method is a Hough technique and has the characteristic insensitivity to occlusion and noise."

A task frame is a coordinate frame that can be attached to different objects that are to be manipulated. The task frame is related to the world-based coordinate frame by a simple geometric transformation. The virtues of such a frame are: (1) certain actions that are difficult to specify in the world frame are easily expressed in the task frame; (2) the task-frame to task-world transformation provides a formalism for describing physical actions; and (3) the task frame can be related to the world frame by proprioception."

Monkeys were trained to pick apple pieces out of a multiple-slotted apple board while their heads were fixed. Eye movement records were obtained using predominantly the implanted search-coil method. 2. Both unilateral and bilateral frontal eye-field lesions produced only temporary deficits in eye movements. Following surgery monkeys tended to neglect the contralateral peripheral visual field and made fewer saccades to peripheral targets. Recovery was virtually completed in 2-4 wk. 3. Superior colliculus ablation reduced fixation accuracy, saccade frequency, and saccade velocity. These deficits showed little recovery with time. 4. Paired frontal eye-field and superior colliculus lesions produced dramatic deficits in visually triggered eye movements. Animals could no longer fixate their eyes on visual targets with any degree of accuracy. The range of eye movements was greatly reduced, as was the frequency and velocity of saccades. These deficits showed little recovery with time. 5. These results suggest that visually triggered saccadic eye movements are controlled by two parallel channels, one involving the superior colliculus and the other the frontal eye field."

A second constraint is needed. A method for finding the optical flow pattern is presented which assumes that the apparent velocity of the brightness pattern varies smoothly almost everywhere in the image. An iterative implementation is shown which successfully computes the optical flow for a number of synthetic image sequences. The algorithm is robust in that it can handle image sequences that are quantized rather coarsely in space and time. It is also insensitive to quantization of brightness levels and additive noise. Examples are included where the assumption of smoothness is violated at singular points or along lines in the image."

During development both normal and supernumerary optic tracts terminated within a single, previously uninnervated tectal lobe. Autoradiographic tracing of either the normal or supernumerary eye's projection revealed distinct, eye-specific bands of radioactivity running rostrocaudally through the dually innervated tectum. Interactions among axons of retinal ganglion cells, possibly mediated through tectal neurons, must be invoked to explain this stereotyped disruption of the normally continuous retinal termination pattern."

The problem of deriving the carrier density and / from Hall effect data is also discussed. Theoretical calculations of the free carrier mobility in deformed semiconductors are compared with experiments. F. R. N. Nabarro and A. T. Quintanilha. \"Dislocations in Superconductors,\" pp. 192-242. In 1968, Kojima and Suzuki, conducting tensile tests at a constant rate of strain on the Type I superconductor lead and on the Type II superconductor niobium at 4.2 K, found that the flow stress increased when superconductivity was destroyed by a magnetic field. The electron drag on the moving dislocations was absent in the superconducting state and restored by the magnetic field. The first part of this chapter discusses the change in the mobility of ordinary dislocations of the crystal lattice of a metal when the metal becomes superconducting. The second part of this chapter is not very closely Telated to the first part. It is concerned with the magnetization of a superconductor of Type II, which occurs by the motion of a lattice of flux lines through the crystal. During this process, the authors postulate, the dislocations of the crystal lattice remain fixed, and act as moderatley effective obstacles to the motion of the flux-line lattice. The nature and effect of dislocations in the lattice of flux lines in a Type II superconductor are analyzed in the last section. M. Kleman. \"The General Theory of Disclinations,\" pp. 243-297. The concept of disclinations (rotational dislocations) has recently found wide application in liquid crystals. Disclinations are the topoligical concepts which help in a description of broken sym-"
