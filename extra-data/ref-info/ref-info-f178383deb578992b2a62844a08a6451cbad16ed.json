We show that this problem reduces to estimating one or more expectations of suitable functionals of the Gibbs states with respect to properly chosen Gibbs distributions. As expected, the resulting estimators are consistent. Certain generalizations are also provided. We study computational complexity with respect to grid size and show that Monte Carlo partition function estimation algorithms can be classified into two categories: E-type algorithms that are of exponential complexity and P-type algorithms that are of polynomial complexity, Turing reducible to the problem of sampling from the Gibbs distribution. E-type algorithms require estimating a single expectation, whereas, P-type algorithms require estimating a number of expectations with respect to Gibbs distributions which are chosen to be sufficiently \"close\" to each other. In the latter case, the required number of expectations is of polynomial order with respect to grid size. We compare computational complexity by using both theoretical results and simulation experiments. We determine the most efficient E-type and P-type algorithms and conclude that P-type algorithms are more appropriate for partition function estimation. We finally suggest a practical and efficient P-type algorithm for this task."

Here we develop a class of local message-passing algorithms, which we call tree-reweighted belief propagation, for efficiently computing the value of these upper bounds, as well as the associated pseudomarginals. We also consider the uses of our bounds for the problem of maximum likelihood (ML) parameter estimation. For a completely observed model, our analysis gives rise to a concave lower bound on the log likelihood of the data. Maximizing this lower bound yields an approximate ML estimate which, in analogy to the moment-matching of exact ML estimation, can be interpreted in terms of pseudo-moment-matching. We present preliminary results illustrating the behavior of this approximate ML estimator."

This bound is constructed by taking convex combinations of tractable distributions. The experimental results published so far concentrates on combinations of tree-structured distributions leading to a convexified Bethe free energy, which is minimized by the tree-reweighted belief propagation algorithm. One of the favorable properties of this class of approximations is that increasing the complexity of the approximation is guaranteed to increase the precision. The lack of this guarantee is notorious in standard generalized belief propagation. We increase the complexity of the approximating distributions by taking combinations of junction trees, leading to a convexified Kikuchi free energy, which is minimized by reweighted generalized belief propagation. Experimental results for Ising grids as well as for fully connected Ising models are presented illustrating advantages and disadvantages of the reweighting method in approximate inference."

                "text": "Stochastic processes de ned on graphs arise in a tremendous variety of elds, including statistical physics, signal processing, computer vision, arti cial intelligence, and information theory. The formalism of graphical models provides a useful language with which to formulate fundamental problems common to all of these elds, including estimation, model tting, and sampling. For graphs without cycles, known as trees, all of these problems are relatively well-understood, and can be solved e\u00c6ciently with algorithms whose complexity scales in a tractable manner with problem size. In contrast, these same problems present considerable challenges in general graphs with cycles. The focus of this thesis is the development and analysis of methods, both exact and approximate, for problems on graphs with cycles. Our contributions are in developing and analyzing techniques for estimation, as well as methods for computing upper and lower bounds on quantities of interest (e.g., marginal probabilities; partition functions). In order to do so, we make use of exponential representations of distributions, as well as insight from the associated information geometry and Legendre duality. Our results demonstrate the power of exponential representations for graphical models, as well as the utility of studying collections of modi ed problems de ned on trees embedded within the original graph with cycles. The speci c contributions of this thesis include the following. We develop a method for performing exact estimation of Gaussian processes on graphs with cycles by solving a sequence of modi ed problems on embedded spanning trees. We present the tree-based reparameterization framework for approximate estimation of discrete processes. This framework leads to a number of theoretical results on belief propagation and related algorithms, including characterizations of their xed points and the associated approximation error. Next we extend the notion of reparameterization to a much broader class of methods for approximate inference, including Kikuchi methods, and present results on their xed points and accuracy. Finally, we develop and analyze a novel class of upper bounds on the log partition function based on convex combinations of distributions in the exponential domain. In the special case of combining tree-structured distributions, the associated dual function gives an interesting perspective on the Bethe free energy. Thesis Supervisors: Alan S.

This paper gives an \"orthogonal\" decomposition of such a system based on information geometry. A typical example is the decomposition of stochastic dependency among a number of random variables. In general, they have a complex structure of dependencies. Pairwise dependency is easily represented by correlation, but it is more difficult to measure effects of pure triplewise or higher order interactions (dependencies) among these variables. Stochastic dependency is decomposed quantitatively into an \"orthogonal\" sum of pairwise, triplewise, and further higher order dependencies. This gives a new invariant decomposition of joint entropy. This problem is important for extracting intrinsic interactions in firing patterns of an ensemble of neurons and for estimating its functional connections. The orthogonal decomposition is given in a wide class of hierarchical structures including both exponential and mixture families. As an example, we decompose the dependency in a higher order Markov chain into a sum of those in various lower order Markov chains."

This allows us to analyze the computational hardness of the learning problem, and devise global optimization algorithms with proven performance guarantees. Markov networks are a class of graphical models that use an undirected graph to capture dependency information among random variables. Of particular interest are Markov networks over low treewidth graphs, under which many operations are tractable. We study the problem of finding a maximum likelihood distribution among Markov networks over graphs of bounded treewidth. We define the maximum hypertree problem, which is the problem of finding an acyclic hypergraph of bounded width, that maximizes the weight of hyperedges it covers (or equivalently, a triangulated graph of bounded clique size maximizing the weight of its cliques). We show that the maximum likelihood Markov network problem can be formulated as a maximum hypertree problem, and in fact the two problems are equivalent. This extends the work of Chow and Liu (1968) who considered the case where k = 1 (i.e. trees). We show that the maximum hypertree problem is NP-hard even for k = 2 and give the first constant factor approximation algorithm for it. More precisely, for any fixed treewidth objective k, we find a k-hypertree with an f(k) fraction of the maximum possible weight of any k-hypertree graph.

This class includes the belief propagation (BP) or sum-product algorithm as well as variations and extensions of BP. Algorithms in this class can be formulated as a sequence of reparameterization updates, each of which entails refactorizing a portion of the distribution corresponding to an acyclic subgraph (i.e., a tree, or more generally, a hypertree). The ultimate goal is to obtain an alternative but equivalent factorization using functions that represent (exact or approximate) marginal distributions on cliques of the graph. Our framework highlights an important property of the sum-product algorithm and the larger class of reparameterization algorithms: the original distribution on the graph with cycles is not changed. The perspective of tree-based updates gives rise to a simple and intuitive characterization of the fixed points in terms of tree consistency. We develop interpretations of these results in terms of information geometry. The invariance of the distribution, in conjunction with the fixed-point characterization, enables us to derive an exact expression for the difference between the true marginals on an arbitrary graph with cycles, and the approximations provided by belief propagation. More broadly, our analysis applies to any algorithm that minimizes the Bethe free energy. We also develop bounds on the approximation error, which illuminate the conditions that govern their accuracy. Finally, we show how the reparameterization perspective extends naturally to generalizations of BP (e.g., Kikuchi (1951) approximations and variants) via the notion of hypertree reparameterization."

The dualistic structures of the exponential families and curved exponential families are elucidated from the geometrical viewpoint. The duality connected by the Legendre transformation is thus extended to include two kinds of affine connections and two kinds of curvatures. The second-order information loss is calculated for Fisher-efficient estimators, and is decomposed into the sum of two non-negative terms. One is related to the exponential curvature of the statistical model and the other is related to the mixture curvature of the estimator. Only the latter term depends on the estimator, and vanishes for the maximum-likelihood estimator. A set of statistics which recover the second-order information loss are given. The second-order efficiency also is obtained. The differential geometry of the function space of distributions is discussed."

Fixed points of these algorithms correspond to extrema of the Bethe and Kikuchi free energy (Yedidia et al., 2001). However, belief propagation does not always converge, which motivates approaches that explicitly minimize the Kikuchi/Bethe free energy, such as CCCP (Yuille, 2002) and UPS (Teh and Welling, 2002). Here we describe a class of algorithms that solves this typically non-convex constrained minimization problem through a sequence of convex constrained minimizations of upper bounds on the Kikuchi free energy. Intuitively one would expect tighter bounds to lead to faster algorithms, which is indeed convincingly demonstrated in our simulations. Several ideas are applied to obtain tight convex bounds that yield dramatic speed-ups over CCCP."

Following a single, simple computational rule, the sum-product algorithm computes-either exactly or approximately-various marginal functions derived from the global function. A wide variety of algorithms developed in artificial intelligence, signal processing, and digital communications can be derived as specific instances of the sum-product algorithm, including the forward/backward algorithm, the Viterbi algorithm, the iterative \"turbo\" decoding algorithm, Pearl's (1988) belief propagation algorithm for Bayesian networks, the Kalman filter, and certain fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithms."

However, there has been little understanding of the algorithm or the nature of the solutions it finds for general graphs. \n \nWe show that BP can only converge to a stationary point of an approximate free energy, known as the Bethe free energy in statistical physics. This result characterizes BP fixed-points and makes connections with variational approaches to approximate inference. \n \nMore importantly, our analysis lets us build on the progress made in statistical physics since Bethe's approximation was introduced in 1935. Kikuchi and others have shown how to construct more accurate free energy approximations, of which Bethe's approximation is the simplest. Exploiting the insights from our analysis, we derive generalized belief propagation (GBP) versions of these Kikuchi approximations. These new message passing algorithms can be significantly more accurate than ordinary BP, at an adjustable increase in complexity.

It includes belief propagation (BP), which can be reformulated as a very local form of reparameterization. More generally, we consider algorithms that perform exact computations over spanning trees of the full graph. On the practical side, we find that such tree reparameterization (TRP) algorithms have convergence properties superior to BP. The reparameterization perspective also provides a number of theoretical insights into approximate inference, including a new characterization of fixed points; and an invariance intrinsic to TRP/BP. These two properties enable us to analyze and bound the error between the TRP/BP approximations and the actual marginals. While our results arise naturally from the TRP perspective, most of them apply in an algorithm-independent manner to any local minimum of the Bethe free energy. Our results also have natural extensions to more structured approximations [e.g., 1, 2]."

We present a number of examples of graphical models, including the QMR-DT database, the sigmoid belief network, the Boltzmann machine, and several variants of hidden Markov models, in which it is infeasible to run exact inference algorithms. We then introduce variational methods, which exploit laws of large numbers to transform the original graphical model into a simplified graphical model in which inference is efficient. Inference in the simpified model provides bounds on probabilities of interest in the original model. We describe a general framework for generating variational transformations based on convex duality. Finally we return to the examples and demonstrate how variational algorithms can be formulated in each case."

However, the choice of a good set of clusters to be used in GBP has remained more of an art then a science until this day. This paper proposes a sequential approach to adding new clusters of nodes and their interactions (i.e. \"regions\") to the approximation. We first review and analyze the recently introduced region graphs and find that three kinds of operations (\"split\", \"merge\" and \"death\") leave the free energy and (under some conditions) the fixed points of GBP invariant. This leads to the notion of \"weakly irreducible\" regions as the natural candidates to be added to the approximation. Computational complexity of the GBP algorithm is controlled by restricting attention to regions with small \"region-width\". Combining the above with an efficient (i.e. local in the graph) measure to predict the improved accuracy of GBP leads to the sequential \"region pursuit\" algorithm for adding new regions bottom-up to the region graph. Experiments show that this algorithm can indeed perform close to optimally."

The belief propagation (BP) algorithm is an efficient way to solve these problems that is exact when the factor graph is a tree, but only approximate when the factor graph has cycles. We show that BP fixed points correspond to the stationary points of the Bethe approximation of the free energy for a factor graph. We explain how to obtain region-based free energy approximations that improve the Bethe approximation, and corresponding generalized belief propagation (GBP) algorithms. We emphasize the conditions a free energy approximation must satisfy in order to be a \"valid\" or \"maxent-normal\" approximation. We describe the relationship between four different methods that can be used to generate valid approximations: the \"Bethe method\", the \"junction graph method\", the \"cluster variation method\", and the \"region graph method\". Finally, we explain how to tell whether a region-based approximation, and its corresponding GBP algorithm, is likely to be accurate, and describe empirical results showing that GBP can significantly outperform BP."

PBP is an iterative message-passing algorithm for solving, either exactly or approximately, the marginalized product density problem, which is a general computational problem of wide applicability. We will show that PBP can be thought of as an algorithm for minimizing a certain \u201cfree energy\u201d function, and by exploiting this interpretation, we will exhibit a one-to-one correspondence between the fixed points of PBP and the stationary points of the free energy."

We explain the principles behind the belief propagation (BP) algorithm, which is an efficient way to solve inference problems based on passing local messages. We develop a unified approach, with examples, notation, and graphical models borrowed from the relevant disciplines.We explain the close connection between the BP algorithm and the Bethe approximation of statistical physics. In particular, we show that BP can only converge to a fixed point that is also a stationary point of the Bethe approximation to the free energy. This result helps explaining the successes of the BP algorithm and enables connections to be made with variational approaches to approximate inference.The connection of BP with the Bethe approximation also suggests a way to construct new message-passing algorithms based on improvements to Bethe's approximation introduced Kikuchi and others. The new generalized belief propagation (GBP) algorithms are significantly more accurate than ordinary BP for some problems. We illustrate how to construct GBP algorithms with a detailed example."

                "text": "One of the major obstacles to using Bayesian methods for pattern recognition has been its computational expense. This thesis presents an approximation technique that can perform Bayesian inference faster and more accurately than previously possible. This method, \u201cExpectation Propagation,\u201d unifies and generalizes two previous techniques: assumed-density filtering, an extension of the Kalman filter, and loopy belief propagation, an extension of belief propagation in Bayesian networks. The unification shows how both of these algorithms can be viewed as approximating the true posterior distribution with simpler distribution, which is close in the sense of KL-divergence. Expectation Propagation exploits the best of both algorithms: the generality of assumed-density filtering and the accuracy of loopy belief propagation. \nLoopy belief propagation, because it propagates exact belief states, is useful for limited types of belief networks, such as purely discrete networks. Expectation Propagation approximates the belief states with expectations, such as means and variances, giving it much wider scope. Expectation Propagation also extends belief propagation in the opposite direction\u2014propagating richer belief states which incorporate correlations between variables. \nThis framework is demonstrated in a variety of statistical models using synthetic and real-world data. On Gaussian mixture problems, Expectation Propagation is found, for the same amount of computation, to be convincingly better than rival approximation techniques: Monte Carlo, Laplace's method, and variational Bayes. For pattern recognition, Expectation Propagation provides an algorithm for training Bayes Point Machine classifiers that is faster and more accurate than any previously known. The resulting classifiers outperform Support Vector Machines on several standard datasets, in addition to having a comparable training time. Expectation Propagation can also be used to choose an appropriate feature set for classification, via Bayesian model selection.

The eigenwert problem involved in the corresponding computation for a long strip crystal of finite width ($n$ atoms), joined straight to itself around a cylinder, is solved by direct product decomposition; in the special case $n=\\ensuremath{\\infty}$ an integral replaces a sum. The choice of different interaction energies ($\\ifmmode\\pm\\else\\textpm\\fi{}J,\\ifmmode\\pm\\else\\textpm\\fi{}{J}^{\\ensuremath{'}}$) in the (0 1) and (1 0) directions does not complicate the problem. The two-way infinite crystal has an order-disorder transition at a temperature $T={T}_{c}$ given by the condition $sinh(\\frac{2J}{k{T}_{c}}) sinh(\\frac{2{J}^{\\ensuremath{'}}}{k{T}_{c}})=1.$ The energy is a continuous function of $T$; but the specific heat becomes infinite as $\\ensuremath{-}log |T\\ensuremath{-}{T}_{c}|$. For strips of finite width, the maximum of the specific heat increases linearly with $log n$. The order-converting dual transformation invented by Kramers and Wannier effects a simple automorphism of the basis of the quaternion algebra which is natural to the problem in hand. In addition to the thermodynamic properties of the massive crystal, the free energy of a (0 1) boundary between areas of opposite order is computed; on this basis the mean ordered length of a strip crystal is ${(\\mathrm{exp} (\\frac{2J}{\\mathrm{kT}}) tanh(\\frac{2{J}^{\\ensuremath{'}}}{\\mathrm{kT}}))}^{n}.$"

These MR methods have found application and permeated the literature of a widely scattered set of disciplines, and one of our principal objectives is to present a single, coherent picture of this framework. A second goal is to describe how this topic fits into the even larger field of MR methods and concepts-in particular, making ties to topics such as wavelets and multigrid methods. A third goal is to provide several alternate viewpoints for this body of work, as the methods and concepts we describe intersect with a number of other fields. The principle focus of our presentation is the class of MR Markov processes defined on pyramidally organized trees. The attractiveness of these models stems from both the very efficient algorithms they admit and their expressive power and broad applicability. We show how a variety of methods and models relate to this framework including models for self-similar and 1/f processes. We also illustrate how these methods have been used in practice."

The other is a gradient based method, that is guaranteed to converge and is shown to give useful results on random graphs with mild frustration. We conclude that the methods are of significant practical value for large inference problems."

Building on original research by the authors over a number of years, this book gives a thorough and rigorous mathematical treatment of the underlying ideas, structures, and algorithms, emphasizing those cases in which exact answers are obtainable. The book will be of interest to researchers and graduate students in artificial intelligence who desire an understanding of the mathematical and statistical basis of probabilistic expert systems, and to students and research workers in statistics wanting an introduction to this fascinating and rapidly developing field. The careful attention to detail will also make this work an important reference source for all those involved in the theory and applications of probabilistic expert systems."
