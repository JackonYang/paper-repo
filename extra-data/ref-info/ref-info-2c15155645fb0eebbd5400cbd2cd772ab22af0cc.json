DuBois collection at the University of Massachusetts and the early Presidential libraries at the Library of Congress. The standard technique for indexing documents is to scan them in, convert them to machine readable form (ASCII) using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and then index them using a text retrieval engine. However, OCR does not work well on handwriting. Here an alternative scheme is proposed for indexing such texts. Each page of the document is segmented into words. The images of the words are then matched against each other to create equivalence classes (each equivalence classes contains multiple instances of the same word). The user then provides ASCII equivalents for say the top 2000 equivalence classes. The current paper deals with the matching aspects of this process. Due to variations in even a single person\u2019s handwriting, it is expected that the matching will be the most difficult step in the whole process. A matching technique based on Euclidean distance mapping is discussed. Experiments are shown demonstrating the feasibility of the approach."

A new technique for word image matching has the potential to select those. word images in a document that . represent potential keywords and to generate improved prototypes for those keywords. No explicit recognition is pe~formed in this process, but better OCR performance will occur on the improved prototypes' than \u2022 would occur on any of the isolated\" words. The proposed method for keyword selection and recognition is best suited for document indexing in an image-based document retrieval system.. This paper presents an algorithm for word image clustering and discusses how it is applied to locate groups of equivalent word images in a document. Improved prototypes are generated for clusters that represent potential keywords. The results of applying the algorithm to an article in the Brown Corpus are given. The keywdrds chosen by this' approach and those chosen from the ASCII text of the article by a conventional keyword selection methodology are compared. The potential for improvementin recognition performance on those keywords is also demonstrated."

The weakest link is its handling of characters which are difficult to segment. The engine is divided into four phases: segmentation, image recognition, ambiguity resolution, and document analysis. The features are zonal and reduce the image to a blurred, gray-level representation. The classifier is data-driven, trained offline, and model-free. Handcrafted features and decision trees tend to be brittle in the presence of noise. To satisfy the needs of full-text applications, the system captures the structure of the document so that, when viewed in a word processor or spreadsheet program, the formatting of the optically recognized document reflects that of the original document. To satisfy the needs of the forms market, a proofing and correction tool displays 'pop-up' images of uncertain characters. >"

The retrieval effectiveness of strategies based on these models has been evaluated experimentally, but there has been little in the way of comparison in terms of their formal properties. In this paper we introduce a recent form of the probabilistic model based on inference networks, and show how the vector space and exact-match models can be described in this framework. Differences between these models can be explained as differences in the estimation of probabilities, both in the initial search and during relevance feedback."

The algorithm maximizes the inner product of two matrices, one of which is the desired \u2018pairing matrix \u2019 and the other a \u2018proximity matrix \u2019 with elements exp (\u2013 r2ij/2\u03c32), where rij is the distance between two features, one in each image, and \u03c3 is an adjustable scale parameter. The output of the algorithm may be compared with the movements that people perceive when viewing two images in quick succession, and it is found that an increase in \u03c3 affects the computed correspondences in much the same way as an increase in interstimulus interval alters the perceived displacements. Provided that \u03c3 is not too small the algorithm will recover the feature mappings that result from image translation, expansion or shear deformation \u2013 transformations of common occurrence in image sequences \u2013 even when the displacements of individual features depart slightly from the general trend."

Up to first order, these deformations can be written in terms of an affine transform. A new framework for measuring affine transforms, which correctly handles the problem of corresponding deformed patches, is presented. In this framework, points, lines or image brightnesses may be used to derive the affine transform between image patches. No correspondence is required. The patches are filtered using Gaussians and derivatives of Gaussians, and the filters are deformed according to the affine transform. The problem of finding the affine transform is therefore reduced to that of finding the appropriate deformed filter to use. The method is local and can handle large affine deformations. Experiments demonstrate that this technique can find scale changes and optical flow in situations where other methods fail.<<ETX>>"

We present a new registration algorithm based on a spline representation of the displacement field which can be specialized to solve all of the above mentioned problems. In particular, we show how to compute local flow, global (parametric) flow, rigid flow resulting from camera egomotion, and multiframe versions of the above problems. Using a spline-based description of the flow removes the need for overlapping correlation windows, and produces an explicit measure of the correlation between adjacent flow estimates. We demonstrate our algorithm on multiframe image registration and the recovery of 3D projective scene geometry. We also provide results on a number of standard motion sequences.<<ETX>>"
