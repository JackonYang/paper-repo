Competition allows cells to automatically retune their sensitivity to avoid noise and saturation effects. All competitive systems induce decision schemes that permit them to be classified. Systems are identified that achieve global pattern formation, or decision-making, no matter how their parameters are chosen. Oscillations can occur due to contradictions in a system's decision scheme. The pattern formation and oscillation results are extreme examples of a complementarity principle that seems to hold for competitive systems. Nonlinear competitive systems can sometimes appear, to a macroscopic observer, to have linear and cooperative properties, although the two types of systems are not equivalent. This observation is relevant to theories about the evolutionary transition from competitive to cooperative behavior."

In this article we develop a similar adaptive element, but one which is more closely in accord with the facts of animal learning theory than elements commonly studied in adaptive network research. We suggest that an essential feature of classical conditioning that has been largely overlooked by adaptive network theorists is its predictive nature. The adaptive element we present learns to increase its response rate in anticipation of increased stimulation, producing a conditioned response before the occurrence of the unconditioned stimulus. The element also is in strong agreement with the behavioral data regarding the effects of stimulus context, since it is a temporally refined extension of the Rescorla-Wagner model. We show by computer simulation that the element becomes sensitive to the most reliable, nonredundant, and earliest predictors of reinforcement . We also point out that the model solves many of the stability and saturation problems encountered in network simulations. Finally, we discuss our model in light of recent advances in the physiology and biochemistry of synaptic mechanisms."

A complete classification determines whether a system exhibits finite wave train and periodic bursting behavior or only single pulse and regular periodic behavior. Qualitative properties of the bursts are deduced and used to suggest underlying membrane mechanisms. The conclusions shed new light on the mechanisms of bursting in the epileptogenic focus and Aplysia ganglia.While periodic bursting is shown to be possible in a large class of membranes, a membrane which satisfies a special additional condition is shown to embody an infinite-dimensional temporal code in the form of arbitrary sequences of bursts. Other examples exhibit nonuniqueness and chaos."

The on-center off-surround anatomy allows patterns to be processed across populations without saturating the populations' response to large inputs. The signals between populations are made sigmoid functions of population activity in order to quench network noise, and yet store sufficiently intense patterns in short term memory (STM). There exists a quenching threshold: a population's activity will be quenched along with network noise if it falls below the threshold; the pattern of suprathreshold population activities is contour enhanced and stored in STM. Varying arousal level can therefore influence which pattern features will be stored. The total suprathreshold activity of the network is carefully regulated. Applications to seizure and hallucinatory phenomena, to position codes for mo~or control, to pattern discrimination, to influences of novel events on storage of redundant relevant cues, and to the construction of a sensory-drive heterarchy are mentioned, along with possible anatomical substrates in neocortex, hypothalamus, and hippocampus."

Tille gating phenomena that result lead to dynamically maintained critical peri(Jlds, and to attentional phenomena such as overshadowing in the adult. The fuillctional unit of cognitive coding is suggested to be an adaptive resonance, or amplification and ,prolongation of neural activity, that occurs when afferent data and efferent expectancies reach consensus through a matching process. The resonant state embodies the perceptual event, or attentional focus, and its amplified and sustained activities are capable of driving slow changes of long-term memor:r\"' Mismatch between afferent data and efferent expectancies yields a global sulppression of activity and triggers a reset of short-term memory, as well as raJ~id parallel search and hypothesis testing for uncommitted cells. These mechanisms help to explain and predict, as manifestations of the unified theme of stable code development, positive and negative aftereffects, the McCollough effect, spatial frequency adaptation, monocular rivalry, binocular rivalry and hysteresis, pattern completion, and Gestalt switching; analgesia, partial reinforcement acquisition effect, conditioned reinforcers, underaroused versus overaroused depression; the contingent negative variation, P300, and pontoge]lliculo-occipital waves; olfactory coding, corticogeniculate feedback, matching of proprioceptive and terminal motor maps, and cerebral dominance. The psychophysiological mechanisms that unify these effects are inherently nonlinear and parallel and are inequivalent to the computer, probabilistic, and linear models currently in use."

Clearly written and beautifully illustrated, it deals with the normal anatomy of the pituitary and the related parts of the hypothalamus in man and some animals (particularly monkey, goat, sheep, and rat) and also with the anatomical and histological changes which accompany pituitary stalk section and hypophysectomy. The best parts are those describing the detailed arrangement of the larger pituitary vessels and the portal capillaries of the hypophyseal stalk, which are illustrated diagrammatically, histologically, and in superb casts. The distribution of the hypothalamic nuclei and their relationships with the third ventricle, chiasma, and pituitary stalk are also well demonstrated. Interpretation of air encephalograms will never be as difficult again. The least satisfactory sections are those referring to the control of the pituitary by the hypothalamus and the physiological aspects of pituitary function, but this field has developed enormously and rapidly. Indeed, it is this rapid expansion of physiological knowledge of the identity and actions of the hypothalamic regulatory hormones which makes the availability of this primarily anatomical book so timely, for we can now revise our functional anatomy. The studies comparing the human with the other species add interest, and the authors have also given the details of the experimental and histological techniques used in their studies of pituitary extirpation and stalk section. The book is a summary of the authors' research over nearly 25 years and is a tribute to them. It is an added pleasure to find such a valuable book at such a bargain price."
