Points stand for variables, connections represent associations. When a missing connection is interpreted as a conditional independence, the graph characterizes a conditional independence structure as well. Statistical models, called graphical chain models, correspond to special types of graphs which are interpreted in this fashion. Examples are used to illustrate how conditional independences are reflected in summary statistics derived from the models and how the graphs help to identify analogies and equivalences between different models. Graphical chain models are shown to provide a unifying concept for many statistical techniques that in the past have proven to be useful in analyses of data. They also provide tools for new types of analysis."

The definition does not depend on any particular distributional form and hence can be applied to models with both discrete and continuous random variables. However, the most tractable examples are those for which the joint distribution is normal, or a product of multinomials, and these are considered in detail."

Association is measured in terms of the odds-ratios in 2 \u00d7 2 subtables formed from adjacent rows and adjacent columns. This class includes the null association model, the uniform association model, and models that describe the possible effects of the rows and/or columns on the association. With these models, the association in the table can be analyzed in a manner analogous to the usual two-way analysis of variance, and parsimonious descriptions of this association can be obtained often. Applications are discussed here, some well-known sets of data are reanalyzed, and new insights into these data are obtained."

                "text": "SUMMARY Lawley (1956) describes how asymptotic likelihood ratio tests can in general be improved by multiplying the -2 log A test statistic by a multiplier chosen so that the null distribution of the modified statistic is better approximated by its asymptotic x2 distribution. This paper applies this technique to asymptotic likelihood ratio tests of hypotheses concerning complete contingency tables. Improved tests are derived for hypotheses with closed form maximum likelihood estimators. An asymptotic likelihood ratio test of a composite null hypothesis against a composite alternative can in general be obtained by comparing -2 log A with a x2 distribution, where A is the ratio of maximized likelihoods under the two hypotheses. Lawley (1956) showed that such tests can be improved by multiplying -2 log A by a scale factor chosen so that the null distribution of the resulting statistic has the same moments as X2 ignoring quantities of order n-2, where n is the size of the sample. When the statistic - 2 log A can be expressed as an explicit function of the observations the multiplier is most easily found by calculating directly its expectation as far as terms of order n-1. These improved likelihood ratio tests have been most used in the area of multivariate analysis. In recent years considerable progress has been made in developing methods for analyzing multidimensional contingency tables using log linear models. A comprehensive review is given by Plackett (1 974). In these models the cell frequencies may be regarded as independent Poisson variables whose log expectations are linear in a hierarchical set of main effect and interaction parameters. The -2 log A statistic for testing the goodness of fit of a given model takes the form S = 2EX log (X/u), where the X are the cell frequencies and the ,u are the maximum likelihood estimators of their expectations. In practice X log (X/,u) can be replaced by zero when X = 0. Following Nelder & Wedderburn (1972), S will be termed the deviance of the model. To test a given model with deviance S1 against an alternative with additional estimated parameters and deviance S2, the likelihood ratio test statistic iS S1-S2"

We show that a reducible zero pattern is the condition under which parameters as well as least squares estimates in recursive equations are one-to-one transformations of parameters and of maximum likelihood estimates, respectively, in a decomposable covariance selection model. As a consequence, (a) we can give a closed-form expression for the maximum likelihood estimate of a decomposable covariance matrix, (b) we can derive Wright's rule for computing implied correlations in path analysis, and (c) we can describe a search procedure for fitting recursive equations."

The first of these is a subclass of hierarchical log linear models. Each of its models can be represented by an undirected graph. In the second class each model corresponds to a particular kind of a directed graph instead and can be characterized by a nontrivial factorization of the joint distribution in terms of response variables. We derive decomposable or multiplicative models as the intersecting class. This result has useful consequences for exploratory types of analysis as well as for the model interpretation: we can give an aid for detecting well-fitting decomposable models in a transformation of the observed contingency table and each decomposable model may be interpreted with the help of an undirected or directed graph."

The techniques proposed here yield 'path diagrams' that are somewhat analogous to those used in path analysis. Earlier path analysis models are not suited to the case where the variables are polytomous, or dichotomous, but the models proposed herein are. For each of our models, methods are presented for (a) testing whether the model fits the data, (b) partitioning the test statistic into components that can be used to test submodels within the overall model, and (c) estimating the parameters in the model. An illustrative application is also included."

The general location model of Olkin & Tate (1961) and extensions introduced by Krzanowski (1980, 1982) form the basis for our methods. Maximum likelihood estimation with incomplete data is achieved by an application of the EM algorithm (Dempster, Laird & Rubin, 1977). Special cases of the algorithm include Orchard & Woodbury's (1972) algorithm for incomplete normal samples, Fuchs's (1982) algorithms for log linear modelling of partially classified contingency tables, and Day's (1969) algorithm for multivariate normal mixtures. Applications include: (a) imputation of missing values, (b) logistic regression and discriminant analysis with missing predictors and unclassified observations, (c) linear regression with missing continuous and categorical predictors, and (d) parametric cluster analysis with incomplete data. Methods are illustrated using data from the St Louis Risk Research Project.

Necessary and sufficient conditions for collapsibility are found in terms of the generating class. It is shown that log linear models are appropriate for tables with response and explanatory variables if and only if they are collapsible onto the explanatory variables. Some key word8: Collapsibility; Contingency table; Graphical model; Interaction graph; Log linear model; Response variable; S-sufficiency. shown to be closely related. Some models have the property that relations between a set of the classifying factors may be studied by examination of the table of marginal totals formed by summing over the remaining factors. Such models are said to be collapsible onto the given set of factors. Collapsibility has important consequences for hypothesis testing and model selection, and can be useful in data reduction. We consider various definitions of collapsibility and show their equivalence. Furthermore, necessary and sufficient conditions for collapsi- bility are found in terms of the generating class. Many tables analysed in practice involve response variables. Simple examples, one of which is given in ? 3, suffice to show the importance of distinguishing between response and explanatory variables: first, that inappropriate models may be avoided, and second that natural and relevant models that are not log linear may be considered. This paper characterizes appropriate and inappropriate log linear models for tables with response variables and some alternative approaches for the analysis of such tables are briefly considered. We consider a multidimensional contingency table N based on a set of classifying factors F. For a given subset a of F we are interested in the table of marginal totals Na, that is to say the table of cell counts summed over the remaining factors aC, that is the complement of a in F. We identify a hierarchical log linear model L, that is the set of probabilities p E L, with its generating class, whose elements, generators, are given in square brackets: thus for example the model (AB) (BCD) for a 4-way table corresponds"

The reel is mounted in a casing which receives the tee when the spring rotates the reel to wind the spring onto it. The reel is normally locked by a one-way ratchet but is released to wind in the string by a push-button which has a spike and is detachable from the casing so as to be usable as a ball marker. When practising, the cord can be aligned with the green or hole and used as an aid in swinging the club face in the correct direction. The casing has a spring-clip so that the article can be clipped into the golfer's pocker when he is not using it."

These models are hierarchical models that can be represented by a simple, undirected graph on as many vertices as the dimension of the corresponding table. Further all these models can be given an interpretation in terms of conditional independence and the interpretation can be read directly off the graph in the form of a Markov property. The class of graphical models contains that of decomposable models and we give a simple criterion for decomposability of a given graphical model. To some extent we discuss estimation problems and give suggestions for further work."

                "text": "Abstract Problems involving causal inference have dogged at the heels of statistics since its earliest days. Correlation does not imply causation, and yet causal conclusions drawn from a carefully designed experiment are often valid. What can a statistical model say about causation? This question is addressed by using a particular model for causal inference (Holland and Rubin 1983; Rubin 1974) to critique the discussions of other writers on causation and causal inference. These include selected philosophers, medical researchers, statisticians, econometricians, and proponents of causal modeling."
