In this paper, the Bayesian approach to regularization and model-comparison is demonstrated by studying the inference problem of interpolating noisy data. The concepts and methods described are quite general and can be applied to many other data modeling problems. Regularizing constants are set by examining their posterior probability distribution. Alternative regularizers (priors) and alternative basis sets are objectively compared by evaluating the evidence for them. Occam's razor is automatically embodied by this process. The way in which Bayes infers the values of regularizing constants and noise levels has an elegant interpretation in terms of the effective number of parameters determined by the data set. This framework is due to Gull and Skilling."

This approach allows the true predictive distribution for a test case given a set of training cases to be approximated arbitrarily closely, in contrast to previous approaches which approximate the posterior weight distribution by a Gaussian. In this work, the Hybrid Monte Carlo method is implemented in conjunction with simulated annealing, in order to speed relaxation to a good region of parameter space. The method has been applied to a test problem, demonstrating that it can produce good predictions, as well as an indication of the uncertainty of these predictions. Appropriate weight scaling factors are found automatically. By applying known techniques for calculation of \\free energy\" diierences, it should also be possible to compare the merits of diierent network architectures. The work described here should also be applicable to a wide variety of statistical models other than neural networks."

We wish to treat the outputs of the network as probabilities of alternatives (e.g. pattern classes), conditioned on the inputs. We look for appropriate output non-linearities and for appropriate criteria for adaptation of the parameters of the network (e.g. weights). We explain two modifications: probability scoring, which is an alternative to squared error minimisation, and a normalised exponential (softmax) multi-input generalisation of the logistic non-linearity. The two modifications together result in quite simple arithmetic, and hardware implementation is not difficult either. The use of radial units (squared distance instead of dot product) immediately before the softmax output stage produces a network which computes posterior distributions over class labels based on an assumption of Gaussian within-class distributions. However the training, which uses cross-class information, can result in better performance at class discrimination than the usual within-class training method, unless the within-class distribution assumptions are actually correct."

The single-output neuron is trained to be either a zero or a one. A test decision is made by thresholding the output at, for example, one-half. The set of inputs that produce an output of one-half forms the classification boundary. The authors adopted an inversion algorithm for the neural network that allows generation of this boundary. For each boundary point, the classification gradient can be generated. The gradient provides a useful measure of the steepness of the multidimensional decision surfaces. Conjugate input pairs are generated using the boundary point and gradient information and presented to an oracle for proper classification. These data are used to refine further the classification boundary, thereby increasing the classification accuracy. The result can be a significant reduction in the training set cardinality in comparison with, for example, randomly generated data points. An application example to power system security assessment is given."

The theory implies that, for a reduction in eg that remains finite in the large-N limit, P should generally scale as nN, where N is the number of independently adjustable weights in the network. We show that for smooth networks, i.e., those with continuously varying weights and smooth transfer functions, the generalization curve asymptotically obeys an inverse power law. In contrast, for nonsmooth networks other behaviors can appear, depending on the nature of the nonlinearities as well as the realizability of the rule. In particular, a discontinuous learning transition from a state of poor to a state of perfect generalization can occur in nonsmooth networks learning realizable rules. We illustrate both gradual and continuous learning with a detailed analytical and numerical study of several single-layer perceptron models. Comparing with the exact replica theory of perceptron learning, we find that for realizable rules the high-temperature and annealed theories provide very good approximations to the generalization performance. Assuming this to hold for multilayer networks as well, we propose a classification of possible asymptotic forms of learning curves in general realizable models. For unrealizable rules we find that the above approximations fail in general to predict correctly the shapes of the generalization curves. Another indication of the important role of quenched disorder for unrealizable rules is that the generalization error is not necessarily a monotonically increasing function of temperature. Also, unrealizable rules can possess genuine spin-glass phases indicative of degenerate minima separated by high barriers."

The objective is to minimize the data requirement of learning. The authors choose a criterion for selecting training examples that works well in conjunction with the criterion used for learning, here, least squares. They proceed sequentially, selecting an example that, when added to the previous set of training examples and learned, maximizes the decrement of network squared error over the input space. When dealing with clean data and deterministic relationships, concise training sets that minimize the integrated squared bias (ISB) are desired. The ISB is used to derive a selection criterion for evaluating individual training examples, the DISB, that is maximized to select new exemplars. They conclude with graphical illustrations of the method, and demonstrate its use during network training. Experimental results indicate that training upon exemplars selected in this fashion can save computation in general purpose use as well."

Queries appear to be available in practice for most problems of interest, e.g. by appeal to a human expert. The author's algorithm is proved to PAC learn in polynomial time the class of target functions defined by layered, depth two, threshold nets having n inputs connected to k hidden threshold units connected to one or more output units, provided k=/<4. While target functions and input distributions can be described for which the algorithm will fail for larger k, it appears likely to work well in practice. Tests of a variant of the algorithm have consistently and rapidly learned random nets of this type. Computational efficiency figures are given. The algorithm can also be proved to learn intersections of k half-spaces in R(n) in time polynomial in both n and k. A variant of the algorithm can learn arbitrary depth layered threshold networks with n inputs and k units in the first hidden layer in time polynomial in the larger of n and k but exponential in the smaller of the two."

By exploiting the graphical structure, the updating can be performed locally, either approximately or exactly, and the setup makes it possible to take advantage of a range of well-established statistical techniques.

                "text": "AbstractPROF. R. H. FOWLER'S monumental work on statistical mechanics has, in this the second edition, in his own modest words, been rearranged and brought more up to date. But the new volume is much more than a revision, in that it is explicitly based on quantum mechanics from the outset ; the first dynamical equation found written in the formal presentation is a wave-equation. Prof. Fowler states in justification that although classical mechanics is used to derive the quantum mechanics by a process of generalization, \"once the laws of quantum mechanics have been thus guessed, as they must be before we can discuss the theorems of statistical mechanics, quantized systems naturally come first. In 1935 this attitude hardly needs apology\". In consequence of this, the concluding chapter of the first edition, dealing with quantum statistics, has been incorporated in the new exposition from the start, and what is effectively the opening chapter is now doubled in length. Otherwise there is no change of general structure. But a comparison of the two editions shows that the chapter of the first edition entitled \"Thermionics\" is now more than four times as long, and contains a treatment of the electron theory of metals and of semi-conductors ; that the chapter on dielectrics and magnetic constants has been similarly extended, and now includes an account of ferro-magnetism ; lastly, there is a new concluding chapter on \"co-operative\" and other phenomena. The number of references is almost doubled. It is difficult to over-estimate the amount of work involved in thus re-writing and extending what was already an encyclop\u00e6dic work.Statistical Mechanics: \n the Theory of the Properties of Matter in Equilibrium.

The integral of a sigmoid times a gaussian cannot be solved analytically; here I suggest a simple numerical approximation to it: (2.3) with IE. = l/J1+.rrS2/8. This approximation is not globally accurate over (aMp,s2), (for large s2 > a the function should tend to an error function, not a logistic) but it breaks down gracefully. The value of K was chosen so that the approximation has the correct gain at aMP = 0, as s2 -+ m. A representative of this approximation is given in Figure 1, which compares 4 and 4' with numerical evaluations of $ and I$. A similar approximation in terms of the error function is suggested in Spiegelhalter and Lauritzen (1990). If the output is immediately used to make a (0/1) decision, then the use of moderated outputs will make no difference to the performance of the classifier (unless the costs associated with error are asymetrical), since both functions pass through 0."
