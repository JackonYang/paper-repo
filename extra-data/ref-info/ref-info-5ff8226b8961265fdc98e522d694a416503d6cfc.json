The algorithms are designed to operate in real time when implemented on new parallel computer architectures. A doubly stochastic representation is used in image modelling. Here, an auto-normal (Gaussian) process is used to model textures in visible light and infrared images, and an auto-binary field is used to model apriori information about local image geometry. Image segmentation is realized as true maximum likelihood estimation. The first segmentation algorithm is hierarchical and uses a pyramid-like structure in new ways that exploit the mutual dependencies among disjoint pieces of a textured region. The second segmentation algorithm is a relaxation-type algorithm that arises naturally within the context of these non-causal Markovian Processes. It is a simple, true maximum likelihood estimator. The algorithms can be used separately or together. These issues and subtleties concerning the use of the Markovian processes are discussed."

The Bayes smoothing algorithm yields the a posteriori distribution of the scene value at each pixel, given the total noisy image, in a recursive way. The a posteriori distribution together with a criterion of optimality then determine a Bayes estimate of the scene. The algorithm presented is an extension of a 1-D Bayes smoothing algorithm to 2-D and it gives the optimum Bayes estimate for the scene value at each pixel. Computational concerns in 2-D, however, necessitate certain simplifying assumptions on the model and approximations on the implementation of the algorithm. In particular, the scene (noiseless image) is modeled as a Markov mesh random field, a special class of Markov random fields, and the Bayes smoothing algorithm is applied on overlapping strips (horizontal/vertical) of the image consisting of several rows (columns). It is assumed that the signal (scene values) vector sequence along the strip is a vector Markov chain. Since signal correlation in one of the dimensions is not fully used along the edges of the strip, estimates are generated only along the middle sections of the strips. The overlapping strips are chosen such that the union of the middle sections of the strips gives the whole image. The Bayes smoothing algorithm presented here is valid for scene random fields consisting of multilevel (discrete) or continuous random variables."

A texture model is a mathematical procedure capable of producing and describing a textured image. We explore the use of Markov random fields as texture models. The binomial model, where each point in the texture has a binomial distribution with parameter controlled by its neighbors and ``number of tries'' equal to the number of gray levels, was taken to be the basic model for the analysis. A method of generating samples from the binomial model is given, followed by a theoretical and practical analysis of the method's convergence. Examples show how the parameters of the Markov random field control the strength and direction of the clustering in the image. The power of the binomial model to produce blurry, sharp, line-like, and blob-like textures is demonstrated. Natural texture samples were digitized and their parameters were estimated under the Markov random field model. A hypothesis test was used for an objective assessment of goodness-of-fit under the Markov random field model. Overall, microtextures fit the model well. The estimated parameters of the natural textures were used as input to the generation procedure. The synthetic microtextures closely resembled their real counterparts, while the regular and inhomogeneous textures did not."

We briefly review the definitions and basic concepts of Markov random fields (MRFs) and GDs and present some realizations from these distributions. The use of statistical models and methods in image processing has increased considerably over the recent years. Most of these studies involve the use of MRF models and processing techniques based on these models. The pioneering work on MRFs due to Dobrushin [1], Wong [2], and Woods [3] involves extending the Markovian property in one dimension to higher dimensions. However, due to lack of causality in two dimensions the extension is not straightforward. Some properties in one dimension, for example, the equivalence of one-sided and two-sided Markovianity, do not carry over to two dimensions. The early work by Abend et al. [4] presents a causal characterization for a class of MRFs called Markov mesh random fields. This work also includes a formulation pointing out the Gibbsian property of a Markov chain without fully realizing the connection. Other attempts in extending the Markovian property to two dimensions include the autoregressive models: the \u201csimultaneous autoregressive\u201d (SAR) models and the \u201cconditional Markov\u201d models introduced by Chellappa and Kashyap [5]."

The degradation is assumed to be due to a space invariant, periodic, nonseparable known point-spread function, and additive white noise. Our basic approach is to represent the images by a class of spatial interaction models, namely the simultaneous autoregressve models and the conditional Markov models defined on toroidal lattices, and develop minimum mean-squared error restoration algorithms using these models. The restoration algorithms are optimal, if the parameters characterizing the interaction models are exactly known. However, in practice, the parameters are estimated from the images. By using spatial interaction models, we develop restoration algorithms that do not require the availability of the original image or its prototype. The specific structure of the underlying lattice enables the implementation of the filters using fast Fourier transform (FFT) computations, Several restoration examples are given."

Pixel gray levels and the presence and orientation of edges are viewed as states of atoms or molecules in a lattice-like physical system. The assignment of an energy function in the physical system determines its Gibbs distribution. Because of the Gibbs distribution, Markov random field (MRF) equivalence, this assignment also determines an MRF image model. The energy function is a more convenient and natural mechanism for embodying picture attributes than are the local characteristics of the MRF. For a range of degradation mechanisms, including blurring, nonlinear deformations, and multiplicative or additive noise, the posterior distribution is an MRF with a structure akin to the image model. By the analogy, the posterior distribution defines another (imaginary) physical system. Gradual temperature reduction in the physical system isolates low energy states (``annealing''), or what is the same thing, the most probable states under the Gibbs distribution. The analogous operation under the posterior distribution yields the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the image given the degraded observations. The result is a highly parallel ``relaxation'' algorithm for MAP estimation. We establish convergence properties of the algorithm and we experiment with some simple pictures, for which good restorations are obtained at low signal-to-noise ratios."

The method of moments basically involves equating the sample moments to the corresponding mixture moments expressed in terms of component parameters and solving these equations for the unknown parameters. These moment equations, however, are nonlinear in the unknown parameters, and heretofore, an analytic solution of these equations has been obtained only for two-component mixtures [2]. Numerical solutions also tend to be unreliable for more than two components, due to the large number of nonlinear equations and parameters to be solved for. In this correspondence, under the condition that the component distributions have equal variances or equal means, the nonlinear moment equations are transformed into a set of linear equations using Prony's method. The solution of these equations for the unknown parameters is analytically feasible and numerically reliable for mixtures with several components. Numerous examples using the proposed technique for two-, three-, and four-component mixtures are presented."

An optimal recipe for classifying such patterns is described. It combines the use of an orthonormal expansion for the logarithm of probability functions, with the generation of a joint probability distribution from lower-order marginals. The unwieldy nature of the optimal recipe leads to the consideration of dependence represented by a Markov chain and a two-dimensional analog called a Markov mesh. The Markov chain has a \"reflecting\" property in that the r th order nonstationary chain implies that a point depends on its r nearest neighbors on each side. By scanning along a grid-filling curve so that the 2r neighbors of a point are geometrically close to it, certain spatial dependencies are obtained. The grid-filling curves are sequences of functions which have Hilbert \"space-filling\" curves as their limit. This simple approach does not provide for many of the spatial dependencies that should be considered. A novel extension of Markov chain methods into two dimensions leads to the Markov mesh which economically takes care of a much larger class of spatial dependencies. Likelihood ratio classification based on Markov chain and Markov mesh assumptions requires the estimation of a much smaller number of parameters than the general case. The development presented in this paper is new and need not be restricted to binary variables."

In the general case, with two means, two standard deviations, and a proportionality factor to be estimated, the first five sample moments are required, and it becomes necessary to find a particular solution of a ninth degree polynomial equation that was originally derived by Karl Pearson [10]. A procedure which circumvents solution of the nonic equation and thereby considerably reduces the total computational effort otherwise required, is presented. Estimates obtained in the simpler special case in which the two standard deviations are assumed to be equal, are employed as first approximations in an iterative method for simultaneously solving the basic system of moment equations applicable in the more general case in which the two standard deviations are unequal. Conditional maximum likelihood and conditional minimum chi-square estimation subject to having the first four sample moments equated ..."

                "text": "AbstractPROF. R. H. FOWLER'S monumental work on statistical mechanics has, in this the second edition, in his own modest words, been rearranged and brought more up to date. But the new volume is much more than a revision, in that it is explicitly based on quantum mechanics from the outset ; the first dynamical equation found written in the formal presentation is a wave-equation. Prof. Fowler states in justification that although classical mechanics is used to derive the quantum mechanics by a process of generalization, \"once the laws of quantum mechanics have been thus guessed, as they must be before we can discuss the theorems of statistical mechanics, quantized systems naturally come first. In 1935 this attitude hardly needs apology\". In consequence of this, the concluding chapter of the first edition, dealing with quantum statistics, has been incorporated in the new exposition from the start, and what is effectively the opening chapter is now doubled in length. Otherwise there is no change of general structure. But a comparison of the two editions shows that the chapter of the first edition entitled \"Thermionics\" is now more than four times as long, and contains a treatment of the electron theory of metals and of semi-conductors ; that the chapter on dielectrics and magnetic constants has been similarly extended, and now includes an account of ferro-magnetism ; lastly, there is a new concluding chapter on \"co-operative\" and other phenomena. The number of references is almost doubled. It is difficult to over-estimate the amount of work involved in thus re-writing and extending what was already an encyclop\u00e6dic work.Statistical Mechanics: \n the Theory of the Properties of Matter in Equilibrium.
