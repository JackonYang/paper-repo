                "text": "A novel graph theoretic approach to image segmentation is presented, and its application to tissue segmentation in MR images of the human brain is demonstrated. An undirected adjacency graph G is used to represent the image with each vertex of G corresponding to a homogeneous component of the image. Each component may be a single pixel or a connected region which, under a suitable criterion, is homogeneous. All pairs of nodes corresponding to spatially connected pixels or regions in the image are linked by arcs in G. A flow capacity, assigned to each arc, is chosen to reflect the probability that the pair of linked vertices belong to the same region or tissue type. The segmentation is achieved through clustering vertices in G by removing arcs of G to form mutually exclusive subgraphs. The subgraphs formed by the clustering algorithm are optimal in the sense that the largest inter-subgraph maximum flow is minimized. Each of the resulting subgraphs then represents a homogeneous region of the image. Using a suitable choice of the arc capacity function, this approach can be used to segment the image either by searching for statistically homogeneous regions (texture segmentation) or by searching for closed region boundaries (edge detection). A direct implementation of the new segmentation algorithm requires the construction of a flow equivalent spanning tree for G. As the size of the graph G increases, constructing an equivalent tree becomes very inefficient. In order to overcome this problem, an algorithm for hierarchically constructing and partitioning a partially equivalent tree of much reduced size has been developed. This hierarchical algorithm results in an optimal solution equivalent to that obtained by partitioning the complete equivalent tree of G."

Development of these clustering algorithms was based on examples from two-dimensional space because we wanted to copy the human perception of gestalts or point groupings. On the other hand, all the methods considered apply to higher dimensional spaces and even to general metric spaces. Advantages of these methods include determinacy, easy interpretation of the resulting clusters, conformity to gestalt principles of perceptual organization, and invariance of results under monotone transformations of interpoint distance. Brief discussion is made of the application of cluster detection to taxonomy and the selection of good feature spaces for pattern recognition. Detailed analyses of several planar cluster detection problems are illustrated by text and figures. The well-known Fisher iris data, in four-dimensional space, have been analyzed by these methods also. PL/1 programs to implement the minimal spanning tree methods have been fully debugged."

In this paper, we present a noniterative, graph-theoretic approach to nonparametric cluster analysis.

The technique does not require training prototypes but operates in an \"unsupervised\" mode. The features most useful for the given image to be segmented are retained by the algorithm without human interaction, by rejecting those attributes which do not contribute to homogeneous clustering in N-dimensional vector space. The basic procedure is a K-means clustering algorithm which converges to a local minimum in the average squared intercluster distance for a specified number of clusters. The algorithm iterates on the number of clusters, evaluating the clustering based on a parameter of clustering quality. The parameter proposed is a product of between and within cluster scatter measures, which achieves a maximum value that is postulated to represent an intrinsic number of clusters in the data. At this value, feature rejection is implemented via a Bhattacharyya measure to make the image segments more homogeneous (thereby removing \"noisy\" features); and reclustering is performed. The resulting parameter of clustering fidelity is maximized with segmented imagery resulting in psychovisually pleasing and culturally logical image segments."

The paper presents a dynamic programming approach that reduces the amount of redundant transitional calculations implicit in a total enumeration approach. A comparison of the number of calculations required under each approach is presented in Appendix A. Unlike most clustering approaches used in practice, the dynamic programming algorithm will always converge on the best clustering solution. The efficiency of the dynamic programming approach depends upon the rapid-access computer memory available. A numerical example is given in Appendix B."

To obtain improved estimates, we have developed a new unsupervised hierarchical segmentation algorithm upon which our tissue classification scheme is based. The MR images are modeled as a first order Gauss-Markov ran- dom field (GMRF) with unknown parameters. Through test- ing hypotheses of homogeneity for either labeled or unlabeled data, the segmentation algorithm seeks to group the pixels in- to connected regions which are homogeneous GMRFs. This is achieved in three steps. The image is represented by a quadtree and a split-and-merge procedure is applied to find large homo- geneous regions within the image. This is followed by a segmen- tation refinement step involving connected component labeling and region growing. Here, the use of a hierarchical approach allows the algorithm to learn about the image by first process- ing the easy-to-classify pixels while delaying decisions on the hard pixels until more information has been gathered. Final- ly, a novel graph theoretic clustering algorithm is developed to reduce the number of resulting connected regions. This clus- tering method is globally optimal for a properly defined family of cost functions."

The procedure operates in a nonparametric unsupervised mode. The feasibility of the methodology is demonstrated by segmenting a six-band Landsat-4 digital image with 324 scan lines and 392 pixels per scan line. For this image, 100-percent ground cover information is available for estimating the quality of segmentation. About 80 percent of the imaged area contains corn and soybean fields near the peak of their growing season. The remaining 20 percent of the image contains 12 different types of ground cover classes that appear in regions of diffferent sizes and shapes. The segmentation method uses the fuzzy c-means algorithm in two stages. The large number of clusters resulting from this segmentation process are then merged by use of a similarity measure on the cluster centers. Results are presented to show that this two-stage process leads to separation of corn and soybean, and of several minor classes that would otherwise be overwhelmed in any practical one-stage clustering."

We also describe a parallel implementation of the algorithm that runs in On2 log U log p time in the PRAM model with EREW and uses only p processors where p = \u00e2\u008c\u0088m/n\u00e2\u008c\u0089."

(1) Intensity changes, which occur in a natural image over a wide range of scales, are detected separately at different scales. An appropriate filter for this purpose at a given scale is found to be the second derivative of a Gaussian, and it is shown that, provided some simple conditions are satisfied, these primary filters need not be orientation-dependent. Thus, intensity changes at a given scale are best detected by finding the zero values of \u22072G(x, y)* I(x, y) for image I, where G(x, y) is a two-dimensional Gaussian distribution and \u22072 is the Laplacian. The intensity changes thus discovered in each of the channels are then represented by oriented primitives called zero-crossing segments, and evidence is given that this representation is complete. (2) Intensity changes in images arise from surface discontinuities or from reflectance or illumination boundaries, and these all have the property that they are spatially localized. Because of this, the zero-crossing segments from the different channels are not independent, and rules are deduced for combining them into a description of the image. This description is called the raw primal sketch. The theory explains several basic psychophysical findings, and the operation of forming oriented zero-crossing segments from the output of centre-surround \u22072G filters acting on the image forms the basis for a physiological model of simple cells (see Marr & Ullman 1979)."

The techniques presented by Ford and Fulkerson spurred the development of powerful computational tools for solving and analyzing network flow models, and also furthered the understanding of linear programming. In addition, the book helped illuminate and unify results in combinatorial mathematics while emphasizing proofs based on computationally efficient construction.

Pixel gray levels and the presence and orientation of edges are viewed as states of atoms or molecules in a lattice-like physical system. The assignment of an energy function in the physical system determines its Gibbs distribution. Because of the Gibbs distribution, Markov random field (MRF) equivalence, this assignment also determines an MRF image model. The energy function is a more convenient and natural mechanism for embodying picture attributes than are the local characteristics of the MRF. For a range of degradation mechanisms, including blurring, nonlinear deformations, and multiplicative or additive noise, the posterior distribution is an MRF with a structure akin to the image model. By the analogy, the posterior distribution defines another (imaginary) physical system. Gradual temperature reduction in the physical system isolates low energy states (``annealing''), or what is the same thing, the most probable states under the Gibbs distribution. The analogous operation under the posterior distribution yields the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the image given the degraded observations. The result is a highly parallel ``relaxation'' algorithm for MAP estimation. We establish convergence properties of the algorithm and we experiment with some simple pictures, for which good restorations are obtained at low signal-to-noise ratios."

The signal intensity depends indirectly on particular physical and chemical characteristics of the tissues being imaged. These tissue properties influence the behavior of the nuclei undergoing resonance, and their behavior is what directly affects the MRI signal. The parameters of interest that describe this behavior are the relaxation times Ti and T2, the spin density (for hydrogen, N(H)), and the microscopic (diffusion) and macroscopic (flow, motion) motional states of the nuclei. These parameters exist, in turn, because of certain properties of the tissues: water content, fat content, macromolecules, paramagnetic ions and flow being among the significant variables."
