Categorization of text is of increasing importance in information retrieval and natural language processing systems. Previous research on automated text categorization has mixed machine learning and knowledge engineering methods, making it diicult to draw conclusions about the performance of particular methods. In this paper we present empirical results on the performance of a Bayesian classiier and a decision tree learning algorithm on two text categorization data sets. We nd that both algorithms achieve reasonable performance and allow controlled tradeoos between false positives and false negatives. The stepwise feature selection in the decision tree algorithm is particularly eeective in dealing with the large feature sets common in text categorization. However, even this algorithm is aided by an initial preeltering of features, connrming the results found by Almuallim and Dietterich on artiicial data sets. We also demonstrate the impact of the time-varying nature of category deenitions."

Using an already coded training database of about 50,000 stories from the Dow Jones Press Release News Wire, and SEEKER [Stanfill] (a text retrieval system that supports relevance feedback) as the underlying match engine, codes are assigned to new, unseen stories with a recall of about 80% and precision of about 70%. There are about 350 different codes to be assigned. Using a massively parallel supercomputer, we leverage the information already contained in the thousands of coded stories and are able to code a story in about 2 seconds. Given SEEKER, the text retrieval system, we achieved these results in about two person-months. We believe this approach is effective in reducing the development time to implement classification systems involving large number of topics for the purpose of classification, message routing etc."

This book is a complete guide to the C4.5 system as implemented in C for the UNIX environment. It contains a comprehensive guide to the system's use , the source code (about 8,800 lines), and implementation notes. The source code and sample datasets are also available on a 3.5-inch floppy diskette for a Sun workstation. \n \nC4.5 starts with large sets of cases belonging to known classes. The cases, described by any mixture of nominal and numeric properties, are scrutinized for patterns that allow the classes to be reliably discriminated. These patterns are then expressed as models, in the form of decision trees or sets of if-then rules, that can be used to classify new cases, with emphasis on making the models understandable as well as accurate. The system has been applied successfully to tasks involving tens of thousands of cases described by hundreds of properties. The book starts from simple core learning methods and shows how they can be elaborated and extended to deal with typical problems such as missing data and over hitting. Advantages and disadvantages of the C4.5 approach are discussed and illustrated with several case studies. \n \nThis book and software should be of interest to developers of classification-based intelligent systems and to students in machine learning and expert systems courses."

In this paper we study the properties of phrasal and clustered indexing languages on a text categorization task, enabling us to study their properties in isolation from query interpretation issues. We show that optimal effectiveness occurs when using only a small proportion of the indexing terms available, and that effectiveness peaks at a higher feature set size and lower effectiveness level for a syntactic phrase indexing than for word-based indexing. We also present results suggesting that traditional term clustering method are unlikely to provide significantly improved text representations. An improved probabilistic text categorization method is also presented."

This paper discusses an architecture for probabilistic concept-based information retrieval which addresses the knowledge acquisition problem. The architecture makes use of the probabilistic networks technology for representing and reasoning about concepts and includes a knowledge acquisition component which partially automates the construction of concept knowledge bases from data. We describe two experiments that apply the architecture to the task of retrieving documents about terrorism from a set of documents from the Reuters news service. The experiments provide positive evidence that the architecture design is feasible and that there are advantages to concept-based methods."

The proportion of these patterns which are misrecognized or rejected is taken as the estimate of the error probability or rejection probability for the machine. In Part I, this testing procedure is discussed for the cases of unknown and known a priori probabilities of occurrence of the pattern classes. The differences between the tests that should be made in the two cases are noted, and confidence intervals for the test results are indicated. These concepts are applied to various published pattern recognition results by determining the appropriate confidence interval for each result. In Part II, the problem of the optimum partitioning of a sample of fixed size between the design and test phases of a pattern recognition machine is discussed. One important nonparametric result is that the proportion of the total sample used for testing the machine should never be less than that proportion used for designing the machine, and in some cases should be a good deal more."

(Generally speaking, subjects respond quicker than normal to the word nurse if it follows a highly associated word such as doctor. ) We will extend the term to provide the basis for a statistical description of a variety of interesting linguistic phenomena, ranging from semantic relations of the doctor/nurse type (content word/content word) to lexico-syntactic co-occurrence constraints between verbs and prepositions (content word/function word). This paper will propose an objective measure based on the information theoretic notion of mutual information, for estimating word association norms from computer readable corpora. (The standard method of obtaining word association norms, testing a few thousand subjects on a few hundred words, is both costly and unreliable.) The proposed measure, the association ratio, estimates word association norms directly from computer readable corpora, making it possible to estimate norms for tens of thousands of words."

The texts to be indexed are abstracts written in English. The system of descriptors is prescribed. For the application of the AIR/PHYS system a large-scale dictionary containing more than 600 000 word-descriptor relations reap. phrase-descriptor relations has been developed. Most of these relations have been obtained by means of statistical and heuristical methods. In consequence, the relation system is rather imperfect. Therefore, the indexing system needs some fault- tolerating features. An appropriate indexing approach and the corresponding structure of the AIR/PHYS system are described.

The procedure produces optimum solutions for all problems tested, \"classical\" problems appearing in the literature, as well as randomly generated test problems, up to 110 cities. Run times grow approximately as n2; in absolute terms, a typical 100-city problem requires less than 25 seconds for one case GE635, and about three minutes to obtain the optimum with above 95 per cent confidence."

There are 21,450 news stories from the year 1987. All stories beyond April 7 are used as independent test cases, and the remaining data were the training cases. The data consist of 14,704 training cases and 6746 test cases. There are 135 topics of interest, with 93 of these topics occurring more than once in the training data. We chose to experiment with these 93 topics. Our error measures, however, take into account the remaining topics (with one or fewer occurrences in the training data,) since the cases associated with these topics are always present in the test data. Of the original newswires, there are 7133 stories with \u201cempty\u201d topic assignments. We chose to ignore these stories, since we can neither learn from them nor test on them. As a result, the raw data that we worked with had 10,645 training cases and 3672 test cases. We derived our own dictionaries and attributes from the raw document training data and applied rule induction machine-learning methods (Swap-1). For each experiment for a given topic, a random subset, corresponding to 33% of the training data, was reserved for error estimation. Each of the recursively pruned rule sets was evaluated on these randomly selected cases to help select the best rule set. Estimates on these cases were generally within 27o of the performance of the selected rule sets on the 3672 independent test cases from after April 7. Dictionaries were created two different ways. First, the simpler approach used the local-dictionary process, where the 150 most frequent words for the given topic were generated. We experimented with the cutoff point, evaluating cutoffs both below (50) and above (200) this threshold. The results suggested to us that 150 corresponded approximately to a local minimum, in terms of the accuracy and the performance of the induced rule sets. A brief universal list of 427 stop words was maintained, and these words were removed from the most frequent 150 words. Thus the actual number of features that were used for learning the categorization models varied for each of the 93 topics, in the range of 80\u2013 100. The local dictionaries were created using a fast algorithm that used a simple submatch strategy (without a stemmer) to pick up all the unique single words encountered in documents belonging to a topic. The second approach was to create a universal dictionary by examining all documents in the training set. Depending on the topic, a variable number of features were derived by an entropy-based feature selection model, as in Breiman et al. [1984]. From a universal dictionary of approximately 10,000 features, the number of features selected for each category ranged between 30 and 200."
