                "text": "We consider the problem of depth estimation from a single monocular image in this work. It is a challenging task as no reliable depth cues are available, e.g., stereo correspondences, motions etc. Previous efforts have been focusing on exploiting geometric priors or additional sources of information, with all using hand-crafted features. Recently, there is mounting evidence that features from deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) are setting new records for various vision applications. On the other hand, considering the continuous characteristic of the depth values, depth estimations can be naturally formulated into a continuous conditional random field (CRF) learning problem. Therefore, we in this paper present a deep convolutional neural field model for estimating depths from a single image, aiming to jointly explore the capacity of deep CNN and continuous CRF. Specifically, we propose a deep structured learning scheme which learns the unary and pairwise potentials of continuous CRF in a unified deep CNN framework. The proposed method can be used for depth estimations of general scenes with no geometric priors nor any extra information injected. In our case, the integral of the partition function can be analytically calculated, thus we can exactly solve the log-likelihood optimization. Moreover, solving the MAP problem for predicting depths of a new image is highly efficient as closed-form solutions exist. We experimentally demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art depth estimation methods on both indoor and outdoor scene datasets."

We take a supervised learning approach to this problem, in which we begin by collecting a training set of monocular images (of unstructured outdoor environments which include forests, trees, buildings, etc.) and their corresponding ground-truth depthmaps. Then, we apply supervised learning to predict the depthmap as a function of the image. Depth estimation is a challenging problem, since local features alone are insufficient to estimate depth at a point, and one needs to consider the global context of the image. Our model uses a discriminatively-trained Markov Random Field (MRF) that incorporates multiscale local- and global-image features, and models both depths at individual points as well as the relation between depths at different points. We show that, even on unstructured scenes, our algorithm is frequently able to recover fairly accurate depthmaps."

While for stereo images local correspondence suffices for estimation, finding depth relations from a single image is less straightforward, requiring integration of both global and local information from various cues. Moreover, the task is inherently ambiguous, with a large source of uncertainty coming from the overall scale. In this paper, we present a new method that addresses this task by employing two deep network stacks: one that makes a coarse global prediction based on the entire image, and another that refines this prediction locally. We also apply a scale-invariant error to help measure depth relations rather than scale. By leveraging the raw datasets as large sources of training data, our method achieves state-of-the-art results on both NYU Depth and KITTI, and matches detailed depth boundaries without the need for superpixelation."

The mapping is represented as a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) [15] that takes the low-resolution image as the input and outputs the high-resolution one. We further show that traditional sparse-coding-based SR methods can also be viewed as a deep convolutional network. But unlike traditional methods that handle each component separately, our method jointly optimizes all layers. Our deep CNN has a lightweight structure, yet demonstrates state-of-the-art restoration quality, and achieves fast speed for practical on-line usage."

This is a challenging task, since a single image on its own does not provide any depth cue. To address this, we exploit the availability of a pool of images for which the depth is known. More specifically, we formulate monocular depth estimation as a discrete-continuous optimization problem, where the continuous variables encode the depth of the superpixels in the input image, and the discrete ones represent relationships between neighboring superpixels. The solution to this discrete-continuous optimization problem is then obtained by performing inference in a graphical model using particle belief propagation. The unary potentials in this graphical model are computed by making use of the images with known depth. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in both the indoor and outdoor scenarios. Our experimental evaluation shows that our depth estimates are more accurate than existing methods on standard datasets."

Nevertheless, it is still unclear how different CNN methods compare with each other and with previous state-of-the-art shallow representations such as the Bag-of-Visual-Words and the Improved Fisher Vector. This paper conducts a rigorous evaluation of these new techniques, exploring different deep architectures and comparing them on a common ground, identifying and disclosing important implementation details. We identify several useful properties of CNN-based representations, including the fact that the dimensionality of the CNN output layer can be reduced significantly without having an adverse effect on performance. We also identify aspects of deep and shallow methods that can be successfully shared. In particular, we show that the data augmentation techniques commonly applied to CNN-based methods can also be applied to shallow methods, and result in an analogous performance boost. Source code and models to reproduce the experiments in the paper is made publicly available."

Our main contribution is a thorough evaluation of networks of increasing depth using an architecture with very small (3x3) convolution filters, which shows that a significant improvement on the prior-art configurations can be achieved by pushing the depth to 16-19 weight layers. These findings were the basis of our ImageNet Challenge 2014 submission, where our team secured the first and the second places in the localisation and classification tracks respectively. We also show that our representations generalise well to other datasets, where they achieve state-of-the-art results. We have made our two best-performing ConvNet models publicly available to facilitate further research on the use of deep visual representations in computer vision."

Both can quickly and accurately predict the 3D positions of body joints from a single depth image without using any temporal information. The key to both approaches is the use of a large, realistic, and highly varied synthetic set of training images. This allows us to learn models that are largely invariant to factors such as pose, body shape, field-of-view cropping, and clothing. Our first approach employs an intermediate body parts representation, designed so that an accurate per-pixel classification of the parts will localize the joints of the body. The second approach instead directly regresses the positions of body joints. By using simple depth pixel comparison features and parallelizable decision forests, both approaches can run super-real time on consumer hardware. Our evaluation investigates many aspects of our methods, and compares the approaches to each other and to the state of the art. Results on silhouettes suggest broader applicability to other imaging modalities."

Unlike traditional approaches [18, 19], which attempt to map from appearance features to depth directly, we first perform a semantic segmentation of the scene and use the semantic labels to guide the 3D reconstruction. This approach provides several advantages: By knowing the semantic class of a pixel or region, depth and geometry constraints can be easily enforced (e.g., \u201csky\u201d is far away and \u201cground\u201d is horizontal). In addition, depth can be more readily predicted by measuring the difference in appearance with respect to a given semantic class. For example, a tree will have more uniform appearance in the distance than it does close up. Finally, the incorporation of semantic features allows us to achieve state-of-the-art results with a significantly simpler model than previous works."

We propose a method that uses a multiscale convolutional network trained from raw pixels to extract dense feature vectors that encode regions of multiple sizes centered on each pixel. The method alleviates the need for engineered features, and produces a powerful representation that captures texture, shape, and contextual information. We report results using multiple postprocessing methods to produce the final labeling. Among those, we propose a technique to automatically retrieve, from a pool of segmentation components, an optimal set of components that best explain the scene; these components are arbitrary, for example, they can be taken from a segmentation tree or from any family of oversegmentations. The system yields record accuracies on the SIFT Flow dataset (33 classes) and the Barcelona dataset (170 classes) and near-record accuracy on Stanford background dataset (eight classes), while being an order of magnitude faster than competing approaches, producing a 320\u00d7240 image labeling in less than a second, including feature extraction."

We demonstrate our technique in cases where past methods fail (non-translating cameras and dynamic scenes). Our technique is applicable to single images as well as videos. For videos, we use local motion cues to improve the inferred depth maps, while optical flow is used to ensure temporal depth consistency. For training and evaluation, we use a Kinect-based system to collect a large data set containing stereoscopic videos with known depths. We show that our depth estimation technique outperforms the state-of-the-art on benchmark databases. Our technique can be used to automatically convert a monoscopic video into stereo for 3D visualization, and we demonstrate this through a variety of visually pleasing results for indoor and outdoor scenes, including results from the feature film Charade."

We show that convolutional networks by themselves, trained end-to-end, pixels-to-pixels, improve on the previous best result in semantic segmentation. Our key insight is to build \u201cfully convolutional\u201d networks that take input of arbitrary size and produce correspondingly-sized output with efficient inference and learning. We define and detail the space of fully convolutional networks, explain their application to spatially dense prediction tasks, and draw connections to prior models. We adapt contemporary classification networks (AlexNet, the VGG net, and GoogLeNet) into fully convolutional networks and transfer their learned representations by fine-tuning to the segmentation task. We then define a skip architecture that combines semantic information from a deep, coarse layer with appearance information from a shallow, fine layer to produce accurate and detailed segmentations. Our fully convolutional networks achieve improved segmentation of PASCAL VOC (30% relative improvement to 67.2% mean IU on 2012), NYUDv2, SIFT Flow, and PASCAL-Context, while inference takes one tenth of a second for a typical image."

The best-performing methods are complex ensemble systems that typically combine multiple low-level image features with high-level context. In this paper, we propose a simple and scalable detection algorithm that improves mean average precision (mAP) by more than 30% relative to the previous best result on VOC 2012 -- achieving a mAP of 53.3%. Our approach combines two key insights: (1) one can apply high-capacity convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to bottom-up region proposals in order to localize and segment objects and (2) when labeled training data is scarce, supervised pre-training for an auxiliary task, followed by domain-specific fine-tuning, yields a significant performance boost. Since we combine region proposals with CNNs, we call our method R-CNN: Regions with CNN features. We also present experiments that provide insight into what the network learns, revealing a rich hierarchy of image features. Source code for the complete system is available at http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~rbg/rcnn."

This poses a serious bottleneck for many image manipulation, editing, and retrieval tasks. In this paper we consider the problem of adding depth to an image of an object, effectively 'lifting' it back to 3D, by exploiting a collection of aligned 3D models of related objects. Our key insight is that, even when the imaged object is not contained in the shape collection, the network of shapes implicitly characterizes a shape-specific deformation subspace that regularizes the problem and enables robust diffusion of depth information from the shape collection to the input image. We evaluate our fully automatic approach on diverse and challenging input images, validate the results against Kinect depth readings, and demonstrate several imaging applications including depth-enhanced image editing and image relighting."

On the test data, we achieved top-1 and top-5 error rates of 37.5% and 17.0%, respectively, which is considerably better than the previous state-of-the-art. The neural network, which has 60 million parameters and 650,000 neurons, consists of five convolutional layers, some of which are followed by max-pooling layers, and three fully connected layers with a final 1000-way softmax. To make training faster, we used non-saturating neurons and a very efficient GPU implementation of the convolution operation. To reduce overfitting in the fully connected layers we employed a recently developed regularization method called \"dropout\" that proved to be very effective. We also entered a variant of this model in the ILSVRC-2012 competition and achieved a winning top-5 test error rate of 15.3%, compared to 26.2% achieved by the second-best entry."

This paper adds to the mounting evidence that this is indeed the case. We report on a series of experiments conducted for different recognition tasks using the publicly available code and model of the OverFeat network which was trained to perform object classification on ILSVRC13. We use features extracted from the OverFeat network as a generic image representation to tackle the diverse range of recognition tasks of object image classification, scene recognition, fine grained recognition, attribute detection and image retrieval applied to a diverse set of datasets. We selected these tasks and datasets as they gradually move further away from the original task and data the OverFeat network was trained to solve. Astonishingly, we report consistent superior results compared to the highly tuned state-of-the-art systems in all the visual classification tasks on various datasets. For instance retrieval it consistently outperforms low memory footprint methods except for sculptures dataset. The results are achieved using a linear SVM classifier (or L2 distance in case of retrieval) applied to a feature representation of size 4096 extracted from a layer in the net. The representations are further modified using simple augmentation techniques e.g. jittering. The results strongly suggest that features obtained from deep learning with convolutional nets should be the primary candidate in most visual recognition tasks."

This is the main message of this paper, which introduces an automated pipeline with pixels as inputs and 3D surfaces of various rigid categories as outputs in images of realistic scenes. At the core of our approach are deformable 3D models that can be learned from 2D annotations available in existing object detection datasets, that can be driven by noisy automatic object segmentations and which we complement with a bottom-up module for recovering high-frequency shape details. We perform a comprehensive quantitative analysis and ablation study of our approach using the recently introduced PASCAL 3D+ dataset and show very encouraging automatic reconstructions on PASCAL VOC."

In this paper, we show that we can use this property to reduce the learning of a pixel-wise depth classifier to a much simpler classifier predicting only the likelihood of a pixel being at an arbitrarily fixed canonical depth. The likelihoods for any other depths can be obtained by applying the same classifier after appropriate image manipulations. Such transformation of the problem to the canonical depth removes the training data bias towards certain depths and the effect of perspective. The approach can be straight-forwardly generalized to multiple semantic classes, improving both depth estimation and semantic segmentation performance by directly targeting the weaknesses of independent approaches. Conditioning the semantic label on the depth provides a way to align the data to their physical scale, allowing to learn a more discriminative classifier. Conditioning depth on the semantic class helps the classifier to distinguish between ambiguities of the otherwise ill-posed problem. We tested our algorithm on the KITTI road scene dataset and NYU2 indoor dataset and obtained obtained results that significantly outperform current state-of-the-art in both single-view depth and semantic segmentation domain."

The main hallmark of this architecture is the improved utilization of the computing resources inside the network. By a carefully crafted design, we increased the depth and width of the network while keeping the computational budget constant. To optimize quality, the architectural decisions were based on the Hebbian principle and the intuition of multi-scale processing. One particular incarnation used in our submission for ILSVRC14 is called GoogLeNet, a 22 layers deep network, the quality of which is assessed in the context of classification and detection."

We show how a multiscale and sliding window approach can be efficiently implemented within a ConvNet. We also introduce a novel deep learning approach to localization by learning to predict object boundaries. Bounding boxes are then accumulated rather than suppressed in order to increase detection confidence. We show that different tasks can be learned simultaneously using a single shared network. This integrated framework is the winner of the localization task of the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge 2013 (ILSVRC2013) and obtained very competitive results for the detection and classifications tasks. In post-competition work, we establish a new state of the art for the detection task. Finally, we release a feature extractor from our best model called OverFeat."

Common cases of this include pictures taken from inside a vehicle, or outdoor security cameras mounted inside a protective enclosure. At capture time, defocus can be used to remove the artifacts, but this relies on achieving a shallow depth-of-field and placement of the camera close to the window. Instead, we present a post-capture image processing solution that can remove localized rain and dirt artifacts from a single image. We collect a dataset of clean/corrupted image pairs which are then used to train a specialized form of convolutional neural network. This learns how to map corrupted image patches to clean ones, implicitly capturing the characteristic appearance of dirt and water droplets in natural images. Our models demonstrate effective removal of dirt and rain in outdoor test conditions."

Most existing work ignores physical interactions or is applied only to tidy rooms and hallways. Our goal is to parse typical, often messy, indoor scenes into floor, walls, supporting surfaces, and object regions, and to recover support relationships. One of our main interests is to better understand how 3D cues can best inform a structured 3D interpretation. We also contribute a novel integer programming formulation to infer physical support relations. We offer a new dataset of 1449 RGBD images, capturing 464 diverse indoor scenes, with detailed annotations. Our experiments demonstrate our ability to infer support relations in complex scenes and verify that our 3D scene cues and inferred support lead to better object segmentation."

The scenarios are diverse, capturing real-world traffic situations, and range from freeways over rural areas to inner-city scenes with many static and dynamic objects. Our data is calibrated, synchronized and timestamped, and we provide the rectified and raw image sequences. Our dataset also contains object labels in the form of 3D tracklets, and we provide online benchmarks for stereo, optical flow, object detection and other tasks.

Such a database is useful for a variety of applications, including training systems for object detection and validation of 3D output. We build such a database from images that have been annotated with only the identity of objects and their spatial extent in images. Important for this task is the recovery of geometric information that is implicit in the object labels, such as qualitative relationships between objects (attachment, support, occlusion) and quantitative ones (inferring camera parameters). We describe a model that integrates cues extracted from the object labels to infer the implicit geometric information. We show that we are able to obtain high quality 3D information by evaluating the proposed approach on a database obtained with a laser range scanner. Finally, given the database of 3D scenes, we show how it can find better scene matches for an unlabeled image by expanding the database through viewpoint interpolation to unseen views."

In this paper we present continuous conditional neural fields (CCNF) \u2013 a novel structured regression model that can learn non-linear input-output dependencies, and model temporal and spatial output relationships of varying length sequences. We propose two instances of our CCNF framework: Chain-CCNF for time series modelling, and Grid-CCNF for spatial relationship modelling. We evaluate our model on five public datasets spanning three different regression problems: facial landmark detection in the wild, emotion prediction in music and facial action unit recognition. Our CCNF model demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on all of the datasets used."

Using perspective cues from the global scene geometry, we first develop a 3D based object detector. This detector is competitive with an image based detector built using state-of-the-art methods; however, combining the two produces a notably improved detector, because it unifies contextual and geometric information. We then use a probabilistic model that explicitly uses constraints imposed by spatial layout - the locations of walls and floor in the image - to refine the 3D object estimates. We use an existing approach to compute spatial layout [1], and use constraints such as objects are supported by floor and can not stick through the walls. The resulting detector (a) has significantly improved accuracy when compared to the state-of-the-art 2D detectors and (b) gives a 3D interpretation of the location of the object, derived from a 2D image. We evaluate the detector on beds, for which we give extensive quantitative results derived from images of real scenes."

Graphical models are used to generate a small (5-30) set of diverse segmentations proposals, such that this set has high recall. Since the number of required proposals is so low, we can extract fairly complex features to rank them. Our complex feature of choice is a novel CNN called SegNet, which directly outputs a (coarse) semantic segmentation. Importantly, SegNet is specifically trained to optimize the corpus-level PASCAL IOU loss function. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first CNN specifically designed for semantic segmentation. This two-module approach achieves $52.5\\%$ on the PASCAL 2012 segmentation challenge."

It is based on a two-scale decomposition of the image into a base layer, encoding large-scale variations, and a detail layer. Only the base layer has its contrast reduced, thereby preserving detail. The base layer is obtained using an edge-preserving filter called the bilateral filter. This is a non-linear filter, where the weight of each pixel is computed using a Gaussian in the spatial domain multiplied by an influence function in the intensity domain that decreases the weight of pixels with large intensity differences. We express bilateral filtering in the framework of robust statistics and show how it relates to anisotropic diffusion. We then accelerate bilateral filtering by using a piecewise-linear approximation in the intensity domain and appropriate subsampling. This results in a speed-up of two orders of magnitude. The method is fast and requires no parameter setting."

In an effort to understand the benefits and drawbacks of existing methods, we empirically compare five state-of-the-art superpixel algorithms for their ability to adhere to image boundaries, speed, memory efficiency, and their impact on segmentation performance. We then introduce a new superpixel algorithm, simple linear iterative clustering (SLIC), which adapts a k-means clustering approach to efficiently generate superpixels. Despite its simplicity, SLIC adheres to boundaries as well as or better than previous methods. At the same time, it is faster and more memory efficient, improves segmentation performance, and is straightforward to extend to supervoxel generation."

Inspired by the \"Blocks World\" work in the 1960's, we present a qualitative physical representation of an outdoor scene where objects have volume and mass, and relationships describe 3D structure and mechanical configurations. Our representation allows us to apply powerful global geometric constraints between 3D volumes as well as the laws of statics in a qualitative manner. We also present a novel iterative \"interpretation-by-synthesis\" approach where, starting from an empty ground plane, we progressively \"build up\" a physically-plausible 3D interpretation of the image. For surface layout estimation, our method demonstrates an improvement in performance over the state-of-the-art [9]. But more importantly, our approach automatically generates 3D parse graphs which describe qualitative geometric and mechanical properties of objects and relationships between objects within an image."

Most of the CRF research has been done on structured classification where the outputs are discrete. In this study we propose a CRF probabilistic model for structured regression that uses multiple non-structured predictors as its features. We construct features as squared prediction errors and show that this results in a Gaussian predictor. Learning becomes a convex optimization problem leading to a global solution for a set of parameters. Inference can be conveniently conducted through matrix computation. Experimental results on the remote sensing problem of estimating Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) provide strong evidence that the proposed CRF model successfully exploits the inherent spatio-temporal properties of AOD data. The experiments revealed that CRF are more accurate than the baseline neural network and domain-based predictors."

Using more expressive representation would result in dense graphs, making these methods impractical for large-scale applications. To address this issue, we propose an effective CRF model with linear scale-up properties regarding approximate learning and inference for structured regression on large, fully connected graphs. The proposed method is validated on real-world large-scale problems of image de-noising and remote sensing. In conducted experiments, we demonstrated that dense connectivity provides an improvement in prediction accuracy. Inference time of less than ten seconds on graphs with millions of nodes and trillions of edges makes the proposed model an attractive tool for large-scale, structured regression problems.\n \n"

Conventional learning to rank methods are usually designed for 'local ranking', in the sense that the ranking model is defined on a single object, for example, a document in information retrieval. For many applications, this is a very loose approximation. Relations always exist between objects and it is better to define the ranking model as a function on all the objects to be ranked (i.e., the relations are also included). This paper refers to the problem as global ranking and proposes employing a Continuous Conditional Random Fields (CRF) for conducting the learning task. The Continuous CRF model is defined as a conditional probability distribution over ranking scores of objects conditioned on the objects. It can naturally represent the content information of objects as well as the relation information between objects, necessary for global ranking. Taking two specific information retrieval tasks as examples, the paper shows how the Continuous CRF method can perform global ranking better than baselines."

Conditional random fields offer several advantages over hidden Markov models and stochastic grammars for such tasks, including the ability to relax strong independence assumptions made in those models. Conditional random fields also avoid a fundamental limitation of maximum entropy Markov models (MEMMs) and other discriminative Markov models based on directed graphical models, which can be biased towards states with few successor states. We present iterative parameter estimation algorithms for conditional random fields and compare the performance of the resulting models to HMMs and MEMMs on synthetic and natural-language data."

Well-known examples include the kernel density estimate (KDE) for density estimation and the support vector machine (SVM) for classification. We propose a kernel classifier that optimizes the L2 or integrated squared error (ISE) of a \u201cdifference of densities\u201d. We focus on the Gaussian kernel, although the method applies to other kernels suitable for density estimation. Like a support vector machine (SVM), the classifier is sparse and results from solving a quadratic program. We provide statistical performance guarantees for the proposed L2 kernel classifier in the form of a finite sample oracle inequality, and strong consistency in the sense of both ISE and probability of error. A special case of our analysis applies to a previously introduced ISE-based method for kernel density estimation. For dimensionality greater than 15, the basic L2 kernel classifier performs poorly in practice. Thus, we extend the method through the introduction of a natural regularization parameter, which allows it to remain competitive with the SVM in high dimensions. Simulation results for both synthetic and real-world data are presented."
