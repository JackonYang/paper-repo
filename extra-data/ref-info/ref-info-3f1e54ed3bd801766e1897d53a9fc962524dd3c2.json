We also address this problem when distances are measured by the L1 norm and in the Hamming cube. Significantly improving and extending recent results ofKleinberg, we construct data structures whose size is polynomial in the size ofthe database and search algorithms that run in time nearly linear or nearly quadratic in the dimension.

In many practical search problems however, the underlying metric is non-Euclidean. Nearest neighbor algorithms for general metric spaces are quite weak, which motivates a search for other classes of metric spaces that can be tractably searched.In this paper, we develop an efficient dynamic data structure for nearest neighbor queries in growth-constrained metrics. These metrics satisfy the property that for any point q and number r the ratio between numbers of points in balls of radius 2r and r is bounded by a constant. Spaces of this kind may occur in networking applications, such as the Internet or Peer-to-peer networks, and vector quantization applications, where feature vectors fall into low-dimensional manifolds within high-dimensional vector spaces."

We introduce the idea of aggressive pruning and give a family of practical algorithms, an idealized analysis, and describe experiments. Our main result is that search complexity measured in terms of d-dimensional inner product operations, is i) strongly sublinear with respect to the data set size n for moderate R, ii) asymptotically, and as a practical matter, independent of dimension. Given a random data set, a random query within distance 2Rv/d of some database element, and a randomly constructed data structure, the search succeeds with a specified probability, which is a parameter of the search algorithm. On average a search performs ~-. n p distance computations where n is the number of points in the database, and p < 1 is calculated in our analysis. Linear and near-linear space structures are described, and our algorithms and analysis are free of large hidden constants, i.e. the algorithms perform far less work than exhaustive search both in theory and practice. This paper focuses on uniform distributions and Euclidean space, but we believe our ideas may contribute to improved general purpose algorithms for high dimensions."

                "text": "Representing data as points in a high-dimensional space, so as to use geometric methods for indexing, is an algorithmic technique with a wide array of uses. It is central to a number of areas such as information retrieval, pattern recognition, and statistical data analysis; many of the problems arising in these applications can involve several hundred or several thousand dimensions. We consider the nearest-neighbor problem for d-dimensional Euclidean space: we wish to pre-process a database of n points so that given a query point, one can efficiently determine its nearest neighbors in the database. There is a large literature on algorithms for this problem, in both the exact and approximate cases. The more sophisticated algorithms typically achieve a query time that is logarithmic in n at the expense of an exponential dependence on the dimension d; indeed, even the averagecase analysis of heuristics such as k-d trees reveals an exponential dependence on d in the query time. In this work, we develop a new approach to the nearest-neighbor problem, based on a method for combining randomly chosen one-dimensional projections of the underlying point set. From this, we obtain the following two results. (i) An algorithm for finding e-approximate nearest neighbors with a query time of O((d log d)(d + log n)). (ii) An e-approximate nearest-neighbor algorithm with near-linear storage and a query time that improves asymptotically on linear search in all dimensions. \u2217Department of Computer Science, Cornell University, Ithaca NY 14853.

Of late, there has been increasing interest in building search/index structures for performing similarity search over high-dimensional data, e.g., image databases, document collections, time-series databases, and genome databases. Unfortunately, all known techniques for solving this problem fall prey to the \\curse of dimensionality.\" That is, the data structures scale poorly with data dimensionality; in fact, if the number of dimensions exceeds 10 to 20, searching in k-d trees and related structures involves the inspection of a large fraction of the database, thereby doing no better than brute-force linear search. It has been suggested that since the selection of features and the choice of a distance metric in typical applications is rather heuristic, determining an approximate nearest neighbor should su ce for most practical purposes. In this paper, we examine a novel scheme for approximate similarity search based on hashing. The basic idea is to hash the points Supported by NAVY N00014-96-1-1221 grant and NSF Grant IIS-9811904.

Given a set S of n sites (points), and a distance measure d , the nearestneighborsearching problem is to build a data structure so that given a query point q , the site nearest to q can be found quickly. This paper gives data structures for this problem when the sites and queries are in a metric space. One data structure, D(S) , uses a divide-and-conquer recursion. The other data structure, M(S,Q) , is somewhat like a skiplist. Both are simple and implementable. The data structures are analyzed when the metric space obeys a certain sphere-packing bound, and when the sites and query points are random and have distributions with an exchangeability property. This property implies, for example, that query point q is a random element of \n $ S\\cup\\{q\\} $ . Under these conditions, the preprocessing and space bounds for the algorithms are close to linear in n . They depend also on the sphere-packing bound, and on the logarithm of the distanceratio\n $ \\Upsilon(S) $ of S , the ratio of the distance between the farthest pair of points in S to the distance between the closest pair. The data structure M(S,Q) requires as input data an additional set Q , taken to be representative of the query points. The resource bounds of M(S,Q) have a dependence on the distance ratio of S\n $\\cup$ Q . While M(S,Q) can return wrong answers, its failure probability can be bounded, and is decreasing in a parameter K . Here K\u2264 |Q|/n is chosen when building M(S,Q) . The expected query time for M(S,Q) is O(Klog\u00a0 n)log\u00a0\n$\\Upsilon(S\\cup Q)$ , and the resource bounds increase linearly in K . The data structure D(S) has expected O( log n)O(1) query time, for fixed distance ratio. The preprocessing algorithm for M(S,Q) can be used to solve the all nearest neighbor problem for S in O(n(log\u00a0 n)2(log\u00a0\u03d2(S))2) expected time."

Our data structure consists of a sequence of progressively finer \u03b5-nets of S, with pointers that allow us to navigate easily from one scale to the next.We analyze the worst-case complexity of this data structure in terms of the \"abstract dimensionality\" of the metric S. Our data structure is extremely efficient for metrics of bounded dimension and is essentially optimal in a certain model of distance computation. Finally, as a special case, our approach improves over one recently devised by Karger and Ruhl [KR02]."

Our methods are general since these distance computations can be applied to any mining or similarity algorithms that use L/sub p/ norms. A novelty of our distance computation procedures is that they work for any L/sub p/ norms, not only the traditional p = 2 or p = 1, but for all p /spl les/ 2; the choice of p, say fractional p, provides an interesting alternative similarity behavior! We use our algorithms in a detailed experimental study of the clustering patterns in real tabular data obtained from one of AT&T's data stores and show that our methods are substantially faster than straightforward methods while remaining highly accurate, and able to detect interesting patterns by varying the value of p."

In high dimensional space the data becomes sparse, and traditional indexing and algorithmic techniques fail from a efficiency and/or effectiveness perspective. Recent research results show that in high dimensional space, the concept of proximity, distance or nearest neighbor may not even be qualitatively meaningful. In this paper, we view the dimensionality curse from the point of view of the distance metrics which are used to measure the similarity between objects. We specifically examine the behavior of the commonly used L k norm and show that the problem of meaningfulness in high dimensionality is sensitive to the value of k. For example, this means that the Manhattan distance metric (L 1 norm) is consistently more preferable than the Euclidean distance metric (L 2 norm) for high dimensional data mining applications. Using the intuition derived from our analysis, we introduce and examine a natural extension of the L k norm to fractional distance metrics. We show that the fractional distance metric provides more meaningful results both from the theoretical and empirical perspective. The results show that fractional distance metrics can significantly improve the effectiveness of standard clustering algorithms such as the k-means algorithm."

Performing such comparisons entails finding many short local alignments between sequences up to tens of megabases in length. To process such long sequences efficiently, existing algorithms find alignments by expanding around short runs of matching bases with no substitutions or other differences. Unfortunately, exact matches that are short enough to occur often in significant alignments also occur frequently by chance in the background sequence. Thus, these algorithms must trade off between efficiency and sensitivity to features without long exact matches.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWe introduce a new algorithm, LSH-ALL-PAIRS, to find ungapped local alignments in genomic sequence with up to a specified fraction of substitutions. The length and substitution rate of these alignments can be chosen so that they appear frequently in significant similarities yet still remain rare in the background sequence. The algorithm finds ungapped alignments efficiently using a randomized search technique, locality-sensitive hashing. We have found LSH-ALL-PAIRS to be both efficient and sensitive for finding local similarities with as little as 63% identity in mammalian genomic sequences up to tens of megabases in length"

Although this phenomenon-known as the \u2018dimensional curse\u2019-is well known, little or no quantitative a.nalysis of the phenomenon is available. In this paper, we provide a detailed analysis of partitioning and clustering techniques for similarity search in HDVSs. We show formally that these methods exhibit linear complexity at high dimensionality, and that existing methods are outperformed on average by a simple sequential scan if the number of dimensions exceeds around 10. Consequently, we come up with an alternative organization based on approximations to make the unavoidable sequential scan as fast as possible. We describe a simple vector approximation scheme, called VA-file, and report on an experimental evaluation of this and of two tree-based index methods (an R*-tree and an X-tree)."

We show that under a broad set of conditions (much broader than independent and identically distributed dimensions), as dimensionality increases, the distance to the nearest data point approaches the distance to the farthest data point. To provide a practical perspective, we present empirical results on both real and synthetic data sets that demonstrate that this effect can occur for as few as 10-15 dimensions. \n \nThese results should not be interpreted to mean that high-dimensional indexing is never meaningful; we illustrate this point by identifying some high-dimensional workloads for which this effect does not occur. However, our results do emphasize that the methodology used almost universally in the database literature to evaluate high-dimensional indexing techniques is flawed, and should be modified. In particular, most such techniques proposed in the literature are not evaluated versus simple linear scan, and are evaluated over workloads for which nearest neighbor is not meaningful. Often, even the reported experiments, when analyzed carefully, show that linear scan would outperform the techniques being proposed on the workloads studied in high (10-15) dimensionality!"

In nearest neighbor searching, we are given a set of data points S in real d-dimensional space, R d , and are to build a data structure such that, given any query point q 2 R d , the nearest data point to q can be found eeciently. In general, we are given k 1, and are asked to return the k-nearest neighbors to q in S. In approximate nearest neighbor searching, an error bound 0 is also given. The search algorithm returns k distinct points of S, such that the ratio between the distance to the ith point reported and the true ith nearest neighbor is at most 1 +. Among the features of ANN are the following. It supports k-nearest neighbor searching, by specifying k with the query. It supports both exact and approximate nearest neighbor searching, by specifying an approximation factor 0 with the query. It supports all Minkowski distance metrics, including the L 1 (Manhattan), L 2 (Eu-clidean), and L 1 (Max) metrics. There are no exponential factors in space, implying that the data structure is practical even for very large data sets in high dimensional spaces, irrespective of. ANN is written as a testbed for a class of nearest neighbor searching algorithms, particularly those based on orthogonal decompositions of space. These include k-d trees 3, 4], balanced box-decomposition trees 2] and other related spatial data structures (see Samet 5]). The library supports a number of diierent methods for building search structures. It also supports two methods for searching these structures: standard tree-ordered search 1] and priority search 2]. In priority search, the cells of the data structure are visited in increasing order of distance from the query point. In addition to the library there are two programs provided for testing and evaluating the performance of various search methods. The rst, called ann test, provides a primitive script language that allows the user to generate data sets and query sets, either by reading from a le or randomly through the use of a number of built-in point distributions.

We study the use of delta compression in a somewhat different scenario, where we wish to compress a large collection of (more or less) related files by performing a sequence of pairwise delta compressions. The problem of finding an optimal delta encoding for a collection of files by taking pairwise deltas can be reduced to the problem of computing a branching of maximum weight in a weighted directed graph, but this solution is inefficient and thus does not scale to larger file collections. This motivates us to propose a framework for cluster-based delta compression that uses text clustering techniques to prune the graph of possible pairwise delta encodings. To demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, we present experimental results on collections of Web pages. Our experiments show that cluster-based delta compression of collections provides significant improvements in compression ratio as compared to individually compressing each file or using tar+gzip, at a moderate cost in efficiency."

In particular, the well-known a-priori algorithm is only effective when the only rules of interest are relationships that occur very frequently. However, there are a number of applications, such as data mining, identification of similar Web documents, clustering and collaborative filtering, where the rules of interest have comparatively few instances in the data. In these cases, we must look for highly correlated items, or possibly even causal relationships between infrequent items. We develop a family of algorithms for solving this problem, employing a combination of random sampling and hashing techniques.

                "text": "The field of algorithms for pairwise biosequence similarity search is dominated by heuristic methods of high efficiency but uncertain sensitivity. One reason that more formal string matching algorithms with sensitivity guarantees have not been applied to biosequences is that they cannot directly find similarities that score highly under substitution score functions such as the DNAPAM-TT [20], PAM [9], or BLOSUM [12] families of matrices. We describe a general technique, score simulation, to map ungapped similarity search problems using these score functions into the problem of finding pairs of strings that are close in Hamming space. Score simulation leads to indexing schemes for biosequences that permit efficient ungapped similarity searches with formal guarantees of sensitivity using arbitrary score functions. In particular, we introduce the lsh-all-pairs-sim algorithm for finding local similarities in large biosequence collections and show that it is both computationally feasible and sensitive in practice."

The most popular technique, k-means clustering, however, has two inherent limitations: the clusters are constrained to be spherically symmetric and their number has to be known a priori. In nonparametric clustering methods, like the one based on mean shift, these limitations are eliminated but the amount of computation becomes prohibitively large as the dimension of the space increases. We exploit a recently proposed approximation technique, locality-sensitive hashing (LSH), to reduce the computational complexity of adaptive mean shift. In our implementation of LSH the optimal parameters of the data structure are determined by a pilot learning procedure, and the partitions are data driven. As an application, the performance of mode and k-means based textons are compared in a texture classification study."

The algorithm tries to capture the intuitive notion of similarity perceived by humans: two pieces are similar if they are fully or partially based on the same score, even if they are performed by different people or at different speed. Local peaks in signal power are identified in each audio file, and a spectral vector is extracted near each peak. Nearby peaks are selectively grouped together to form \"characteristic sequences\" which are used as the basis for indexing. A hashing scheme known as \"locality-sensitive hashing\" is employed to index the high-dimensional vectors. Retrieval results are ranked based on the number of final matches filtered by some linearity criteria."

                "text": "In this article, we show several results obtained by combining the use of <i>stable distributions</i> with <i>pseudorandom generators for bounded space</i>. In particular:---We show that, for any <i>p</i> \u2208 (0, 2], one can maintain (using only <i>O</i>(log <i>n</i>/\u03b5<sup>2</sup>) words of storage) a <i>sketch</i> <i>C(q)</i> of a point <i>q</i> \u2208 <i>l</i><sup><i>n</i></sup><sub><i>p</i></sub> under dynamic updates of its coordinates. The sketch has the property that, given <i>C(q)</i> and <i>C(s)</i>, one can estimate \u2016<i>q</i> \u2212 <i>s</i>\u2016<sub><i>p</i></sub> up to a factor of (1 + \u03b5) with large probability. This solves the main open problem of Feigenbaum et al. [1999].---We show that the aforementioned sketching approach directly translates into an approximate algorithm that, for a fixed linear mapping <i>A</i>, and given <i>x</i> \u2208 \u211c<sup><i>n</i></sup> and <i>y</i> \u2208 \u211c<sup><i>m</i></sup>, estimates \u2016<i>Ax</i> \u2212 <i>y</i>\u2016<sub><i>p</i></sub> in <i>O</i>(<i>n</i> + <i>m</i>) time, for any <i>p</i> \u2208 (0, 2]. This generalizes an earlier algorithm of Wasserman and Blum [1997] which worked for the case <i>p</i> = 2.---We obtain another sketch function <i>C</i>\u2032 which probabilistically embeds <i>l</i><sup><i>n</i></sup><sub>1</sub> into a <i>normed space</i> <i>l</i><sup><i>m</i></sup><sub>1</sub>. The embedding guarantees that, if we set <i>m</i> = log(1/\u0394)<sup><i>O</i>(1/\u03b5)</sup>, then for any pair of points <i>q</i>, <i>s</i> \u2208 <i>l</i><sup><i>n</i></sup><sub>1</sub>, the distance between <i>q</i> and <i>s</i> does not <i>increase</i> by more than (1 + \u03b5) with constant probability, and it does not <i>decrease</i> by more than (1 \u2212 \u03b5) with probability 1 \u2212 \u0394. This is the only known dimensionality reduction theorem for the <i>l</i><sub>1</sub> norm. In fact, stronger theorems of this type (i.e., that guarantee very low probability of expansion as well as of contraction) cannot exist [Brinkman and Charikar 2003].---We give an explicit embedding of <i>l</i><sup><i>n</i></sup><sub>2</sub> into <i>l</i><sup><i>n</i><sup><i>O</i>(log <i>n</i>)</sup></sup><sub>1</sub> with distortion (1 + 1/<i>n</i><sup>\u0398(1)</sup>)."

Content publishers such as Disney and Sony Records therefore expect to lose several billions of dollars in copyright revenues over the next few years. To address this problem, we propose building a copy detection system (CDS), where content publishers will register their valuable digital content. The CDS then crawls the web, compares the web content to the registered content, and notifies the content owners of illegal copies. In this dissertation, we discuss how to build such a system so it is accurate, scalable (e.g., to hundreds of gigabytes of data, or millions of web pages) and resilient to \u201cattacks\u201d (e.g., copying a resampled audio clip) from cyber-pirates. We also discuss two prototype CDS systems we have built as \u201cproofs of concept:\u201d (1)\u00a0SCAM (Stanford Copy Analysis Mechanism) for text documents, and (2)\u00a0DECEIVE (Detecting Copies of Internet Video) for video sequences."

This stable random variable is a continuous function of each of the uniform random variables, and of \u03b1 and a modified skewness parameter \u03b2' throughout their respective permissible ranges."

In particular, the well-known a priori algorithm is only effective when the only rules of interest are relationships that occur very frequently. However, there are a number of applications, such as data mining, identification of similar Web documents, clustering, and collaborative filtering, where the rules of interest have comparatively few instances in the data. In these cases, we must look for highly correlated items, or possibly even causal relationships between infrequent items. We develop a family of algorithms for solving this problem, employing a combination of random sampling and hashing techniques. We provide analysis of the algorithms developed and conduct experiments on real and synthetic data to obtain a comparative performance analysis."

As recent results show, however, the problem is a very di cult one, not only with regards to the performance issue but also to the quality issue. In this paper, we discuss the quality issue and identify a new generalized notion of nearest neighbor search as the relevant problem in high dimensional space. In contrast to previous approaches, our new notion of nearest neighbor search does not treat all dimensions equally but uses a quality criterion to select relevant dimensions (projections) with respect to the given query. As an example for a useful quality criterion, we rate how well the data is clustered around the query point within the selected projection. We then propose an e cient and e ective algorithm to solve the generalized nearest neighbor problem. Our experiments based on a number of real and synthetic data sets show that our new approach provides new insights into the nature of nearest neighbor search on high"
