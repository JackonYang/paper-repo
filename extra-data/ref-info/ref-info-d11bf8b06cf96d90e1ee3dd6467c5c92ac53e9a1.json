This equation is parameterized by the object's position and orientation with respect to the observer.

RANSAC is capable of interpreting/smoothing data containing a significant percentage of gross errors, and is thus ideally suited for applications in automated image analysis where interpretation is based on the data provided by error-prone feature detectors. A major portion of this paper describes the application of RANSAC to the Location Determination Problem (LDP): Given an image depicting a set of landmarks with known locations, determine that point in space from which the image was obtained. In response to a RANSAC requirement, new results are derived on the minimum number of landmarks needed to obtain a solution, and algorithms are presented for computing these minimum-landmark solutions in closed form. These results provide the basis for an automatic system that can solve the LDP under difficult viewing"

We analyze the task requirements in terms of what information needs to be represented, how to represent it, what kind of paradigms can be used to process it, and how to implement the paradigms. We describe shape surfaces by curves and patches, which we represent by linear primitives, such as points, lines, and planes. Next we describe algo rithms to construct this representation from range data. We then propose the paradigm of recognizing objects while locat ing them. We analyze the basic constraint of rigidity that can be exploited, which we implement as a prediction and verifi cation scheme that makes efficient use of the representation. Results are presented for data obtained from a laser range finder, but both the shape representation and the matching algorithm are general and can be used for other types of data, such as ultrasound, stereo, and tactile."

The objects are modeled as polyhedra having up to six degrees of freedom relative to the sensors. We show that inconsistent hypotheses about pairings between sensed points and object surfaces can be discarded efficiently by using local constraints on distances between faces, angles between face normals, and angles (relative to the surface normals) of vectors between sensed points. We show by simu lation and by mathematical bounds that the number of hy potheses consistent with these constraints is small. We also show how to recover the position and orientation of the object from the sensory data. The algorithm's performance on data obtained from a triangulation range sensor is illustrated."

Its principle is based on the interpretation of a triplet of any image lines as the perspective projection of a triplet of linear ridges of the object model, and on the search for the model attitude consistent with these projections. The geometrical transformations to be applied to the model to bring it into the corresponding location are obtained by the resolution of an eight-degree equation in the general case. Using simple logical rules, it is shown on examples related to polyhedra that this approach leads to results useful for both location and recognition of 3D objects because few admissible hypotheses are retained from the interpolation of the three line segments. Line matching by the prediction-verification procedure is thus less complex. >"

With this method, the computations of the rotation matrix and the translation vector of the camera are separable. First, the rotation matrix is found by a linear algorithm using eight or more line correspondences, or by a nonlinear algorithm using three or more line correspondences, where the line correspondences are either given or derived from point correspondences. Then, the translation vector is obtained by solving a set of linear equations based on three or more line correspondences, or two or more point correspondences. Eight 2-D to 3-D line correspondences or six 2-D to 3-D point correspondences are needed for the linear approach; three 2-D to 3-D line or point correspondences for the nonlinear approach. Good results can be obtained in the presence of noise if more than the minimum required number of correspondences are used. >"

A simplified linear solution and a robust solution to the 2D-perspective-projection-2D-perspective-projection pose-estimation problem are also given. Simulation experiments consisting of millions of trials with varying numbers of pairs of corresponding points and varying signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) with either Gaussian or uniform noise provide data suggesting that accurate inference of rotation and translation with noisy data may require corresponding point data sets with hundreds of corresponding point pairs when the SNR is less than 40 dB.

This gives a set of k observed segments. These segments have to be matched to the n segments in the model. This matching process can be viewed as a search through an \"interpretation tree\" containing (n + l) nodes . For any reasonable values of k and n, this tree contains a very large number of nodes. A sophisticated search strategy is needed to complete this search in a reasonable time. The search strategy developed by Lowe starts by grouping the observed line segments into significant multisegment structures called perceptual groups. These \"observed\" groups are then matched to groups known to exist in the model. By initially matching groups instead of individual segments, the interpretation tree is pruned to a huge extent. Furthermore, since perceptual groups containing three or more segments are used to initialize the search, at each stage of the search it is possible to solve for the object's pose parameters (i.e. location and orientation). Using this estimate of pose, the position of each model segment's image can be predicted. Subbranches of the interpretation tree are only considered if the observed segments are in close proximity to the predicted image of their assigned model segment. These two factors lead to a very efficient search strategy."

The 3-D sensor system consists of a camera using a position-sensitive device and multiple LEDs ( light emitting diode) attached to robotic devices, such as a robot's hand and a teaching device. 3-D pose of these devices is calculated in real time based on both two-dimensional coordinate values of the LEDs in an image plane of the camera and geometrical relationships among 3-D positions of the LEDs. The 3-D sensor system has the advantages of simplicity and practical usefulness for obtain ing 3-D information about robotic devices at high speed. We describe the experimental results of applications to visual detection of a robot's hand position and orientation, teaching of robot paths with a robot language system, and modeling of robot environments using the stereo-vision method."

                "text": "A theory of edge detection is presented. The analysis proceeds in two parts. (1) Intensity changes, which occur in a natural image over a wide range of scales, are detected separately at different scales. An appropriate filter for this purpose at a given scale is found to be the second derivative of a Gaussian, and it is shown that, provided some simple conditions are satisfied, these primary filters need not be orientation-dependent. Thus, intensity changes at a given scale are best detected by finding the zero values of \u22072G(x, y)* I(x, y) for image I, where G(x, y) is a two-dimensional Gaussian distribution and \u22072 is the Laplacian. The intensity changes thus discovered in each of the channels are then represented by oriented primitives called zero-crossing segments, and evidence is given that this representation is complete. (2) Intensity changes in images arise from surface discontinuities or from reflectance or illumination boundaries, and these all have the property that they are spatially localized. Because of this, the zero-crossing segments from the different channels are not independent, and rules are deduced for combining them into a description of the image. This description is called the raw primal sketch. The theory explains several basic psychophysical findings, and the operation of forming oriented zero-crossing segments from the output of centre-surround \u22072G filters acting on the image forms the basis for a physiological model of simple cells (see Marr & Ullman 1979)."

This failure of the standard method to improve the initial solution has received some notice in statistical applications of least squares3 and has been encountered rather frequently in connection with certain engineering applications involving the approximate representation of one function by another. The purpose of this article is to show how the problem may be solved by an extension of the standard method which insures improvement of the initial solution.4 The process can also be used for solving non-linear simultaneous equations, in which case it may be considered an extension of Newton's method. Let the function to be approximated be h{x, y, z, \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 ), and let the approximating function be H{oc, y, z, \u2022 \u2022 \u25a0 ; a, j3, y, \u25a0 \u2022 \u25a0 ), where a, /3, 7, \u2022 \u25a0 \u25a0 are the unknown parameters.

                "text": "The theory of visual perception that Irvin Rock develops and supports in this book with numerous original experiments, views perception as the outcome of a process of unconscious inference, problem solving, and the building of structural descriptions of the external world. It is a radical departure from his earlier work and contrasts with traditional perceptual theories like those of James J. Gibson or the Gestalt view.Rock experiments with a series of phenomena, like motion perception, illusory contours, and size and brightness constancy, and shows that they can be understood in terms of the knowledge applied by the visual system to the interpretation of the retinal image. His work largely complements that being done in artificial intelligence, demonstrating that the visual system is far more subtle and intelligent in many tasks which have not yet been modelled on the computer.Irvin Rock, a noted investigator of perceptual phenomena for nearly three decades, is Professor of Psychology at Rutgers University."
