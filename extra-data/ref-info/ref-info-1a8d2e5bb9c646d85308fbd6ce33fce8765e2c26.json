                "text": "The hope that mathematical methods employed in the investigation of formal logic would lead to purely computational methods for obtaining mathematical theorems goes back to Leibniz and has been revived by Peano around the turn of the century and by Hilbert's school in the 1920's. Hilbert, noting that all of classical mathematics could be formalized within quantification theory, declared that the problem of finding an algorithm for determining whether or not a given formula of quantification theory is valid was the central problem of mathematical logic. And indeed, at one time it seemed as if investigations of this \u201cdecision\u201d problem were on the verge of success. However, it was shown by Church and by Turing that such an algorithm can not exist. This result led to considerable pessimism regarding the possibility of using modern digital computers in deciding significant mathematical questions. However, recently there has been a revival of interest in the whole question. Specifically, it has been realized that while no decision procedure exists for quantification theory there are many proof procedures available\u2014that is, uniform procedures which will ultimately locate a proof for any formula of quantification theory which is valid but which will usually involve seeking \u201cforever\u201d in the case of a formula which is not valid\u2014and that some of these proof procedures could well turn out to be feasible for use with modern computing machinery.\n Hao Wang [9] and P. C. Gilmore [3] have each produced working programs which employ proof procedures in quantification theory. Gilmore's program employs a form of a basic theorem of mathematical logic due to Herbrand, and Wang's makes use of a formulation of quantification theory related to those studied by Gentzen. However, both programs encounter decisive difficulties with any but the simplest formulas of quantification theory, in connection with methods of doing propositional calculus. Wang's program, because of its use of Gentzen-like methods, involves exponentiation on the total number of truth-functional connectives, whereas Gilmore's program, using normal forms, involves exponentiation on the number of clauses present. Both methods are superior in many cases to truth table methods which involve exponentiation on the total number of variables present, and represent important initial contributions, but both run into difficulty with some fairly simple examples.\nIn the present paper, a uniform proof procedure for quantification theory is given which is feasible for use with some rather complicated formulas and which does not ordinarily lead to exponentiation. The superiority of the present procedure over those previously available is indicated in part by the fact that a formula on which Gilmore's routine for the IBM 704 causes the machine to computer for 21 minutes without obtaining a result was worked successfully by hand computation using the present method in 30 minutes. Cf. \u00a76, below.\nIt should be mentioned that, before it can be hoped to employ proof procedures for quantification theory in obtaining proofs of theorems belonging to \u201cgenuine\u201d mathematics, finite axiomatizations, which are \u201cshort,\u201d must be obtained for various branches of mathematics. This last question will not be pursued further here; cf., however, Davis and Putnam [2], where one solution to this problem is given for ele"

                "text": "From the Preface (See Front Matter for full Preface) \n \nThe study of formal languages constitutes an important subarea of computer science. This area sprang to life around 1956 when Noam Chomsky gave a mathematical model of a grammar in connection with his study of natural languages. Shortly afterwards, the concept of a grammar was found to be of great importance to the programmer when the syntax of the programming language ALGOL was defined by a context-free grammar. This development led naturally to syntax-directed compiling and the concept of a compiler compiler. Since then a considerable flurry of activity has taken place, the results of which have related formal languages and automata theory to such an extent that it is impossible to treat the areas separately. By now, no serious study of computer science would be complete without a knowledge of the techniques and results from language and automata theory. \n \nThis book presents the theory of formal languages as a coherent theory and makes explicit its relationship to automata. The book begins with an explanation of the notion of a finite description of a language. The fundamental descriptive device--the grammar--is explained, as well as its three major subclasses--regular, context-free, and context-sensitive grammars. The context-free grammars are treated in detail, and such topics as normal forms, derivation trees, and ambiguity are covered. Four types of automata equivalent to the four types of grammars are described. These automata are the finite automaton, the pushdown automaton, the linear bounded automaton, and the Turing machine. The Turing machine is covered in detail, and unsolvability of the halting problem shown. The book concludes with certain advanced topics in language theory--closure properties, computational complexity, deterministic pushdown automata, LR(k) grammars, stack automata, and decidability."

During the procedure, from any given graph two graphs, the representative graph and the reordered graph, are derived. The representative graph is a homomorphic image of the original graph; the reordered graph is constructed from the representative graph to be isomorphic to the given graph. Unique labels are assigned to the vertices of both derived graphs. It follows that two repre- sentative graphs or two reordered graphs are isomorphic if and only if they are identical. A conjecture states that the representative graphs exhibit the automorphism partitioning of the given graph. The representative graphs form a necessity condition for isomorphism; namely, if the representative graphs are not identical, then the given graphs are not isomorphic. The converse is true for trees and follows from the conjecture for other types of graphs. It is also shown that the reordered graphs form a sufficiency condition for isomorphism; namely, if the reordered graphs are identical, then the given graphs are isomorphic. The converse follows from the conjecture. The time required to determine both derived graphs depends on a power of n, the order of the given graph. This power is a function of an adjacency property known as the strong regu- larity of the given graph. For graphs that do not contain a strongly regular transitive sub- graph, the power is, at worst, five."
