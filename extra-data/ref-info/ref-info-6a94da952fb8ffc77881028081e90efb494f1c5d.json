An innovative method (called \"CLAWS\") was recently developed by those working with the Lancaster-Oslo/Bergen Corpus of British English. This algorithm uses a systematic calculation based upon the probabilities of co-occurrence of particular tags. Its accuracy is high, but it is very slow, and it has been manually augmented in a number of ways. The effects upon accuracy of this manual augmentation are not individually known.The current paper presents an algorithm for disambiguation that is similar to CLAWS but that operates in linear rather than in exponential time and space, and which minimizes the unsystematic augments. Tests of the algorithm using the million words of the Brown Standard Corpus of English are reported; the overall accuracy is 96%. This algorithm can provide a fast and accurate front end to any parsing or natural language processing system for English."

The model has the advantage that a pre-tagged training corpus is not required. Words are represented by equivalence classes to reduce the number of parameters required and provide an essentially vocabulary-independent model. State chains are used to model selective higher-order conditioning in the model, which obviates the proliferation of parameters attendant in uniformly higher-order models. The structure of the state chains is based on both an analysis of errors and linguistic knowledge. Examples show how word dependency across phrases can be modeled."

We need to create robust systems which are able to deal appropriately with these shortcomings. We are interested in particular in systems for extracting specified information from a text.

Since the possible strings may be acoustically similar, a language model is required; given a word string, the model returns its linguistic probability. Several Markov language models are discussed. A novel kind of language model which reflects short-term patterns of word use by means of a cache component (analogous to cache memory in hardware terminology) is presented. The model also contains a 3g-gram component of the traditional type. The combined model and a pure 3g-gram model were tested on samples drawn from the Lancaster-Oslo/Bergen (LOB) corpus of English text. The relative performance of the two models is examined, and suggestions for the future improvements are made. >"

The resulting parser, which I call CASS, is fast and accurate. It parses a million words in 5-6 hours; that is as fast as the fastest parsers reported in the literature. Its accuracy at recognizing chunks (mid-level constituents) and at identifying subjects and predicates is 95% or better."

These constraints are important in blocking incorrect analyses in natural language processing systems. However, these constraints are domain-specific and hence must be developed anew when a system is ported to a new domain. A discovery procedure for selectional constraints is therefore essential in enhancing the portability of such systems.This paper describes a semi-automated procedure for collecting the co-occurrence patterns from a sample of texts in a domain, and then using these patterns as the basis for selectional constraints in analyzing further texts. We discuss some of the difficulties in automating the collection process, and describe two experiments that measure the completeness of these patterns and their effectiveness compared with manually-prepared patterns. We then describe and evaluate a procedure for selectional constraint relaxation, intended to compensate for gaps in the set of patterns. Finally, we suggest how these procedures could be combined with a system that queries a domain expert, in order to produce a more efficient discovery procedure."

Even a \"portable\" system may be expensive to use because its installation takes a long time or requires the labor of scarce, highly-trained people. BBN has recently created a tool for acquisition which dramatically reduces the time and cost of installing a natural language system.During 1988, BBN used its Learner\u2122 tool to configure the Parlance\u2122 database interface to two different versions of a large Navy database. The configuration process was performed primarily with development versions of the Learner, which is a software tool for creating the knowledge bases, vocabulary, and mappings to the database that enable the Parlance interface to understand questions addressed to a particular database. The Learner reduced the time required to create Parlance configurations from months to weeks, and demonstrated that the Learner works effectively on databases with many hundreds of fields."
