Inspired by the \"Blocks World\" work in the 1960's, we present a qualitative physical representation of an outdoor scene where objects have volume and mass, and relationships describe 3D structure and mechanical configurations. Our representation allows us to apply powerful global geometric constraints between 3D volumes as well as the laws of statics in a qualitative manner. We also present a novel iterative \"interpretation-by-synthesis\" approach where, starting from an empty ground plane, we progressively \"build up\" a physically-plausible 3D interpretation of the image. For surface layout estimation, our method demonstrates an improvement in performance over the state-of-the-art [9]. But more importantly, our approach automatically generates 3D parse graphs which describe qualitative geometric and mechanical properties of objects and relationships between objects within an image."

In this paper, we provide a framework for placing local object detection in the context of the overall 3D scene by modeling the interdependence of objects, surface orientations, and camera viewpoint. Most object detection methods consider all scales and locations in the image as equally likely. We show that with probabilistic estimates of 3D geometry, both in terms of surfaces and world coordinates, we can put objects into perspective and model the scale and location variance in the image. Our approach reflects the cyclical nature of the problem by allowing probabilistic object hypotheses to refine geometry and vice-versa. Our framework allows painless substitution of almost any object detector and is easily extended to include other aspects of image understanding. Our results confirm the benefits of our integrated approach."

This requires a representation above the level of pixels that can be endowed with high-level attributes such as class of object/region, its orientation, and (rough 3D) location within the scene. Towards this goal, we propose a region-based model which combines appearance and scene geometry to automatically decompose a scene into semantically meaningful regions. Our model is defined in terms of a unified energy function over scene appearance and structure. We show how this energy function can be learned from data and present an efficient inference technique that makes use of multiple over-segmentations of the image to propose moves in the energy-space. We show, experimentally, that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the tasks of both multi-class image segmentation and geometric reasoning. Finally, by understanding region classes and geometry, we show how our model can be used as the basis for 3D reconstruction of the scene."

Object categories are modeled via distributions over the 3D location and appearance of visual features. Uncertainty in the number of object instances depicted in a particular image is then achieved via a transformed Dirichlet process. In contrast with image-based approaches to object recognition, we model scale variations as the perspective projection of objects in different 3D poses. To calibrate the underlying geometry, we incorporate binocular stereo images into the training process. A robust likelihood model accounts for outliers in matched stereo features, allowing effective learning of 3D object structure from partial 2D segmentations. Applied to a dataset of office scenes, our model detects objects at multiple scales via a coarse reconstruction of the corresponding 3D geometry."

This ability is completely missing in most popular recognition algorithms, which pretend that the world is flat and/or view it through a patch-sized peephole. Yet it seems very likely that having a grasp of this \u201csurface layout\u201d of a scene should be of great assistance for many tasks, including recognition, navigation, and novel view synthesis.In this paper, we take the first step towards constructing the surface layout, a labeling of the image intogeometric classes. Our main insight is to learn appearance-based models of these geometric classes, which coarsely describe the 3D scene orientation of each image region. Our multiple segmentation framework provides robust spatial support, allowing a wide variety of cues (e.g., color, texture, and perspective) to contribute to the confidence in each geometric label. In experiments on a large set of outdoor images, we evaluate the impact of the individual cues and design choices in our algorithm. We further demonstrate the applicability of our method to indoor images, describe potential applications, and discuss extensions to a more complete notion of surface layout."

The presence of clutter is a major problem for existing single-view 3D reconstruction algorithms, most of which rely on finding the ground-wall boundary. In most rooms, this boundary is partially or entirely occluded. We gain robustness to clutter by modeling the global room space with a parameteric 3D \u201cbox\u201d and by iteratively localizing clutter and refitting the box. To fit the box, we introduce a structured learning algorithm that chooses the set of parameters to minimize error, based on global perspective cues. On a dataset of 308 images, we demonstrate the ability of our algorithm to recover spatial layout in cluttered rooms and show several examples of estimated free space."

                "text": "We consider the problem of estimating detailed 3D structure from a single still image of an unstructured environment. Our goal is to create 3D models which are both quantitatively accurate as well as visually pleasing. For each small homogeneous patch in the image, we use a Markov random field (MRF) to infer a set of \"plane parameters\" that capture both the 3D location and 3D orientation of the patch. The MRF, trained via supervised learning, models both image depth cues as well as the relationships between different parts of the image. Inference in our model is tractable, and requires only solving a convex optimization problem. Other than assuming that the environment is made up of a number of small planes, our model makes no explicit assumptions about the structure of the scene; this enables the algorithm to capture much more detailed 3D structure than does prior art (such as Saxena et ah, 2005, Delage et ah, 2005, and Hoiem et el, 2005), and also give a much richer experience in the 3D flythroughs created using image-based rendering, even for scenes with significant non-vertical structure. Using this approach, we have created qualitatively correct 3D models for 64.9% of 588 images downloaded from the Internet, as compared to Hoiem et al.'s performance of 33.1%. Further, our models are quantitatively more accurate than either Saxena et al. or Hoiem et al."

Our main contribution is a novel framework for combining object-level descriptions (such as position, shape, and color) with pixel-level appearance, boundary, and occlusion reasoning. In training, we exploit a rough 3D object model to learn physically localized part appearances. To find and segment objects in an image, we generate proposals based on the appearance and layout of local parts. The proposals are then refined after incorporating object-level information, and overlapping objects compete for pixels to produce a final description and segmentation of objects in the scene. A further contribution is a novel instance penalty, which is handled very efficiently during inference. We experimentally validate our approach on the challenging PASCAL'06 car database."

Based on a part-based probabilistic representation [31], we propose a new 3D object class model that is capable of recognizing unseen views by pose estimation and synthesis. We achieve this by using a dense, multiview representation of the viewing sphere parameterized by a triangular mesh of viewpoints. Each triangle of viewpoints can be morphed to synthesize new viewpoints. By incorporating 3D geometrical constraints, our model establishes explicit correspondences among object parts across viewpoints. We propose an incremental learning algorithm to train the generative model. A cellphone video clip of an object is first used to initialize model learning. Then the model is updated by a set of unsorted training images without viewpoint labels. We demonstrate the robustness of our model on object detection, viewpoint classification and synthesis tasks. Our model performs superiorly to and on par with state-of-the-art algorithms on the Savarese et al. 2007 and PASCAL datasets in object detection. It outperforms all previous work in viewpoint classification and offers promising results in viewpoint synthesis."

We show that we can recognize the three dimensional structure of the interior of a building, even in the presence of occluding objects. Several physically valid structure hypotheses are proposed by geometric reasoning and verified to find the best fitting model to line segments, which is then converted to a full 3D model. Our experiments demonstrate that our structure recovery from line segments is comparable with methods using full image appearance. Our approach shows how a set of rules describing geometric constraints between groups of segments can be used to prune scene interpretation hypotheses and to generate the most plausible interpretation."

In this article, a new method for detecting the three mutual orthogonal directions of such an environment is presented. Since realtime performance is not necessary for architectural application, like building reconstruction, a computationally more intensive approach was chosen. On the other hand, our approach is more rigorous than existing techniques, since the information given by the condition of three mutual orthogonal directions in the scene is identified and incorporated. Since knowledge about the camera geometry can be deduced from the vanishing points of three mutual orthogonal directions, we use this knowledge to reject falsely detected vanishing points.

In this paper, we are concerned with how these tasks can be combined in a way that improves the performance of each of them. Inspired by Barrow and Tenenbaum, we present a flexible framework for interfacing scene analysis processes using intrinsic images. Each intrinsic image is a registered map describing one characteristic of the scene. We apply this framework to develop an integrated 3D scene understanding system with estimates of surface orientations, occlusion boundaries, objects, camera viewpoint, and relative depth. Our experiments on a set of 300 outdoor images demonstrate that these tasks reinforce each other, and we illustrate a coherent scene understanding with automatically reconstructed 3D models."

Our approach is formulated in a minimum description length hypothesis selection framework, which allows our system to recover from mismatches and temporarily lost tracks. Building upon a state-of-the-art object detector, it performs multiview/multicategory object recognition to detect cars and pedestrians in the input images. The 2D object detections are checked for their consistency with (automatically estimated) scene geometry and are converted to 3D observations which are accumulated in a world coordinate frame. A subsequent trajectory estimation module analyzes the resulting 3D observations to find physically plausible spacetime trajectories. Tracking is achieved by performing model selection after every frame. At each time instant, our approach searches for the globally optimal set of spacetime trajectories which provides the best explanation for the current image and for all evidence collected so far while satisfying the constraints that no two objects may occupy the same physical space nor explain the same image pixels at any point in time. Successful trajectory hypotheses are then fed back to guide object detection in future frames. The optimization procedure is kept efficient through incremental computation and conservative hypothesis pruning. We evaluate our approach on several challenging video sequences and demonstrate its performance on both a surveillance-type scenario and a scenario where the input videos are taken from inside a moving vehicle passing through crowded city areas."

Our goal is to efficiently create 3-d models which are visually pleasant. We chose an appropriate 3-d model structure and formulate the task of 3-d reconstruction as model fitting problem. Our 3-d models are composed of a number of vertical walls and a ground plane, where ground-vertical boundary is a continuous polyline. We achieve computational efficiency by special preprocessing together with stepwise search of 3-d model parameters dividing the problem into two smaller sub-problems on chain graphs. The use of Conditional Random Field models for both problems allows to various cues. We infer orientation of vertical walls of 3-d model vanishing points."

This requires solving several sub-problems simultaneously, including object detection, region labeling, and geometric reasoning. The last few decades have seen great progress in tackling each of these problems in isolation. Only recently have researchers returned to the difficult task of considering them jointly. In this work, we consider learning a set of related models in such that they both solve their own problem and help each other. We develop a framework called Cascaded Classification Models (CCM), where repeated instantiations of these classifiers are coupled by their input/output variables in a cascade that improves performance at each level. Our method requires only a limited \"black box\" interface with the models, allowing us to use very sophisticated, state-of-the-art classifiers without having to look under the hood. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on a large set of natural images by combining the subtasks of scene categorization, object detection, multiclass image segmentation, and 3d reconstruction."

Usually, these priors are used post-hoc in the process of resolving feature matches and obtaining final scene estimates, via `first get candidate matches, then resolve' consensus algorithms such as RANSAC. In this paper we show that the dramatically different approach of using priors dynamically to guide a feature by feature matching search can achieve global matching with much fewer image processing operations and lower overall computational cost. Essentially, we put image processing into the loopof the search for global consensus. In particular, our approach is able to cope with significant image ambiguity thanks to a dynamic mixture of Gaussians treatment. In our fully Bayesian algorithm, the choice of the most efficient search action at each step is guided intuitively and rigorously by expected Shannon information gain. We demonstrate the algorithm in feature matching as part of a sequential SLAM system for 3D camera tracking. Robust, real-time matching can be achieved even in the previously unmanageable case of jerky, rapid motion necessitating weak motion modelling and large search regions."

Such data is useful for supervised learning and quantitative evaluation. To achieve this, we developed a web-based tool that allows easy image annotation and instant sharing of such annotations. Using this annotation tool, we have collected a large dataset that spans many object categories, often containing multiple instances over a wide variety of images. We quantify the contents of the dataset and compare against existing state of the art datasets used for object recognition and detection. Also, we show how to extend the dataset to automatically enhance object labels with WordNet, discover object parts, recover a depth ordering of objects in a scene, and increase the number of labels using minimal user supervision and images from the web.\n"

Our system is able to represent highly variable object classes and achieves state-of-the-art results in the PASCAL object detection challenges. While deformable part models have become quite popular, their value had not been demonstrated on difficult benchmarks such as the PASCAL data sets. Our system relies on new methods for discriminative training with partially labeled data. We combine a margin-sensitive approach for data-mining hard negative examples with a formalism we call latent SVM. A latent SVM is a reformulation of MI--SVM in terms of latent variables. A latent SVM is semiconvex, and the training problem becomes convex once latent information is specified for the positive examples. This leads to an iterative training algorithm that alternates between fixing latent values for positive examples and optimizing the latent SVM objective function."

There are three key contributions. The first is the introduction of a new image representation called the \u201cIntegral Image\u201d which allows the features used by our detector to be computed very quickly. The second is a simple and efficient classifier which is built using the AdaBoost learning algorithm (Freund and Schapire, 1995) to select a small number of critical visual features from a very large set of potential features. The third contribution is a method for combining classifiers in a \u201ccascade\u201d which allows background regions of the image to be quickly discarded while spending more computation on promising face-like regions. A set of experiments in the domain of face detection is presented. The system yields face detection performance comparable to the best previous systems (Sung and Poggio, 1998; Rowley et al., 1998; Schneiderman and Kanade, 2000; Roth et al., 2000). Implemented on a conventional desktop, face detection proceeds at 15 frames per second."

The parsing algorithm optimizes the posterior probability and outputs a scene representation as a \u201cparsing graph\u201d, in a spirit similar to parsing sentences in speech and natural language. The algorithm constructs the parsing graph and re-configures it dynamically using a set of moves, which are mostly reversible Markov chain jumps. This computational framework integrates two popular inference approaches\u2014generative (top-down) methods and discriminative (bottom-up) methods. The former formulates the posterior probability in terms of generative models for images defined by likelihood functions and priors. The latter computes discriminative probabilities based on a sequence (cascade) of bottom-up tests/filters. In our Markov chain algorithm design, the posterior probability, defined by the generative models, is the invariant (target) probability for the Markov chain, and the discriminative probabilities are used to construct proposal probabilities to drive the Markov chain. Intuitively, the bottom-up discriminative probabilities activate top-down generative models. In this paper, we focus on two types of visual patterns\u2014generic visual patterns, such as texture and shading, and object patterns including human faces and text. These types of patterns compete and cooperate to explain the image and so image parsing unifies image segmentation, object detection, and recognition (if we use generic visual patterns only then image parsing will correspond to image segmentation (Tu and Zhu, 2002. IEEE Trans. PAMI, 24(5):657\u2013673). We illustrate our algorithm on natural images of complex city scenes and show examples where image segmentation can be improved by allowing object specific knowledge to disambiguate low-level segmentation cues, and conversely where object detection can be improved by using generic visual patterns to explain away shadows and occlusions."

A retinally connected neural network examines small windows of an image and decides whether each window contains a face. The system arbitrates between multiple networks to improve performance over a single network. We use a bootstrap algorithm for training the networks, which adds false detections into the training set as training progresses. This eliminates the difficult task of manually selecting non-face training examples, which must be chosen to span the entire space of non-face images. Comparisons with other state-of-the-art face detection systems are presented; our system has better performance in terms of detection and false-positive rates."
