                "text": "Representing data as points in a high-dimensional space, so as to use geometric methods for indexing, is an algorithmic technique with a wide array of uses. It is central to a number of areas such as information retrieval, pattern recognition, and statistical data analysis; many of the problems arising in these applications can involve several hundred or several thousand dimensions. We consider the nearest-neighbor problem for d-dimensional Euclidean space: we wish to pre-process a database of n points so that given a query point, one can efficiently determine its nearest neighbors in the database. There is a large literature on algorithms for this problem, in both the exact and approximate cases. The more sophisticated algorithms typically achieve a query time that is logarithmic in n at the expense of an exponential dependence on the dimension d; indeed, even the averagecase analysis of heuristics such as k-d trees reveals an exponential dependence on d in the query time. In this work, we develop a new approach to the nearest-neighbor problem, based on a method for combining randomly chosen one-dimensional projections of the underlying point set. From this, we obtain the following two results. (i) An algorithm for finding e-approximate nearest neighbors with a query time of O((d log d)(d + log n)). (ii) An e-approximate nearest-neighbor algorithm with near-linear storage and a query time that improves asymptotically on linear search in all dimensions. \u2217Department of Computer Science, Cornell University, Ithaca NY 14853.

The goal is to preprocess the point set S, such that queries can be answered as efficiently as possible. We assume that the dimension d is a constant independent of n. Although reasonably good solutions to this problem exist when d is small, as d increases the performance of these algorithms degrades rapidly. We present a randomized algorithm for approximate nearest neighbor searching. Given any set of n points S \u2282 E, and a constant \u01eb > 0, we produce a data structure, such that given any query point, a point of S will be reported whose distance from the query point is at most a factor of (1 + \u01eb) from that of the true nearest neighbor. Our algorithm runs in O(log n) expected time and requires O(n log n) space. The data structure can be built in O(n) expected time. The constant factors depend on d and \u01eb. Because of the practical importance of nearest neighbor searching in higher dimensions, we have implemented a practical variant of this algorithm, and show empirically that for many point distributions this variant of the algorithm finds the nearest neighbor in moderately large dimension significantly faster than existing practical approaches."

The up-tree (vantage point tree) is introduced in several forms, together\u2018 with &&ciated algorithms, as an improved method for these difficult search nroblems. Tree construcI tion executes in O(nlog(n i ) time, and search is under certain circumstances and in the imit, O(log(n)) expected time.

Of late, there has been increasing interest in building search/index structures for performing similarity search over high-dimensional data, e.g., image databases, document collections, time-series databases, and genome databases. Unfortunately, all known techniques for solving this problem fall prey to the \\curse of dimensionality.\" That is, the data structures scale poorly with data dimensionality; in fact, if the number of dimensions exceeds 10 to 20, searching in k-d trees and related structures involves the inspection of a large fraction of the database, thereby doing no better than brute-force linear search. It has been suggested that since the selection of features and the choice of a distance metric in typical applications is rather heuristic, determining an approximate nearest neighbor should su ce for most practical purposes. In this paper, we examine a novel scheme for approximate similarity search based on hashing. The basic idea is to hash the points Supported by NAVY N00014-96-1-1221 grant and NSF Grant IIS-9811904.

                "text": "Abstract. Given a set S of n sites (points), and a distance measure d , the nearestneighborsearching problem is to build a data structure so that given a query point q , the site nearest to q can be found quickly. This paper gives data structures for this problem when the sites and queries are in a metric space. One data structure, D(S) , uses a divide-and-conquer recursion. The other data structure, M(S,Q) , is somewhat like a skiplist. Both are simple and implementable. The data structures are analyzed when the metric space obeys a certain sphere-packing bound, and when the sites and query points are random and have distributions with an exchangeability property. This property implies, for example, that query point q is a random element of \n $ S\\cup\\{q\\} $ . Under these conditions, the preprocessing and space bounds for the algorithms are close to linear in n . They depend also on the sphere-packing bound, and on the logarithm of the distanceratio\n $ \\Upsilon(S) $ of S , the ratio of the distance between the farthest pair of points in S to the distance between the closest pair. The data structure M(S,Q) requires as input data an additional set Q , taken to be representative of the query points. The resource bounds of M(S,Q) have a dependence on the distance ratio of S\n $\\cup$ Q . While M(S,Q) can return wrong answers, its failure probability can be bounded, and is decreasing in a parameter K . Here K\u2264 |Q|/n is chosen when building M(S,Q) . The expected query time for M(S,Q) is O(Klog\u00a0 n)log\u00a0\n$\\Upsilon(S\\cup Q)$ , and the resource bounds increase linearly in K . The data structure D(S) has expected O( log n)O(1) query time, for fixed distance ratio. The preprocessing algorithm for M(S,Q) can be used to solve the all nearest neighbor problem for S in O(n(log\u00a0 n)2(log\u00a0\u03d2(S))2) expected time."

For most of the problems considered a lower bound of O(N log N) is shown. For all of them the best currently-known upper bound is O(N2) or worse. The purpose of this paper is to introduce a single geometric structure, called the Voronoi diagram, which can be constructed rapidly and contains all of the relevant proximity information in only linear space. The Voronoi diagram is used to obtain O(N log N) algorithms for all of the problems."

Most averagecase analyses of nearest-neighbor searching algorithms are made under the simplifying assumption thatd is fixed and thatn is so large relative tod thatboundary effects can be ignored. This means that for any query point the statistical distribution of the data points surrounding it is independent of the location of the query point. However, in many applications of nearest-neighbor searching (such as data compression by vector quantization) this assumption is not met, since the number of data pointsn grows roughly as 2 d .Largely for this reason, the actual performances of many nearest-neighbor algorithms tend to be much better than their theoretical analyses would suggest. We present evidence of why this is the case. We provide an accurate analysis of the number of cells visited in nearest-neighbor searching by the bucketing andk-d tree algorithms. We assumem dpoints uniformly distributed in dimensiond, wherem is a fixed integer \u22652. Further, we assume that distances are measured in theL \u221e metric. Our analysis is tight in the limit asd approaches infinity. Empirical evidence is presented showing that the analysis applies even in low dimensions."

Often the data is noisy and even approximate classification is of extreme importance. The difficulty of such classification stems from the fact that usually the data has many incomparable attributes, and often results in the question of clustering problems in high dimensional spaces. Since they require measuring distance between every pair of data points, standard algorithms for computing the exact clustering solutions use quadratic or \u201cnearly quadratic\u201d running time; i.e., O(dn2\u2212\u03b1(d)) time where n is the number of data points, d is the dimension of the space and \u03b1(d) approaches 0 as d grows. In this paper, we show (for three fairly natural clustering rules) that computing an approximate solution can be done much more efficiently. More specifically, for agglomerative clustering (used, for example, in the Alta Vista\u2122 search engine), for the clustering defined by sparse partitions, and for a clustering based on minimum spanning trees we derive randomized (1 + \u2208) approximation algorithms with running times \u00d5(d2n2\u2212\u03b3) where \u03b3 > 0 depends only on the approximation parameter \u2208 and is independent of the dimension d."

The expected time required to build an RPO tree is $O(n^{\\lceil {{d / 2}} \\rceil (1 + \\epsilon )} )$, for any fixed $\\epsilon > 0$, and a query can be answered in $O(\\log n)$ worst-case time.

For example, given an image database, one may want to retrieve all images that are similar to a given query image. Distance based index structures are proposed for applications where the data domain is high dimensional, or the distance function used to compute distances between data objects is non-Euclidean. In this paper, we introduce a distance based index structure called multi-vantage point (mvp) tree for similarity queries on high-dimensional metric spaces. The mvp-tree uses more than one vantage point to partition the space into spherical cuts at each level. It also utilizes the pre-computed (at construction time) distances between the data points and the vantage points. We have done experiments to compare mvp-trees with vp-trees which have a similar partitioning strategy, but use only one vantage point at each level, and do not make use of the pre-computed distances. Empirical studies show that mvp-tree outperforms the vp-tree 20% to 80% for varying query ranges and different distance distributions."

More generally, each point can be modelled as a ball of small radius, and we mav wish to find a transformation approximating the closest d&axe between P and Q. This problem has many applications in domains such as computer vision and computational chemistry In this paper we present improved algorithms for this problem, by allowing the running time of our algorithms to depend not only on n, (the number of points in the sets), but also on A, the diameter of the point set. The deoendence on A also allAws us to effectively *process point se& that occur in practice, where diameters tend to be small ([EVW91]). Our algorithms are also simple to implement, in contrast to much of the earlier work. To obtain the above-mentioned results, we introduce a novel discretization technique to reduce geometric pattern matching to combinatorial pattern matching. In addition, we address various generalizations of the classical problem first posed by Erd8s: \u201cGiven a set, of n points in the plane, how many pairs of points can be exactly a unit distance apart?\u201c. The combinatorial bounds we prove enable us to obtain improved results for geometric pattern matching and may have other applications."

The paper defines a theoretical framework to study the performance of algorithms for this problem, and provides a basic algorithmic approach. It is shown that a certain class of algorithms, D-oblivious algorithms, can not be optimal both in space and time. This is done by proving a lower bound on the tradeoff between the space and time complexities of D-oblivious algorithms. Several algorithms for this problem are presented, and their performance is compared to that of Ispell, the standard speller of Unix. On the Webster English dictionary the algorithms are shown to be faster than 'Ispell' by a significant factor, while incurring only a small cost in space.<<ETX>>"

Our offline approach aims to efficiently cluster similar pages on the web, using the technique of Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH), in which web pages are hashed in such a way that similar pages have a much higher probability of collision than dissimilar pages. Our preliminary experiments on the Stanford WebBase have shown that the hash-based scheme can be scaled to millions of urls."

The assumption is that the number of ones common to any two vectors is significantly less than t, except for an unknown set of O(n) pairs. This problem has important applications in DNA physical mapping, clustering, and searching for approximate dictionary matches. We present two randomized algorithms that solve this problem with high probability and in sub-quadratic expected time. One of these algorithms is based on a recursive tree-searching procedure, and the other on hashing. We analyze the tree scheme in terms of branching processes, while our analysis of the hashing scheme is based on Markov chains. Since both algorithms have similar asymptotic performance, we also examine experimentally their relative merits in practical situations. We conclude by showing that a fundamental problem arising in the Human Genome Project is captured by the bit vector intersection problem described above and hence can be solved by our algorithms."

This approach offers a new perspective on a number of graph-theoretic and algorithmic problems. There are several ways to model graphs geometrically and our main concern here is with geometric representations that respect themetric of the (possibly weighted) graph. Given a graphG we map its vertices to a normed space in an attempt to (i) keep down the dimension of the host space, and (ii) guarantee a smalldistortion, i.e., make sure that distances between vertices inG closely match the distances between their geometric images.In this paper we develop efficient algorithms for embedding graphs low-dimensionally with a small distortion. Further algorithmic applications include:\u2022A simple, unified approach to a number of problems on multicommodity flows, including the Leighton-Rao Theorem [37] and some of its extensions. We solve an open question in this area, showing that the max-flow vs. min-cut gap in thek-commodities problem isO(logk). Our new deterministic polynomial-time algorithm finds a (nearly tight) cut meeting this bound.\u2022For graphs embeddable in low-dimensional spaces with a small distortion, we can find low-diameter decompositions (in the sense of [7] and [43]). The parameters of the decomposition depend only on the dimension and the distortion and not on the size of the graph.\u2022In graphs embedded this way, small balancedseparators can be found efficiently.\nGiven faithful low-dimensional representations of statistical data, it is possible to obtain meaningful and efficientclustering. This is one of the most basic tasks in pattern-recognition. For the (mostly heuristic) methods used in the practice of pattern-recognition, see [20], especially chapter 6.Our studies of multicommodity flows also imply that every embedding of (the metric of) ann-vertex, constant-degree expander into a Euclidean space (of any dimension) has distortion \u03a9(logn). This result is tight, and closes a gap left open by Bourgain [12]."

Although this phenomenon-known as the \u2018dimensional curse\u2019-is well known, little or no quantitative a.nalysis of the phenomenon is available. In this paper, we provide a detailed analysis of partitioning and clustering techniques for similarity search in HDVSs. We show formally that these methods exhibit linear complexity at high dimensionality, and that existing methods are outperformed on average by a simple sequential scan if the number of dimensions exceeds around 10. Consequently, we come up with an alternative organization based on approximations to make the unavoidable sequential scan as fast as possible. We describe a simple vector approximation scheme, called VA-file, and report on an experimental evaluation of this and of two tree-based index methods (an R*-tree and an X-tree)."

Let D be a database of n sequences; we would like to preprocess D so that given any on-line query sequence Q we can quickly find a sequence S in D for which d(S;Q) d(S; T ) for any other sequence T in D. Hered(S;Q) denotes the distance between sequences S andQ, defined to be the minimum number of edit operations needed to transform one to another (all edit operations will be reversible so thatd(S; T ) = d(T; S) for any two sequencesT andS). These operations correspond to the notion of similarity between sequences that we wish to capture in a given application. Natural edit operations include character edits (inserts, replacements, deletes etc), block edits (moves, copies, deletes, reversals) and block numerical transformations (scaling by an additive or a multiplicative constant). The SNN problem arises in many applications. We present the first known efficient algorithm for \u201capproximate\u201d nearest neighbor search for sequences with preprocessing time and space polynomial in size of D and query time near-linear in size of Q. We assume the distanced(S; T ) between two sequences S andT is the minimum number of character edits and block operations needed to transform one to the other. The approximation factor we achieve is O(log `(log `)2), where` is the size of the longest sequence in D.

The time and space requirements of the algorithm is near linear; previously known approaches take at least quadratic time."

Our main result is a tight upper and lower bound of on the time for answering membership queries in a set of size when reasonable space is used for the data structure storing the set; the upper bound can be obtained using space, and the lower bound holds even if we allow space . Several variations of this result are also obtained. Among others, we show a tradeoff between time and circuit depth under the unit-cost assumption: any RAM instruction set which permits a linear space, constant query time solution to the static dictionary problem must have an instruction of depth , where is the word size of the machine (and the size of the universe). This matches the depth of multiplication and integer division, used in the perfect hashing scheme by Fredman, Koml\u00b4 and Szemer\u00b4 edi."

We use a local linear discriminant analysis to estimate an effective metric for computing neighborhoods. We determine the local decision boundaries from centroid information, and then shrink neighborhoods in directions orthogonal to these local decision boundaries, and elongate them parallel to the boundaries. Thereafter, any neighborhood-based classifier can be employed, using the modified neighborhoods. The posterior probabilities tend to be more homogeneous in the modified neighborhoods. We also propose a method for global dimension reduction, that combines local dimension information. In a number of examples, the methods demonstrate the potential for substantial improvements over nearest neighbour classification."

Our main result is a tight upper and lower bound of (p logn= loglog n) on the time for answering membership queries in a set of size n when reasonable space is used for the data structure storing the set; the upper bound can be obtained using O(n) space, and the lower bound holds even if we allow space 2 polylog n. Several variations of this bound is also obtained, including tight upper and lower bounds on the storage space if the query time must be constant and bounds valid for non-AC 0 RAMs if the execution time of an instruction computing a function is measured as the minimal depth of a polynomially sized unbounded fan-in circuit computing the function. We refer to this model as the Circuit RAM. As an example of the latter, we show that any RAM instruction set which permits a linear space, constant query time solution to the static dictionary problem must have an instruction of depth (log w= loglogw), where w is the word size of the machine (and log the size of the universe). This matches the depth of multiplication and integer division, used in the two level perfect hashing scheme by Fredman, Komll os and Szemer edi. One of the non-dictionary related consequences of our techniques is a randomized AC 0 sorting algorithm using O(n(log logn) 2) time and linear space."

This rule is independent of the underlying joint distribution on the sample points and their classifications, and hence the probability of error R of such a rule must be at least as great as the Bayes probability of error R^{\\ast} --the minimum probability of error over all decision rules taking underlying probability structure into account. However, in a large sample analysis, we will show in the M -category case that R^{\\ast} \\leq R \\leq R^{\\ast}(2 --MR^{\\ast}/(M-1)) , where these bounds are the tightest possible, for all suitably smooth underlying distributions. Thus for any number of categories, the probability of error of the nearest neighbor rule is bounded above by twice the Bayes probability of error. In this sense, it may be said that half the classification information in an infinite sample set is contained in the nearest neighbor."

Algorithmic examples are also given to illustrate the use of each tool in a concrete setting. In the second part of the book, each chapter focuses on an important area to which randomized algorithms can be applied, providing a comprehensive and representative selection of the algorithms that might be used in each of these areas. Although written primarily as a text for advanced undergraduates and graduate students, this book should also prove invaluable as a reference for professionals and researchers."

The approach is to take advantage of implicit higher-order structure in the association of terms with documents (\u201csemantic structure\u201d) in order to improve the detection of relevant documents on the basis of terms found in queries. The particular technique used is singular-value decomposition, in which a large term by document matrix is decomposed into a set of ca. 100 orthogonal factors from which the original matrix can be approximated by linear combination. Documents are represented by ca. 100 item vectors of factor weights. Queries are represented as pseudo-document vectors formed from weighted combinations of terms, and documents with supra-threshold cosine values are returned. initial tests find this completely automatic method for retrieval to be promising."

The <italic>k</italic>-d tree is defined and examples are given. It is shown to be quite efficient in its storage requirements. A significant advantage of this structure is that a single data structure can handle many types of queries very efficiently. Various utility algorithms are developed; their proven average running times in an <italic>n</italic> record file are: insertion, <italic>O</italic>(log <italic>n</italic>); deletion of the root, <italic>O</italic>(<italic>n</italic><supscrpt>(<italic>k</italic>-1)/<italic>k</italic></supscrpt>); deletion of a random node, <italic>O</italic>(log <italic>n</italic>); and optimization (guarantees logarithmic performance of searches), <italic>O</italic>(<italic>n</italic> log <italic>n</italic>). Search algorithms are given for partial match queries with <italic>t</italic> keys specified [proven maximum running time of <italic>O</italic>(<italic>n</italic><supscrpt>(<italic>k</italic>-<italic>t</italic>)/<italic>k</italic></supscrpt>)] and for nearest neighbor queries [empirically observed average running time of <italic>O</italic>(log <italic>n</italic>).] These performances far surpass the best currently known algorithms for these tasks. An algorithm is presented to handle any general intersection query. The main focus of this paper is theoretical. It is felt, however, that <italic>k</italic>-d trees could be quite useful in many applications, and examples of potential uses are given."

A highly redundant number of descriptive tuples from the sequences of interest are generated and used as indices in a table look-up paradigm. Theoretical and experimental results on the sensitivity and accuracy of the approach are provided. These include the probability of correct and random matches and the storage and computational requirements. An experimental system is implemented for a database containing the complete genome of the bacteria E. Coli (approximately 2 million nucleotides).

Like the first edition,this text can also be used for self-study by technical professionals since it discusses engineering issues in algorithm design as well as the mathematical aspects. \nIn its new edition,Introduction to Algorithms continues to provide a comprehensive introduction to the modern study of algorithms. The revision has been updated to reflect changes in the years since the book's original publication. New chapters on the role of algorithms in computing and on probabilistic analysis and randomized algorithms have been included. Sections throughout the book have been rewritten for increased clarity,and material has been added wherever a fuller explanation has seemed useful or new information warrants expanded coverage. \nAs in the classic first edition,this new edition of Introduction to Algorithms presents a rich variety of algorithms and covers them in considerable depth while making their design and analysis accessible to all levels of readers. Further,the algorithms are presented in pseudocode to make the book easily accessible to students from all programming language backgrounds. \nEach chapter presents an algorithm,a design technique,an application area,or a related topic. The chapters are not dependent on one another,so the instructor can organize his or her use of the book in the way that best suits the course's needs. Additionally,the new edition offers a 25% increase over the first edition in the number of problems,giving the book 155 problems and over 900 exercises thatreinforcethe concepts the students are learning."

QBIC allows queries on large image and video databases based on example images, user-constructed sketches and drawings, selected color and texture patterns, camera and object motion, and other graphical information. Two key properties of QBIC are (1) its use of image and video content-computable properties of color, texture, shape and motion of images, videos and their objects-in the queries, and (2) its graphical query language, in which queries are posed by drawing, selecting and other graphical means. This article describes the QBIC system and demonstrates its query capabilities. QBIC technology is part of several IBM products. >"

The LSIRS user interface was initial prototype graphical user interface (GUI) of the recently developed XLSI application. The indexing and SVD software used to employ Latent Semantic Indexing (or LSI) was developed at Bellcore and the University of Tennessee. Based on data collected from the usage of the system by graduate students and University of Tennessee library patrons, LSIRS is shown to be an e ective and useful document retrieval system for both the inexperienced and advanced user.

For various ray shooting problems, space/query-time trade-offs of the following type are achieved: For some integer b and a parameter $m(n \\leqslant m \\leqslant n^b )$ the queries are answered in time $O(({n / {m^{{1 / b}} }})\\log ^{O(1)} n)$, with $O(m^{1 + \\varepsilon } )$ space and preprocessing time ($\\varepsilon > 0$ is arbitrarily small but fixed constant). $b = \\lfloor {{d / 2}} \\rfloor $ is obtained for ray shooting in a convex d-polytope defined as an intersection of n half spaces, $b = d$ for an arrangement of n hyperplanes in $\\mathbb{R}^d $, and $b = 3$ for an arrangement of n half planes in $\\mathbb{R}^3 $.

These tools differ from those used in standard image databases in that they make direct use of the image content rather than relying on annotations. Direct search on image content is made possible by use of semantics-preserving image compression, which reduces images to a small set of perceptually significant coefficients. We describe three Photobook tools in particular: one that allows search based on gray-level appearance, one that uses 2-D shape, and a third that allows search based on textural properties."
