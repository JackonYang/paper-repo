                "text": "This dissertation describes research involving vision techniques which would be useful in an autonomous exploring vehicle, such as a Mars rover. These techniques produce a description of the surroundings of the vehicle in terms of the position, size, and approximate shape of objects, and can match such scene descriptions with others previously produced. The information produced is thus useful both for navigation and obstacle avoidance. The techniques operate by using three-dimensional data which they can produce by means of stereo vision from stereo picture pairs or which can be obtained from a laser rangefinder. The research thus divides conveniently into two portions: stereo mapping and three-dimensional modelling and matching. \nThe stereo mapping techniques are designed to be suitable for the kind of pictures that a Mars rover might obtain and to produce the kind of data that the modelling techniques need. These stereo techniques are based upon area correlation and produce a depth map of the scene. Emphasis is placed upon extraction of useful data from noisy pictures and upon the estimation of the accuracy of the data produced. Included are the following: a self-calibration method for computing the stereo camera model (the relative position and orientation of the two camera positions); a high-resolution stereo correlator for producing accurate matches with accuracy and confidence estimates, which includes the ability to compensate for brightness and contrast changes between the pictures; a search technique for using the correlator to produce a dense sampling of matched points for a pair of pictures; and the computation of the distances to the matched points, including the propagation of the accuracy estimates. \nThe three-dimensional modelling and matching techniques are designed to be tolerant of the errors that stereo mapping techniques often produce. First, a ground surface finder tries to find a set of points that form a well-defined smooth surface that lies below most of the other points. Then, by using this knowledge of the ground surface and knowledge of the camera viewpoint that produced the points in the scene, an object finder approximates the objects that are above the ground by ellipsoids. Finally, a scene matcher can use the descriptions of scenes in terms of ellipsoidal objects. By using a search pruned by using probabilities obtained by means of Bayes' theorem, it determines the probability that two scene descriptions refer to the same scene and the linear transformation needed to bring the two scenes into alignment. \nThese techniques have been tried on stereo pictures of the Martian surface taken by the Viking Lander 1. The object finder was able to locate rocks fairly successfully, and the scene matcher was able to match successfully the resulting scene descriptions. Examples of these results are shown."

We examine geometric constraints on stereo correspondence and describe progress toward formulation from first principles of an evaluation function for selection of the best among alternative correspondences. Within a surface interpretation, conditions on correspondence of edges and surface intervals are shown. These conditions are useful with wide angle stereo and provide particularly tight constraints for narrow angle stereo. We invoke the general assumption that edge and surface orientations are not related to observer position. We are combining these general constraints with ongoing work in scene modeling of known regularities which include distributions with respect to the gravity vector (horizontal and vertical edges and surfaces), parallelism and alignment with local coordinate systems, and orthogonal corners. We will use them to calculate a likelihood measure for correspondences."

The algorithm consists of five steps: (1) Each image is filtered with bar masks of four sizes that vary with eccentricity; the equivalent filters are about one octave wide. (2) Zero-crossings of the mask values are localized, and positions that correspond to terminations are found; (3) For each mask size, matching takes place between pairs of zero- crossings or terminations of the same sign in the two images, for a range of disparities up to about the vergence movements, thus causing small masks to come into correspondence; (5) When a correspondence is achieved, it is written into a dynamic buffer, called the 2 1/2 D sketch. It is shown that this proposal provides a theoretical framework for most existing phychophysical and neurophysiological data about stereopsis. Several critical experimental predictions are also made, for instance, about the wsize of Panum?s area under various conditions. The results of such experiments would tell us whether, for example, cooperativity is necessary for the fusion process."

                "text": "The Gestalt Photo Mapping System is made up of the GPM II and GPM Plotting System. The GPM II is a computer-controlled, auto-correlating, analytical photomapper. It is composed of two scanners, an automatic image correlator, a control computer, an operator's console, and one or two printers. A typical stereomodel is completed automatically in less than an hour and a half after a 10 minute operator-assisted analytical orientation. Principal topographic output consists of a 700,000-point digital terrain model (DTM) on magnetic tape: Planimetric output consists of an orthophoto on 20 X 25 cm stable-base film. The GPM Plotting System is an off-line automatic DTM processing system. It consists of a disk-based minicomputer and plotter. Smoothed contours and slope maps may be plotted at map scale with annotation in less than an hour and a half. A GPM III orthophoto and GPM Plotting System contours may be combined without editing by using conventional photographic techniques to produce a reproduction-quality contoured orthophot map in less than a day. /Author/"
