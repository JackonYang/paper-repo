Under these conditions, scanning is much slower than when the target is a known word, or a member of a small fixed set. It is argued that printed words are processed in two stages, termed \u2018stimulus examination\u2019 and \u2018memory examination\u2019 respectively. Preliminary data relevant to other aspects of the scanning method are also presented: error rates, the importance of motivation, the extent to which words scanned over can be recognized later, and the relation between scanning and reading aloud."

                "text": "This series of studies represents an effort to extend the subtractive method of Bonders to the analysis of depth of processing in simple classification tasks. The stimuli are always pairs of items (letters, nonsense forms, digits) to which S must respond \"same\" or \"different\" as quickly as possible. Levels of instruction are physical identity (e.g., AA), name identity (e.g., Aa), and rule identity (e.g., both vowels). By use of the subtractive method, times for matches at each level are analyzed. The emphasis is not placed upon the times themselves but upon their relevance for understanding the operations and mechanisms involved in perceptual matching, naming, and classifying. Nearly 100 years ago the Dutch physiologist Donders presented a paper (Bonders, 1868) on the time for simple cognitive operations. This wellknown paper initiated the use of the subtractive method of latency analysis to measure the time for internal mental processes such as recognition and choice. Although the subtractive method has received a good deal of criticism (Boring, 1950), there is once again active interest in pursuing it. Recent work includes detailed analysis of successive stages in simple reaction time (McGill, 1963), separation of recognition from choice time (Taylor, 1966), effect of task variables such as S-R compatibility upon the component times (Broadbent & Gregory, 1965), and development of dynamic decision models to predict and explain various components of choice time (Fitts, 1966; Stone, 1960)."
