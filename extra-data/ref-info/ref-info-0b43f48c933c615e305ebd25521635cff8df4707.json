A model includes parts\u2019 appearance, as well as location and scale relations between parts. The object class is generatively modeled using a simple Bayesian network with a central hidden node containing location and scale information, and nodes describing object parts. The model\u2019s parameters, however, are optimized to reduce a loss function of the training error, as in discriminative methods. We show how boosting techniques can be extended to optimize the relational model proposed, with complexity linear in the number of parts and the number of features per image. This efficiency allows our method to learn relational models with many parts and features. The method has an advantage over purely generative and purely discriminative approaches for learning from sets of salient features, since generative method often use a small number of parts and features, while discriminative methods tend to ignore geometrical relations between parts. Experimental results are described, using some bench-mark data sets and three sets of newly collected data, showing the relative merits of our method in recognition and localization tasks.\n"

The first step of our method consists of clustering local scale-invariant descriptors to characterize object class appearance. Next, we train on the groups, and perform feature selection to determine the most discriminative parts. We use local regions to realize robust and sparse part and texture selection invariant to changes in scale, orientation and affine deformation and, as a result, we avoid image normalization in both training and prediction phases. We train our object models without requiring image parts to be labeled or objects to be separated from the background. Moreover, our method continues to work well when images have cluttered background and occluded objects. We evaluate our method on seven recently proposed datasets, and quantitatively compare the effect of different types of local regions and feature selection criteria on object recognition. Our experiments show that local invariant descriptors are an appropriate representation for many different object classes. Our results also confirm the importance of appearance-based discriminative feature selection."

We present a simple method for image description based on histograms of qualitative shape indexes computed from the combination of triplets of sampled locations and gradient directions in the image. We demonstrate that this method indeed is able to capture variation within classes of objects and we apply it to the problem of recognizing four different categories from a large database. Using our descriptor on the whole image, containing varying degrees of background clutter, we obtain results for two of the objects that are superior to the best results published so far for this database. By cropping images manually we demonstrate that our method has a potential to handle also the other objects when supplied with an algorithm for searching the image. We argue that our method, based on qualitative image properties, capture the large range of variation that is typically encountered within an object class. This means that our method can be used on substantially larger patches of images than existing methods based on simpler criteria for evaluating image similarity."

Objects are modeled as flexible constellations of parts. A probabilistic representation is used for all aspects of the object: shape, appearance, occlusion and relative scale. An entropy-based feature detector is used to select regions and their scale within the image. In learning the parameters of the scale-invariant object model are estimated. This is done using expectation-maximization in a maximum-likelihood setting. In recognition, this model is used in a Bayesian manner to classify images. The flexible nature of the model is demonstrated by excellent results over a range of datasets including geometrically constrained classes (e.g. faces, cars) and flexible objects (such as animals)."

The model is a sparse representation of the object, and consists of a star topology configuration of parts modeling the output of a variety of feature detectors. The optimal choice of feature types (whose repertoire includes interest points, curves and regions) is made automatically. In recognition, the model may be applied efficiently in an exhaustive manner, bypassing the need for feature detectors, to give the globally optimal match within a query image. The approach is demonstrated on a wide variety of categories, and delivers both successful classification and localization of the object within the image."

We introduce LOCUS (learning object classes with unsupervised segmentation) which uses a generative probabilistic model to combine bottom-up cues of color and edge with top-down cues of shape and pose. A key aspect of this model is that the object appearance is allowed to vary from image to image, allowing for significant within-class variation. By iteratively updating the belief in the object's position, size, segmentation and pose, LOCUS avoids making hard decisions about any of these quantities and so allows for each to be refined at any stage. We show that LOCUS successfully learns an object class model from unlabeled images, whilst also giving segmentation accuracies that rival existing supervised methods. Finally, we demonstrate simultaneous recognition and segmentation in novel images using the learned models for a number of object classes, as well as unsupervised object discovery and tracking in video."

A two-stage, partially supervised learning architecture is proposed: a rudimentary detector is learned from a very small set of segmented images and applied to a larger training set of un-segmented images; the second stage bootstraps these detections to learn an improved classifier while explicitly training against clutter. The detectors are learned with a boosting algorithm which creates a location-sensitive classifier using a discriminative set of features from a randomly chosen dictionary of contour fragments. We present results that are very competitive with other state-of-the-art object detection schemes and show robustness to object articulations, clutter, and occlusion. Our major contributions are the application of boosted local contour-based features for object detection in a partially supervised learning framework, and an efficient new boosting procedure for simultaneously selecting features and estimating per-feature parameters."

A novel hierarchical representation allows to represent individual images as well as various objects classes in a single, scale and rotation invariant model. The recognition method is based on a codebook representation where appearance clusters built from edge based features are shared among several object classes. A probabilistic model allows for reliable detection of various objects in the same image. The approach is highly efficient due to fast clustering and matching methods capable of dealing with millions of high dimensional features. The system shows excellent performance on several object categories over a wide range of scales, in-plane rotations, background clutter, and partial occlusions. The performance of the proposed multi-object class detection approach is competitive to state of the art approaches dedicated to a single object class recognition problem."

Our aims are to enable models for new categories to benefit from the detectors built previously for other categories, and for the complexity of the multiclass system to grow sublinearly with the number of categories. To this end we introduce a visual alphabet representation which can be learnt incrementally, and explicitly shares boundary fragments (contours) and spatial configurations (relation to centroid) across object categories. We develop a learning algorithm with the following novel contributions: (i) AdaBoost is adapted to learn jointly, based on shape features; (ii) a new learning schedule enables incremental additions of new categories; and (iii) the algorithm learns to detect objects (instead of categorizing images). Furthermore, we show that category similarities can be predicted from the alphabet. We obtain excellent experimental results on a variety of complex categories over several visual aspects. We show that the sharing of shape features not only reduces the number of features required per category, but also often improves recognition performance, as compared to individual detectors which are trained on a per-class basis."

The method is designed to efficiently handle categories containing hundreds of redundant local features, such as those returned by current key-point detectors. This robustness allows it to outperform constellation style models, despite their stronger spatial models. The model is initialized by robust bottom-up voting over location-scale pyramids, and optimized by expectation-maximization. Training is rapid, and objects do not need to be marked in the training images. Experiments on several popular datasets show the method's ability to capture complex natural object classes."

Following a common consensus in the field, we do not assume that a figure- ground segmentation is available prior to recognition. However, in contrast to most standard approaches for object class recognition, our approach automati- cally segments the object as a result of the categorization. This combination of recognition and segmentation into one process is made pos- sible by our use of an Implicit Shape Model, which integrates both into a common probabilistic framework. In addition to the recognition and segmentation result, it also generates a per-pixel confidence measure specifying the area that supports a hypothesis and how much it can be trusted. We use this confidence to derive a nat- ural extension of the approach to handle multiple objects in a scene and resolve ambiguities between overlapping hypotheses with a novel MDL-based criterion. In addition, we present an extensive evaluation of our method on a standard dataset for car detection and compare its performance to existing methods from the literature. Our results show that the proposed method significantly outper- forms previously published methods while needing one order of magnitude less training examples. Finally, we present results for articulated objects, which show that the proposed method can categorize and segment unfamiliar objects in differ- ent articulations and with widely varying texture patterns, even under significant partial occlusion."

The features are invariant to image scaling, translation, and rotation, and partially invariant to illumination changes and affine or 3D projection. These features share similar properties with neurons in inferior temporal cortex that are used for object recognition in primate vision. Features are efficiently detected through a staged filtering approach that identifies stable points in scale space. Image keys are created that allow for local geometric deformations by representing blurred image gradients in multiple orientation planes and at multiple scales. The keys are used as input to a nearest neighbor indexing method that identifies candidate object matches. Final verification of each match is achieved by finding a low residual least squares solution for the unknown model parameters. Experimental results show that robust object recognition can be achieved in cluttered partially occluded images with a computation time of under 2 seconds."

Kernel-based classification methods can learn complex decision boundaries, but a kernel over unordered set inputs must somehow solve for correspondences epsivnerally a computationally expensive task that becomes impractical for large set sizes. We present a new fast kernel function which maps unordered feature sets to multi-resolution histograms and computes a weighted histogram intersection in this space. This \"pyramid match\" computation is linear in the number of features, and it implicitly finds correspondences based on the finest resolution histogram cell where a matched pair first appears. Since the kernel does not penalize the presence of extra features, it is robust to clutter. We show the kernel function is positive-definite, making it valid for use in learning algorithms whose optimal solutions are guaranteed only for Mercer kernels. We demonstrate our algorithm on object recognition tasks and show it to be accurate and dramatically faster than current approaches"

The work draws together two powerful formulations: pictorial structures (PS) and Markov random fields (MRFs) both of which have efficient algorithms for their solution. The resulting combination, which we call the object category specific MRF, suggests a solution to the problem that has long dogged MRFs namely that they provide a poor prior for specific shapes. In contrast, our model provides a prior that is global across the image plane using the PS. We develop an efficient method, OBJ CUT, to obtain segmentations using this model. Novel aspects of this method include an efficient algorithm for sampling the PS model, and the observation that the expected log likelihood of the model can be increased by a single graph cut. Results are presented on two object categories, cows and horses. We compare our methods to the state of the art in object category specific image segmentation and demonstrate significant improvements."

After reviewing existing edge and gradient based descriptors, we show experimentally that grids of histograms of oriented gradient (HOG) descriptors significantly outperform existing feature sets for human detection. We study the influence of each stage of the computation on performance, concluding that fine-scale gradients, fine orientation binning, relatively coarse spatial binning, and high-quality local contrast normalization in overlapping descriptor blocks are all important for good results. The new approach gives near-perfect separation on the original MIT pedestrian database, so we introduce a more challenging dataset containing over 1800 annotated human images with a large range of pose variations and backgrounds."

The object is represented by a set of viewpoint invariant region descriptors so that recognition can proceed successfully despite changes in viewpoint, illumination and partial occlusion. The temporal continuity of the video within a shot is used to track the regions in order to reject unstable regions and reduce the effects of noise in the descriptors. The analogy with text retrieval is in the implementation where matches on descriptors are pre-computed (using vector quantization), and inverted file systems and document rankings are used. The result is that retrieved is immediate, returning a ranked list of key frames/shots in the manner of Google. The method is illustrated for matching in two full length feature films."

In recent years a variety of approaches have been proposed, and impressive results have been reported on a variety of databases. This paper systematically evaluates (1) various local shape descriptors, namely Shape Context and Local Chamfer descriptor and (2) four different interest point detectors for the detection of pedestrians. Those results are compared to the standard global Chamfer matching approach. A main result of the paper is that Shape Context trained on real edge images rather than on clean pedestrian silhouettes combined with the Hessian-Laplace detector outperforms all other tested approaches."

This approach is quite flexible, and permits recognition based on color, texture, and particularly shape, in a homogeneous framework. While nearest neighbor classifiers are natural in this setting, they suffer from the problem of high variance (in bias-variance decomposition) in the case of limited sampling. Alternatively, one could use support vector machines but they involve time-consuming optimization and computation of pairwise distances. We propose a hybrid of these two methods which deals naturally with the multiclass setting, has reasonable computational complexity both in training and at run time, and yields excellent results in practice. The basic idea is to find close neighbors to a query sample and train a local support vector machine that preserves the distance function on the collection of neighbors. Our method can be applied to large, multiclass data sets for which it outperforms nearest neighbor and support vector machines, and remains efficient when the problem becomes intractable for support vector machines. A wide variety of distance functions can be used and our experiments show state-of-the-art performance on a number of benchmark data sets for shape and texture classification (MNIST, USPS, CUReT) and object recognition (Caltech- 101). On Caltech-101 we achieved a correct classification rate of 59.05%(\u00b10.56%) at 15 training images per class, and 66.23%(\u00b10.48%) at 30 training images."

Specifically, our proposed method exceeds the state of the art on the Caltech-101 database and achieves high accuracy on a large database of fifteen natural scene categories. The spatial pyramid framework also offers insights into the success of several recently proposed image descriptions, including Torralba\u2019s \"gist\" and Lowe\u2019s SIFT descriptors."

Clustering is often a key step in object recognition and is penalized by the high dimensionality of the descriptors. Indeed, local descriptors, such as SIFT, which have shown excellent results in recognition, are high-dimensional and live in different low-dimensional subspaces. We therefore use a subspace clustering method called High-Dimensional Data Clustering (HDDC) which overcomes the curse of dimensionality. Furthermore, in many cases only a few of the clusters are useful to discriminate the object. We, thus, evaluate the discriminative capacity of clusters and use it to compute the probability that a local descriptor belongs to the object. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our probabilistic approach for object localization and show that subspace clustering gives better results compared to standard clustering methods. Furthermore, our approach outperforms existing results for the Pascal 2005 dataset."

Graph cuts are used to find the globally optimal segmentation of the N-dimensional image. The obtained solution gives the best balance of boundary and region properties among all segmentations satisfying the constraints. The topology of our segmentation is unrestricted and both \"object\" and \"background\" segments may consist of several isolated parts. Some experimental results are presented in the context of photo/video editing and medical image segmentation. We also demonstrate an interesting Gestalt example. A fast implementation of our segmentation method is possible via a new max-flow algorithm."

In particular, for large learning tasks with many training examples on the shelf optimization techniques for general quadratic programs quickly become intractable in their memory and time requirements. SVM light is an implementation of an SVM learner which addresses the problem of large tasks.
