                "text": "The explosion of the Internet provides us with a tremendous resource of images shared online. It also confronts vision researchers the problem of finding effective methods to navigate the vast amount of visual information. Semantic image understanding plays a vital role towards solving this problem. One important task in image understanding is object recognition, in particular, generic object categorization. Critical to this problem are the issues of learning and dataset. Abundant data helps to train a robust recognition system, while a good object classifier can help to collect a large amount of images. This paper presents a novel object recognition algorithm that performs automatic dataset collecting and incremental model learning simultaneously. The goal of this work is to use the tremendous resources of the web to learn robust object category models for detecting and searching for objects in real-world cluttered scenes. Humans contiguously update the knowledge of objects when new examples are observed. Our framework emulates this human learning process by iteratively accumulating model knowledge and image examples. We adapt a non-parametric latent topic model and propose an incremental learning framework. Our algorithm is capable of automatically collecting much larger object category datasets for 22 randomly selected classes from the Caltech 101 dataset. Furthermore, our system offers not only more images in each object category but also a robust object category model and meaningful image annotation. Our experiments show that OPTIMOL is capable of collecting image datasets that are superior to the well known manually collected object datasets Caltech 101 and LabelMe."

Semi-supervised approaches using a small number of labeled examples together with many un-labeled examples are often unreliable as they frequently produce an internally consistent, but nevertheless incorrect set of extractions. We propose that this problem can be overcome by simultaneously learning classifiers for many different categories and relations in the presence of an ontology defining constraints that couple the training of these classifiers. Experimental results show that simultaneously learning a coupled collection of classifiers for 30 categories and relations results in much more accurate extractions than training classifiers individually."

However, existing techniques restrict these properties to categorical labels (for example, a person is \u2018smiling\u2019 or not, a scene is \u2018dry\u2019 or not), and thus fail to capture more general semantic relationships. We propose to model relative attributes. Given training data stating how object/scene categories relate according to different attributes, we learn a ranking function per attribute. The learned ranking functions predict the relative strength of each property in novel images. We then build a generative model over the joint space of attribute ranking outputs, and propose a novel form of zero-shot learning in which the supervisor relates the unseen object category to previously seen objects via attributes (for example, \u2018bears are furrier than giraffes\u2019). We further show how the proposed relative attributes enable richer textual descriptions for new images, which in practice are more precise for human interpretation. We demonstrate the approach on datasets of faces and natural scenes, and show its clear advantages over traditional binary attribute prediction for these new tasks."

Most approaches use co-occurrence of \"nouns\" and image features over large datasets to determine the correspondence, but many correspondence ambiguities remain. We further constrain the correspondence problem by exploiting additional language constructs to improve the learning process from weakly labeled data. We consider both \"prepositions\" and \"comparative adjectives\" which are used to express relationships between objects. If the models of such relationships can be determined, they help resolve correspondence ambiguities. However, learning models of these relationships requires solving the correspondence problem. We simultaneously learn the visual features defining \"nouns\" and the differential visual features defining such \"binary-relationships\" using an EM-based approach."

This setup has hardly been studied in computer vision research, but it is the rule rather than the exception, because the world contains tens of thousands of different object classes and for only a very few of them image, collections have been formed and annotated with suitable class labels. In this paper, we tackle the problem by introducing attribute-based classification. It performs object detection based on a human-specified high-level description of the target objects instead of training images. The description consists of arbitrary semantic attributes, like shape, color or even geographic information. Because such properties transcend the specific learning task at hand, they can be pre-learned, e.g. from image datasets unrelated to the current task. Afterwards, new classes can be detected based on their attribute representation, without the need for a new training phase. In order to evaluate our method and to facilitate research in this area, we have assembled a new large-scale dataset, \u201cAnimals with Attributes\u201d, of over 30,000 animal images that match the 50 classes in Osherson's classic table of how strongly humans associate 85 semantic attributes with animal classes. Our experiments show that by using an attribute layer it is indeed possible to build a learning object detection system that does not require any training images of the target classes."

But exactly how such data can be harnessed and organized remains a critical problem. We introduce here a new database called \u201cImageNet\u201d, a large-scale ontology of images built upon the backbone of the WordNet structure. ImageNet aims to populate the majority of the 80,000 synsets of WordNet with an average of 500-1000 clean and full resolution images. This will result in tens of millions of annotated images organized by the semantic hierarchy of WordNet. This paper offers a detailed analysis of ImageNet in its current state: 12 subtrees with 5247 synsets and 3.2 million images in total. We show that ImageNet is much larger in scale and diversity and much more accurate than the current image datasets. Constructing such a large-scale database is a challenging task. We describe the data collection scheme with Amazon Mechanical Turk. Lastly, we illustrate the usefulness of ImageNet through three simple applications in object recognition, image classification and automatic object clustering. We hope that the scale, accuracy, diversity and hierarchical structure of ImageNet can offer unparalleled opportunities to researchers in the computer vision community and beyond."

Doing so allows us not only to name familiar objects, but also: to report unusual aspects of a familiar object (\u201cspotty dog\u201d, not just \u201cdog\u201d); to say something about unfamiliar objects (\u201chairy and four-legged\u201d, not just \u201cunknown\u201d); and to learn how to recognize new objects with few or no visual examples. Rather than focusing on identity assignment, we make inferring attributes the core problem of recognition. These attributes can be semantic (\u201cspotty\u201d) or discriminative (\u201cdogs have it but sheep do not\u201d). Learning attributes presents a major new challenge: generalization across object categories, not just across instances within a category. In this paper, we also introduce a novel feature selection method for learning attributes that generalize well across categories. We support our claims by thorough evaluation that provides insights into the limitations of the standard recognition paradigm of naming and demonstrates the new abilities provided by our attribute-based framework."

This is a tremendously difficult task as the visual features distinguishing architectural elements of different places can be very subtle. In addition, we face a hard search problem: given all possible patches in all images, which of them are both frequently occurring and geographically informative? To address these issues, we propose to use a discriminative clustering approach able to take into account the weak geographic supervision. We show that geographically representative image elements can be discovered automatically from Google Street View imagery in a discriminative manner. We demonstrate that these elements are visually interpretable and perceptually geo-informative. The discovered visual elements can also support a variety of computational geography tasks, such as mapping architectural correspondences and influences within and across cities, finding representative elements at different geo-spatial scales, and geographically-informed image retrieval."

These images come with varying degrees of label information. \"Clean labels\" can be manually obtained on a small fraction, \"noisy labels\" may be extracted automatically from surrounding text, while for most images there are no labels at all. Semi-supervised learning is a principled framework for combining these different label sources. However, it scales polynomially with the number of images, making it impractical for use on gigantic collections with hundreds of millions of images and thousands of classes. In this paper we show how to utilize recent results in machine learning to obtain highly efficient approximations for semi-supervised learning that are linear in the number of images. Specifically, we use the convergence of the eigenvectors of the normalized graph Laplacian to eigenfunctions of weighted Laplace-Beltrami operators. Our algorithm enables us to apply semi-supervised learning to a database of 80 million images gathered from the Internet."

Most current approaches rely on modeling the relationships between object categories as a source of context. In this paper we seek to move beyond categories to provide a richer appearance-based model of context. We present an exemplar-based model of objects and their relationships, the Visual Memex, that encodes both local appearance and 2D spatial context between object instances. We evaluate our model on Torralba's proposed Context Challenge against a baseline category-based system. Our experiments suggest that moving beyond categories for context modeling appears to be quite beneficial, and may be the critical missing ingredient in scene understanding systems."

Existing semi-supervised approaches are typically unreliable and face semantic drift because the learning task is under-constrained. This is primarily because they ignore the strong interactions that often exist between scene categories, such as the common attributes shared across categories as well as the attributes which make one scene different from another. The goal of this paper is to exploit these relationships and constrain the semi-supervised learning problem. For example, the knowledge that an image is an auditorium can improve labeling of amphitheaters by enforcing constraint that an amphitheater image should have more circular structures than an auditorium image. We propose constraints based on mutual exclusion, binary attributes and comparative attributes and show that they help us to constrain the learning problem and avoid semantic drift. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments, including results on a very large dataset of one million images."

A multi-modal approach employing both text, meta data and visual features is used to gather many, high-quality images from the Web. Candidate images are obtained by a text based Web search querying on the object identifier (the word penguin). The Web pages and the images they contain are downloaded. The task is then to remove irrelevant images and re-rank the remainder. First, the images are re-ranked using a Bayes posterior estimator trained on the text surrounding the image and meta data features (such as the image alternative tag, image title tag, and image filename). No visual information is used at this stage. Second, the top-ranked images are used as (noisy) training data and a SVM visual classifier is learnt to improve the ranking further. The principal novelty is in combining text/meta-data and visual features in order to achieve a completely automatic ranking of the images. Examples are given for a selection of animals (e.g. camels, sharks, penguins), vehicles (cars, airplanes, bikes) and other classes (guitar, wristwatch), totalling 18 classes. The results are assessed by precision/recall curves on ground truth annotated data and by comparison to previous approaches including those of Berg et al. (on an additional six classes) and Fergus et al."

In this work we propose to incorporate semantic object context as a post-processing step into any off-the-shelf object categorization model. Using a conditional random field (CRF) framework, our approach maximizes object label agreement according to contextual relevance. We compare two sources of context: one learned from training data and another queried from Google Sets. The overall performance of the proposed framework is evaluated on the PASCAL and MSRC datasets. Our findings conclude that incorporating context into object categorization greatly improves categorization accuracy."

In particular, we consider a problem setting motivated by the task of learning to classify web pages, in which the description of each example can be partitioned into two distinct views. For example, the description of a web page can be partitioned into the words occurring on that page, and the words occurring in hyperlinks t,hat point to that page. We assume that either view of the example would be sufficient for learning if we had enough labeled data, but our goal is to use both views together to allow inexpensive unlabeled data to augment, a much smaller set of labeled examples. Specifically, the presence of two distinct views of each example suggests strategies in which two learning algorithms are trained separately on each view, and then each algorithm\u2019s predictions on new unlabeled examples are used to enlarge the training set of the other. Our goal in this paper is to provide a PAC-style analysis for this setting, and, more broadly, a PAC-style framework for the general problem of learning from both labeled and unlabeled data. We also provide empirical results on real web-page data indicating that this use of unlabeled examples can lead to significant improvement of hypotheses in practice. *This research was supported in part by the DARPA HPKB program under contract F30602-97-1-0215 and by NSF National Young investigator grant CCR-9357793.

Existing multi-class active learning approaches have focused on utilizing classification uncertainty of regions to select the most ambiguous region for labeling. These approaches, however, ignore the contextual interactions between different regions of the image and the fact that knowing the label for one region provides information about the labels of other regions. For example, the knowledge of a region being sea is informative about regions satisfying the \u201con\u201d relationship with respect to it, since they are highly likely to be boats. We explicitly model the contextual interactions between regions and select the question which leads to the maximum reduction in the combined entropy of all the regions in the image (image entropy). We also introduce a new methodology of posing labeling questions, mimicking the way humans actively learn about their environment. In these questions, we utilize the regions linked to a concept with high confidence as anchors, to pose questions about the uncertain regions. For example, if we can recognize water in an image then we can use the region associated with water as an anchor to pose questions such as \u201cwhat is above water?\u201d. Our active learning framework also introduces questions which help in actively learning contextual concepts. For example, our approach asks the annotator: \u201cWhat is the relationship between boat and water?\u201d and utilizes the answer to reduce the image entropies throughout the training dataset and obtain more relevant training examples for appearance models."

We explicitly train it to distinguish objects with a well-defined boundary in space, such as cows and telephones, from amorphous background elements, such as grass and road. The measure combines in a Bayesian framework several image cues measuring characteristics of objects, such as appearing different from their surroundings and having a closed boundary. This includes an innovative cue measuring the closed boundary characteristic. In experiments on the challenging PASCAL VOC 07 dataset, we show this new cue to outperform a state-of-the-art saliency measure [17], and the combined measure to perform better than any cue alone. Finally, we show how to sample windows from an image according to their objectness distribution and give an algorithm to employ them as location priors for modern class-specific object detectors. In experiments on PASCAL VOC 07 we show this greatly reduces the number of windows evaluated by class-specific object detectors."

                "text": "We demonstrate a method for identifying images containing categories of animals. The images we classify depict animals in a wide range of aspects, configurations and appearances. In addition, the images typically portray multiple species that differ in appearance (e.g. ukari\u2019s, vervet monkeys, spider monkeys, rhesus monkeys, etc.). Our method is accurate despite this variation and relies on four simple cues: text, color, shape and texture. Visual cues are evaluated by a voting method that compares local image phenomena with a number of visual exemplars for the category. The visual exemplars are obtained using a clustering method applied to text on web pages. The only supervision required involves identifying which clusters of exemplars refer to which sense of a term (for example, \"monkey\" can refer to an animal or a bandmember). Because our method is applied to web pages with free text, the word cue is extremely noisy. We show unequivocal evidence that visual information improves performance for our task. Our method allows us to produce large, accurate and challenging visual datasets mostly automatically."

However, scene understanding research has been constrained by the limited scope of currently-used databases which do not capture the full variety of scene categories. Whereas standard databases for object categorization contain hundreds of different classes of objects, the largest available dataset of scene categories contains only 15 classes. In this paper we propose the extensive Scene UNderstanding (SUN) database that contains 899 categories and 130,519 images. We use 397 well-sampled categories to evaluate numerous state-of-the-art algorithms for scene recognition and establish new bounds of performance. We measure human scene classification performance on the SUN database and compare this with computational methods. Additionally, we study a finer-grained scene representation to detect scenes embedded inside of larger scenes."

Typically the vision researcher has already determined the dataset\u2019s scope, the labels \u201cactively\u201d obtained are in fact already known, and/or the crowd-sourced collection process is iteratively fine-tuned. We present an approach for live learning of object detectors, in which the system autonomously refines its models by actively requesting crowd-sourced annotations on images crawled from the Web. To address the technical issues such a large-scale system entails, we introduce a novel part-based detector amenable to linear classifiers, and show how to identify its most uncertain instances in sub-linear time with a hashing-based solution. We demonstrate the approach with experiments of unprecedented scale and autonomy, and show it successfully improves the state-of-the-art for the most challenging objects in the PASCAL VOC benchmark. In addition, we show our detector competes well with popular nonlinear classifiers that are much more expensive to train."

In our method, each image claims its own code in a way that maintains discrimination while being predictable from visual data. Category memberships are usually good proxies for visual similarity but should not be enforced as a hard constraint. Our method learns codes that maximize separability of categories unless there is strong visual evidence against it. Simple linear SVMs can achieve state-of-the-art results with our short codes. In fact, our method produces state-of-the-art results on Caltech256 with only 128-dimensional bit vectors and outperforms state of the art by using longer codes. We also evaluate our method on ImageNet and show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art binary code methods on this large scale dataset. Lastly, our codes can discover a discriminative set of attributes."

We propose to automatically populate it with pixelwise segmentations, by leveraging existing manual annotations in the form of class labels and bounding-boxes. The key idea is to recursively exploit images segmented so far to guide the segmentation of new images. At each stage this propagation process expands into the images which are easiest to segment at that point in time, e.g. by moving to the semantically most related classes to those segmented so far. The propagation of segmentation occurs both (a) at the image level, by transferring existing segmentations to estimate the probability of a pixel to be foreground, and (b) at the class level, by jointly segmenting images of the same class and by importing the appearance models of classes that are already segmented. Through an experiment on 577 classes and 500k images we show that our technique (i) annotates a wide range of classes with accurate segmentations; (ii) effectively exploits the hierarchical structure of ImageNet; (iii) scales efficiently; (iv) outperforms a baseline GrabCut [1] initialized on the image center, as well as our recent segmentation transfer technique [2] on which this paper is based. Moreover, our method also delivers state-of-the-art results on the recent iCoseg dataset for co-segmentation."

We define iconic images as high-quality representatives of a large group of images consistent both in appearance and semantics. To find such groups, we perform joint clustering in the space of global image descriptors and latent topic vectors of tags associated with the images. To select the representative iconic images for the joint clusters, we use a quality ranking learned from a large collection of labeled images. For the purposes of visualization, iconic images are grouped by semantic ldquothemerdquo and multidimensional scaling is used to compute a 2D layout that reflects the relationships between the themes. Results on four large-scale datasets demonstrate the ability of our approach to discover plausible themes and recurring visual motifs for challenging abstract concepts such as ldquoloverdquo and ldquobeautyrdquo."

Training linear SVMs however is quite expensive, and can become intractable as the number of categories increase. In this work we revisit a much older technique, viz. Linear Discriminant Analysis, and show that LDA models can be trained almost trivially, and with little or no loss in performance. The covariance matrices we estimate capture properties of natural images. Whitening HOG features with these covariances thus removes naturally occuring correlations between the HOG features. We show that these whitened features (which we call WHO) are considerably better than the original HOG features for computing similarities, and prove their usefulness in clustering. Finally, we use our findings to produce an object detection system that is competitive on PASCAL VOC 2007 while being considerably easier to train and test."

The idea lies in augmenting an existing attribute-based representation with additional dimensions for which an autoencoder model is coupled with a large-margin principle. This construction allows a smooth transition between the zero-shot regime with no training example, the unsupervised regime with training examples but without class labels, and the supervised regime with training examples and with class labels. The resulting optimization problem can be solved efficiently, because several of the necessity steps have closed-form solutions. Through extensive experiments we show that the augmented representation achieves better results in terms of object categorization accuracy than the semantic representation alone."

Our system is able to represent highly variable object classes and achieves state-of-the-art results in the PASCAL object detection challenges. While deformable part models have become quite popular, their value had not been demonstrated on difficult benchmarks such as the PASCAL data sets. Our system relies on new methods for discriminative training with partially labeled data. We combine a margin-sensitive approach for data-mining hard negative examples with a formalism we call latent SVM. A latent SVM is a reformulation of MI--SVM in terms of latent variables. A latent SVM is semiconvex, and the training problem becomes convex once latent information is specified for the positive examples. This leads to an iterative training algorithm that alternates between fixing latent values for positive examples and optimizing the latent SVM objective function."

The model is based on a set of parts which describe the expected appearance and position, in an object centered coordinate frame, of features detected by a low-level interest operator. Each object category then has its own distribution over these parts, which are shared between objects. We learn the parameters of this model via a Gibbs sampler which uses the graphical model's structure to analytically average over many parameters. Applied to a database of images of isolated objects, the sharing of parts among objects improves detection accuracy when few training examples are available. We also extend this hierarchical framework to scenes containing multiple objects"

The procedure is based on a very low dimensional representation of the scene, that we term the Spatial Envelope. We propose a set of perceptual dimensions (naturalness, openness, roughness, expansion, ruggedness) that represent the dominant spatial structure of a scene. Then, we show that these dimensions may be reliably estimated using spectral and coarsely localized information. The model generates a multidimensional space in which scenes sharing membership in semantic categories (e.g., streets, highways, coasts) are projected closed together. The performance of the spatial envelope model shows that specific information about object shape or identity is not a requirement for scene categorization and that modeling a holistic representation of the scene informs about its probable semantic category."

This paper shows that early fusion of shape and color, as is popular in image classification, leads to a significant drop in performance for object detection. Moreover, such approaches also yields suboptimal results for object categories with varying importance of color and shape. In this paper we propose the use of color attributes as an explicit color representation for object detection. Color attributes are compact, computationally efficient, and when combined with traditional shape features provide state-of-the-art results for object detection. Our method is tested on the PASCAL VOC 2007 and 2009 datasets and results clearly show that our method improves over state-of-the-art techniques despite its simplicity. We also introduce a new dataset consisting of cartoon character images in which color plays a pivotal role. On this dataset, our approach yields a significant gain of 14% in mean AP over conventional state-of-the-art methods."

After reviewing existing edge and gradient based descriptors, we show experimentally that grids of histograms of oriented gradient (HOG) descriptors significantly outperform existing feature sets for human detection. We study the influence of each stage of the computation on performance, concluding that fine-scale gradients, fine orientation binning, relatively coarse spatial binning, and high-quality local contrast normalization in overlapping descriptor blocks are all important for good results. The new approach gives near-perfect separation on the original MIT pedestrian database, so we introduce a more challenging dataset containing over 1800 annotated human images with a large range of pose variations and backgrounds."

We formulate features that respond to characteristic changes in brightness, color, and texture associated with natural boundaries. In order to combine the information from these features in an optimal way, we train a classifier using human labeled images as ground truth. The output of this classifier provides the posterior probability of a boundary at each image location and orientation. We present precision-recall curves showing that the resulting detector significantly outperforms existing approaches. Our two main results are 1) that cue combination can be performed adequately with a simple linear model and 2) that a proper, explicit treatment of texture is required to detect boundaries in natural images."

When people play the game they help determine the contents of images by providing meaningful labels for them. If the game is played as much as popular online games, we estimate that most images on the Web can be labeled in a few months. Having proper labels associated with each image on the Web would allow for more accurate image search, improve the accessibility of sites (by providing descriptions of images to visually impaired individuals), and help users block inappropriate images. Our system makes a significant contribution because of its valuable output and because of the way it addresses the image-labeling problem. Rather than using computer vision techniques, which don't work well enough, we encourage people to do the work by taking advantage of their desire to be entertained."

Such \u201cexemplars\u201d can be found by randomly choosing an initial subset of data points and then iteratively refining it, but this works well only if that initial choice is close to a good solution. We devised a method called \u201caffinity propagation,\u201d which takes as input measures of similarity between pairs of data points. Real-valued messages are exchanged between data points until a high-quality set of exemplars and corresponding clusters gradually emerges. We used affinity propagation to cluster images of faces, detect genes in microarray data, identify representative sentences in this manuscript, and identify cities that are efficiently accessed by airline travel. Affinity propagation found clusters with much lower error than other methods, and it did so in less than one-hundredth the amount of time."

Their major weakness is that, without costly human intervention, the extracted terms (often rapidly) drift from the meaning of the original seed terms. In this paper we propose Mutual Exclusion bootstrapping (MEB) in which multiple semantic classes compete for each extracted term. This significantly reduces the problem of semantic drift by providing boundaries for the semantic classes. We demonstrate the superiority of MEB to standard bootstrapping in extracting named entities from the Google Web 1T 5-grams. Finally, we demonstrate that MEB is a multi-way cut problem over semantic classes, terms and contexts."

In this paper, we summarize the key insights from our empirical analysis of the important elements constituting this detector. More specifically, we study the relationship between the role of deformable parts and the mixture model components within this detector, and understand their relative importance. First, we find that by increasing the number of components, and switching the initialization step from their aspect-ratio, left-right flipping heuristics to appearance-based clustering, considerable improvement in performance is obtained. But more intriguingly, we observed that with these new components, the part deformations can now be turned off, yet obtaining results that are almost on par with the original DPM detector."
