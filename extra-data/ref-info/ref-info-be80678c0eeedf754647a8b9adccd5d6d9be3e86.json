The proposed method is capable of segmenting pages with non-rectangular layout as well as with various angles of skew. The characteristics of the method are as follows: (1) thinning of the background enables us to represent white areas of any shape as connected thin lines or chains and the robustness for tilted page images is also achieved by the representation; and (2) based on this representation, the task of page segmentation is defined as to find the loops enclosing printed areas. The task is achieved by eliminating unnecessary chains using not only a feature of white areas, but also a feature of black areas divided by a chain. Based on the experimental results and the comparison with previous methods, we discuss the advantages and limitations of the proposed method."

This method is based on the analysis of the background white space that surrounds the printed regions on the page. It does not make any assumptions about the shape of the regions as opposed to most earlier approaches which assume that printed regions are rectangular. It is capable of identifying and describing regions of complex shapes more accurately than existing methods. It requires no a priori knowledge. The background white space is covered with tiles and the contour of each region is identified by tracing through these white tiles that encircle it. The method can segment page images with severe skew without skew correction. The white tiles on the image can also be used in subsequent document analysis processes such as the classification of the image regions."

Based on the extraction of the background, it offers the benefit of being adaptive to the context of the document and to be insensitive to the orientation of the text blocks. It involves a two-dimensional isotropic structuring element used to characterized the white streams. This element is a disk approximated by a regular octagon which can be recursively generated. Another advantage of the proposed method is that a hierarchical segmentation can be derived from the image built upon the octagonal pattern. This tree allows to perform an isotropic multi-scale smearing, which leads to a physical segmentation. The algorithms are based on an input-time tracing principle and use a single scan of the image, they are very well suited to a real-time implementation."

This paper describes the document spectrum (or docstrum), which is a method for structural page layout analysis based on bottom-up, nearest-neighbor clustering of page components. The method yields an accurate measure of skew, within-line, and between-line spacings and locates text lines and text blocks. It is advantageous over many other methods in three main ways: independence from skew angle, independence from different text spacings, and the ability to process local regions of different text orientations within the same image. Results of the method shown for several different page formats and for randomly oriented subpages on the same image illustrate the versatility of the method. We also discuss the differences, advantages, and disadvantages of the docstrum with respect to other lay-out methods. >"

We give the definition of a generalized (Euclidean distance measure, 2D Cartesian space, and an area based generator set) Voronoi tessellation and then present our algorithm for approximating this generalized tessellation. The algorithm is constructed from a normal point Voronoi tessellation algorithm. A parameterized Voronoi neighborhood graph (VNG) which can be derived from the tessellation is defined. A graph algorithm for grouping based on the VNG, its image elements, and Voronoi cell descriptors can then be easily derived.

The structure of the background (white space) is analyzed, assisted by an enumeration of all maximal white rectangles. For this enumeration, the most computationally expensive step, an algorithm has been developed that, aside from a sort, achieves an expected runtime linear in the number of black connected components. The crucial engineering decision is the specification of a partial order on white rectangles to express domain-specific knowledge of preferred shapes and sizes. This order determines a sequence of partial covers of the background, and thus, a sequence of nested page segmentations. In experimental trials on Manhattan layouts, good segmentations often occur early in this sequence, using a simple and uniform shape-direction rule. This is a global-to-local strategy, which for some tasks is superior to strategies currently emphasized in the literature, including bottom-up and top-down.<<ETX>>"

The generalized Voronoi diagrams treated here include Voronoi diagrams for figures, additively weighted Voronoi diagrams, Voronoi diagrams in a river, Voronoi diagrams in a Riemannian plane, and Voronoi diagrams with respect to collision-avoiding shortest paths. The construction of these generalized Voronoi diagrams is reduced to the construction of the ordinary Voronoi diagrams. The methods proposed here can save much time which is otherwise necessary for writing a computer program for each type of generalized Voronoi diagram."

The algorithm outputs two images, one containing text strings and the other graphics. These images can then be processed by suitable character recognition and graphics recognition systems. The performance of the algorithm, both in terms of its effectiveness and computational efficiency, was evaluated using several test images and showed superior performance compared to other techniques. >"

This board employs the boundary tracking method and does not require a working memory for temporary labels, and thus it can process labels in size 512*512 images without restricting the maximum numbers of connected regions. It can also count holes within regions, and control labeling by using the perimeter of regions, at the same time of labelling. The processing time is 50 msec for size 512*512 real images.<<ETX>>"

This is achieved by exploiting a small number of nearly universal typesetting and layout conventions. The system does not require prior knowledge of page orientation (module 90/spl deg/), and copes well with nonzero skew and shear angles (within 10/spl deg/). Also it locates blocks of text without reliance on detailed a priori layout models, and in spite of unknown or mixed horizontal and vertical text-line orientations. Within blocks, it infers text-line orientation and isolates lines, without knowledge of the language, symbol set, text sizes, or the number of text lines. Segmentation into words and symbols, and determination of reading order, normally require some knowledge of the language: this is held to minimum by relying on shape-driven algorithms. The underlying algorithms are based on Fourier theory, digital signal processing, computational geometry, and statistical decision theory. Most of the computation occurs within algorithms that possess unambiguous semantics (that is, heuristics are kept to a minimum). The effectiveness of the method on English, Japanese, Hebrew, Thai, and Korean documents is discussed.<<ETX>>"
