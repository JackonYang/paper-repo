Our method is based on higher order conditional random fields and uses potentials defined on sets of pixels (image segments) generated using unsupervised segmentation algorithms. These potentials enforce label consistency in image regions and can be seen as a generalization of the commonly used pairwise contrast sensitive smoothness potentials. The higher order potential functions used in our framework take the form of the Robust Pn model and are more general than the Pn Potts model recently proposed by Kohli et al. We prove that the optimal swap and expansion moves for energy functions composed of these potentials can be computed by solving a st-mincut problem. This enables the use of powerful graph cut based move making algorithms for performing inference in the framework. We test our method on the problem of multi-class object segmentation by augmenting the conventional crf used for object segmentation with higher order potentials defined on image regions. Experiments on challenging data sets show that integration of higher order potentials quantitatively and qualitatively improves results leading to much better definition of object boundaries. We believe that this method can be used to yield similar improvements for many other labelling problems."

It is well known that each quantisation has its fair share of pros and cons; and the existence of a common optimal quantisation level suitable for all object categories is highly unlikely. Motivated by this observation, we propose a hierarchical random field model, that allows integration of features computed at different levels of the quantisation hierarchy. MAP inference in this model can be performed efficiently using powerful graph cut based move making algorithms. Our framework generalises much of the previous work based on pixels or segments. We evaluate its efficiency on some of the most challenging data-sets for object class segmentation, and show it obtains state-of-the-art results."

For accurate labeling it is important to capture the global context of the image as well as local information. We introduce a CRF based scene labeling model that incorporates both local features and features aggregated over the whole image or large sections of it. Secondly, traditional CRF learning requires fully labeled datasets which can be costly and troublesome to produce. We introduce a method for learning CRFs from datasets with many unlabeled nodes by marginalizing out the unknown labels so that the log-likelihood of the known ones can be maximized by gradient ascent. Loopy Belief Propagation is used to approximate the marginals needed for the gradient and log-likelihood calculations and the Bethe free-energy approximation to the log-likelihood is monitored to control the step size. Our experimental results show that effective models can be learned from fragmentary labelings and that incorporating top-down aggregate features significantly improves the segmentations. The resulting segmentations are compared to the state-of-the-art on three different image datasets."

Each layer is modeled as a conditional field that allows one to capture arbitrary observation-dependent label interactions. The proposed framework has two main advantages. First, it encodes both the short-range interactions (e.g., pixelwise label smoothing) as well as the long-range interactions (e.g., relative configurations of objects or regions) in a tractable manner. Second, the formulation is general enough to be applied to different domains ranging from pixelwise image labeling to contextual object detection. The parameters of the model are learned using a sequential maximum-likelihood approximation. The benefits of the proposed framework are demonstrated on four different datasets and comparison results are presented"

Our system scores low-level patches according to their class re levance, propagates these posterior probabilities to pixels and uses low- level segmentation to guide the semantic segmentation. The two main contributions of this paper are as follows. First, for the patch scoring, we describe each patch with a high-level descriptor based on the Fisher kernel and use a s et of linear classifiers. While the Fisher kernel methodology was shown t o lead to high accuracy for image classification, it has not been applied to the segmentation problem. Second, we use global image classifiers to take into account the context of the objects to be segmented. If an image as a whole is unlikely to contain an object class, then the corresponding class is not considered in the segmentation pipeline. This increases the classification a ccuracy and reduces the computational cost. We will show that despite its apparent simplicity, this system provides above state-of-the-art performance on the PASCAL VOC 2007 dataset and state-of-the-art performance on the MSRC 21 dataset."

The object hypotheses are represented as figure-ground segmentations, and are extracted automatically, without prior knowledge about properties of individual object classes, by solving a sequence of constrained parametric min-cut problems (CPMC) on a regular image grid. We then learn to rank the object hypotheses by training a continuous model to predict how plausible the segments are, given their mid-level region properties. We show that this algorithm significantly outperforms the state of the art for low-level segmentation in the VOC09 segmentation dataset. It achieves the same average best segmentation covering as the best performing technique to date [2], 0.61 when using just the top 7 ranked segments, instead of the full hierarchy in [2]. Our method achieves 0.78 average best covering using 154 segments. In a companion paper [18], we also show that the algorithm achieves state-of-the art results when used in a segmentation-based recognition pipeline."

One important type of global feature is that of inter-class spatial relationships. For example, identifying \u201ctree\u201d pixels indicates that pixels above and to the sides are more likely to be \u201csky\u201d whereas pixels below are more likely to be \u201cgrass.\u201d Incorporating such global information across the entire image and between all classes is a computational challenge as it is image-dependent, and hence, cannot be precomputed.In this work we propose a method for capturing global information from inter-class spatial relationships and encoding it as a local feature. We employ a two-stage classification process to label all image pixels. First, we generate predictions which are used to compute a local relative location feature from learned relative location maps. In the second stage, we combine this with appearance-based features to provide a final segmentation. We compare our results to recent published results on several multi-class image segmentation databases and show that the incorporation of relative location information allows us to significantly outperform the current state-of-the-art."

The work draws together two powerful formulations: pictorial structures (PS) and Markov random fields (MRFs) both of which have efficient algorithms for their solution. The resulting combination, which we call the object category specific MRF, suggests a solution to the problem that has long dogged MRFs namely that they provide a poor prior for specific shapes. In contrast, our model provides a prior that is global across the image plane using the PS. We develop an efficient method, OBJ CUT, to obtain segmentations using this model. Novel aspects of this method include an efficient algorithm for sampling the PS model, and the observation that the expected log likelihood of the model can be increased by a single graph cut. Results are presented on two object categories, cows and horses. We compare our methods to the state of the art in object category specific image segmentation and demonstrate significant improvements."

To our knowledge, this is the first model that performs all three tasks in one coherent framework. For instance, a scene of a `polo game' consists of several visual objects such as `human', `horse', `grass', etc. In addition, it can be further annotated with a list of more abstract (e.g. `dusk') or visually less salient (e.g. `saddle') tags. Our generative model jointly explains images through a visual model and a textual model. Visually relevant objects are represented by regions and patches, while visually irrelevant textual annotations are influenced directly by the overall scene class. We propose a fully automatic learning framework that is able to learn robust scene models from noisy Web data such as images and user tags from Flickr.com. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework by automatically classifying, annotating and segmenting images from eight classes depicting sport scenes. In all three tasks, our model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms."

The learned model is used for automatic visual understanding and semantic segmentation of photographs. Our discriminative model exploits texture-layout filters, novel features based on textons, which jointly model patterns of texture and their spatial layout. Unary classification and feature selection is achieved using shared boosting to give an efficient classifier which can be applied to a large number of classes. Accurate image segmentation is achieved by incorporating the unary classifier in a conditional random field, which (i) captures the spatial interactions between class labels of neighboring pixels, and (ii) improves the segmentation of specific object instances. Efficient training of the model on large datasets is achieved by exploiting both random feature selection and piecewise training methods.\n\nHigh classification and segmentation accuracy is demonstrated on four varied databases: (i) the MSRC 21-class database containing photographs of real objects viewed under general lighting conditions, poses and viewpoints, (ii) the 7-class Corel subset and (iii) the 7-class Sowerby database used in He et\u00a0al. (Proceeding of IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, vol.\u00a02, pp.\u00a0695\u2013702, June 2004), and (iv) a set of video sequences of television shows. The proposed algorithm gives competitive and visually pleasing results for objects that are highly textured (grass, trees, etc.), highly structured (cars, faces, bicycles, airplanes, etc.), and even articulated (body, cow, etc.).\n"

We present an approach to multi-class segmentation which combines two methods for this integration: a Conditional Random Field (CRF) which couples to local image features and an image classification method which considers global features. The CRF follows the approach of Reynolds & Murphy (2007) and is based on an unsupervised multi scale pre-segmentation of the image into patches, where patch labels correspond to the random variables of the CRF. The output of the classifier is used to constraint this CRF. We demonstrate and compare the approach on a standard semantic segmentation data set."

These are ensembles of decision trees that act directly on image pixels, and therefore do not need the expensive computation of filter-bank responses or local descriptors. They are extremely fast to both train and test, especially compared with k-means clustering and nearest-neighbor assignment of feature descriptors. The nodes in the trees provide (i) an implicit hierarchical clustering into semantic textons, and (ii) an explicit local classification estimate. Our second contribution, the bag of semantic textons, combines a histogram of semantic textons over an image region with a region prior category distribution. The bag of semantic textons is computed over the whole image for categorization, and over local rectangular regions for segmentation. Including both histogram and region prior allows our segmentation algorithm to exploit both textural and semantic context. Our third contribution is an image-level prior for segmentation that emphasizes those categories that the automatic categorization believes to be present. We evaluate on two datasets including the very challenging VOC 2007 segmentation dataset. Our results significantly advance the state-of-the-art in segmentation accuracy, and furthermore, our use of efficient decision forests gives at least a five-fold increase in execution speed."

However, these frameworks tend to exploit the provided bounding box merely to exclude its exterior from consideration and sometimes to initialize the energy minimization. In this paper, we discuss how the bounding box can be further used to impose a powerful topological prior, which prevents the solution from excessive shrinking and ensures that the user-provided box bounds the segmentation in a sufficiently tight way. The prior is expressed using hard constraints incorporated into the global energy minimization framework leading to an NP-hard integer program. We then investigate the possible optimization strategies including linear relaxation as well as a new graph cut algorithm called pinpointing. The latter can be used either as a rounding method for the fractional LP solution, which is provably better than thresholding-based rounding, or as a fast standalone heuristic. We evaluate the proposed algorithms on a publicly available dataset, and demonstrate the practical benefits of the new prior both qualitatively and quantitatively."

Natural language researchers have made great progress by exploiting the 1D structure of language to design efficient polynomial-time parsing algorithms. By contrast, the two-dimensional nature of images makes it much harder to design efficient image parsers and the form of the hierarchical representations is also unclear. Attempts to adapt representations and algorithms from natural language have only been partially successful. In this paper, we propose a Hierarchical Image Model (HIM) for 2D image parsing which outputs image segmentation and object recognition. This HIM is represented by recursive segmentation and recognition templates in multiple layers and has advantages for representation, inference, and learning. Firstly, the HIM has a coarse-to-fine representation which is capable of capturing long-range dependency and exploiting different levels of contextual information. Secondly, the structure of the HIM allows us to design a rapid inference algorithm, based on dynamic programming, which enables us to parse the image rapidly in polynomial time. Thirdly, we can learn the HIM efficiently in a discriminative manner from a labeled dataset. We demonstrate that HIM outperforms other state-of-the-art methods by evaluation on the challenging public MSRC image dataset. Finally, we sketch how the HIM architecture can be extended to model more complex image phenomena."

This paper presents a large-scale evaluation of an approach that represents images as distributions (signatures or histograms) of features extracted from a sparse set of keypoint locations and learns a Support Vector Machine classifier with kernels based on two effective measures for comparing distributions, the Earth Mover\u2019s Distance and the \u03c72 distance. We first evaluate the performance of our approach with different keypoint detectors and descriptors, as well as different kernels and classifiers. We then conduct a comparative evaluation with several state-of-the-art recognition methods on four texture and five object databases. On most of these databases, our implementation exceeds the best reported results and achieves comparable performance on the rest. Finally, we investigate the influence of background correlations on recognition performance via extensive tests on the PASCAL database, for which ground-truth object localization information is available. Our experiments demonstrate that image representations based on distributions of local features are surprisingly effective for classification of texture and object images under challenging real-world conditions, including significant intra-class variations and substantial background clutter."

This technique works by partitioning the image into increasingly fine sub-regions and computing histograms of local features found inside each sub-region. The resulting \"spatial pyramid\" is a simple and computationally efficient extension of an orderless bag-of-features image representation, and it shows significantly improved performance on challenging scene categorization tasks. Specifically, our proposed method exceeds the state of the art on the Caltech-101 database and achieves high accuracy on a large database of fifteen natural scene categories. The spatial pyramid framework also offers insights into the success of several recently proposed image descriptions, including Torralba\u2019s \"gist\" and Lowe\u2019s SIFT descriptors."

The combinatorial optimization literature provides many min-cut/max-flow algorithms with different polynomial time complexity. Their practical efficiency, however, has to date been studied mainly outside the scope of computer vision. The goal of this paper is to provide an experimental comparison of the efficiency of min-cut/max flow algorithms for applications in vision. We compare the running times of several standard algorithms, as well as a new algorithm that we have recently developed. The algorithms we study include both Goldberg-Tarjan style \"push -relabel\" methods and algorithms based on Ford-Fulkerson style \"augmenting paths.\" We benchmark these algorithms on a number of typical graphs in the contexts of image restoration, stereo, and segmentation. In many cases, our new algorithm works several times faster than any of the other methods, making near real-time performance possible. An implementation of our max-flow/min-cut algorithm is available upon request for research purposes."

For a class of kernels we show that one can do this much more efficiently. In particular we show that one can build histogram intersection kernel SVMs (IKSVMs) with runtime complexity of the classifier logarithmic in the number of support vectors as opposed to linear for the standard approach. We further show that by precomputing auxiliary tables we can construct an approximate classifier with constant runtime and space requirements, independent of the number of support vectors, with negligible loss in classification accuracy on various tasks. This approximation also applies to 1 - chi2 and other kernels of similar form. We also introduce novel features based on a multi-level histograms of oriented edge energy and present experiments on various detection datasets. On the INRIA pedestrian dataset an approximate IKSVM classifier based on these features has the current best performance, with a miss rate 13% lower at 10-6 False Positive Per Window than the linear SVM detector of Dalal & Triggs. On the Daimler Chrysler pedestrian dataset IKSVM gives comparable accuracy to the best results (based on quadratic SVM), while being 15times faster. In these experiments our approximate IKSVM is up to 2000times faster than a standard implementation and requires 200times less memory. Finally we show that a 50times speedup is possible using approximate IKSVM based on spatial pyramid features on the Caltech 101 dataset with negligible loss of accuracy."

So far, intensity-based descriptors have been widely used for feature extraction at salient points. To increase illumination invariance and discriminative power, color descriptors have been proposed. Because many different descriptors exist, a structured overview is required of color invariant descriptors in the context of image category recognition. Therefore, this paper studies the invariance properties and the distinctiveness of color descriptors (software to compute the color descriptors from this paper is available from http://www.colordescriptors.com) in a structured way. The analytical invariance properties of color descriptors are explored, using a taxonomy based on invariance properties with respect to photometric transformations, and tested experimentally using a data set with known illumination conditions. In addition, the distinctiveness of color descriptors is assessed experimentally using two benchmarks, one from the image domain and one from the video domain. From the theoretical and experimental results, it can be derived that invariance to light intensity changes and light color changes affects category recognition. The results further reveal that, for light intensity shifts, the usefulness of invariance is category-specific. Overall, when choosing a single descriptor and no prior knowledge about the data set and object and scene categories is available, the OpponentSIFT is recommended. Furthermore, a combined set of color descriptors outperforms intensity-based SIFT and improves category recognition by 8 percent on the PASCAL VOC 2007 and by 7 percent on the Mediamill Challenge."

                "text": "After [15], [31], [19], [8], [25], [5], minimum cut/maximum flow algorithms on graphs emerged as an increasingly useful tool for exact or approximate energy minimization in low-level vision. The combinatorial optimization literature provides many min-cut/max-flow algorithms with different polynomial time complexity. Their practical efficiency, however, has to date been studied mainly outside the scope of computer vision. The goal of this paper is to provide an experimental comparison of the efficiency of min-cut/max flow algorithms for applications in vision. We compare the running times of several standard algorithms, as well as a new algorithm that we have recently developed. The algorithms we study include both Goldberg-Tarjan style \"push-relabel\" methods and algorithms based on Ford-Fulkerson style \"augmenting paths.\" We benchmark these algorithms on a number of typical graphs in the contexts of image restoration, stereo, and segmentation. In many cases, our new algorithm works several times faster than any of the other methods, making near real-time performance possible. An implementation of our max-flow/min-cut algorithm is available upon request for research purposes."

Each of these techniques constructs a graph such that the minimum cut on the graph also minimizes the energy. Yet, because these graph constructions are complex and highly specific to a particular energy function, graph cuts have seen limited application to date. In this paper, we give a characterization of the energy functions that can be minimized by graph cuts. Our results are restricted to functions of binary variables. However, our work generalizes many previous constructions and is easily applicable to vision problems that involve large numbers of labels, such as stereo, motion, image restoration, and scene reconstruction. We give a precise characterization of what energy functions can be minimized using graph cuts, among the energy functions that can be written as a sum of terms containing three or fewer binary variables. We also provide a general-purpose construction to minimize such an energy function. Finally, we give a necessary condition for any energy function of binary variables to be minimized by graph cuts. Researchers who are considering the use of graph cuts to optimize a particular energy function can use our results to determine if this is possible and then follow our construction to create the appropriate graph. A software implementation is freely available."
