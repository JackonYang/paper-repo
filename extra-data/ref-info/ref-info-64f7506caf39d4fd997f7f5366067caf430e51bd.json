We describe an approach called word spotting which involves grouping word images into clusters of similar words by using image matching to find similarity. By annotating \u201cinteresting\u201d clusters, an index that links words to the locations where they occur can be built automatically. Image similarities computed using a number of different techniques including dynamic time warping are compared. The word similarities are then used for clustering using both K-means and agglomerative clustering techniques. It is shown in a subset of the George Washington collection that such a word spotting technique can outperform a Hidden Markov Model word-based recognition technique in terms of word error rates."

Our aim is to address a methodology which is segmentation-free since in many cases of historical documents, the segmentation process does not produce meaningful results due to unconstraint layout, several degradations or typesetting imperfections. The proposed method is based on block-based document image descriptors that are used at a template matching process satisfying invariance in terms of translation, rotation and scaling. Improvement in terms of time expense is obtained by applying the matching process only on salient regions of the image. Experimental results on a database with representative historical printed documents prove the efficiency of the proposed approach."

In this paper, we present a word spotting system based on Hidden Markov Models (HMM) that uses trained subword models to spot keywords. With the proposed method, arbitrary keywords can be spotted that do not need to be present in the training set. Also, no text line segmentation is required. On the modern IAM off-line database and the historical George Washington database we show that the proposed system outperforms a standard template matching approach based on dynamic time warping (DTW)."

One approach is to perform Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on each document followed by indexing of the resulting text. However, if the quality of the document is poor or time is critical,complete OCR of all images is infeasible. This paper build upon previous works on Word Shape Coding to propose an alternative technique and combination of feature descriptors for keyword spotting without the use of OCR. Different sequence alignment similarity measures can be used for partial or whole word matching. The proposed technique is tolerant to serifs,font styles and certain degrees of touching, broken or overlapping characters. It improves over previous works with not only better precision and lower collision rate, but more importantly, the ability for partial matching. Experiment results show that it is about 15 times faster than OCR. It is a promising technique to boost better document image retrieval."

The approach is to take advantage of implicit higher-order structure in the association of terms with documents (\u201csemantic structure\u201d) in order to improve the detection of relevant documents on the basis of terms found in queries. The particular technique used is singular-value decomposition, in which a large term by document matrix is decomposed into a set of ca. 100 orthogonal factors from which the original matrix can be approximated by linear combination. Documents are represented by ca. 100 item vectors of factor weights. Queries are represented as pseudo-document vectors formed from weighted combinations of terms, and documents with supra-threshold cosine values are returned. initial tests find this completely automatic method for retrieval to be promising."

It performs very fast categorization of each pixel in an image, a brute-force approach made feasible by three key developments: First, our method reduces the size of a large generic dictionary (on the order of ten thousand words) to the low hundreds while increasing classification performance compared to k-means. This is achieved by creating a discriminative dictionary tailored to the task by following the information bottleneck principle. Second, we perform feature-based categorization efficiently on a dense grid by extending the concept of integral images to the computation of local histograms. Third, we compute SIFT descriptors densely in linear time. We compare our method to the state of the art and find that it excels in accuracy and simplicity, performing better while assuming less."

Availability of electronic imaging tools and effective image processing techniques makes it feasible to process the multimedia data in large databases. A framework for content-based retrieval of historical documents in the Ottoman Empire archives is presented. The documents are stored as textual images, which are compressed by constructing a library of symbols occurring in a document, and the symbols in the original image are then replaced with pointers into the codebook to obtain a compressed representation of the image. The features in wavelet and spatial domains, based on angular and distance span of shapes, are used to extract the symbols. In order to make content-based retrieval in the historical archives, a query is specified as a rectangular region in an input image and the same symbol-extraction process is applied to the query region. The queries are processed on the codebook of documents and the query images are identified in the resulting documents using the pointers in the textual images. The query process does not require decompression of images. The new content-based retrieval framework is also applicable to many other document archives using different scripts."

This technique works by partitioning the image into increasingly fine sub-regions and computing histograms of local features found inside each sub-region. The resulting \"spatial pyramid\" is a simple and computationally efficient extension of an orderless bag-of-features image representation, and it shows significantly improved performance on challenging scene categorization tasks. Specifically, our proposed method exceeds the state of the art on the Caltech-101 database and achieves high accuracy on a large database of fifteen natural scene categories. The spatial pyramid framework also offers insights into the success of several recently proposed image descriptions, including Torralba\u2019s \"gist\" and Lowe\u2019s SIFT descriptors."

This paper presents a large-scale evaluation of an approach that represents images as distributions (signatures or histograms) of features extracted from a sparse set of keypoint locations and learns a Support Vector Machine classifier with kernels based on two effective measures for comparing distributions, the Earth Mover\u2019s Distance and the \u03c72 distance. We first evaluate the performance of our approach with different keypoint detectors and descriptors, as well as different kernels and classifiers. We then conduct a comparative evaluation with several state-of-the-art recognition methods on four texture and five object databases. On most of these databases, our implementation exceeds the best reported results and achieves comparable performance on the rest. Finally, we investigate the influence of background correlations on recognition performance via extensive tests on the PASCAL database, for which ground-truth object localization information is available. Our experiments demonstrate that image representations based on distributions of local features are surprisingly effective for classification of texture and object images under challenging real-world conditions, including significant intra-class variations and substantial background clutter."
