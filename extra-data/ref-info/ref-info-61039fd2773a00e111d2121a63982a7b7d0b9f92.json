A tree is first grown to completion so that the tree partitions the training sample into terminal regions of all one class. This is usually done from the root down using a recursive partitioning algorithm. Choose a test for the root node to create a tree of depth one and partition the training set among the new leaves just created. Now apply the same-algorithm recursively to each of the leaves. The test is chosen at each stage using a greedy oneply lookahead heuristic. Experience has shown that a tree so grown will suffer from over-fitting, in the sense that nodes near the bottom of the tree represent noise in the sample, and their removal can often increase predictive accuracy, see Quinlan (1986) for an introduction. To help overcome this problem, a second process is subsequently employed to pmne back the tree, for instance using resampling or hold-out methods, such as Breiman et al. (1984) or Crawford (1989), approximate sigmficance tests such as Quinlan"

This prediction problem is the basic task of many expert systems, and is referred to in AI as the classification problem (where the prediction is referred to as the classification). The task is to learn a classifier given a training sample of classified examples. In credit assessment, classes are \u201caccept\u201d and \u201creject\u201d (the credit application). A training sample in this case would be historical records of previous loan applications together with whether the loan went bad. This generic learning task is referred to as supervised learning in pattern recognition, and induction or empirical learning in machine learning, see for instance Quinlan (1986). The statistical community uses techniques such as discriminant analysis and nearest neighbor methods, for instance described by Ripley (1987)."

The thesis is motivated by considering some current research issues in machine learning such as bias, over tting and search, and considering the requirements placed on a learning system when it is used for knowledge acquisition. Basic Bayesian decision theory relevant to the problem of learning classi cation rules is reviewed, then a Bayesian framework for such learning is presented. The framework has three components: the hypothesis space, the learning protocol, and criteria for successful learning. Several learning protocols are analysed in detail: queries, logical, noisy, uncertain and positive-only examples. The analysis is done by interpreting a protocol as a likelihood function and by performing conditional likelihood analysis. The aim of this framework and theoretical treatment is to consider how three important questions should be addressed: what actions a learner should take, whether the learner's initial subjective knowledge is appropriate, and how con dent the learner can be in results obtained. The resultant learning framework is compared and uni ed with the corresponding learning frameworks of Gold, Valiant, minimum encoding approaches such as MDL and MML, and classical methods from statistics and pattern recognition. Finally, two extensive case studies are reported. The rst case study works through conjunctive and complete hypothesis spaces to illustrate problems such as the inherent worst-case and sampleindependent analysis of the Valiantmodel and how this can be overcome in the Bayesian framework. Experiments reported indicate considerable improvements can be achieved. The second case study presents a Bayesian approach to learning decision trees based on the theory presented for the uncertain examples protocol. Experiments reported indicate the approach compares favourably with existing decision tree methods. The Bayesian method presented should readily transfer to the learning of disjunctive rules or other more exible representations, and to more exible search strategies. The Bayesian method should also provide much stronger feedback for an interactive style of learning."

This paper describes a technique for transforming such trees to small sets of production rules, a common formalism for expressing knowledge in expert systems. The method makes use of the training set of cases from which the decision tree was generated, first to generalize and assess the reliability of individual rules extracted from the tree, and subsequently to refine the collection of rules as a whole. The final set of production rules is usually both simpler than the decision tree from which it was obtained, and more accurate when classifying unseen cases. Transformation to production rules also provides a way of combining different decision trees for the same classification domain."

Examples are taken from laboratory medicine, where the problem can be stated as finding the best combination of tests for making a diagnosis. These tests are typically numerical with unknown decision thresholds. Because of uncertainty in classification, the solution is described in terms of maximizing measures of decision rule performance on a data base of cases, for example maximizing positive predictive value, subject to a constraint of a minimum sensitivity. The resultant rules are quite similar to classifi cation production rules, and the procedures described should be valid for many knowledge acquisition and refinement tasks. The solution is found by a heuristic search procedure, and empirical results for several data bases and published studies are described."

The first edition of Peter Lees book appeared in 1989, but the subject has moved ever onwards, with increasing emphasis on Monte Carlo based techniques.This new fourth edition looks at recent techniques such as variational methods, Bayesian importance sampling, approximate Bayesian computation and Reversible Jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC), providing a concise account of the way in which the Bayesian approach to statistics develops as well as how it contrasts with the conventional approach. The theory is built up step by step, and important notions such as sufficiency are brought out of a discussion of the salient features of specific examples.This edition:Includes expanded coverage of Gibbs sampling, including more numerical examples and treatments of OpenBUGS, R2WinBUGS and R2OpenBUGS.Presents significant new material on recent techniques such as Bayesian importance sampling, variational Bayes, Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) and Reversible Jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC).Provides extensive examples throughout the book to complement the theory presented.Accompanied by a supporting website featuring new material and solutions.More and more students are realizing that they need to learn Bayesian statistics to meet their academic and professional goals. This book is best suited for use as a main text in courses on Bayesian statistics for third and fourth year undergraduates and postgraduate students."

Algorithms are presented for automatically constructing a binary decision tree designed to estimate these probabilities. At each node of the tree there is a yes/no question relating to the words already spoken, and at each leaf there is a probability distribution over the allowable vocabulary. Ideally, these nodal questions can take the form of arbitrarily complex Boolean expressions, but computationally cheaper alternatives are also discussed. Some results obtained on a 5000-word vocabulary with a tree designed to predict the next word spoken from the preceding 20 words are included. The tree is compared to an equivalent trigram model and shown to be superior. >"

The Bayesian option trees and averaging algorithm gave significantly better accuracy and half-Brier score on predictions for a set of learning problems, but at computational expense. Bear in mind the Bayesian algorithms had settings of mild prior parameters made and undertook considerably more search, whereas the other algorithms were not tuned in any such way. First, this work has a number of implications for Bayesian learning. Simple maximum posterior methods and minimum encoding methods (which here would choose the single maximum posterior tree) may not perform well in combinatorial discrete spaces like trees if the prior is not well matched to the problem. Considerable improvement can be obtained by averaging over multiple high posterior models. With trees and a multiplicative posterior, efficient averaging over multiple models is possible. Standard computational techniques for performing averaging such as importance sampling and Gibbs sampling are therefore avoided. More sophisticated priors could help here, but it is surely just as important to consider more versatile classification models such as the decision trellises suggested by Chou (1991). Second, the Bayesian methods derived here corresponded to a variety of subtasks previously done by a collection of disparate ad hoc approaches honed through experience."
