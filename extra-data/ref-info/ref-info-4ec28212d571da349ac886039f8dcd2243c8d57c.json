By segmentation, we mean a map from the set of pixels to a small set of levels such that each connected component of the set of pixels with the same level forms a relatively large and \"meaningful\" region. The method finds a set of levels with associated gray values by first finding junctions in the image and then seeking a minimum set of threshold values that preserves the junctions. Then it finds a segmentation map that maps each pixel to the level with the closest gray value to the pixel data, within a smoothness constraint. For a convex smoothing penalty, we show the global optimal solution for an energy function that fits the data can be obtained in a polynomial time, by a novel use of the maximum-flow algorithm. Our approach is in contrast to a view in computer vision where segmentation is driven by intensity, gradient, usually not yielding closed boundaries."

Rather than focusing on local features and their consistencies in the image data, our approach aims at extracting the global impression of an image. We treat image segmentation as a graph partitioning problem and propose a novel global criterion, the normalized cut, for segmenting the graph. The normalized cut criterion measures both the total dissimilarity between the different groups as well as the total similarity within the groups. We show that an efficient computational technique based on a generalized eigenvalue problem can be used to optimize this criterion. We have applied this approach to segmenting static images and found results very encouraging."

Recently, a number of authors have demonstrated good performance on this task using methods that are based on eigenvectors of the affinity matrix. These approaches are extremely attractive in that they are based on simple eigendecomposition algorithms whose stability is well understood. Nevertheless, the use of eigendecompositions in the context of segmentation is far from well understood. In this paper we give a unified treatment of these algorithms, and show the close connections between them while highlighting their distinguishing features. We then prove results on eigenvectors of block matrices that allow us to analyze the performance of these algorithms in simple grouping settings. Finally, we use our analysis to motivate a variation on the existing methods that combines aspects from different eigenvector segmentation algorithms. We illustrate our analysis with results on real and synthetic images."

The major restriction is that the energy function's smoothness term must only involve pairs of pixels. We propose two algorithms that use graph cuts to compute a local minimum even when very large moves are allowed. The first move we consider is an /spl alpha/-/spl beta/-swap: for a pair of labels /spl alpha/,/spl beta/, this move exchanges the labels between an arbitrary set of pixels labeled a and another arbitrary set labeled /spl beta/. Our first algorithm generates a labeling such that there is no swap move that decreases the energy. The second move we consider is an /spl alpha/-expansion: for a label a, this move assigns an arbitrary set of pixels the label /spl alpha/. Our second algorithm, which requires the smoothness term to be a metric, generates a labeling such that there is no expansion move that decreases the energy. Moreover, this solution is within a known factor of the global minimum. We experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on image restoration, stereo and motion."

The data to be clustered are represented by an undirected adjacency graph G with arc capacities assigned to reflect the similarity between the linked vertices. Clustering is achieved by removing arcs of G to form mutually exclusive subgraphs such that the largest inter-subgraph maximum flow is minimized. For graphs of moderate size ( approximately 2000 vertices), the optimal solution is obtained through partitioning a flow and cut equivalent tree of G, which can be efficiently constructed using the Gomory-Hu algorithm (1961). However for larger graphs this approach is impractical. New theorems for subgraph condensation are derived and are then used to develop a fast algorithm which hierarchically constructs and partitions a partially equivalent tree of much reduced size. This algorithm results in an optimal solution equivalent to that obtained by partitioning the complete equivalent tree and is able to handle very large graphs with several hundred thousand vertices. The new clustering algorithm is applied to the image segmentation problem. The segmentation is achieved by effectively searching for closed contours of edge elements (equivalent to minimum cuts in G), which consist mostly of strong edges, while rejecting contours containing isolated strong edges. This method is able to accurately locate region boundaries and at the same time guarantees the formation of closed edge contours. >"

Once solved, the minimum-cut associated to the maximum-flow yields a disparity surface for the whole image at once. This global approach to stereo analysis provides a more accurate and coherent depth map than the traditional line-by-line stereo. Moreover, the optimality of the depth surface is guaranteed and can be shown to be a generalization of the dynamic programming approach that is widely used in standard stereo. Results show improved depth estimation as well as better handling of depth discontinuities. While the worst case running time is O(n/sup 2/d/sup 2/log(nd)), the observed average running time is O(n/sup 1.2/ d/sup 1.3/) for an image size of n pixels and depth resolution d."
