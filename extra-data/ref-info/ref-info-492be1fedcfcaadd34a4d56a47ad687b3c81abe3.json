The Kass et al.\u2019s algorithm involves four steps: setting up a variational integral on the continuous plane, deriving a pair of Euler equations, discretizing them, and solving the discrete equations iteratively until convergence. This algorithm suffers from a number of problems. We discuss these problems and present an algoIithm for active contours based on dynamic programming. The optimization problem is set up as a discrete multi-stage decision process and is solved by a \u201ctime-delayed\u201d discrete dynamic programming algorithm. This formulation leads to a stable behavior for the active contours over iterations, in addition to allowing for hard constraints to be enforced on the behavior of the solution. Results of the application of the proposed algorithm to real images is presented."

This problem arises naturally in many reconstruction problems, where one wishes to reconstruct a function belonging to a constrained class of signals based upon noisy observed data. A common approach is to combine the objective functions into a single total cxt function. The problem then is to determine appropriate weights for the objective functions. In this paper we propose techniques for automatically determining the weights, and discuss their properties. The Min-Max Principle, which avoids the problems of extremely low or high weights, is introduced. ExpresEions are derived relating the optimal weights, objective function values, and total cost."

Through regularization, they may be reformulated as well-posed variational principles whose solutions are computable. Standard regularization theory employs quadratic stabilizing functionals that impose global smoothness constraints on possible solutions. Discontinuities present serious difficulties to standard regularization, however, since their reconstruction requires a precise spatial control over the smoothing properties of stabilizers. This paper proposes a general class of controlled-continuity stabilizers which provide the necessary control over smoothness. These nonquadratic stabilizing functionals comprise multiple generalized spline kernels combined with (noncontinuous) continuity control functions. In the context of computational vision, they may be thought of as controlled-continuity constraints. These generic constraints are applicable to visual reconstruction problems that involve both continuous regions and discontinuities, for which global smoothness constraints fail."

Most processes of early vision such as stereomatching, computation of motion and all the ``structure from\" processes can be regarded as solutions to inverse problems. This common characteristic of early vision can be formalized---{\\it most early vision problems are ``ill-posed problems\" in the sense of Hadamard}. We will show that a mathematical theory developed for regularizing ill-posed problems leads in a natural way to the solution of early vision problems in terms of variational principles of a certain class. This is a new theoretical framework for some of the variational solutions already obtained in the analysis of early vision processes. It also shows how several other problems in early vision can be approached and solved."

Specific topics in early vision and their regularization are then analyzed rigorously, characterizing existence, uniqueness, and stability of solutions. A fundamental difficulty that arises in almost every vision problem is scale, that is, the resolution at which to operate. Methods that have been proposed to deal with the problem include scale-space techniques that consider the behavior of the result across a continuum of scales. From the point of view of regulation theory, the concept of scale is related quite directly to the regularization parameter lambda . It suggested that methods used to obtained the optimal value of lambda may provide, either directly or after suitable modification, the optimal scale associated with the specific instance of certain problems. >"

The glomeruli were modeled by a polygon whose sides could be varied within a given range of lengths. The objects were located by determining the best match of the model according to a so-called optimum criterion in which all possible shapes were evaluated at all possible positions in the input image. The best model was selected according to the maximum average gray level. To increase the probability of obtaining a closed contour, a distance criterion was added and the maximum gray-level requirement was relaxed somewhat. The optimum criterion was modified to include a directionality constraint in which the difference in angle between model segments and the edge values in the image was minimized, thereby increasing the performance of the method. A hierarchical multiresolution strategy was used to reduce calculation time. The cyclical property of a contour is also taken into account. >"

The data \u03a6i may be the result of theory, direct measurements, remote soundings or a combination of these. We develop a new mathematical formalism exploiting the method of Generalized Cross Validation (GCV), and some recently developed optimization results, for analyzing this data. The analyzed field \u03a6N,m,\u03bb is the solution to the minimization problem: Find \u03a6 in a suitable space of functions to minimize where Functions of d=1, 2 or 3 of the four variables x, y, p, t are also considered.

A method for estimation of contour properties based on smoothing spline approximations is presented. Generalized cross-validation is to devise an automatic algorithm for finding the optimal value of the smoothing (regularization) parameter from the data. The cross-validated smoothing splines are then used to obtain optimal estimates of the derivatives of quantized contours. Experimental results are presented which demonstrate the robustness of the method applied to the estimation of curvature of quantized contours under variable scale, rotation, and partial occlusion.

The stereo matching problem, that is, obtaining a correspondence between right and left images, can be cast as a search problem. When a pair of stereo images is rectified, pairs of corresponding points can be searched for within the same scanlines. We call this search intra-scanline search. This intra-scanline search can be treated as the problem of finding a matching path on a two-dimensional (2D) search plane whose axes are the right and left scanlines. Vertically connected edges in the images provide consistency constraints across the 2D search planes. Inter-scanline search in a three-dimensional (3D) search space, which is a stack of the 2D search planes, is needed to utilize this constraint. Our stereo matching algorithm uses edge-delimited intervals as elements to be matched, and employs the above mentioned two searches: one is inter-scanline search for possible correspondences of connected edges in right and left images and the other is intra-scanline search for correspondences of edge-delimited intervals on each scanline pair. Dynamic programming is used for both searches which proceed simultaneously: the former supplies the consistency constraint to the latter while the latter supplies the matching score to the former. An interval-based similarity metric is used to compute the score. The algorithm has been tested with different types of images including urban aerial images, synthesized images, and block scenes, and its computational requirement has been discussed."

Visible-surface reconstruction is an inverse problem. A well-posed variational formulation results from the use of a controlled-continuity surface model. Discontinuity detection amounts to the identification of this generic model's distributed parameters from the data. Finite-element shape primitives yield a local discretization of the variational principle. The result is an efficient algorithm for visible-surface reconstruction. >"

                "text": "This paper describes a computational approach to edge detection. The success of the approach depends on the definition of a comprehensive set of goals for the computation of edge points. These goals must be precise enough to delimit the desired behavior of the detector while making minimal assumptions about the form of the solution. We define detection and localization criteria for a class of edges, and present mathematical forms for these criteria as functionals on the operator impulse response. A third criterion is then added to ensure that the detector has only one response to a single edge. We use the criteria in numerical optimization to derive detectors for several common image features, including step edges. On specializing the analysis to step edges, we find that there is a natural uncertainty principle between detection and localization performance, which are the two main goals. With this principle we derive a single operator shape which is optimal at any scale. The optimal detector has a simple approximate implementation in which edges are marked at maxima in gradient magnitude of a Gaussian-smoothed image. We extend this simple detector using operators of several widths to cope with different signal-to-noise ratios in the image. We present a general method, called feature synthesis, for the fine-to-coarse integration of information from operators at different scales. Finally we show that step edge detector performance improves considerably as the operator point spread function is extended along the edge."

In dealing with a human being and a human society, we enjoy the luxury of being irrational, illogical, inconsistent, and incomplete, and yet of coping. In operating a computer, we must meet the rigorous requirements for detailed instructions and absolute precision. If we understood the ability of the human mind to make effective decisions when confronted by complexity, uncertainty, and irrationality then we could use computers a million times more effectively than we do. Recognition of this fact has been a motivation for the spurt of research in the field of neurophysiology. The more we study the information processing aspects of the mind, the more perplexed and impressed we become. It will be a very long time before we understand these processes sufficiently to reproduce them. In any case, the mathematician sees hundreds and thousands of formidable new problems in dozens of blossoming areas, puzzles galore, and challenges to his heart's content. He may never resolve some of these, but he will never be bored. What more can he ask?"

Pixel gray levels and the presence and orientation of edges are viewed as states of atoms or molecules in a lattice-like physical system. The assignment of an energy function in the physical system determines its Gibbs distribution. Because of the Gibbs distribution, Markov random field (MRF) equivalence, this assignment also determines an MRF image model. The energy function is a more convenient and natural mechanism for embodying picture attributes than are the local characteristics of the MRF. For a range of degradation mechanisms, including blurring, nonlinear deformations, and multiplicative or additive noise, the posterior distribution is an MRF with a structure akin to the image model. By the analogy, the posterior distribution defines another (imaginary) physical system. Gradual temperature reduction in the physical system isolates low energy states (``annealing''), or what is the same thing, the most probable states under the Gibbs distribution. The analogous operation under the posterior distribution yields the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the image given the degraded observations. The result is a highly parallel ``relaxation'' algorithm for MAP estimation. We establish convergence properties of the algorithm and we experiment with some simple pictures, for which good restorations are obtained at low signal-to-noise ratios."

A second constraint is needed. A method for finding the optical flow pattern is presented which assumes that the apparent velocity of the brightness pattern varies smoothly almost everywhere in the image. An iterative implementation is shown which successfully computes the optical flow for a number of synthetic image sequences. The algorithm is robust in that it can handle image sequences that are quantized rather coarsely in space and time. It is also insensitive to quantization of brightness levels and additive noise. Examples are included where the assumption of smoothness is violated at singular points or along lines in the image."

We derive a scheme to integrate intensity edges with stereo depth and motion field information and show results from a Connection Machine algorithm on synthetic and natural images.
