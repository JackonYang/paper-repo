This study addresses the question of how simple networks of neuron-like elements can account for a variety of phenomena associated with this shift of selective visual attention. Specifically, we propose the following: (1) A number of elementary features, such as color, orientation, direction of movement, disparity etc. are represented in parallel in different topographical maps, called the early representation. (2) There exists a selective mapping from the early topographic representation into a more central non-topographic representation, such that at any instant the central representation contains the properties of only a single location in the visual scene, the selected location. We suggest that this mapping is the principal expression of early selective visual attention. One function of selective attention is to fuse information from different maps into one coherent whole. (3) Certain selection rules determine which locations will be mapped into the central representation. The major rule, using the conspicuity of locations in the early representation, is implemented using a so-called Winner-Take-All network. Inhibiting the selected location in this network causes an automatic shift towards the next most conspicious location. Additional rules are proximity and similarity preferences. We discuss how these rules can be implemented in neuron-like networks and suggest a possible role for the extensive back-projection from the visual cortex to the LGN."

The properties of an edge are embedded in a figure of merit and the edge detection problem becomes the problem of minimizing the given figure of merit. This problem can be represented as a shortest path problem on a graph and can be solved using well-known graph search algorithms. The relations between this representation of the minimization problem and a dynamic programming approach are discussed, showing that the graph search method can lead to substantial improvements in computing time. Moreover, if heuristic search methods are used, the computing time will depend on the amount of noise in the picture. Some experimental results are given; these show how various information about the shape of the contour of an object can be embedded in the figure of merit, thus allowing the extraction of contours from noisy pictures and the separation of touching objects."

Using this assumption, we prove that the subjective contour through two point-tangents is a parabola. We extend the theory to include multiple point-tangents and points.

The first part of the paper reviews general approaches to visual object recognition and divides these approaches into three broad classes: invariant properties methods, object decomposition methods, and alignment methods. The second part presents the alignment method. In this approach the recognition process is divided into two stages. The first determines the transformation in space that is necessary to bring the viewed object into alignment with possible object-models. The second stage determines the model that best matches the viewed object. The proposed alignment method also uses abstract description, but unlike structural description methods, it uses them pictorially, rather than in symbolic structural descriptions."

The radiograph is scanned and consolidated into several resolutions which are enhanced and analyzed by a hierarchic tumor recognition process. The hierarchic structure of the tumor recognition process has the form of a ladder-like decision tree. The major steps in the decision tree are: 1) find the lung regions within the chest radiograph, 2) find candidate nodule sites (potential tumor locations) within the lung regions, 3) find boundaries for most of these sites, 4) find nodules from among the candidate nodule boundaries, and 5) find tumors from among the nodules. The first three steps locate potential nodules in the radiograph. The last two steps classify the potential nodules into nonnodules, nodules which are not tumors, and nodules which are tumors."
