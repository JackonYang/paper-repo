We study the problem in the framework of hierarchical classification, where the geometric structure of an image can be represented by an ultrametric contour map, the soft boundary image associated to a family of nested segmentations. We define generic ultrametric distances by integrating local contour cues along the regions boundaries and combining this information with region attributes. Then, we evaluate quantitatively our results with respect to ground-truth segmentation data, proving that our system outperforms significantly two widely used hierarchical segmentation techniques, as well as the state of the art in local edge detection."

Natural images contain both textured and untextured regions, so the cues of contour and texture differences are exploited simultaneously. Contours are treated in the intervening contour framework, while texture is analyzed using textons. Each of these cues has a domain of applicability, so to facilitate cue combination we introduce a gating operator based on the texturedness of the neighborhood at a pixel. Having obtained a local measure of how likely two nearby pixels are to belong to the same region, we use the spectral graph theoretic framework of normalized cuts to find partitions of the image into regions of coherent texture and brightness. Experimental results on a wide range of images are shown."

We provide extensive experimental evaluation to demonstrate that, when coupled to a high-performance contour detector, the OWT-UCM algorithm produces state-of-the-art image segmentations.

Our method is based on observations that a homogeneously textured region of a natural image can be well modeled by a Gaussian distribution and the region boundary can be effectively coded by an adaptive chain code. The optimal segmentation of an image is the one that gives the shortest coding length for encoding all textures and boundaries in the image, and is obtained via an agglomerative clustering process applied to a hierarchy of decreasing window sizes. The optimal segmentation also provides an accurate estimate of the overall coding length and hence the true entropy of the image. Our algorithm achieves state-of-the-art results on the Berkeley Segmentation Dataset compared to other popular methods."

For this purpose, we study the connection between seed-based and hierarchical segmentation. We consider an Ultrametric Contour Map (UCM), the representation of a hierarchy of segmentations as a real-valued boundary image. Starting from a set of seed points, we propose an algorithm for constructing Voronoi tessellations with respect to a distance defined by the UCM. As a result, the main contribution of the paper is a method that allows exploiting the information of any hierarchical scheme for constrained segmentation. Our algorithm is parameter-free, computationally efficient and robust. We prove the interest of the approach proposed by evaluating quantitatively the results with respect to ground-truth data."

However, highly accurate image contour detection algorithms are also very computationally intensive, which limits their applicability, even for offline batch processing. In this work, we examine efficient parallel algorithms for performing image contour detection, with particular attention paid to local image analysis as well as the generalized eigensolver used in Normalized Cuts. Combining these algorithms into a contour detector, along with careful implementation on highly parallel, commodity processors from Nvidia, our contour detector provides uncompromised contour accuracy, with an F-metric of 0.70 on the Berkeley Segmentation Dataset. Runtime is reduced from 4 minutes to 1.8 seconds. The efficiency gains we realize enable high-quality image contour detection on much larger images than previously practical, and the algorithms we propose are applicable to several image segmentation approaches. Efficient, scalable, yet highly accurate image contour detection will facilitate increased performance in many computer vision applications."

The underlying idea is to segment the input image several times, each time focussing on a different salient part of the image and to subsequently merge all obtained results into one composite segmentation. We identify salient parts of the image by applying affinity propagation clustering to efficiently calculated local color and texture models. Each salient region then serves as an independent initialization for a figure/ground segmentation. Segmentation is done by minimizing a convex energy functional based on weighted total variation leading to a global optimal solution. Each salient region provides an accurate figure/ ground segmentation highlighting different parts of the image. These highly redundant results are combined into one composite segmentation by analyzing local segmentation certainty. Our formulation is quite general, and other salient region detection algorithms in combination with any semi-supervised figure/ground segmentation approach can be used. We demonstrate the high quality of our method on the well-known Berkeley segmentation database. Furthermore we show that our method can be used to provide good spatial support for recognition frameworks."

Beginning with an image, we execute a sequence of steps in which pixels are gradually merged to produce larger and larger regions. In each step, we consider pairs of adjacent regions and provide a probability measure to assess whether or not they should be included in the same segment. Our probabilistic formulation takes into account intensity and texture distributions in a local area around each region. It further incorporates priors based on the geometry of the regions. Finally, posteriors based on intensity and texture cues are combined using \u201c a mixture of experts\u201d formulation. This probabilistic approach is integrated into a graph coarsening scheme, providing a complete hierarchical segmentation of the image. The algorithm complexity is linear in the number of the image pixels and it requires almost no user-tuned parameters. In addition, we provide a novel evaluation scheme for image segmentation algorithms, attempting to avoid human semantic considerations that are out of scope for segmentation algorithms. Using this novel evaluation scheme, we test our method and provide a comparison to several existing segmentation algorithms."

In contrast to most multiscale image processing, this algorithm works on multiple scales of the image in parallel, without iteration, to capture both coarse and fine level details. The algorithm is computationally efficient, allowing to segment large images. We use the normalized cut graph partitioning framework of image segmentation. We construct a graph encoding pairwise pixel affinity, and partition the graph for image segmentation. We demonstrate that large image graphs can be compressed into multiple scales capturing image structure at increasingly large neighborhood. We show that the decomposition of the image segmentation graph into different scales can be determined by ecological statistics on the image grouping cues. Our segmentation algorithm works simultaneously across the graph scales, with an inter-scale constraint to ensure communication and consistency between the segmentations at each scale. As the results show, we incorporate long-range connections with linear-time complexity, providing high-quality segmentations efficiently. Images that previously could not be processed because of their size have been accurately segmented thanks to this method."

However, evaluation of segmentation algorithms thus far has been largely subjective, leaving a system designer to judge the effectiveness of a technique based only on intuition and results in the form of a few example segmented images. This is largely due to image segmentation being an ill-defined problem-there is no unique ground-truth segmentation of an image against which the output of an algorithm may be compared. This paper demonstrates how a recently proposed measure of similarity, the normalized probabilistic rand (NPR) index, can be used to perform a quantitative comparison between image segmentation algorithms using a hand-labeled set of ground-truth segmentations. We show that the measure allows principled comparisons between segmentations created by different algorithms, as well as segmentations on different images. We outline a procedure for algorithm evaluation through an example evaluation of some familiar algorithms - the mean-shift-based algorithm, an efficient graph-based segmentation algorithm, a hybrid algorithm that combines the strengths of both methods, and expectation maximization. Results are presented on the 300 images in the publicly available Berkeley segmentation data set"

In order to prevent its oversegmentation, the notion of dynamics of a minimum, based on geodesic reconstruction, has been proposed. In this paper, we extend the notion of dynamics to the contour arcs. This notion acts as a measure of the saliency of the contour. Contrary to the dynamics of minima, our concept reflects the extension and shape of the corresponding object in the image. This representation is also much more natural, because it is expressed in terms of partitions of the plane, i.e., segmentations. A hierarchical segmentation process is then derived, which gives a compact description of the image, containing all the segmentations one can obtain by the notion of dynamics, by means of a simple thresholding. Finally, efficient algorithms for computing the geodesic reconstruction as well as the dynamics of contours are presented."

We employ a large database of manually segmented images in order to learn an optimal affinity function between pairs of pixels. These pairwise affinities can then be used to cluster the pixels into visually coherent groups. Region cues are computed as the similarity in brightness, color, and texture between image patches. Boundary cues are incorporated by looking for the presence of an \"intervening contour\", a large gradient along a straight line connecting two pixels. We first use the dataset of human segmentations to individually optimize parameters of the patch and gradient features for brightness, color, and texture cues. We then quantitatively measure the power of different feature combinations by computing the precision and recall of classifiers trained using those features. The mutual information between the output of the classifiers and the same-segment indicator function provides an alternative evaluation technique that yields identical conclusions. As expected, the best classifier makes use of brightness, color, and texture features, in both patch and gradient forms. We find that for brightness, the gradient cue outperforms the patch similarity. In contrast, using color patch similarity yields better results than using color gradients. Texture is the most powerful of the three channels, with both patches and gradients carrying significant independent information. Interestingly, the proximity of the two pixels does not add any information beyond that provided by the similarity cues. We also find that the convexity assumptions made by the intervening contour approach are supported by the ecological statistics of the dataset."

Our model can detect objects whose boundaries are not necessarily defined by the gradient. We minimize an energy which can be seen as a particular case of the minimal partition problem. In the level set formulation, the problem becomes a \"mean-curvature flow\"-like evolving the active contour, which will stop on the desired boundary. However, the stopping term does not depend on the gradient of the image, as in the classical active contour models, but is instead related to a particular segmentation of the image. We give a numerical algorithm using finite differences. Finally, we present various experimental results and in particular some examples for which the classical snakes methods based on the gradient are not applicable. Also, the initial curve can be anywhere in the image, and interior contours are automatically detected."

Human observers perform this task with ease, relying on a system in which hierarchical processing seems to have a critical role. Despite many attempts, computerized algorithms have so far not demonstrated robust segmentation capabilities under general viewing conditions. Here we describe a new, highly efficient approach that determines all salient regions of an image and builds them into a hierarchical structure. Our algorithm, segmentation by weighted aggregation, is derived from algebraic multigrid solvers for physical systems, and consists of fine-to-coarse pixel aggregation. Aggregates of various sizes, which may or may not overlap, are revealed as salient, without predetermining their number or scale. Results using this algorithm are markedly more accurate and significantly faster (linear in data size) than previous approaches."

Region features are appealing in this context because: (1) they encode shape and scale information of objects naturally; (2) they are only mildly affected by background clutter. Regions have not been popular as features due to their sensitivity to segmentation errors. In this paper, we start by producing a robust bag of overlaid regions for each image using Arbeldez et al., CVPR 2009. Each region is represented by a rich set of image cues (shape, color and texture). We then learn region weights using a max-margin framework. In detection and segmentation, we apply a generalized Hough voting scheme to generate hypotheses of object locations, scales and support, followed by a verification classifier and a constrained segmenter on each hypothesis. The proposed approach significantly outperforms the state of the art on the ETHZ shape database(87.1% average detection rate compared to Ferrari et al. 's 67.2%), and achieves competitive performance on the Caltech 101 database."

Detecting junctions locally has proved problematic because the image intensity surface is confusing in the neighborhood of a junction. Edge detectors also do not perform well near junctions. Current leading approaches to junction detection, such as the Harris operator, are based on 2D variation in the intensity signal. However, a drawback of this strategy is that it confuses textured regions with junctions. We believe that the right approach to junction detection should take advantage of the contours that are incident at a junction; contours themselves can be detected by processes that use more global approaches. In this paper, we develop a new high-performance contour detector using a combination of local and global cues. This contour detector provides the best performance to date (F=0.70) on the Berkeley Segmentation Dataset (BSDS) benchmark. From the resulting contours, we detect and localize candidate junctions, taking into account both contour salience and geometric configuration. We show that improvements in our contour model lead to better junctions. Our contour and junction detectors both provide state of the art performance."

We employ a large dataset of manually segmented images in order to learn an optimal affinity function between nearby pairs of pixels. Region cues are computed as the similarity in brightness, color, and texture between image patches. Boundary cues are incorporated by looking for the presence of an \u201cintervening contour\u201d, a large gradient along a straight line connecting two pixels. We then use spectral clustering to find an approximate minimizer of the normalized cut, partitioning the image into coherent segments. We evaluate the power of local measurements and global segmentations in predicting the location of image boundaries by computing the precision and recall with respect to the human groundtruth data. The results show that spectral clustering is successful in suppressing noise and boosting weak signals over a wide variety of natural images."

Graph cuts are used to find the globally optimal segmentation of the N-dimensional image. The obtained solution gives the best balance of boundary and region properties among all segmentations satisfying the constraints. The topology of our segmentation is unrestricted and both \"object\" and \"background\" segments may consist of several isolated parts. Some experimental results are presented in the context of photo/video editing and medical image segmentation. We also demonstrate an interesting Gestalt example. A fast implementation of our segmentation method is possible via a new max-flow algorithm."

We extend our previous work [1], proposed for background/foreground separation, to the segmentation of images into more than two regions. We also demonstrate an efficient implementation of the curve evolution, which reduces the computational time significantly. Finally, we validate the proposed method on the Berkeley Segmentation Data Set by comparing its performance with other segmentation techniques."

The algorithms are evaluated using an efficient algorithm for computing precision and recall with regard to human ground-truth boundaries. We test each segmentation method over a representative set of input parameters, and present tuning curves that fully characterize algorithm performance over the complete image database. We complement the evaluation on the BSD with segmentation results on synthetic images. The results reported here provide a useful benchmark for current and future research efforts in image segmentation."

We formulate features that respond to characteristic changes in brightness, color, and texture associated with natural boundaries. In order to combine the information from these features in an optimal way, we train a classifier using human labeled images as ground truth. The output of this classifier provides the posterior probability of a boundary at each image location and orientation. We present precision-recall curves showing that the resulting detector significantly outperforms existing approaches. Our two main results are 1) that cue combination can be performed adequately with a simple linear model and 2) that a proper, explicit treatment of texture is required to detect boundaries in natural images."

In this paper we extend such cost functions and address multi-region image segmentation problem by employing a multi-phase level set framework. For multi-modal images cost functions become more complicated and relatively difficult to minimize. We extend our previous work, proposed for background/foreground separation, to the segmentation of images in more than two regions. We also demonstrate an efficient implementation of the curve evolution, which reduces the computational time significantly. Finally, we validate the proposed method on the Berkeley segmentation data set by comparing its performance with other segmentation techniques."

Motivated by growing evidence that the human visual system exploits contour closure for the purposes of perceptual grouping [6, 7, 14, 15, 25], we present an algorithm for computing highly closed bounding contours from images. Unlike previous algorithms [11, 18, 26], no restrictions are placed on the type of structure bounded or its shape. Contours are represented locally by tangent vectors, augmented by image intensity estimates. A Bayesian model is developed for the likelihood that two tangent vectors form contiguous components of the same contour. Based on this model, a sparsely-connected graph is constructed, and the problem of computing closed contours is posed as the computation of shortest-path cycles in this graph. We show that simple tangent cycles can be efficiently computed in natural images containing many local ambiguities, and that these cycles generally correspond to bounding contours in the image. These closure computations can potentially complement region-grouping methods by extending the class of structures segmented to include heterogeneous structures."

This method operates on a set of boundary fragments that are produced by edge detection. Boundary extraction identifies a subset of these fragments and connects them sequentially to form a closed boundary with the largest saliency. We encode the Gestalt laws of proximity and continuity in a novel boundary-saliency measure based on the relative gap length and average curvature when connecting fragments to form a closed boundary. This new measure attempts to remove a possible bias toward short boundaries. We present a polynomial-time algorithm for finding the most-salient closed boundary. We also present supplementary preprocessing steps that facilitate the application of ratio contour to real images. We compare ratio contour to two closely related methods for extracting closed boundaries: Elder and Zucker's method based on the shortest-path algorithm and Williams and Thornber's method based on spectral analysis and a strongly-connected-components algorithm. This comparison involves both theoretic analysis and experimental evaluation on both synthesized data and real images."

This diversity has led to a wide range of different approaches for image segmentation. In this paper we present a single unified framework for addressing this problem --- \"Segmentation by Composition\". We define a good image segment as one which can be easily composed using its own pieces, but is difficult to compose using pieces from other parts of the image. This non-parametric approach captures a large diversity of segment types, yet requires no pre-definition or modelling of segment types, nor prior training. Based on this definition, we develop a segment extraction algorithm --- i.e., given a single point-of-interest, provide the \"best\" image segment containing that point. This induces a figure-ground image segmentation, which applies to a range of different segmentation tasks: single image segmentation, simultaneous co-segmentation of several images, and class-based segmentations."

Classical image segmentation tools use either texture (colour) information, e.g. Magic Wand, or edge (contrast) information, e.g. Intelligent Scissors. Recently, an approach based on optimization by graph-cut has been developed which successfully combines both types of information. In this paper we extend the graph-cut approach in three respects. First, we have developed a more powerful, iterative version of the optimisation. Secondly, the power of the iterative algorithm is used to simplify substantially the user interaction needed for a given quality of result. Thirdly, a robust algorithm for \"border matting\" has been developed to estimate simultaneously the alpha-matte around an object boundary and the colours of foreground pixels. We show that for moderately difficult examples the proposed method outperforms competitive tools."

Experimental results demonstrate that our method not only performs on par with either texture segmentation or boundary completion methods on their specialized examples, but also works well on a variety of real images."

One general methodology which shows promise for solving this problem is to characterize textured regions via their responses to a set of filters. However, this approach brings with it many open questions, including how to combine texture and intensity information into a common descriptor and how to deal with the fact that filter responses inside textured regions are generally spatially inhomogeneous. Our goal in this paper is to introduce two new ideas which address these open questions and to demonstrate the application of these ideas to the segmentation of natural images. The first idea consists of a novel means of describing points in natural images and an associated distance function for comparing these descriptors. This distance function is aided in textured regions by the use of the second idea, a new process introduced here which we have termed area completion. Experimental segmentation results which incorporate our proposed approach into the Normalized Cut framework of Shi and Malik are provided for a variety of natural images."

Potential completions are generated by building a constrained Delaunay triangulation (CDT) over the set of contours found by a local edge detector. Maximum likelihood parameters for the model are learned from human labeled ground truth. Using held out test data, we measure how the model, by incorporating continuity structure, improves boundary detection over the local edge detector. We also compare performance with a baseline local classifier that operates on pairs of edgels. Both algorithms consistently dominate the low-level boundary detector at all thresholds. To our knowledge, this is the first time that curvilinear continuity has been shown quantitatively useful for a large variety of natural images. Better boundary detection has immediate application in the problem of object detection and recognition"

We provide a multiple-hypothesis framework for robustly estimating scene structure from a single image and obtaining confidences for each geometric label. These confidences can then be used to improve the performance of many other applications.

The success of the approach depends on the definition of a comprehensive set of goals for the computation of edge points. These goals must be precise enough to delimit the desired behavior of the detector while making minimal assumptions about the form of the solution. We define detection and localization criteria for a class of edges, and present mathematical forms for these criteria as functionals on the operator impulse response. A third criterion is then added to ensure that the detector has only one response to a single edge. We use the criteria in numerical optimization to derive detectors for several common image features, including step edges. On specializing the analysis to step edges, we find that there is a natural uncertainty principle between detection and localization performance, which are the two main goals. With this principle we derive a single operator shape which is optimal at any scale. The optimal detector has a simple approximate implementation in which edges are marked at maxima in gradient magnitude of a Gaussian-smoothed image. We extend this simple detector using operators of several widths to cope with different signal-to-noise ratios in the image. We present a general method, called feature synthesis, for the fine-to-coarse integration of information from operators at different scales. Finally we show that step edge detector performance improves considerably as the operator point spread function is extended along the edge."

Most edge detection schemes ignore the composite nature of these edges, resulting in systematic errors in detection and localization. The problem of detecting and localizing these edges is addressed, along with the problem of false responses in smoothly shaded regions with constant gradient of the image brightness. A class of nonlinear filters, known as quadratic filters, is appropriate for this task, while linear filters are not. Performance criteria are derived for characterizing the SNR, localization and multiple responses of these filters in a manner analogous to Canny's criteria for linear filters. A two-dimensional version of the approach is developed which has the property of being able to represent multiple edges at the same location and determine the orientation of each to any desired precision.

The problem is posed using a statistical model for images with multiple curves. Besides having important applications to edge detection and grouping the curve finding task is a special case of a more general problem, where we want to explain the whole image in terms of a small set of objects. We describe a novel approach for estimating the content of scenes with multiple objects using a min-cover framework that is simple and powerful. The min-cover problem is NP-hard but there is a good approximation algorithm that sequentially selects objects minimizing a \"cost per pixel\" measure. In the case of curve detection we use a type of best-first search to quickly find good curves for the covering algorithm. The method integrates image data over long curves without relying on binary feature detection. We have applied the curve detection method for finding object boundaries in natural scenes and measured its performance using the Berkeley segmentation dataset."

In this paper we present a new image representation which provides a transformation from the raw pixel data to a small set of image regions which are coherent in color and texture space. This so-called \"blobworld\" representation is based on segmentation using the expectation-maximization algorithm on combined color and texture features. The texture features we use for the segmentation arise from a new approach to texture description and scale selection. We describe a system that uses the blobworld representation to retrieve images. An important and unique aspect of the system is that, in the context of similarity-based querying, the user is allowed to view the internal representation of the submitted image and the query results. Similar systems do not offer the user this view into the workings of the system; consequently, the outcome of many queries on these systems can be quite inexplicable, despite the availability of knobs for adjusting the similarity metric."

We utilize local boundary cues including contrast, localization and relative contrast, and train a classifier to integrate them across scales. Our approach successfully combines strengths from both large-scale detection (robust but poor localization) and small-scale detection (detail-preserving but sensitive to clutter). We carry out quantitative evaluations on a variety of boundary and object datasets with human-marked groundtruth. We show that multi-scale boundary detection offers large improvements, ranging from 20% to 50%, over single-scale approaches. This is the first time that multi-scale is demonstrated to improve boundary detection on large datasets of natural images."

The basic computational module of the technique is an old pattern recognition procedure: the mean shift. For discrete data, we prove the convergence of a recursive mean shift procedure to the nearest stationary point of the underlying density function and, thus, its utility in detecting the modes of the density. The relation of the mean shift procedure to the Nadaraya-Watson estimator from kernel regression and the robust M-estimators; of location is also established. Algorithms for two low-level vision tasks discontinuity-preserving smoothing and image segmentation - are described as applications. In these algorithms, the only user-set parameter is the resolution of the analysis, and either gray-level or color images are accepted as input. Extensive experimental results illustrate their excellent performance."

CST is obtained by augmenting the objectpsilas segmentation tree (ST) with inter-region neighbor links, in addition to their recursive embedding structure already present in ST. This makes CST a hierarchy of region adjacency graphs. A regionpsilas neighbors are computed using an extension to regions of the Voronoi diagram for point patterns. Unsupervised learning of the CST model of a category is formulated as matching the CST graph representations of unlabeled training images, and fusing their maximally matching subgraphs. A new learning algorithm is proposed that optimizes the model structure by simultaneously searching for both the most salient nodes (regions) and the most salient edges (containment and neighbor relationships of regions) across the image graphs. Matching of the category model to the CST of a new image results in simultaneous detection, segmentation and recognition of all occurrences of the category, and a semantic explanation of these results."

But while much success has been reported in detecting several rectangular-shaped object classes (i.e. faces, cars, pedestrians), results have been much less impressive for more general types of objects. Several researchers have advocated the use of image segmentation as a way to get a better spatial support for objects. In this paper, our aim is to address this issue by studying the following two questions: 1) how important is good spatial support for recognition? 2) can segmentation provide better spatial support for objects? To answer the first, we compare recognition performance using ground-truth segmentation vs. bounding boxes. To answer the second, we use the multiple segmentation approach to evaluate how close can real segments approach the ground-truth for real objects, and at what cost. Our results demonstrate the importance of finding the right spatial support for objects, and the feasibility of doing so without excessive computational burden."

                "text": "When computing descriptors of image data, the type of information that can be extracted may be strongly dependent on the scales at which the image operators are applied. This article presents a systematic methodology for addressing this problem. A mechanism is presented for automatic selection of scale levels when detecting one-dimensional image features, such as edges and ridges.A novel concept of a scale-space edge is introduced, defined as a connected set of points in scale-space at which: (i) the gradient magnitude assumes a local maximum in the gradient direction, and (ii) a normalized measure of the strength of the edge response is locally maximal over scales. An important consequence of this definition is that it allows the scale levels to vary along the edge. Two specific measures of edge strength are analyzed in detail, the gradient magnitude and a differential expression derived from the third-order derivative in the gradient direction. For a certain way of normalizing these differential descriptors, by expressing them in terms of so-called \u03b3-normalized derivatives, an immediate consequence of this definition is that the edge detector will adapt its scale levels to the local image structure. Specifically, sharp edges will be detected at fine scales so as to reduce the shape distortions due to scale-space smoothing, whereas sufficiently coarse scales will be selected at diffuse edges, such that an edge model is a valid abstraction of the intensity profile across the edge.Since the scale-space edge is defined from the intersection of two zero-crossing surfaces in scale-space, the edges will by definition form closed curves. This simplifies selection of salient edges, and a novel significance measure is proposed, by integrating the edge strength along the edge. Moreover, the scale information associated with each edge provides useful clues to the physical nature of the edge.With just slight modifications, similar ideas can be used for formulating ridge detectors with automatic selection, having the characteristic property that the selected scales on a scale-space ridge instead reflect the width of the ridge.It is shown how the methodology can be implemented in terms of straightforward visual front-end operations, and the validity of the approach is supported by theoretical analysis as well as experiments on real-world and synthetic data."

                "text": "A theory of edge detection is presented. The analysis proceeds in two parts. (1) Intensity changes, which occur in a natural image over a wide range of scales, are detected separately at different scales. An appropriate filter for this purpose at a given scale is found to be the second derivative of a Gaussian, and it is shown that, provided some simple conditions are satisfied, these primary filters need not be orientation-dependent. Thus, intensity changes at a given scale are best detected by finding the zero values of \u22072G(x, y)* I(x, y) for image I, where G(x, y) is a two-dimensional Gaussian distribution and \u22072 is the Laplacian. The intensity changes thus discovered in each of the channels are then represented by oriented primitives called zero-crossing segments, and evidence is given that this representation is complete. (2) Intensity changes in images arise from surface discontinuities or from reflectance or illumination boundaries, and these all have the property that they are spatially localized. Because of this, the zero-crossing segments from the different channels are not independent, and rules are deduced for combining them into a description of the image. This description is called the raw primal sketch. The theory explains several basic psychophysical findings, and the operation of forming oriented zero-crossing segments from the output of centre-surround \u22072G filters acting on the image forms the basis for a physiological model of simple cells (see Marr & Ullman 1979)."

Edge separators of a graph are produced by iteratively reweighting the edges until the graph disconnects into the prescribed number of components. At each iteration a small number of eigenvectors with small eigenvalue are computed and used to determine the reweighting. In this way spectral rounding directly produces discrete solutions where as current spectral algorithms must map the continuous eigenvectors to discrete solutions by employing a heuristic geometric separator (e.g. k-means). We show that spectral rounding compares favorably to current spectral approximations on the Normalized Cut criterion (NCut). Results are given for natural image segmentation, medical image segmentation, and clustering. A practical version is shown to converge."

We then learn the importance of different descriptors (e.g. color, texture, shape) of the ancestors for classification.

The learned model is used for automatic visual recognition and semantic segmentation of photographs. Our discriminative model exploits novel features, based on textons, which jointly model shape and texture. Unary classification and feature selection is achieved using shared boosting to give an efficient classifier which can be applied to a large number of classes. Accurate image segmentation is achieved by incorporating these classifiers in a conditional random field. Efficient training of the model on very large datasets is achieved by exploiting both random feature selection and piecewise training methods. \n \nHigh classification and segmentation accuracy are demonstrated on three different databases: i) our own 21-object class database of photographs of real objects viewed under general lighting conditions, poses and viewpoints, ii) the 7-class Corel subset and iii) the 7-class Sowerby database used in [1]. The proposed algorithm gives competitive results both for highly textured (e.g. grass, trees), highly structured (e.g. cars, faces, bikes, aeroplanes) and articulated objects (e.g. body, cow)."

On one side, there are energy minimization methods that yield very accurate, dense flow fields, but fail as displacements get too large. On the other side, there is descriptor matching that allows for large displacements, but correspondences are very sparse, have limited accuracy, and due to missing regularity constraints there are many outliers. In this paper we propose a method that can combine the advantages of both matching strategies. A region hierarchy is established for both images. Descriptor matching on these regions provides a sparse set of hypotheses for correspondences. These are integrated into a variational approach and guide the local optimization to large displacement solutions. The variational optimization selects among the hypotheses and provides dense and subpixel accurate estimates, making use of geometric constraints and all available image information."

The inference procedure is divided into two stages: a trace inference stage, which is the subject of the present work, and a curve synthesis stage. It is shown that recovery of the trace of a curve requires estimating local models for the curve at the same time, and that tangent and curvature information are sufficient. These make it possible to specify powerful constraints between estimated tangents to a curve, in terms of a neighborhood relationship called cocircularity, and between curvature estimates, in terms of a curvature consistency relation. Because all curve information is quantized, special care must be taken to obtain accurate estimates of trace points, tangents, and curvatures. This issue is addressed specifically to the introduction of a smoothness constraint and a maximum curvature constraint. The procedure is applied to two types of images: artificial images designed to evaluate curvature and noise sensitivity, and natural images. >"

It is difficult since often the decision for an edge cannot be made purely based on low level cues such as gradient, instead we need to engage all levels of information, low, middle, and high, in order to decide where to put edges. In this paper we propose a novel supervised learning algorithm for edge and object boundary detection which we refer to as Boosted Edge Learning or BEL for short. A decision of an edge point is made independently at each location in the image; a very large aperture is used providing significant context for each decision. In the learning stage, the algorithm selects and combines a large number of features across different scales in order to learn a discriminative model using an extended version of the Probabilistic Boosting Tree classification algorithm. The learning based framework is highly adaptive and there are no parameters to tune. We show applications for edge detection in a number of specific image domains as well as on natural images. We test on various datasets including the Berkeley dataset and the results obtained are very good."

Our grouping criterion, called untangling cycles, exploits the inherent topological 1D structure of salient contours to extract them from the otherwise 2D image clutter. To define a measure for topological classification robust to clutter and broken edges, we use a graph formulation instead of the standard computational topology. The key insight is that a pronounced ID contour should have a clear ordering of edges, to which all graph edges adhere, and no long range entanglements persist. Finding the contour grouping by optimizing these topological criteria is challenging. We introduce a novel concept of circular embedding to encode this combinatorial task. Our solution leads to computing the dominant complex eigenvectors/eigenvalues of the random walk matrix of the contour grouping graph. We demonstrate major improvements over state-of-the-art approaches on challenging real images."

In contrast to existing algorithms for minimizing the full Mumford-Shah this is the first one which is based on a convex relaxation. As a consequence the computed solutions are independent of the initialization.

                "text": "The fact that objects in the world appear in different ways depending on the scale of observation has important implications if one aims at describing them. It shows that the notion of scale is of utmost importance when processing unknown measurement data by automatic methods. In their seminal works, Witkin (1983) and Koenderink (1984) proposed to approach this problem by representing image structures at different scales in a so-called scale-space representation. Traditional scale-space theory building on this work, however, does not address the problem of how to select local appropriate scales for further analysis. This article proposes a systematic methodology for dealing with this problem. A framework is presented for generating hypotheses about interesting scale levels in image data, based on a general principle stating that local extrema over scales of different combinations of \u03b3-normalized derivatives are likely candidates to correspond to interesting structures. Specifically, it is shown how this idea can be used as a major mechanism in algorithms for automatic scale selection, which adapt the local scales of processing to the local image structure.Support for the proposed approach is given in terms of a general theoretical investigation of the behaviour of the scale selection method under rescalings of the input pattern and by integration with different types of early visual modules, including experiments on real-world and synthetic data. Support is also given by a detailed analysis of how different types of feature detectors perform when integrated with a scale selection mechanism and then applied to characteristic model patterns. Specifically, it is described in detail how the proposed methodology applies to the problems of blob detection, junction detection, edge detection, ridge detection and local frequency estimation.In many computer vision applications, the poor performance of the low-level vision modules constitutes a major bottleneck. It is argued that the inclusion of mechanisms for automatic scale selection is essential if we are to construct vision systems to automatically analyse complex unknown environments."

Unlike previous theories, our model is derived from a single assumption: that the prior probability distribution of boundary completion shape can be modeled by a random walk in a lattice whose points are positions and orientations in the image plane (i.e., the space that one can reasonably assume is represented by neurons of the mammalian visual cortex). Our model does not employ numerical relaxation or other explicit minimization, but instead relies on the fact that the probability that a particle following a random walk will pass through a given position and orientation on a path joining two boundary fragments can be computed directly as the product of two vector-field convolutions. We show that for the random walk we define, the maximum likelihood paths are curves of least energy, that is, on average, random walks follow paths commonly assumed to model the shape of illusory contours. A computer model is demonstrated on numerous illusory contour stimuli from the literature."

Lazy Snapping separates coarse and fine scale processing, making object specification and detailed adjustment easy. Moreover, Lazy Snapping provides instant visual feedback, snapping the cutout contour to the true object boundary efficiently despite the presence of ambiguous or low contrast edges. Instant feedback is made possible by a novel image segmentation algorithm which combines graph cut with pre-computed over-segmentation. A set of intuitive user interface (UI) tools is designed and implemented to provide flexible control and editing for the users. Usability studies indicate that Lazy Snapping provides a better user experience and produces better segmentation results than the state-of-the-art interactive image cutout tool, Magnetic Lasso in Adobe Photoshop."

In computer vision, a fundamental problem is to appropriately decompose the domain R of a function g (x,y) of two variables. This problem starts by describing the physical situation which produces images: assume that a three-dimensional world is observed by an eye or camera from some point P and that g1(rho) represents the intensity of the light in this world approaching the point sub 1 from a direction rho. If one has a lens at P focusing this light on a retina or a film-in both cases a plane domain R in which we may introduce coordinates x, y then let g(x,y) be the strength of the light signal striking R at a point with coordinates (x,y); g(x,y) is essentially the same as sub 1 (rho) -possibly after a simple transformation given by the geometry of the imaging syste. The function g(x,y) defined on the plane domain R will be called an image. What sort of function is g? The light reflected off the surfaces Si of various solid objects O sub i visible from P will strike the domain R in various open subsets R sub i. When one object O1 is partially in front of another object O2 as seen from P, but some of object O2 appears as the background to the sides of O1, then the open sets R1 and R2 will have a common boundary (the 'edge' of object O1 in the image defined on R) and one usually expects the image g(x,y) to be discontinuous along this boundary.

The authors show how to design and steer the filters and present examples of their use in the analysis of orientation and phase, angularly adaptive filtering, edge detection, and shape from shading. One can also build a self-similar steerable pyramid representation. The same concepts can be generalized to the design of 3-D steerable filters. >"

The speed may be an arbitrary function of curvature, and the front can also be passively advected by an underlying flow. These algorithms approximate the equations of motion, which resemble Hamilton-Jacobi equations with parabolic right-hand-sides, by using techniques from the hyperbolic conservation laws. Non-oscillatory schemes of various orders of accuracy are used to solve the equations, providing methods that accurately capture the formation of sharp gradients and cusps in the moving fronts. The algorithms handle topological merging and breaking naturally, work in any number of space dimensions, and do not require that the moving surface be written as a function. The methods can be also used for more general Hamilton-Jacobitype problems. We demonstrate our algorithms by computing the solution to a variety of surface motion problems."

Although relaxation labeling is parallel and iterative, the complexity of updating with standard rules is too costly for practical implementation. A description is given of a computationally more efficient updating rule that utilizes radial projection instead of normal projection to avoid the complexities incurred by previous update rules when boundaries to the labeling space are encountered. This reduction in complexity is achieved by first restricting support vectors to the positive quadrant, and then using radial projection onto the constraint instead of normal projection. Crucial order information is conserved through smooth convergence towards the optimum and a rate of convergence proportional to the magnitudes of the support functions. >"

We take a supervised learning approach to this problem, in which we begin by collecting a training set of monocular images (of unstructured indoor and outdoor environments which include forests, sidewalks, trees, buildings, etc.) and their corresponding ground-truth depthmaps. Then, we apply supervised learning to predict the value of the depthmap as a function of the image. Depth estimation is a challenging problem, since local features alone are insufficient to estimate depth at a point, and one needs to consider the global context of the image. Our model uses a hierarchical, multiscale Markov Random Field (MRF) that incorporates multiscale local- and global-image features, and models the depths and the relation between depths at different points in the image. We show that, even on unstructured scenes, our algorithm is frequently able to recover fairly accurate depthmaps. We further propose a model that incorporates both monocular cues and stereo (triangulation) cues, to obtain significantly more accurate depth estimates than is possible using either monocular or stereo cues alone.\n"

In the learning stage, the probabilistic boosting-tree automatically constructs a tree in which each node combines a number of weak classifiers (evidence, knowledge,) into a strong classifier (a conditional posterior probability). It approaches the target posterior distribution by data augmentation (tree expansion) through a divide-and-conquer strategy. In the testing stage, the conditional probability is computed at each tree node based on the learned classifier, which guides the probability propagation in its sub-trees. The top node of the tree therefore outputs the overall posterior probability by integrating the probabilities gathered from its sub-trees. Also, clustering is naturally embedded in the learning phase and each sub-tree represents a cluster of certain level. The proposed framework is very general and it has interesting connections to a number of existing methods such as the A* algorithm, decision tree algorithms, generative models, and cascade approaches. In this paper, we show the applications of PBT for classification, detection, and object recognition. We have also applied the framework in segmentation"

In this work we propose to incorporate semantic object context as a post-processing step into any off-the-shelf object categorization model. Using a conditional random field (CRF) framework, our approach maximizes object label agreement according to contextual relevance. We compare two sources of context: one learned from training data and another queried from Google Sets. The overall performance of the proposed framework is evaluated on the PASCAL and MSRC datasets. Our findings conclude that incorporating context into object categorization greatly improves categorization accuracy."

When the graph is singly connected, local propagation rules of the sort proposed by Pearl (1988) are guaranteed to converge to the correct posterior probabilities. Recently a number of researchers have empirically demonstrated good performance of these same local propagation schemes on graphs with loops, but a theoretical understanding of this performance has yet to be achieved. For graphical models with a single loop, we derive an analytical relationship between the probabilities computed using local propagation and the correct marginals. Using this relationship we show a category of graphical models with loops for which local propagation gives rise to provably optimal maximum a posteriori assignments (although the computed marginals will be incorrect). We also show how nodes can use local information in the messages they receive in order to correct their computed marginals. We discuss how these results can be extended to graphical models with multiple loops and show simulation results suggesting that some properties of propagation on single-loop graphs may hold for a larger class of graphs. Specifically we discuss the implication of our results for understanding a class of recently proposed error-correcting codes known as turbo codes."
