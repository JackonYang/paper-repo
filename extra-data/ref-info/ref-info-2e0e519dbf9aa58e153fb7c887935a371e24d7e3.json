Rather than focusing on local features and their consistencies in the image data, our approach aims at extracting the global impression of an image. We treat image segmentation as a graph partitioning problem and propose a novel global criterion, the normalized cut, for segmenting the graph. The normalized cut criterion measures both the total dissimilarity between the different groups as well as the total similarity within the groups. We show that an efficient computational technique based on a generalized eigenvalue problem can be used to optimize this criterion. We have applied this approach to segmenting static images and found results very encouraging."

We show that the method leads to markedly improved segmentation results and can deal with significant variation in shape and varying backgrounds.

Natural images contain both textured and untextured regions, so the cues of contour and texture differences are exploited simultaneously. Contours are treated in the intervening contour framework, while texture is analyzed using textons. Each of these cues has a domain of applicability, so to facilitate cue combination we introduce a gating operator based on the texturedness of the neighborhood at a pixel. Having obtained a local measure of how likely two nearby pixels are to belong to the same region, we use the spectral graph theoretic framework of normalized cuts to find partitions of the image into regions of coherent texture and brightness. Experimental results on a wide range of images are shown."

This work is distinguished by three key contributions. The first is the introduction of a new image representation called the \"integral image\" which allows the features used by our detector to be computed very quickly. The second is a learning algorithm, based on AdaBoost, which selects a small number of critical visual features from a larger set and yields extremely efficient classifiers. The third contribution is a method for combining increasingly more complex classifiers in a \"cascade\" which allows background regions of the image to be quickly discarded while spending more computation on promising object-like regions. The cascade can be viewed as an object specific focus-of-attention mechanism which unlike previous approaches provides statistical guarantees that discarded regions are unlikely to contain the object of interest. In the domain of face detection the system yields detection rates comparable to the best previous systems. Used in real-time applications, the detector runs at 15 frames per second without resorting to image differencing or skin color detection."

We focus on the probabilistic tracking of people and learn models of how they appear and move in images. In particular we learn the likelihood of observing various spatial and temporal filter responses corresponding to edges, ridges, and motion differences given a model of the person. Similarly, we learn probability distributions over filter responses for general scenes that define a likelihood of observing the filter responses for arbitrary backgrounds. We then derive a probabilistic model for tracking that exploits the ratio between the likelihood that image pixels corresponding to the foreground (person) were generated by an actual person or by some unknown background. The paper extends previous work on learning image statistics and combines it with Bayesian tracking using particle filtering. By combining multiple image cues, and by using learned likelihood models, we demonstrate improved robustness and accuracy when tracking complex objects such as people in monocular image sequences with cluttered scene and a moving camera."

We illustrate our approach by combining nearest prototype discriminators that are simple to implement and widely applicable as they can be constructed in any feature space with a distance function. For efficient run-time performance we adapt the work on \"alternating trees\" for multi-class discrimination tasks. We report results on a multi-class discrimination task in which significant gains in performance are seen by combining discriminators under our framework from a variety of easy to construct feature spaces."

The counting operation is started at the time that the pulse from the selected plug is received and is terminated when the reference signal is received from the pulse generator. Provision is made for compensating for different reference angles between the top dead center position and the position at which the pulse generator produces a pulse. This is done by presetting a counter in accordance with the reference angle."
