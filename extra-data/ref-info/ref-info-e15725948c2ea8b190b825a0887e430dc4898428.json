Our application is the reading of German handwritten addresses for automatic mail sorting. The quality of the handwritten words is often bad in this application, because writers are not very cooperative. Therefore we have developed some suitable and eecient preprocessing operations to clean the image and normalize the writing. Because the words are often diicult to segment into letters, we have chosen a segmentation{free approach for recognition with semi{continuous Hidden Markov Models. We are applying the technique of context modelling in a model hierarchy in order to train more speciic letter models. For training and evaluation, we have used a large sample of 15000 handwritten city and street names. A number of experiments have been performed to evaluate strategies for feature space reduction (Karhunen{Loeve transform, linear discrim-inant analysis). On a 100 word lexicon, we achieve recognition rates of up to 90% on large independent test sets."

In contrast to other systems, whole lines of text are the basic units for the recognizer. Thus the difficult problem of segmenting a line of text into individual words can be avoided. Another novel feature of the system is the incorporation of a statistical language model into the recognizer. Experiments on the database described previously by the authors (1999) have shown that a recognition rate on the word level of 79.5% and 60.05% for small (776 words) and larger (7719 words) vocabularies can be reached. These figures increase to 84.3% and 67.32% if the top ten choices are taken into account."

This system includes feature extraction, classification, estimation of model parameters, and word recognition. The feature extraction module transforms a binary image to a sequence of feature vectors. The classification module consists of a transformation based on linear discriminant analysis and Gaussian soft-decision vector quantizers which transform feature vectors into sets of symbols and associated likelihoods. Symbols and likelihoods form the input to both HMM training and recognition. HMM training performed in several successive steps requires only a small amount of gestalt labeled data on the level of characters for initialization. HMM recognition based on the Viterbi algorithm runs on subsets of the whole vocabulary.<<ETX>>"

The database is based on the Lancaster-Oslo/Bergen(LOB) corpus. This corpus is a collection of tests that were used to generate forms, which subsequently were filled out by persons in their own handwriting. As of December 1998 the database includes 556 forms produced by approximately 250 different writers. The database consists of full English sentences. It could serve as a basis for a variety of handwriting recognition tasks. The main focus, however is on recognition techniques that use linguistic knowledge beyond the lexicon level. This knowledge can be automatically derived from the corpus or it can be supplied from external sources."

This corpus is a collection of texts that comprise about one million word instances. The database includes 1,066 forms produced by approximately 400 different writers. A total of 82,227 word instances out of a vocabulary of 10,841 words occur in the collection. The database consists of full English sentences. It can serve as a basis for a variety of handwriting recognition tasks. However, it is expected that the database would be particularly useful for recognition tasks where linguistic knowledge beyond the lexicon level is used, because this knowledge can be automatically derived from the underlying corpus. The database also includes a few image-processing procedures for extracting the handwritten text from the forms and the segmentation of the text into lines and words."

Five functional modules included in the system are introduced in this paper: (i) pre-processing, which concerns introducing an image representation for easy manipulation of large page images and image handling procedures using the image representation; (ii) line separation, concerning text line detection and extracting images of lines of text from a page image; (iii) word segmentation, which concerns locating word gaps and isolating words from a line of text image obtained efficiently and in an intelligent manner; (iv) word recognition, concerning handwritten word recognition algorithms; and (v) linguistic post-pro- cessing, which concerns the use of linguistic constraints to intelligently parse and recognize text. Key ideas employed in each functional module, which have been developed for dealing with the diversity of handwriting in its various aspects with a goal of system reliability and robustness, are described in this paper. Preliminary experiments show promising results in terms of speed and accuracy."

These notions are applied to obtain a graph, G, representing a line image, and also to find an 'axis' as the regular part of G. The complements to G of the axis are the 'tarsi', singular parts of G, which correspond to informative features of a cursive word. A segmentation of the graph is obtained, giving a symbolic description chain (SDC). Using one or more as robust anchors, possible words in a list of words are selected. Candidate words are examined to see if the other letters fit the rest of the SDC. Good results are obtained for clean images of words written by several persons. >"

Impressive progress has been achieved in reading isolated single characters during the last decade. Cursive script recognition still lacks a good recognition rate. Since there is a high variability in unconstrainted handwritten script words, the domain is much more difficult than single character recognition. To achieve acceptable results, the context has to be restricted by a given lexicon of all possible words. The only accessible information is the binary image of the cursive script word. Since handling of raster data is cumbersome, connectivity analysis is applied as a first processing step. Thereafter it is necessary to reduce the variability as much as possible without losing relevant information. Therefore, some normalization steps angle, rotation stroke width, and size. The normalization techniques of the authors' system and the subsequent feature extraction are presented.

Different experimental approaches for incorporating these recognition methods into a more powerful system are also presented. The resulting multiple-expert system proves that the consensus of these methods tends to compensate for individual weaknesses, while preserving individual strengths. It is shown that it is possible to reduce the substitution rate to a desired level while maintaining a fairly high recognition rate in the classification of totally unconstrained handwritten ZIP code numerals. If reliability is of the utmost importance, substitutions can be avoided completely (reliability=100%) while retaining a recognition rate above 90%. Results are compared with those for some of the most effective numeral recognition systems found in the literature. >"

Several component processes of a recognition system for isolated offline cursive script words are described. A word image is transformed through a hierarchy of representation levels: points, contours, features, letters, and words. A unique feature representation is generated bottom-up from the image using statistical dependences between letters and features. Ratings for partially formed words are computed using a stack algorithm and a lexicon represented as a trie. Several novel techniques for low- and intermediate-level processing for cursive script are described, including heuristics for reference line finding, letter segmentation based on detecting local minima along the lower contour and areas with low vertical profiles, simultaneous encoding of contours and their topological relationships, extracting features, and finding shape-oriented events. Experiments demonstrating the performance of the system are also described. >"

The recognition rate is 80-90%. In the production mode, the check acceptance rate is 60-75%, with the misread rate corresponding to that of a human operator (close to 1%)."

The model used is based on Hidden Markov Models (HMM). The lines are firstly preprocessed, then segmented and characterized by two types of features. We create a HMM for each street name by simply concatenating the corresponding letter models, elementary HMM learned on a large city name database. A street name may often be surrounded by other information on the left and on the right within the delivery line. These phenomena are roughly modelled by trigrams. The global model is then simply obtained by the concatenation of trigram models with the HMMs corresponding to street names."

                "text": "Determining the delivery location for mail pieces based on handwritten addresses is a problem that trained humans can normally solve. As a problem in machine reading and interpretation, it presents many challenges. A method for determining the delivery point codes (DPCs) for handwritten addresses by computer is described. Solution to the task requires locating and recognizing address components (e.g., ZIP Code, street number, P.O. box number) and using multiple information sources to assign the DPC to an address. The methodology uses diverse pattern recognition techniques, image processing algorithms (thresholding, underline removal, separation of lines, location and recognition of address components), and access to United States Postal Service (USPS) databases to determine the DPC.<<ETX>>"
