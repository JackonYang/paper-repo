This paper outlines how a tree learning algorithm can be derived using Bayesian statistics. This introduces Bayesian techniques for splitting, smoothing, and tree averaging. The splitting rule is similar to Quinlan's information gain, while smoothing and averaging replace pruning. Comparative experiments with reimplementations of a minimum encoding approach,c4 (Quinlanet al., 1987) andcart (Breimanet al., 1984), show that the full Bayesian algorithm can produce more accurate predictions than versions of these other approaches, though pays a computational price."

                "text": "Summary Often, in a regression situation with many variables, a sequence of submodels is generated containing fewer variables by using such methods as stepwise addition or deletion of variables, or 'best subsets'. The question is which of this sequence of submodels is 'best', and how can submodel performance be evaluated. This was explored in Breiman (1988) for a fixed X-design. This is a sequel exploring the case of random X-designs. Analytical results are difficult, if not impossible. This study involved an extensive simulation. The basis of the study is the theoretical definition of prediction error (PE) as the expected squared error produced by applying a prediction equation to the distributional universe of (y, x) values. This definition is used throughout to compare various submodels. There can be startling differences between the x-fixed and x-random situations and different PE estimates are appropriate. Non-resampling estimates such as C,, adjusted RZ,etc. turn out to be highly biased methods for submodel selection. The two best methods are cross-validation and bootstrap. One surprise is that 5 fold cross-validation (leave out 20% of the data) is better at submodel selection and evaluation than leave-one-out cross-validation. There are a number of other surprises."

In part, this is related to a better understanding of what are now referred to as hidden nodes. These algorithms are considered to be of marked value in pattern recognition problems. Because of that, we tested the ability of an early neural network model, ADAP, to forecast the onset of diabetes mellitus in a high risk population of Pima Indians. The algorithm's performance was analyzed using standard measures for clinical tests: sensitivity, specificity, and a receiver operating characteristic curve. The crossover point for sensitivity and specificity is 0.76. We are currently further examining these methods by comparing the ADAP results with those obtained from logistic regression and linear perceptron models using precisely the same training and forecasting sets. A description of the algorithm is included."

The definition is acquired by studying large collections of training examples of the form \u2329Xi, f(Xi)\u232a. Existing approaches to this problem include (a) direct application of multiclass algorithms such as the decision-tree algorithms ID3 and CART, (b) application of binary concept learning algorithms to learn individual binary functions for each of the k classes, and (c) application of binary concept learning algorithms with distributed output codes such as those employed by Sejnowski and Rosenberg in the NETtalk system. This paper compares these three approaches to a new technique in which BCH error-correcting codes are employed as a distributed output representation. We show that these output representations improve the performance of ID3 on the NETtalk task and of backpropagation on an isolated-letter speech-recognition task. These results demonstrate that error-correcting output codes provide a general-purpose method for improving the performance of inductive learning programs on multiclass problems."

As expected, the multilayer feedforward networks (MLFN'S) outperformed the single-layer networks, achieving 1000/0 accuracy on the training set and up to 980/0 accuracy on the testing set. Comparable figures for the single-layer networks were 94.50/0 and 92 0/0, respectively.

Each element of the pattern sets is comprised of various scalar observations. In this paper, we use the diagnosis of breast cytology to demonstrate the applicability of this method to medical diagnosis and decision making. Each of 11 cytological characteristics of breast fine-needle aspirates reported to differ between benign and malignant samples was graded 1 to 10 at the time of sample collection. Nine characteristics were found to differ significantly between benign and malignant samples. Mathematically, these values for each sample were represented by a point in a nine-dimensional space of real variables. Benign points were separated from malignant ones by planes determined by linear programming. Correct separation was accomplished in 369 of 370 samples (201 benign and 169 malignant). In the one misclassified malignant case, the fine-needle aspirate cytology was so definitely benign and the cytology of the excised cancer so definitely malignant that we believe the tumor was missed on aspiration. Our mathematical method is applicable to other medical diagnostic and decision-making problems."
