We consider a setting in which the learner responds to each example according to a current hypothesis. Then the learner updates the hypothesis, if necessary, based on the correct classification of the example. One natural measure of the quality of learning in this setting is the number of mistakes the learner makes. For suitable classes of functions, learning algorithms are available that make a bounded number of mistakes, with the bound independent of the number of examples seen by the learner. We present one such algorithm that learns disjunctive Boolean functions, along with variants for learning other classes of Boolean functions. The basic method can be expressed as a linear-threshold algorithm. A primary advantage of this algorithm is that the number of mistakes grows only logarithmically with the number of irrelevant attributes in the examples. At the same time, the algorithm is computationally efficient in both time and space."

Learning in layered networks is posed as a search in the network parameter space for a network that minimizes an additive error function of a statistically independent examples. By imposing the equivalence of the minimum error and the maximum likelihood criteria for training the network, the Gibbs distribution on the ensemble of networks with a fixed architecture is derived. The probability of correct prediction of a novel example can be expressed using the ensemble, serving as a measure to the network's generalization ability. The entropy of the prediction distribution is shown to be a consistent measure of the network's performance. The proposed formalism is applied to the problems of selecting an optimal architecture and the prediction of learning curves. >"

This makes it very unlikely that any algorithm like backpropagation which varies weights on a network of fixed size and topology will be able to learn in polynomial time. However, Valiant has recently proposed a learning protocol (Valiant 1984), which allows one to sensibly consider generalization by learning algorithms with the freedom to add neurons and synapses, as well as simply adjusting weights. Within this context, standard circuit complexity arguments show that learning algorithms with such freedom can solve in polynomial time any learning problem that can be solved in polynomial time by any algorithm whatever. In this sense, neural nets are universal learners, capable of learning any learnable class of concepts."

                "text": "Since an tiquity, man has dreamed of building a de vice that would \"learn from examples\" 1 \"form generalizations\", and \"discover t he rules\" behind patt ern s in t he data. Recent work has shown that a high ly connected , layered networ k of simple an alog processing element s can be astonishingly successful at this, in some cases . In ord er to be precise about what has been observed, we give defini t ions of memorization, generalization , and rule ex traction. T he most im portant part of this paper proposes a way to measure th e ent ropy or information content of a learni ng task a nd the effi ciency wit h which a network ext racts informat ion from the dat a. We also a rgue that the way in which the ne tworks ca n compactly represent a wid e class of Boolean (an d othe r) functi ons is analogous to t he way in which polynomials or other famili es of functions can be \"curve fit\" to gene ral data; specifically, they ex tend the domain, a nd average noisy data. Alas , findi ng a suitable rep rese ntation is generall y an ill-posed and ill-cond itio ned problem. E ven whe n the problem has bee n \" regularized\", what rem ain s is a difficult combinatoria l opt imizatio n problem. Whe n a network is given mo re resou rces than the mi nimu m needed to solve a given t ask , the symmetric, low-order , local solut ions that hum an s see m to pre fer are not the ones that the network chooses from th e vast number of solut ions avai la ble; ind eed , th e generalized delt a method a nd similar learning procedures do not usually hold t he \"human \" solut ions stable against perturbations.

Overview of the contents Section 2 gives seve ral examples that illustra te t he import ance of automatic learning from examples . Section 3 poses a tes t -case problem (\"c l umps\") which will be used t hroughout the paper to illustrate the issues of interest. Section 4 describes the class of networks we are considering and introdu ces t he notation. Section 5 presents a proof by construction t hat a two-layer network can rep resent any Boolean function, and section 6 shows t hat there is an elegant representation for the c lumps tas k, using very few weights and processing units. Sections 7 an d 8 argue that the ob jective function E(W ) has a complicated st ruct ure: good solutions are generally not points in W space, bu t rat her parameteri zed fam ilies of points. Furt hermore, in all but the simplest sit uations, the E su rface is riddled with local minim a, and any automatic lear ning procedure must take firm measures to deal with t his. Section 9 shows that our c l umps tas k is a very simple prob lem, accordin g to the various schemes that have been proposed to quantify the complexity of network tasks and solut ions. Section 10 shows that a general network does no t prefer t he simple solut ions t hat hum ans seem to prefer. Sect ion 11 discusses the crucial effect of changes of representation on the feasibility of aut oma t ic learni ng. We prove that \"automat ic learn ing will always succeed, given t he right preprocessor,\" but we also show t hat t his statement is grossly misleading since there is no automati c procedure for const ruct ing the requ ired preprocessor. Sections 12 and 13 propose definit ions of rule ext ract ion and genera liza t ion and emphas ize th e disti nction between th e two. Sect ion 14 calculates th e entropy budget for ru le ext ract ion and est imates the informat ion available from the t rain ing data and from the \"programming\" or \"architecture\" of t he network. This leads to an ap proximate express ion for t he efficiency with which the learni ng procedu re ext rac ts infor mat ion from t he t ra ining data. Sect ion 16 presents a simple model which allows us to calculate the erro r rate duri ng t he learn ing process. Sect ion 17 discusses the rela t ionship bet ween rule ext ract ion in general and assoc iat ive memo ry in particular . In sect ion 18, we arg ue that when special informat ion is availabl e, such as infor mation about the symmetry, geomet ry, or topology of the task at hand, the netwo rk must be provided this information. We also discuss various ways in which this informat ion can be \"programmed\" into t he net wor k. Section 19 dr aws the analogy between th e family of functions t hat can be implemented by networks with limited amounts of resour ces and other families of funct ions such as polynomials of limited degree.

Automa t ic learning from exa mples is a top ic of enormo us importan ce. There are many application s where there is no ot her way to approach the task. For example, consider th e problem of recognizing hand-wri t ten characters. The raw image can be fed to a preprocessor that will detect salient fea tures such as straight line segments, arcs, terminations, et c., in various parts of the field. But what then? Th ere is no mathematical expression t hat will tell you what features correspo nd to a \"7\" or a \"Q\" . The task is defined purely by th e statist ics of what features convent iona lly go with what meaningt here is no ot her definition. T here is no way to prog ram it ; the solut ion must be learned by examp les [6,11]. Another example is the task of producing the correct pronunciation of a segment of written English . There are pattern s and rules of pron unciation , but th ey are so complex that a network th at could \"discover t he rules\" on its own would save an enormous amount of labor [37J. Another example concerns clinical medicine: t he task of mapping a set of symptoms onto a diagnosis. Here t he inputs have physical meaningth ey are not purely convent iona l as in the previous exa mplesbut we are st ill a long way from writing down an equat ion or a computer program that will perform the task a priori. We must learn from the statist ics of past exa mp les (41). Other examples include classifying sonar returns [10], recogni zing speech [5,16,30,23], and predi cting the secondary st ruct ure of proteins from the primary sequence [42]. In th e foregoing examples, t here was rea lly no alte rnat ive to learni ng from exa mples. However, in order to learn more about the power and limit ations of var ious learnin g methods and evaluate new methods as they are prop osed , people have st udied a number of \"test cases\" where t here was an alternativeth at is, where the \"correct\" solut ion was well understood. T hese includ e classifying input pattern s accord ing to th eir parity [33], geometric shape [33,35], or spatial symmetry [36J. 3. Example : tvo-or-more clumps Th e tes t case that we will use throughout t his pap er is a simple geometric task which an adaptive network ought to be able to handle. Th e network's inp ut pattern s will be Nbit binary st rings. Somet imes we will tr ea t the pattern s as numbers, so we can speak of numerical order ; somet imes we will also treat them as one-dimensional images, in which false bits (Fs) repr esent white pixels and true bits (Ts) rep resent black pixels. A cont iguous clump of T s represents a solid black bar . We th en choose the following rule to determine th e desired output of the network, as shown in table 1: if the inpu t pattern is such that all the T s appear in one cont iguous clump , th en th e output should be F , and if there are two or more dumps, th en t he 880 Denker, Schwartz, Wittner, Solla, Howard, Jackel, and Hopfield Input pattern Outpu t Interpretation ffft ttffff F 1 clump fffttftfff T 2 clumps ftt ttttttt F 1 clump tttffttff t T 3 clumps ffffffffff F no clumps Tabl e 1: Exa mples of the t woor-more clumps predicate. output should be T . We call this t he two-or-more clumps predicate.1 We will consider numerous variat ions of t his problem, such as three-versus -two clumps and so for t h. The one-versus-two clumps version is a lso known as t he contiguity predi cate [25]. Questions of connectedness have played an importan t role in the history of network s and automatic learning: Minsky a nd P ap er t devoted a sizable por t ion of t hei r book [27] to this sort of qu est ion. There a re a host of important questions that immedi a tely a rise, some of whi ch are list ed below. In some cases , we give summary answe rs ; the details of t he an swers will be given in following sections . Ca n any network of t he type we are con sid ering actua lly rep resen t such a fu nct ion? (Yes.) This is not a t rivial resu lt , since Minsky and Paper t [27J showed that a Perce ptron (with one layer of adjustable weight s) absolutely could not perform a wide class of functions, and our fun ction is in th is class. Can it perform the funct ion efficient ly? (Yes .) This is in cont ras t, say, to a solut ion of the par ity function usin g a standard programmable logic array (PLA) [26], which is possibl e but requires enormo us numbers of hardware components (O(2N ) gates). Can the net work learn to perform this function , by learn ing from examples? (Yes.) How qui ckly can it learn it ? (It de pen ds; see below.) How many layers are required , an d how many hidden units in eac h layer? How do t he answers to t he prev ious ques t ions de pen d on t he architecture (i.e. size an d shape) of th e network? How sensit ive a re the resul t s to t he num erical me t hods and other details of the implementation , such as t he an alog represe ntation of T and F, \"moment um term s\" , \"weight decay te rms\" , step size, et c.? Does t he solut ion (i. e. the configuration of weights) t hat the net work find s make sense? Is it s imilar to the solut ions t hat human s would choose , given t he task of designing"

This is particularly true in areas where the problems do not lend themselves to systematic programming, such as pattern recognition in natural environments. The feasibility of learning an unknown function from examples depends on two questions: 1. Do the examples convey enough information to determine the function? 2. Is there a speedy way of constructing the function from the examples? These questions contrast the roles of information and complexity in learning. While the two roles share some ground, they are conceptually and technically different. In the common language of learning, the information question is that of generalization and the complexity question is that of scaling. The work of Vapnik and Chervonenkis (1971) provides the key tools for dealing with the information issue. In this review, we develop the main ideas of this framework and discuss how complexity fits in."

The memory representations for pronunciations are learned by practice and are shared among many processing units. The performance of NETtalk has some similarities with observed human performance. (i) The learning follows a power law. (ii) The more words the network learns, the better it is at generalizing and correctly pronouncing new words, (iii) The performance of the network degrades very slowly as connections in the network are damaged: no single link or processing unit is essential. (iv) Relearning after damage is much faster than learning during the original training. (v) Distributed or spaced practice is more effective for long-term retention than massed practice. Network models can be constructed that have the same performance and learning characteristics on a particular task, but differ completely at the levels of synaptic strengths and single-unit responses. However, hierarchical clustering techniques applied to NETtalk reveal that these different networks have similar internal representations of letter-to-sound correspondences within groups of processing units. This suggests that invariant internal representations may be found in assemblies of neurons intermediate in size between highly localized and completely distributed representations."

It follows that statistical theory can provide considerable insight into the properties, advantages, and disadvantages of different network learning methods. We review concepts and analytical results from the literatures of mathematical statistics, econometrics, systems identification, and optimization theory relevant to the analysis of learning in artificial neural networks. Because of the considerable variety of available learning procedures and necessary limitations of space, we cannot provide a comprehensive treatment. Our focus is primarily on learning procedures for feedforward networks. However, many of the concepts and issues arising in this framework are also quite broadly relevant to other network learning paradigms. In addition to providing useful insights, the material reviewed here suggests some potentially useful new training methods for artificial neural networks."

It is shown that a family of surfaces having d degrees of freedom has a natural separating capacity of 2d pattern vectors, thus extending and unifying results of Winder and others on the pattern-separating capacity of hyperplanes. Applying these ideas to the vertices of a binary n-cube yields bounds on the number of spherically, quadratically, and, in general, nonlinearly separable Boolean functions of n variables. It is shown that the set of all surfaces which separate a dichotomy of an infinite, random, separable set of pattern vectors can be characterized, on the average, by a subset of only 2d extreme pattern vectors. In addition, the problem of generalizing the classifications on a labeled set of pattern points to the classification of a new point is defined, and it is found that the probability of ambiguous generalization is large unless the number of training patterns exceeds the capacity of the set of separating surfaces."

In this paper we regard learning as the phenomenon of knowledge acquisition in the absence of explicit programming. We give a precise methodology for studying this phenomenon from a computational viewpoint. It consists of choosing an appropriate information gathering mechanism, the learning protocol, and exploring the class of concepts that can be learnt using it in a reasonable (polynomial) number of steps. We find that inherent algorithmic complexity appears to set serious limits to the range of concepts that can be so learnt. The methodology and results suggest concrete principles for designing realistic learning systems."

However, there has been little research into the synergies achievable by combining these two learning paradigms. A hybrid system that combines the symbolically-oriented explanation-based learning paradigm with the neural backpropagation algorithm is described. In the presented EBL-ANN algorithm, the initial neural network configuration is determined by the generalized explanation of the solution to a specific classification task. This approach overcomes problems that arise when using imperfect theories to build explanations and addresses the problem of choosing a good initial neural network configuration. Empirical results show that the hybrid system more accurately learns a concept than the explanation-based system by itself and learns faster and generalizes better than the neural learning system by itself."

The methods in this paper lead to a unified treatment of some of Valiant's results, along with previous results on distribution-free convergence of certain pattern recognition algorithms. It is shown that the essential condition for distribution-free learnability is finiteness of the Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension, a simple combinatorial parameter of the class of concepts to be learned. Using this parameter, the complexity and closure properties of learnable classes are analyzed, and the necessary and sufficient conditions are provided for feasible learnability."
