This is equivalent to thinking of the texture as a pattern painted on the surface. Three-dimensional textures, where the elements may point out of the surface, have largely been ignored. We study a special class of 3D textures, perpendicular textures where we can model the elements as being normal to the surface. The perspective projection of perpendicularly textured surfaces results in several interesting phenomena, which do not occur in the much-studied tangential texture case. These include occlusion, foreshortening and illumination. In this paper, we study the geometry of the problem, modeling the locations of the elements of the texture as being a realization of a spatial point process. Relations between slant and tilt of the surface, density and height of elements and occlusions are derived. Occlusions can now be used as a cue to infer shape, instead of being treated as a source of error."

B. Julesz (1981) introduced the term texton, analogous to a phoneme in speech recognition, but did not provide an operational definition for gray-level images. We re-invent textons as frequently co-occurring combinations of oriented linear filter outputs. These can be learned using a K-means approach. By mapping each pixel to its nearest texton, the image can be analyzed into texton channels, each of which is a point set where discrete techniques such as Voronoi diagrams become applicable. Local histograms of texton frequencies can be used with a /spl chi//sup 2/ test for significant differences to find texture boundaries. Natural images contain both textured and untextured regions, so we combine this cue with that of the presence of peaks of contour energy derived from outputs of odd- and even-symmetric oriented Gaussian derivative filters. Each of these cues has a domain of applicability, so to facilitate cue combination we introduce a gating operator based on a statistical test for isotropy of Delaunay neighbors. Having obtained a local measure of how likely two nearby pixels are to belong to the same region, we use the spectral graph theoretic framework of normalized cuts to find partitions of the image into regions of coherent texture and brightness. Experimental results on a wide range of images are shown."

Since the appearance of 3D texture depends on the illumination and viewing direction in a complicated manner, such image texture can be called a bidirectional texture function. A fundamental representation of image texture is the histogram of pixel intensities. Since the histogram of 3D texture also depends on the illumination and viewing directions in a complex fashion, we refer to it as a bidirectional histogram. In this work, we present a concise analytical model for the bidirectional histogram of Lambertian, isotropic, randomly rough surfaces, which are common in real-world scenes. We demonstrate the accuracy of the histogram model by fitting to several samples from the Columbia-Utrecht texture database. The parameters obtained from the model fits are roughness measures which can be used in texture recognition schemes. In addition, the model has potential application in estimating illumination direction in scenes where surfaces of known tilt and roughness are visible. We demonstrate the usefulness of our model by employing it in a novel 3D texture synthesis procedure."

In the conventional rendering algorithms various methods of approximate photometry are used whose domains of validity have been ill defined. We introduce the necessary photometric concepts and do a comparative study of rendering algorithms. In the computer graphics/vision literature the physically distinct causes of illuminance variation, namely, the obliqueness of surface elements and the effects of vignetting of extended sources, are thoroughly confused. This leads to serious errors when expressions are used in contexts outside their original realm. The treatment of the texture that is due to the illumination of surface mesostructure is an example. Erroneous results are obtained when simple expressions for the illuminance of convex bodies are interpreted in terms of equivalent sources and when these again are used in calculations involving different geometrical structures. We classify current methods in terms of the approximations (often implicitly) made and compare results for a large class of applications: that of surface mesostructure on convex objects. Large differences among the various approximative methods are found. We discuss simple methods that might be used to produce more realistic results at reasonable computational cost."

In this paper we present two feature extraction methods for the classification of textures using two-dimensional (2-D) Markov random field (MRF) models. It is assumed that the given M \u00d7 M texture is generated by a Gaussian MRF model. In the first method, the least square (LS) estimates of model parameters are used as features. In the second method, using the notion of sufficient statistics, it is shown that the sample correlations over a symmetric window including the origin are optimal features for classification. Simple minimum distance classifiers using these two feature sets yield good classification accuracies for a seven class problem."

This approach goes beyond edge-based and area-based approaches by using a richer image description and incorporating several stereo cues that previously have been neglected in the computer vision literature. A technique based on using the pseudo-inverse is presented for characterizing the information present in a vector of filter responses. We show how in our framework viewing geometry can be recovered to determine the locations of epipolar lines. An assumption that visible surfaces in the scene are piecewise smooth leads to differential treatment of image regions corresponding to binocularly visible surfaces, surface boundaries, and occluded regions that are only monocularly visible. The constraints imposed by viewing geometry and piecewise smoothness are incorporated into an iterative algorithm that gives good results on random-dot stereograms, artificially generated scenes, and natural grey-level images."

Parameters of the model are the surface roughness given by the rms slope, the albedo, and the balance between diffuse and specular reflection. The effect of roughness on diffuse reflection is taken into account, instead of our modeling this component as a constant Lambertian term. The model includes geometrical effects such as masking and shadowing. The model is compared with experimental data obtained from goniophotometric measurements on samples of tiles and bricks. The model fits well to samples with very different reflection properties. Measurements of the sample profiles performed with a laser profilometer to determine the rms slope show that the assumed surface model is realistic. The model could therefore be used in machine vision and computer graphics to approximate reflection characteristics of surfaces. It could also be used to predict the texture of surfaces as a function of illumination and viewing angles."

This model consists of three stages: (1) convolution of the image with a bank of even-symmetric linear filters followed by half-wave rectification to give a set of responses modeling outputs of V1 simple cells, (2) inhibition, localized in space, within and among the neural-response profiles that results in the suppression of weak responses when there are strong responses at the same or nearby locations, and (3) texture-boundary detection by using wide odd-symmetric mechanisms. Our model can predict the salience of texture boundaries in any arbitrary gray-scale image. A computer implementation of this model has been tested on many of the classic stimuli from psychophysical literature. Quantitative predictions of the degree of discriminability of different texture pairs match well with experimental measurements of discriminability in human observers."

Pixel gray levels and the presence and orientation of edges are viewed as states of atoms or molecules in a lattice-like physical system. The assignment of an energy function in the physical system determines its Gibbs distribution. Because of the Gibbs distribution, Markov random field (MRF) equivalence, this assignment also determines an MRF image model. The energy function is a more convenient and natural mechanism for embodying picture attributes than are the local characteristics of the MRF. For a range of degradation mechanisms, including blurring, nonlinear deformations, and multiplicative or additive noise, the posterior distribution is an MRF with a structure akin to the image model. By the analogy, the posterior distribution defines another (imaginary) physical system. Gradual temperature reduction in the physical system isolates low energy states (``annealing''), or what is the same thing, the most probable states under the Gibbs distribution. The analogous operation under the posterior distribution yields the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the image given the degraded observations. The result is a highly parallel ``relaxation'' algorithm for MAP estimation. We establish convergence properties of the algorithm and we experiment with some simple pictures, for which good restorations are obtained at low signal-to-noise ratios."
