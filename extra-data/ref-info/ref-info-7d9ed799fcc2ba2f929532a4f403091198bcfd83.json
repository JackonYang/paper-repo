Networks with an intermediate layer of hidden processing units achieved a classification accuracy as high as 100% on a training set of 104 returns. These networks correctly classified a test set of 104 returns not contained in the training set with an accuracy of up to 90.4%. Networks without an intermediate layer of processing units achieved only 73.1% correct on the same test set. Performance improved and the variability due to the initial conditions for training decreased with the number of hidden units. The effect of training set design on test set performance was also examined. The performance of a three-layered network was better than trained human listeners and the network generalized better than a nearest-neighbor classifier. >"

In Chapter 2, a brief review of the main alternative approaches to the development of brain models is presented. Chapter 3 considers the physiological and psychological criteria for a suitable model, and attempts to evaluate the empirical evidence which is available on several important issues. Chapter 4 contains basic definitions and some of the notation to be used in later sections are presented. Parts II and III are devoted to a summary of the established theoretical results obtained to date. Part II (Chapters 5 through 14) deals with the theory of three-layer series-coupled perceptrons, on which most work has been done to date. Part III (Chapters 15 through 20) deals with the theory of multi-layer and cross-coupled perceptrons. Part IV is concerned with more speculative models and problems for future analysis. Of necessity, the final chapters become increasingly heuristic in character, as the theory of perceptrons is not yet complete, and new possibilities are continually coming to light."
