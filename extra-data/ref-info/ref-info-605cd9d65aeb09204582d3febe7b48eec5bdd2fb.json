This paper describes the system design and evaluates several character extraction methods. Automatic text recognition from natural images receives a growing attention because of potential applications in image retrieval, robotics and intelligent transport system. Camera-based document analysis becomes a real possibility with the increasing resolution and availability of digital cameras. However, in the case of a blind person, finding the text region is the first important problem that must be addressed, because it cannot be assumed that the acquired image contains only characters. At first, our system tries to find in the image areas with small characters. Then it zooms into the found areas to retake higher resolution images necessary for character recognition. In the present paper, we propose four character-extraction methods based on connected components. We tested the effectiveness of our methods on the ICDAR 2003 Robust Reading Competition data. The performance of the different methods depends on character size. In the data, bigger characters are more prevalent and the most effective extraction method proves to be the sequence: Sobel edge detection, Otsu binarization, connected component extraction and rule-based connected component filtering."

Camera-based document analysis becomes a real possibility with the increasing resolution and availability of digital cameras. Our research objective is a system that reads the text encountered in natural scenes with the aim to provide assistance to visually impaired persons. In the case of a blind person, finding the text region is the first important problem that must be addressed, because it cannot be assumed that the acquired image contains only characters. In a previous paper (N. Ezaki et al., 2004), we propose four text-detection methods based on connected components. Finding small characters needed significant improvement. This paper describes a new text-detection method geared for small text characters. This method uses Fisher's discriminant rate (FDR) to decide whether an image area should be binarized using local or global thresholds. Fusing the new method with a previous morphology-based one yields improved results. Using a controllable Webcam and a laptop PC, we developed a prototype that works in real time. At first, our system tries to find in the image areas with small characters. Then it zooms into the found areas to retake higher resolution images necessary for character recognition. Going from this proof-of-concept to a complete system requires further research effort."

The heuristic rules based on filters and edge analysis are formed to identify the initial text block and to segment the complete text portion from the image. The new edge features such as straightness and cursiveness are explored to eliminate false positives. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, we introduce misdetection rate and processing time in addition to detection rate and false positive rate. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms existing methods in terms of the above metrics."

Heuristic rules are formed based on combination of filters and edge analysis for identifying a candidate text block in the image. Furthermore, the same rules are extended to grow boundary of candidate text block in order to segment complete text portions in the image. The experimental results of the proposed method show that the method outperforms an existing method in terms of a number of metrics."

In the paper, efficient text detection and binarization methods are used to extract Korean text from color signboards of shops. First, we detect the main Korean text in color signboards by combining the horizontal edge profile in the image and some knowledge of the Korean text specified in our application. Then the detected Korean text is segmented to Korean words by using the vertical edge profile. Finally, each Korean word is fed into binarization module which uses 3-means clustering method in L*a*b* color space to extract text from the background. The experimental results show that our method successfully extracts text with low complexity and therefore can be used in the mobile devices which have limited capability."

With the rapid growth in research over thelast few years on recognizing text in natural scenes, thereis an urgent need to establish some common benchmarkdatasets, and gain a clear understanding of the current stateof the art. We use the term robust reading to refer to text imagesthat are beyond the capabilities of current commercialOCR packages. We chose to break down the robust readingproblem into three sub-problems, and run competitionsfor each stage, and also a competition for the best overallsystem. The sub-problems we chose were text locating,character recognition and word recognition.By breaking down the problem in this way, we hope togain a better understanding of the state of the art in eachof the sub-problems. Furthermore, our methodology involvesstoring detailed results of applying each algorithm toeach image in the data sets, allowing researchers to study indepth the strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm. Thetext locating contest was the only one to have any entries.We report the results of this contest, and show cases wherethe leading algorithms succeed and fail."
