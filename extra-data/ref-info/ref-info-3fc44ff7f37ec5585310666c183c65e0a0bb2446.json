HBG incorporates lexical, syntactic, semantic, and structural information from the parse tree into the disambiguation process in a novel way. We use a corpus of bracketed sentences, called a Treebank, in combination with decision tree building to tease out the relevant aspects of a parse tree that will determine the correct parse of a sentence. This stands in contrast to the usual approach of further grammar tailoring via the usual linguistic introspection in the hope of generating the correct parse. In head-to-head tests against one of the best existing robust probabilistic parsing models, which we call P-CFG, the HBG model significantly outperforms P-CFG, increasing the parsing accuracy rate from 60% to 75%, a 37% reduction in error."

In this paper, I describe SPATTER, a statistical parser based on decision-tree learning techniques which constructs a complete parse for every sentence and achieves accuracy rates far better than any published result. This work is based on the following premises: (1) grammars are too complex and detailed to develop manually for most interesting domains; (2) parsing models must rely heavily on lexical and contextual information to analyze sentences accurately; and (3) existing n-gram modeling techniques are inadequate for parsing models. In experiments comparing SPATTER with IBM's computer manuals parser, SPATTER significantly outperforms the grammar-based parser. Evaluating SPATTER against the Penn Treebank Wall Street Journal corpus using the PARSEVAL measures, SPATTER achieves 86% precision, 86% recall, and 1.3 crossing brackets per sentence for sentences of 40 words or less, and 91% precision, 90% recall, and 0.5 crossing brackets for sentences between 10 and 20 words in length."

The paper first introduces key notions in language modeling and probabilistic parsing, and briefly reviews some previous approaches to using syntactic structure for language modeling. A lexicalized probabilistic top-down parser is then presented, which performs very well, in terms of both the accuracy of returned parses and the efficiency with which they are found, relative to the best broad-coverage statistical parsers. A new language model that utilizes probabilistic top-down parsing is then outlined, and empirical results show that it improves upon previous work in test corpus perplexity. Interpolation with a trigram model yields an exceptional improvement relative to the improvement observed by other models, demonstrating the degree to which the information captured by our parsing model is orthogonal to that captured by a trigram model. A small recognition experiment also demonstrates the utility of the model."

This paper presents a theoretical analysis of the effect of different tree representations for PP attachment on PCFG models, and introduces a new methodology for empirically examining such effects using tree transformations. It shows that one transformation, which copies the label of a parent node onto the labels of its children, can improve the performance of a PCFG model in terms of labelled precision and recall on held out data from 73% (precision) and 69% (recall) to 80% and 79% respectively. It also points out that if only maximum likelihood parses are of interest then many productions can be ignored, since they are subsumed by combinations of other productions in the grammar. In the Penn II tree bank grammar, almost 9% of productions are subsumed in this way."

The base parser produces a set of candidate parses for each input sentence, with associated probabilities that define an initial ranking of these parses. A second model then attempts to improve upon this initial ranking, using additional features of the tree as evidence. The strength of our approach is that it allows a tree to be represented as an arbitrary set of features, without concerns about how these features interact or overlap and without the need to define a derivation or a generative model which takes these features into account. We introduce a new method for the reranking task, based on the boosting approach to ranking problems described in Freund et al. (1998). We apply the boosting method to parsing the Wall Street Journal treebank. The method combined the log-likelihood under a baseline model (that of Collins [1999]) with evidence from an additional 500,000 features over parse trees that were not included in the original model. The new model achieved 89.75 F-measure, a 13 relative decrease in F-measure error over the baseline model's score of 88.2. The article also introduces a new algorithm for the boosting approach which takes advantage of the sparsity of the feature space in the parsing data. Experiments show significant efficiency gains for the new algorithm over the obvious implementation of the boosting approach. We argue that the method is an appealing alternative-in terms of both simplicity and efficiency-to work on feature selection methods within log-linear (maximum-entropy) models. Although the experiments in this article are on natural language parsing (NLP), the approach should be applicable to many other NLP problems which are naturally framed as ranking tasks, for example, speech recognition, machine translation, or natural language generation."

I argue that a purely structural apprach, exemplified by probabilistic context-free grammar, lacks sufficient sensitivity to lexical context, and, conversely, that lexical co-occurence analyses require a richer notion of locality that is best provided by importing some notion of structure.I then propose probabilistic TAG as a framework for statistical language modelling, arguing that it provides an advantageous combination of structure, locality, and lexical sensitivity.

The perplexity for both of these models significantly improve upon the trigram model base-line as well as the best previous grammar-based language model. For the better of our two models these improvements are 24% and 14% respectively.

Eisner (1996) trained three probability models on a small set of about 4,000 conjunction-free, dependencygrammar parses derived from the Wall Street Journal section of the Penn Treebank, and then evaluated the models on a held-out test set, using a novel O(n 3 ) parsing algorithm. The present paper describes some details of the experiments and repeats them with a larger training set of 25,000 sentences. As reported at the talk, the more extensive training yields greatly improved performance, cutting in half the error rate of Eisner (1996). Nearly half the sentences are parsed with no misattachments; two-thirds of sentences are parsed with at most one misattachment. Of the models described in the original paper, the best score is obtained with the generative \u201cmodel C,\u201d which attaches 87\u201388% of all words to the correct parent. However, better models are also explored, in particular, two simple variants on the comprehension \u201cmodel B.\u201d The better of these has an attachment accuracy of 90%, and (unlike model C) tags words more accurately than the comparable trigram tagger. If tags are roughly known in advance, search error is all but eliminated and the new model attains an attachment accuracy of 93%. We find that the parser of Collins (1996), when combined with a highlytrained tagger, also achieves 93% when trained and tested on the same sentences. We briefly discuss the similarities and differences between Collins\u2019s model and ours, pointing out the strengths of each and noting that these strengths could be combined for either dependency parsing or phrase-structure parsing."

In particular, unsupervised learning techniques, such as the inside-outside algorithm (Baker, 1979) for estimating the parameters of stochastic context-free grammars (SCFGs), tend to produce grammars that structure text in ways contrary to our linguistic intuitions. One effective way around this problem is to use hand-structured text like the Penn Treebank (Marcus, 1991) to constrain the learner: (Pereira and Schabes, 1992) demonstrate that the inside-outside algorithm can learn grammars effectively given such constraint, and currently the best performing parsers are trained on treebanks (Black et al., 1992; Magerman, 1995)."

Tests using Wall Street Journal data show that the method performs at least as well as SPATTER (Magerman 95; Jelinek et al. 94), which has the best published results for a statistical parser on this task. The simplicity of the approach means the model trains on 40,000 sentences in under 15 minutes.

TINA integrates key ideas from context free grammars, Augmented Transition Networks (ATN's), and the unification concept. TINA provides a seamless interface between syntactic and semantic analysis, and also produces a highly constraining probabilistic language model to improve recognition performance. An initial set of context-free rewrite rules provided by hand is first converted to a network structure. Probability assignments on all arcs in the network are obtained automatically from a set of example sentences. The parser uses a stack decoding search strategy, with a top-down control flow, and includes a feature-passing mechanism to deal with long-distance movement, agreement, and semantic constraints. TINA provides an automatic sentence generation capability that has been effective for identifying overgeneralization problems as well as in producing a word-pair language model for a recognizer. The parser is currently integrated with MIT's SUMMIT recognizer for use in two application domains, with the parser screening recognizer outputs either at the sentential level or to filter partial theories during the active search process."

This represents a 13% decrease in error rate over the best single-parser results on this corpus [9]. The major technical innovation is the use of a \"maximum-entropy-inspired\" model for conditioning and smoothing that let us successfully to test and combine many different conditioning events. We also present some partial results showing the effects of different conditioning information, including a surprising 2% improvement due to guessing the lexical head's pre-terminal before guessing the lexical head."

We introduce a variant of the GHR contextfree recognition algorithm, and explain how to adapt it for efficient probahilistic parsing. In splitcorpus testing on a real-world corpus of sentences from software testing documents, with 20 possible parses for a sentence of average length, the system finds and identifies the correct parse in 96% of the sentences for which it finds any parse, while producing only 1.03 parses per sentence for those sentences. Significantly, this success rate would be only 79% without the semantic statistics."

Thus a parser for a lexicalized grammar must search a large set of supertags to choose the right ones to combine for the parse of the sentence. We present techniques for disambiguating supertags using local information such as lexical preference and local lexical dependencies. The similarity between LTAG and Dependency grammars is exploited in the dependency model of supertag disambiguation. The performance results for various models of supertag disambiguation such as unigram, trigram and dependency-based models are presented."

The parser itself requires very little human intervention, since the information it uses to make parsing decisions is specified in a concise and simple manner, and is combined in a fully automatic way under the maximum entropy framework. The observed running time of the parser on a test sentence is linear with respect to the sentence length. Furthermore, the parser returns several scored parses for a sentence, and this paper shows that a scheme to pick the best parse from the 20 highest scoring parses could yield a dramatically higher accuracy of 93% precision and recall."

The algorithm works by beginning in a very naive state of knowledge about phrase structure. By repeatedly comparing the results of bracketing in the current state to proper bracketing provided in the training corpus, the system learns a set of simple structural transformations that can be applied to reduce error.

Error analysis on part-of-speech tagging shows that the actual tagging errors made by the conditionally structured model derive not only from label bias, but also from other ways in which the independence assumptions of the conditional model structure are unsuited to linguistic sequences. The paper presents new word-sense disambiguation and POS tagging experiments, and integrates apparently conflicting reports from other recent work."

This long-awaited book contains both detailed specifications of the theory and extensive illustrations of its power to describe large parts of English grammar. Experts who wish to evaluate the theory and students learning GPSP for the first time will find this book an invaluable guide.The initial chapters lay out the theoretical machinery of GPSP in a readily intelligible way. Combining informal discussion with precise formalization, the authors describe all major aspects of their grammatical system, including a complete theory of syntactic features, phrase structure rules, meta rules, and feature instantiation principles. The book then shows just what a GPSP analysis of English syntax can accomplish. Topics include the internal structure of phrases, unbounded dependency constructions of many varieties, and coordinate conjunction a construction long considered the sticking point for phrase structure approaches to syntax.The book concludes with a well developed proposal for a model theoretic semantic system to go along with GPSP syntax. Throughout, the authors maintain the highest standards of explicitness and rigor in developing and assessing their grammatical system. Their aim is to provide the best possible test of the hypothesis that syntactic description can be accomplished in a single-level system. And more generally, it is their intention to formulate a grammatical framework in which linguistic universals follow directly from the form of the system and therefore require no explicit statement. Their book sets new methodological standards for work in generative grammar while presenting a grammatical system of extraordinary scope.\""

To estimate the parameters is to discover a notion of relatedness among context-free rules such that related rules tend to have related probabilities. The prior favors grammars in which the relationships are simple to describe and have few major exceptions. A basic version that bases relatedness on weighted edit distance yields superior smoothing of grammars learned from the Penn Treebank (20% reduction of rule perplexity over the best previous method)."

The predominant approach in computational linguistics has been to use a parametric model with some variant of maximum-likelihood estimation. The assumptions under which maximum-likelihood estimation is justified are arguably quite strong. This chapter discusses the statistical theory underlying various parameter-estimation methods, and gives algorithms which depend on alternatives to (smoothed) maximum-likelihood estimation. We first give an overview of results from statistical learning theory. We then show how important concepts from the classification literature - specifically, generalization results based on margins on training data - can be derived for parsing models. Finally, we describe parameter estimation algorithms which are motivated by these generalization bounds."

PFGs combine most of the best properties of several other formalisms, including those of Collins, Magerman, and Charniak, and in experiments have comparable or better performance. PFGs generate features one at a time, probabilistically, conditioning the probabilities of each feature on other features in a local context. Because the conditioning is local, efficient polynomial time parsing algorithms exist for computing inside, outside, and Viterbi parses. PFGs can produce probabilities of strings, making them potentially useful for language modeling. Precision and recall results are comparable to the state of the art with words, and the best reported without words."

The algorithm requires a corpus and minimum linguistic knowledge (parts-of-speech of words, simple inflection rules, and a small number of general syntactic rules).We conducted two experiments of applying the algorithm to diferent corpora to extract different types of semantic collocations. Though there are some unsolved problems, the results showed the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm."

We then focus on one class of preference function, those based on semantic lexical collocations. Experimental results are presented showing that such functions vary considerably in selecting correct analyses. In particular, we define a function that performs significantly better than ones based on mutual information and likelihood ratios of lexical associations."

Conditional random fields offer several advantages over hidden Markov models and stochastic grammars for such tasks, including the ability to relax strong independence assumptions made in those models. Conditional random fields also avoid a fundamental limitation of maximum entropy Markov models (MEMMs) and other discriminative Markov models based on directed graphical models, which can be biased towards states with few successor states. We present iterative parameter estimation algorithms for conditional random fields and compare the performance of the resulting models to HMMs and MEMMs on synthetic and natural-language data."

This problem of combining preferences arises in several applications, such as that of combining the results of different search engines, or the \"collaborative-filtering\" problem of ranking movies for a user based on the movie rankings provided by other users. In this work, we begin by presenting a formal framework for this general problem. We then describe and analyze an efficient algorithm called RankBoost for combining preferences based on the boosting approach to machine learning. We give theoretical results describing the algorithm's behavior both on the training data, and on new test data not seen during training. We also describe an efficient implementation of the algorithm for a particular restricted but common case. We next discuss two experiments we carried out to assess the performance of RankBoost. In the first experiment, we used the algorithm to combine different web search strategies, each of which is a query expansion for a given domain. The second experiment is a collaborative-filtering task for making movie recommendations."

Unter anderem konkurrieren sie mit ihrem Wirt um Ressourcen die sonst in z.B. Wachstum oder Entwicklung des Immunsystems investiert werden k\u00f6nnten. Ressourcenverf\u00fcgbarkeit, oft von Umweltbedingungen beeinflusst, spielt daher bei der Embryonalund Jugendentwicklung eine wichtige Rolle. In dieser Studie werden die Kosten eines h\u00e4matophagen Ektoparasiten Carnus hemapterus (Milichiidae, Diptera) unter unterschiedlichen Umweltbedingungen in Bezug auf Wachstum, Immunantwort und Gesundheit nestjunger Europ\u00e4ischer Bienenfresser (Merops apiaster) untersucht. Dazu wurde die Anzahl dieser blutsaugenden Ektoparasiten nestweise manipuliert (erh\u00f6ht oder reduziert). Bestimmt wurden die Auswirkungen auf K\u00f6rperkondition; Immunreaktion (T-Zell und humorale Immunantwort) und zwei potentielle Gesundheitsindikatoren im Blut (Sedimentationsrate und H\u00e4matokrit) von Bienenfressernestlingen. Die Ergebnisse zeigen einen signifikant negativen Effekt von C. hemapterus auf Kondition, Immunantwort und H\u00e4matokrit. Werden Parasiten hingegen aus den Nestern entfernt, erh\u00f6hen sich Kondition, \u03b3-Globulin, T-Zell Immunantwort und H\u00e4matokrit. Obwohl eine Reihe von Fitnessindikatoren beeinflusst wurde, gab es w\u00e4hrend des Experimentes keine Abstract One way that parasites influence host survival and fitness is by competing with their hosts for resources that would otherwise be used for growth and immune system development. Thus resource availability, influenced by environmental conditions, may be particularly important during offspring development. This study examined the influence of a haematophagous ectoparasite Carnus hemapterus (Diptera: Milichiidae) in relation to environmental conditions on the growth, immune response, and health of nestling European Bee-eaters (Merops apiaster). The abundance of this bloodsucking ectoparasite per nest was experimentally manipulated to determine its impact on nestling body condition, immune system function in terms of T-cell-mediated and humoral immune response, and two health parameters, sedimentation rate and haematocrit level. Results indicate a significant negative effect of C. hemapterus intensity on nestling body condition and immune response, and on one blood parameter (haematocrit levels). Nestling body condition, \u03b3-globulin levels, wing web swelling, and haematocrit levels increased when parasites were removed. Although a broad spectrum of fitness indicators seems to be affected, no difference in nestling mortality during the experiment was observed between the two treatment groups. Surprisingly, variations in environmental conditions (weather in particular) that likely affected nestling food availability or"
