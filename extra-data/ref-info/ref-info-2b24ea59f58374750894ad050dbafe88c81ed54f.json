For the components, we apply a relaxation method. The method makes mutual connections between components increase or decrease depending on the state of the neighboring components. While applying the relaxation method several times, the process proceeds from a local connection to a global connection, and finally character strings are extracted. We call this process multi stage relaxation. The advantages of this algorithm are that it does not need to nominate character components from an image beforehand, it is adaptive for character size and font, and it can also cope with a document which includes strings with various orientations. In our experiments we use a color image of a magazine cover and a monochromatic image of a graph. For the color image, the multi stage relaxation was executed for each binary image obtained by color segmentation. Lastly, we show the results of the experiments and discuss the effectiveness of our method."

It is intended for use in an automated system for document analysis. The principal parts of the algorithm are the generation of connected components and the application of the Hough transform in order to group components into logical character strings that can then be separated from the graphics. The algorithm outputs two images, one containing text strings and the other graphics. These images can then be processed by suitable character recognition and graphics recognition systems. The performance of the algorithm, both in terms of its effectiveness and computational efficiency, was evaluated using several test images and showed superior performance compared to other techniques. >"

However, it is difficult to identify individual pieces of information because the map components mutually intersect or are overlayed, and because the properties of the map components are not well defined. In this paper, we propose a method of extracting character strings from color urban map images. The characteristic of our method is to validate the identified character strings with map composition rules. Our recognition process is composed of two phases: extraction of character strings and classification of character strings. The extraction phase is organized by a bottom-up approach, based on measurement/estimation among pixels, while the classification phase is composed by means of a top-down approach, based on interpretation/validation among map components."

The method yields an accurate measure of skew, within-line, and between-line spacings and locates text lines and text blocks. It is advantageous over many other methods in three main ways: independence from skew angle, independence from different text spacings, and the ability to process local regions of different text orientations within the same image. Results of the method shown for several different page formats and for randomly oriented subpages on the same image illustrate the versatility of the method. We also discuss the differences, advantages, and disadvantages of the docstrum with respect to other lay-out methods. >"

A striking example of this approach was given by Waltz [13]. This paper formulates the ambiguity-reduction process in terms of iterated parallel operations (i.e., relaxation operations) performed on an array of (object, identification) data. Several different models of the process are developed, convergence properties of these models are established, and simple examples are given."
