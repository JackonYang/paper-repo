Most processes of early vision such as stereomatching, computation of motion and all the ``structure from\" processes can be regarded as solutions to inverse problems. This common characteristic of early vision can be formalized---{\\it most early vision problems are ``ill-posed problems\" in the sense of Hadamard}. We will show that a mathematical theory developed for regularizing ill-posed problems leads in a natural way to the solution of early vision problems in terms of variational principles of a certain class. This is a new theoretical framework for some of the variational solutions already obtained in the analysis of early vision processes. It also shows how several other problems in early vision can be approached and solved."

Although they are well suited structurally for implementation on massively parallel, locally interconnected computational architectures, such distributed algorithms are seriously handi capped by an inherent inefficiency at propagating constraints between widely separated processing elements. Hence, they converge extremely slowly when confronted by the large representations of early vision. Application of multigrid methods can overcome this drawback, as we showed in previous work on 3-D surface reconstruction. In this paper, we develop multiresolution iterative algorithms for computing lightness, shape-from-shading, and optical flow, and we examine the efficiency of these algorithms using synthetic image inputs. The multigrid methodology that we describe is broadly applicable in early vision. Notably, it is an appealing strategy to use in conjunction with regularization analysis for the efficient solution of a wide range of ill-posed image analysis problems."

Moreover, visual processes such as stereopsis can provide such information at a number of levels spanning a range of resolutions. In this paper, we extend this multi-level structure to encompass the subsequent task of reconstructing full surface descriptions from the sparse information. The mathematical development proceeds in three steps. First, the surface most consistent with the sparse constraints is characterized as the solution to an equilibrium state of a thin flexible plate. Second, local, finite element representations of surfaces are introduced and, by applying the finite element method, the continuous variational principle is transformed into a discrete problem in the form of a large system of linear algebraic equations whose solution is computable by local-support, cooperative mechanisms. Third, to exploit the information available at each level of resolution, a hierarchy of discrete problems is formulated and a highly efficient multi-level algorithm, involving both intra-level relaxation processes and bi-directional inter-level algorithm, involving both intra- level relaxation processes and bidirectional inter-level local interpolation processes is applied to their simultaneous solution.. Examples of the generation of hierarchies of surface representations from stereo constraints are given. Finally, the basic surface approximation problem is revisited in a broader mathematical context whose implications are of relevance to vision."

Particular emphasis is placed on utilizing highly parallel, cooperative processing to integrate surface shape information over multiple visual sources, to fuse it across a multiplicity of spatial resolutions, and to maintain the global consistency of the resulting distributed shape representations. The issues are first investigated in terms of a surface reconstruction model rooted in mathematical physics. This formal analysis is augmented by an empirical study of the resulting algorithms, which feature multiresolution iterative processing within hierarchical surface shape representations. The approach is guided by current knowledge of how humans perceive visible surfaces, while applications in machine vision provide a testbed for the algorithms.

Examples are shape from shading, edge detection, motion analysis, structure from motion, and surface interpolation. As shown by Poggio and Koch [Poggio, T. & Koch, C. (1985) Proc. R. Soc. London, Ser. B 226, 303-323], quadratic variational problems, an important subset of early vision tasks, can be \"solved\" by linear, analog electrical, or chemical networks. However, in the presence of discontinuities, the cost function is nonquadratic, raising the question of designing efficient algorithms for computing the optimal solution. Recently, Hopfield and Tank [Hopfield, J. J. & Tank, D. W. (1985) Biol. Cybern. 52, 141-152] have shown that networks of nonlinear analog \"neurons\" can be effective in computing the solution of optimization problems. We show how these networks can be generalized to solve the nonconvex energy functionals of early vision. We illustrate this approach by implementing a specific analog network, solving the problem of reconstructing a smooth surface from sparse data while preserving its discontinuities. These results suggest a novel computational strategy for solving early vision problems in both biological and real-time artificial vision systems."

The proper abstract setting is a Hilbert function space whose reproducing kernel involves no functions more complicated than logarithms and is easily coded. Convenient representation formulas are given, as also a practical multivariate extension of the Peano kernel theorem. Owing to the numerical stability of Cholesky factorization of positive definite symmetric matrices, the whole construction process of a surface spline can be described as a recursive algorithm, the data relative to the various interpolation points being exploited in sequence.R\u00e9sum\u00e9La m\u00e9thode concr\u00e8te d'interpolation par surfaces-spline est \u00e9troitement li\u00e9e au probl\u00e8me classique de la minimisation d'une semi-norme de Soboleff sous des contraintes d'interpolation; la structure intrins\u00e8que des surfaces-spline est d\u00e8s lors celle d'une extension multivari\u00e9e des fonctions-spline naturelles.

Using a restricted form of quintic Hermite interpolation, it is possible to allow distinct bias and tension parameters at each joint without destroying geometric continuity. This provides a new means of obtaining local control of bias and tension in piecewise polynomial curves and surfaces."

Support for this idea comes from three sources: the obvious utility of intrinsic characteristics for higher-level scene analysis; the apparent ability of humans to determine these characteristics, regardless of viewing conditions or familiarity with the scene; and a theoretical argument that such a description is obtainable, by a noncognitive and nonpurposive process, at least, for simple scene domains. The central problem in recovering intrinsic scene characteristics is that the information is confounded in the original light-intensity image: a single intensity value encodes all the characteristics of the corresponding scene point. Recovery depends on exploiting constraints, derived from assumptions about the nature of the scene and the physics of the imaging process."

A fundamental problem in computing such descriptions is scale: a derivative must be taken over some neighborhood, but there is seldom a principled basis for choosing its size. Scale-space filtering is a method that describes signals qualitatively, managing the ambiguity of scale in an organized and natural way. The signal is first expanded by convolution with gaussian masks over a continuum of sizes. This \"scale-space\" image is then collapsed, using its qualitative structure, into a tree providing a concise but complete qualitative description covering all scales of observation. The description is further refined by applying a stability criterion, to identify events that persist of large changes in scale."

The data \u03a6i may be the result of theory, direct measurements, remote soundings or a combination of these. We develop a new mathematical formalism exploiting the method of Generalized Cross Validation (GCV), and some recently developed optimization results, for analyzing this data. The analyzed field \u03a6N,m,\u03bb is the solution to the minimization problem: Find \u03a6 in a suitable space of functions to minimize where Functions of d=1, 2 or 3 of the four variables x, y, p, t are also considered. The approach can he used to analyze temperature fields from radiosonde-measured temperatures and satellite radiance measurements simultaneously, to incorporate the geostrophic wind approximation and other information.

An important aspect of vision is the choice of representations for the different kinds of information in a visual scene. In the early stages of the analysis of an image, the representations used depend more on what it is possible to compute from an image than on what is ultimately desirable, but later representations can be more sensitive to the specific needs of recognition. This essay surveys recent work in vision at M.I.T. from a perspective in which the representational problems assume a primary importance. An overall framework is suggested for visual information processing, in which the analysis proceeds through three representations; (1) the primal sketch, which makes explicit the intensity changes and local two-dimensional geometry of an image, (2) the 2 1/2-D sketch, which is a viewer-centered representation of the depth, orientation and discontinuities of the visible surfaces, and (3) the 3-D model representation, which allows an object-centered description of the three-dimensional structure and organization of a viewed shape. Recent results concerning processes for constructing and maintaining these representations are summarized and discussed. (Author)"

Pixel gray levels and the presence and orientation of edges are viewed as states of atoms or molecules in a lattice-like physical system. The assignment of an energy function in the physical system determines its Gibbs distribution. Because of the Gibbs distribution, Markov random field (MRF) equivalence, this assignment also determines an MRF image model. The energy function is a more convenient and natural mechanism for embodying picture attributes than are the local characteristics of the MRF. For a range of degradation mechanisms, including blurring, nonlinear deformations, and multiplicative or additive noise, the posterior distribution is an MRF with a structure akin to the image model. By the analogy, the posterior distribution defines another (imaginary) physical system. Gradual temperature reduction in the physical system isolates low energy states (``annealing''), or what is the same thing, the most probable states under the Gibbs distribution. The analogous operation under the posterior distribution yields the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the image given the degraded observations. The result is a highly parallel ``relaxation'' algorithm for MAP estimation. We establish convergence properties of the algorithm and we experiment with some simple pictures, for which good restorations are obtained at low signal-to-noise ratios."

To avoid this difficulty, a spline in tension is considered and the value of tension which is sufficient to remove all the extraneous inflection points is determined. The slopes of the interpolating curve at each of the given stations are considered as the unknowns and can be calculated without the necessity of numerical matrix inversion."

There are nine labels associated with each image point, eight labels indicating line segments at various orientations and one indicating the no-line case. Attached to each label is a probability. In the relaxation process, interaction takes place among the probabilities at neighboring points. This permits line segments in compatible orientations to strengthen one another, and incompatible segments to weaken one another. Similarly, no-line labels are reinforced by neighboring no-line labels and weakened by appropriately oriented line labels. This process converges, in only a few iterations, to a condition in which points lying on long curves have achieved high line probabilities, while other points have high no-line probabilities, There is some tendency, under this process, for curves to thicken; however, a thinning procedure can be incorporated to counteract this. The process is effective even for curves of low contrast, and even when many curves lie close to one another."
