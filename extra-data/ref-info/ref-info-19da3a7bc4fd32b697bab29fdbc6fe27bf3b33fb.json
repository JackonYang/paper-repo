Typically, these approaches have enumerated all possible parses for model estimation and finding the most probable parse. For grammars extracted from the Penn Treebank (in our case CCGbank (Hockenmaier, 2003)), enumerating all parses is infeasible. One approach to this problem is to sample the parse space for estimation, e.g. Osborne (2000). In this paper we use a dynamic programming technique applied to a packed chart, similar to those proposed by Geman and Johnson (2002) and Miyao and Tsujii (2002), which efficiently estimates the model parameters over the complete space without enumerating parses."

These models are trained and tested on a corpus obtained by translating the Penn Treebank trees into CCG normal-form derivations. According to an evaluation of unlabeled word-word dependencies, our best model achieves a performance of 89.9%, comparable to the figures given by Collins (1999) for a linguistically less expressive grammar. In contrast to Gildea (2001), we find a significant improvement from modeling word-word dependencies."

A set of dependency structures used for training and testing the parser is obtained from a treebank of CCG normal-form derivations, which have been derived (semi-) automatically from the Penn Treebank. The parser correctly recovers over 80% of labelled dependencies, and around 90% of unlabelled dependencies."

                "text": "This dissertation is concerned with the creation of training data and the development of probability models for statistical parsing of English with Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG). Parsing, or syntactic analysis, is a prerequisite for semantic interpretation, and forms therefore an integral part of any system which requires natural language understanding. Since almost all naturally occurring sentences are ambiguous, it is not sufficient (and often impossible) to generate all possible syntactic analyses. Instead, the parser needs to rank competing analyses and select only the most likely ones. A statistical parser uses a probability model to perform this task. I propose a number of ways in which such probability models can be defined for CCG. The kinds of models developed in this dissertation, generative models over normal-form derivation trees, are particularly simple, and have the further property of restricting the set of syntactic analyses to those corresponding to a canonical derivation structure. This is important to guarantee that parsing can be done efficiently. In order to achieve high parsing accuracy, a large corpus of annotated data is required to estimate the parameters of the probability models. Most existing wide-coverage statistical parsers use models of phrase-structure trees estimated from the Penn Treebank, a 1-million-word corpus of manually annotated sentences from the Wall Street Journal. This dissertation presents an algorithm which translates the phrase-structure analyses of the Penn Treebank to CCG derivations. The resulting corpus, CCGbank, is used to train and test the models proposed in this dissertation. Experimental results indicate that parsing accuracy (when evaluated according to a comparable metric, the recovery of unlabelled word-word dependency relations), is as high as that of standard Penn Treebank parsers which use similar modelling techniques. Most existing wide-coverage statistical parsers use simple phrase-structure grammars whose syntactic analyses fail to capture long-range dependencies, and therefore do not correspond to directly interpretable semantic representations. By contrast, CCG is a grammar formalism in which semantic representations that include long-range dependencies can be built directly during the derivation of syntactic structure. These dependencies define the predicate-argument structure of a sentence, and are used for two purposes in this dissertation: First, the performance of the parser can be evaluated according to how well it recovers these dependencies. In contrast to purely syntactic evaluations, this yields a direct measure of how accurate the semantic interpretations returned by the parser are. Second, I propose a generative model that captures the local and non-local dependencies in the predicate-argument structure, and investigate the impact of modelling non-local in addition to local dependencies."

Existing algorithms for parsing and estimation require the enumeration of all of the parses of a string in order to determine the most likely one, or in order to calculate the statistics needed to estimate a grammar from a training corpus. This paper describes a graph-based dynamic programming algorithm for calculating these statistics from the packed UBG parse representations of Maxwell and Kaplan (1995) which does not require enumerating all parses. Like many graphical algorithms, the dynamic programming algorithm's complexity is worst-case exponential, but is often polynomial. The key observation is that by using Maxwell and Kaplan packed representations, the required statistics can be rewritten as either the max or the sum of a product of functions. This is exactly the kind of problem which can be solved by dynamic programming over graphical models."

We report on the results of applying this system to parsing the UPenn Wall Street Journal (WSJ) treebank. The model combines full and partial parsing techniques to reach full grammar coverage on unseen data. The treebank annotations are used to provide partially labeled data for discriminative statistical estimation using exponential models. Disambiguation performance is evaluated by measuring matches of predicate-argument relations on two distinct test sets. On a gold standard of manually annotated f-structures for a subset of the WSJ treebank, this evaluation reaches 79% F-score. An evaluation on a gold standard of dependency relations for Brown corpus data achieves 76% F-score."

Results using the parsed Wall Street Journal corpus show that in some circumstances, it is possible to obtain better estimation results using an informative sample than when training upon all the available material. Further experimentation demonstrates that with unlexicalised models, a Gaussian prior can reduce overfitting. However, when models are lexicalised and contain overlapping features, overfitting does not seem to be a problem, and a Gaussian prior makes minimal difference to performance. Our approach is applicable for situations when there are an infeasibly large number of parses in the training set, or else for when recovery of these parses from a packed representation is itself computationally expensive."

To date, however, no satisfactory probabilistic analogue of attribute-value grammars has been proposed: previous attempts have failed to define an adequate parameter-estimation algorithm.In the present paper, I define stochastic attribute-value grammars and give an algorithm for computing the maximum-likelihood estimate of their parameters. The estimation algorithm is adapted from Della Pietra, Della Pietra, and Lafferty (1995). To estimate model parameters, it is necessary to compute the expectations of certain functions under random fields. In the application discussed by Della Pietra, Della Pietra, and Lafferty (representing English orthographic constraints), Gibbs sampling can be used to estimate the needed expectations. The fact that attribute-value grammars generate constrained languages makes Gibbs sampling inapplicable, but I show that sampling can be done using the more general Metropolis-Hastings algorithm."

Most existing statistical language models exploit only the immediate history of a text. To extract information from further back in the document's history, we propose and usetrigger pairsas the basic information bearing elements. This allows the model to adapt its expectations to the topic of discourse. Next, statistical evidence from multiple sources must be combined. Traditionally, linear interpolation and its variants have been used, but these are shown here to be seriously deficient. Instead, we apply the principle of Maximum Entropy (ME). Each information source gives rise to a set of constraints, to be imposed on the combined estimate. The intersection of these constraints is the set of probability functions which are consistent with all the information sources. The function with the highest entropy within that set is the ME solution. Given consistent statistical evidence, a unique ME solution is guaranteed to exist, and an iterative algorithm exists which is guaranteed to converge to it. The ME framework is extremely general: any phenomenon that can be described in terms of statistics of the text can be readily incorporated. An adaptive language model based on the ME approach was trained on theWall Street Journalcorpus, and showed a 32\u201339% perplexity reduction over the baseline. When interfaced to SPHINX-II, Carnegie Mellon's speech recognizer, it reduced its error rate by 10\u201314%. This thus illustrates the feasibility of incorporating many diverse knowledge sources in a single, unified statistical framework."

The learning paradigm builds increasingly complex fields by allowing potential functions, or features, that are supported by increasingly large subgraphs. Each feature has a weight that is trained by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the model and the empirical distribution of the training data. A greedy algorithm determines how features are incrementally added to the field and an iterative scaling algorithm is used to estimate the optimal values of the weights. The random field models and techniques introduced in this paper differ from those common to much of the computer vision literature in that the underlying random fields are non-Markovian and have a large number of parameters that must be estimated. Relations to other learning approaches, including decision trees, are given. As a demonstration of the method, we describe its application to the problem of automatic word classification in natural language processing."

However, the flexibility of ME models is not without cost. While parameter estimation for ME models is conceptually straightforward, in practice ME models for typical natural language tasks are very large, and may well contain many thousands of free parameters. In this paper, we consider a number of algorithms for estimating the parameters of ME models, including iterative scaling, gradient ascent, conjugate gradient, and variable metric methods. Sur-prisingly, the standardly used iterative scaling algorithms perform quite poorly in comparison to the others, and for all of the test problems, a limited-memory variable metric algorithm outperformed the other choices."

Several smoothing methods for maximum entropy models have been proposed to address this problem, but previous results do not make it clear how these smoothing methods compare with smoothing methods for other types of related models. In this work, we survey previous work in maximum entropy smoothing and compare the performance of several of these algorithms with conventional techniques for smoothing n-gram language models. Because of the mature body of research in n-gram model smoothing and the close connection between maximum entropy and conventional n-gram models, this domain is well-suited to gauge the performance of maximum entropy smoothing methods. Over a large number of data sets, we find that an ME smoothing method proposed to us by Lafferty performs as well as or better than all other algorithms under consideration. This general and efficient method involves using a Gaussian prior on the parameters of the model and selecting maximum a posteriori instead of maximum likelihood parameter values. We contrast this method with previous n-gram smoothing methods to explain its superior performance."
