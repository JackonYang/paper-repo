The network uses the pattern of activation over a set of hidden units from time-step t-1, together with element t, to predict element t+1. When the network is trained with strings from a particular finite-state grammar, it can learn to be a perfect finite-state recognizer for the grammar. Cluster analyses of the hidden-layer patterns of activation showed that they encode prediction-relevant information about the entire path traversed through the network. We illustrate the phases of learning with cluster analyses performed at different points during training."

We propose an architecture in which time serves as its own representation, and temporal context is encoded in the state of the nodes. We contrast this with the approach of replicating portions of the architecture to represent time. \n \nAs one example of these ideas, we demonstrate an architecture with capacitive inputs serving as temporal feature detectors in an otherwise standard back propagation model. Experiments involving motion detection and word discrimination serve to illustrate novel features of the system. Finally, we discuss possible extensions of the architecture."

                        "text": "Recently, Pearlmutter (1988) has extended backpropagation through time to continuous time approximations. Backpropagation through time deals well with dynamical problems with fixed, or at least previously known, temporal periods. Generating periodic, dynamic behavior from static inputs is an example of the kind of problem that can be learned by this technique. Unfortunately, many interesting problems are not of this type. For example, strings of arbitrary length generated by a probabilistic finite state grammar do not have a fixed, previously known length so backpropagation through time must have some a priori knowledge of their maximum length to set up a system with sufficient size to learn to recognize them. Also, many problems in signal processing and speech recognition involve learning about temporal sequences with a priori unknown temporal properties. T o get around these limitations Jordan and others (Jordan, 1986; Stornetta et al., 1987; Elman, 1988) have used networks with a limited set of carefully chosen recurrent connections. These networks are able to learn some of the interesting tasks possible with continuously running networks having recurrent connections. These networks do not try to do credit assignment back through time but rather use the previous state of the network as pan of the current input. This provides rich, but not total, information about the past so long as appropriate teaching signals are applied to the network. However, the ability of these networks to deal with long, confusing temporal sequences is clearly limited (Servan-Schreiber et al., 1988). Mozer (1988) has attempted to overcome some of these difficulties by adding a layer of units that each have a single self-recurrent connection that is trained by a true gradient-following learning rule."
