This scheme generalizes the computational scheme proposed by Shafer and Logan ' for diagnostic trees of the type studied by Gordon and Shortliffe2,3 and the slightly more general scheme proposed by Shafer4 for hierarchical evidence. It also generalizes the computational scheme proposed by Pearl5 for Bayesian causal trees. Pearl's causal trees and Gordon and Shortliffe's diagnostic trees are both ways of breaking down the evidence that bears on a large problem into smaller items of evidence that bear on smaDler parts of the problem so that these smaller problems can be dealt with one at a time. This localization of effort is often essential to make the process of probability judgment feasible, both for the person who is making probability judgments and for the machine that is combining them. The basic structure for our scheme is a type of tree that generalizes both Pearl's and Gordon and Shortliffe's trees. Trees of this type permit localized computation in Pearl's sense. They are based on qualitative judgments of conditional independence. We believe that the scheme we describe here will prove useful in expert systems. It is now clear that the successful propagation of probability or certainty factors in expert systems requires much more structure than can be provided in a pure production-system framework. Bayesian schemes, on the other hand, often make unrealistic demands for structure. The propagation of belief functions in trees and more general networks occupies a middle ground where some sensible and useful things can be done. We would like to emphasize that the basic idea of local computation for propagating probabilities is Judea Pearl's. It is an innovative idea; we do not believe that it can be found in the Bayesian literature prior to Pearl's work. We see our contribution as extending Pearl's idea from Bayesian probabilities to belief functions. We wil describe the scheme proposed by Pearl5 for Bayesian causal trees. Then, we will describe the scheme proposed by Shafer and Logan I for diagnostic trees, and, afterwards, as a background to our own scheme, we will describe qualitative Markov trees. Finaly, we wil describe our belieffunction scheme, which has Pearl's and Shafer and Logan's schemes as special cases."

Several AI implementations have been undertaken [e.g., Lowrance et al. 1986, Biswas and Anand 1987], but the computational complexity of Dempster's rule has limited the usefulness of such implementations. With the advent of efficient propagation schemes in Markov trees [Shafer et al. 1987], the time is ripe for more powerful systems. \n \nThis paper discusses DELIEF (Design of bELIEFs), an interactive system that allows the design of belief function arguments via a simple graphical interface. The user of DELIEF constructs a graph, with nodes representing variables and edges representing relations among variables. This graph serves as a default knowledge schema. The user enters belief functions representing evidence pertinent to the individual variables in a specific situation, and the system combines them to obtain beliefs on all variables. The schema may be revised and reevaluated until the user is satisfied with the result. The Markov tree used for belief propagation is displayed on demand. The system handles Bayesian causal trees [Pearl 1986] as a special case, and it has a special user interface for this case."

A network of this sort can be used to represent the generic knowledge of a domain expert, and it turns into a computational architecture if the links are used not merely for storing factual knowledge but also for directing and activating the data flow in the computations which manipulate this knowledge. The first part of the paper deals with the task of fusing and propagating the impacts of new information through the networks in such a way that, when equilibrium is reached, each proposition will be assigned a measure of belief consistent with the axioms of probability theory. It is shown that if the network is singly connected (e.g. tree-structured), then probabilities can be updated by local propagation in an isomorphic network of parallel and autonomous processors and that the impact of new information can be imparted to all propositions in time proportional to the longest path in the network. The second part of the paper deals with the problem of finding a tree-structured representation for a collection of probabilistically coupled propositions using auxiliary (dummy) variables, colloquially called \"hidden causes.\" It is shown that if such a tree-structured representation exists, then it is possible to uniquely uncover the topology of the tree by observing pairwise dependencies among the available propositions (i.e., the leaves of the tree). The entire tree structure, including the strengths of all internal relationships, can be reconstructed in time proportional to n log n, where n is the number of leaves."

Overtly epistemological notions are, of course, the concept of belief itself, the concept of subjective probability, and, presumably the most important, the concept of a reason in the sense of a theoretical reason for believing something. Covertly epistemological notions are much more difficult to understand; maybe, they are not epistemological at all. However, a very promising strategy for understanding them is to try to conceive of them as covertly epistemological. One such notion is the concept of objective probability;1 the concept of explanation is another. A third, very important one is the notion of causation, which has been epistemologically problematic ever since Hume. Finally, there is the notion of truth. Many philosophers believe that there is much to be said for a coherence theory of truth or internal realism; they hold some version of the claim that something for which it is impossible to get a true reason cannot be true, and that truth is therefore covertly epistemological."

These models are hierarchical models that can be represented by a simple, undirected graph on as many vertices as the dimension of the corresponding table. Further all these models can be given an interpretation in terms of conditional independence and the interpretation can be read directly off the graph in the form of a Markov property. The class of graphical models contains that of decomposable models and we give a simple criterion for decomposability of a given graphical model. To some extent we discuss estimation problems and give suggestions for further work."

We address the problem of determining whether a graph is a partial graph of a k-tree. This problem is motivated by the existence of polynomial time algorithms for many combinatorial problems on graphs when the graph is constrained to be a partial k-tree for fixed k. These algorithms have practical applications in areas such as reliability, concurrent broadcasting and evaluation of queries in a relational database system. We determine the complexity status of two problems related to finding the smallest number k such that a given graph is a partial k-tree. First, the corresponding decision problem is NP-complete. Second, for a fixed (predetermined) value of k, we present an algorithm with polynomially bounded (but exponential in k) worst case time complexity. Previously, this problem had only been solved for $k = 1,2,3$."

The reel is mounted in a casing which receives the tee when the spring rotates the reel to wind the spring onto it. The reel is normally locked by a one-way ratchet but is released to wind in the string by a push-button which has a spike and is detachable from the casing so as to be usable as a ball marker. When practising, the cord can be aligned with the green or hole and used as an aid in swinging the club face in the correct direction. The casing has a spring-clip so that the article can be clipped into the golfer's pocker when he is not using it."
