Chill treats language acquisition as the learning of search-control rules within a logic program. Unlike many current corpus-based approaches that use statistical learning algorithms, Chill uses techniques from inductive logic programming (ILP) to learn relational representations. Chill is a very flexible system and has been used to learn parsers that produce syntactic parse trees, case-role analyses, and executable database queries. The reported experiments compare Chill's performance to that of a more naive application of ILP to parser acquisition. The results show that ILP techniques, as employed in Chill, are a viable alternative to statistical methods and that the control-rule framework is fundamental to Chill's success."

                "text": "Designing computer systems to understand natural language input is a difficult task. In recent years there has been considerable interest in corpus-based methods for constructing natural language parsers. These empirical approaches replace hand-crafted grammars with linguistic models acquired through automated training over language corpora. A common thread among such methods to date is the use of propositional or probabilistic representations for the learned knowledge. This dissertation presents an alternative approach based on techniques from a subfield of machine learning known as inductive logic programming (ILP). ILP, which investigates the learning of relational (first-order) rules, provides an empirical method for acquiring knowledge within traditional symbolic parsing frameworks. \nThis dissertation details the architecture, implementation and evaluation of C scHILL, a computer system for acquiring natural language parsers by training over corpora of parsed text. C scHILL treats language acquisition as the learning of search-control rules within a logic program that implements a shift-reduce parser. Control rules are induced using a novel ILP algorithm which handles difficult issues arising in the induction of search-control heuristics. Both the control-rule framework and the induction algorithm are crucial to C scHILL's success. \nThe main advantage of C scHILL over propositional counterparts is its flexibility in handling varied representations. C scHILL has produced parsers for various analyses including case-role mapping, detailed syntactic parse trees, and a logical form suitable for expressing first-order database queries. All of these tasks are accomplished within the same framework, using a single, general learning method that can acquire new syntactic and semantic categories for resolving ambiguities. \nExperimental evidence from both artificial and real-world corpora demonstrates that C scHILL learns parsers as well or better than previous artificial neural network or probabilistic approaches on comparable tasks. In the database query domain, which goes beyond the scope of previous empirical approaches, the learned parser outperforms an existing hand-crafted system. These results support the claim that ILP techniques as implemented in C scHILL represent a viable alternative with significant potential advantages over neural-network, propositional, and probabilistic approaches to empirical parser construction."

A majority of the grammarian's efforts are devoted to the disambiguation process, first hypothesizing rules which dictate constituent categories and relationships among words in ambiguous sentences, and then seeking exceptions and corrections to these rules. \nIn this work, I propose an automatic method for acquiring a statistical parser from a set of parsed sentences which takes advantage of some initial linguistic input, but avoids the pitfalls of the iterative and seemingly endless grammar development process. Based on distributionally-derived and linguistically-based features of language, this parser acquires a set of statistical decision trees which assign a probability distribution on the space of parse trees given the input sentence. These decision trees take advantage of significant amount of contextual information, potentially including all of the lexical information in the sentence, to produce highly accurate statistical models of the disambiguation process. By basing the disambiguation criteria selection on entropy reduction rather than human intuition, this parser development method is able to consider more sentences than a human grammarian can when making individual disambiguation rules. \nIn experiments between a parser, acquired using this statistical framework, and a grammarian's rule-based parser, developed over a ten-year period, both using the same training material and test sentences, the decision tree parser significantly outperformed the grammar-based parser on the accuracy measure which the grammarian was trying to maximize, achieving an accuracy of 78% compared to the grammar-based parser's 69%."

Chat-80 has been designed to be both efficient and easily adaptable to a variety of applications. The system is implemented entirely in Prolog, a programming language based on logic. With the aid of a logic-based grammar formalism called extraposition grammars, Chat-80 translates English questions into the Prolog subset of logic. The resulting logical expression is then transformed by a planning algorithm into efficient Prolog, cf. \"query optimisation\" in a relational database. Finally, the Prolog form is executed to yield the answer. On a domain of world geography, most questions within the English subset are answered in well under one second, including relatively complex queries."

HBG incorporates lexical, syntactic, semantic, and structural information from the parse tree into the disambiguation process in a novel way. We use a corpus of bracketed sentences, called a Treebank, in combination with decision tree building to tease out the relevant aspects of a parse tree that will determine the correct parse of a sentence. This stands in contrast to the usual approach of further grammar tailoring via the usual linguistic introspection in the hope of generating the correct parse. In head-to-head tests against one of the best existing robust probabilistic parsing models, which we call P-CFG, the HBG model significantly outperforms P-CFG, increasing the parsing accuracy rate from 60% to 75%, a 37% reduction in error."

The basic material is presented in depth; advanced material, involving new logic grammar formalisms and applications, is presented with a view towards breadth. Major sections of the book include: grammars for formal language and linguistic research, writing a simple logic grammar, different types of logic grammars, applications, and logic grammars and concurrency. This book is intended for those interested in logic programming, artificial intelligence, computational linguistics, Fifth Generation computing, formal languages and compiling techniques. It may be read profitably by upper-level undergraduates, post-graduate students, and active researchers on the above-named areas. Some familiarity with Prolog and logic programming would be helpful; the authors, however, briefly describe Prolog and its relation to logic grammars. After reading Logic Grammars, the reader will be able to cope with the ever-increasing literature of this new and exciting field."

The method has been applied to design of a speech understanding (SU) system. Designers of such systems rely increasingly on robust matchers to perform the task of extracting meaning from one or several word sequence hypotheses generated by a speech recognizer. We describe a new data structure, the semantic classification tree (SCT), that learns semantic rules from training data and can be a building block for robust matchers for NLU tasks. By reducing the need for handcoding and debugging a large number of rules, this approach facilitates rapid construction of an NLU system. In the case of an SU system, the rules learned by an SCT are highly resistant to errors by the speaker or by the speech recognizer because they depend on a small number of words in each utterance. Our work shows that semantic rules can be learned automatically from training data, yielding successful NLU for a realistic application. >"

The algorithm works by beginning in a very naive state of knowledge about phrase structure. By repeatedly comparing the results of bracketing in the current state to proper bracketing provided in the training corpus, the system learns a set of simple structural transformations that can be applied to reduce error. After describing the algorithm, we present results and compare these results to other recent results in automatic grammar induction."

We give the equations for estimating the necessary probabilities using a variant of the inside-outside algorithm. We give experimental results showing that, beginning with a high-performance PCFG, one can develop a pseudo PCSG that yields significant performance gains. Analysis shows that the benefits from the context-sensitive statistics are localized, suggesting that we can use them to extend the original PCFG. Experimental results confirm that this is both feasible and the resulting grammar retains the performance gains. This implies that our scheme may be useful as a novel method for PCFG induction."

The algorithm works by beginning in a very naive state of knowledge about phrase structure. By repeatedly comparing the results of bracketing in the current state to proper bracketing provided in the training corpus, the system learns a set of simple structural transformations that can be applied to reduce error. After describing the algorithm, we present results and compare these results to other recent results in automatic grammar induction."
