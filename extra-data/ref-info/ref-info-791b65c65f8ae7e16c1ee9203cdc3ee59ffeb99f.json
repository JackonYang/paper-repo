Crucially, these approaches are trained based on the assumption that each sentence which mentions the two related entities is an expression of the given relation. Here we argue that this leads to noisy patterns that hurt precision, in particular if the knowledge base is not directly related to the text we are working with. We present a novel approach to distant supervision that can alleviate this problem based on the following two ideas: First, we use a factor graph to explicitly model the decision whether two entities are related, and the decision whether this relation is mentioned in a given sentence; second, we apply constraint-driven semi-supervision to train this model without any knowledge about which sentences express the relations in our training KB. We apply our approach to extract relations from the New York Times corpus and use Freebase as knowledge base. When compared to a state-of-the-art approach for relation extraction under distant supervision, we achieve 31% error reduction."

Instead of exploiting man-made input features carefully optimized for each task, our system learns internal representations on the basis of vast amounts of mostly unlabeled training data.

We investigate an alternative paradigm that does not require labeled corpora, avoiding the domain dependence of ACE-style algorithms, and allowing the use of corpora of any size. Our experiments use Freebase, a large semantic database of several thousand relations, to provide distant supervision. For each pair of entities that appears in some Freebase relation, we find all sentences containing those entities in a large unlabeled corpus and extract textual features to train a relation classifier. Our algorithm combines the advantages of supervised IE (combining 400,000 noisy pattern features in a probabilistic classifier) and unsupervised IE (extracting large numbers of relations from large corpora of any domain). Our model is able to extract 10,000 instances of 102 relations at a precision of 67.6%. We also analyze feature performance, showing that syntactic parse features are particularly helpful for relations that are ambiguous or lexically distant in their expression."

However, they cannot capture the compositional meaning of longer phrases, preventing them from a deeper understanding of language. We introduce a recursive neural network (RNN) model that learns compositional vector representations for phrases and sentences of arbitrary syntactic type and length. Our model assigns a vector and a matrix to every node in a parse tree: the vector captures the inherent meaning of the constituent, while the matrix captures how it changes the meaning of neighboring words or phrases. This matrix-vector RNN can learn the meaning of operators in propositional logic and natural language. The model obtains state of the art performance on three different experiments: predicting fine-grained sentiment distributions of adverb-adjective pairs; classifying sentiment labels of movie reviews and classifying semantic relationships such as cause-effect or topic-message between nouns using the syntactic path between them."

Knowledge-based weak supervision, using structured data to heuristically label a training corpus, works towards this goal by enabling the automated learning of a potentially unbounded number of relation extractors. Recently, researchers have developed multi-instance learning algorithms to combat the noisy training data that can come from heuristic labeling, but their models assume relations are disjoint --- for example they cannot extract the pair Founded(Jobs, Apple) and CEO-of(Jobs, Apple). \n \nThis paper presents a novel approach for multi-instance learning with overlapping relations that combines a sentence-level extraction model with a simple, corpus-level component for aggregating the individual facts. We apply our model to learn extractors for NY Times text using weak supervision from Free-base. Experiments show that the approach runs quickly and yields surprising gains in accuracy, at both the aggregate and sentence level."

Our model differs from previous RNN models in that the model allows for an explicit weighting of important phrases for the target task. We also propose to average parameters in training. Our experimental results on semantic relation classification show that both phrase categories and task-specific weighting significantly improve the prediction accuracy of the model. We also show that averaging the model parameters is effective in stabilizing the learning and improves generalization capacity. The proposed model marks scores competitive with state-of-the-art RNN-based models."

This paper investigates the incorporation of diverse lexical, syntactic and semantic knowledge in feature-based relation extraction using SVM. Our study illustrates that the base phrase chunking information is very effective for relation extraction and contributes to most of the performance improvement from syntactic aspect while additional information from full parsing gives limited further enhancement. This suggests that most of useful information in full parse trees for relation extraction is shallow and can be captured by chunking. We also demonstrate how semantic information such as WordNet and Name List, can be used in feature-based relation extraction to further improve the performance. Evaluation on the ACE corpus shows that effective incorporation of diverse features enables our system outperform previously best-reported systems on the 24 ACE relation subtypes and significantly outperforms tree kernel-based systems by over 20 in F-measure on the 5 ACE relation types."

When a sentence and a knowledge base refer to the same entity pair, this approach heuristically labels the sentence with the corresponding relation in the knowledge base. However, this heuristic can fail with the result that some sentences are labeled wrongly. This noisy labeled data causes poor extraction performance. In this paper, we propose a method to reduce the number of wrong labels. We present a novel generative model that directly models the heuristic labeling process of distant supervision. The model predicts whether assigned labels are correct or wrong via its hidden variables. Our experimental results show that this model detected wrong labels with higher performance than baseline methods. In the experiment, we also found that our wrong label reduction boosted the performance of relation extraction."

A first step towards exploiting this data automatically could be to extract pairs of a given semantic relation from text documents - for example all pairs of a person and her birthdate. One strategy for this task is to find text patterns that express the semantic relation, to generalize these patterns, and to apply them to a corpus to find new pairs. In this paper, we show that this approach profits significantly when deep linguistic structures are used instead of surface text patterns. We demonstrate how linguistic structures can be represented for machine learning, and we provide a theoretical analysis of the pattern matching approach. We show the benefits of our approach by extensive experiments with our prototype system LEILA."

It exploits constituent dependencies to keep the nodes and their head children along the path connecting the two entities, while removing the noisy information from the syntactic parse tree, eventually leading to a dynamic syntactic parse tree. This paper also explores entity features and their combined features in a unified parse and semantic tree, which integrates both structured syntactic parse information and entity-related semantic information. Evaluation on the ACE RDC 2004 corpus shows that our dynamic syntactic parse tree outperforms all previous tree spans, and the composite kernel combining this tree kernel with a linear state-of-the-art feature-based kernel, achieves the so far best performance."

Stability-based criterion is used to automatically estimate the number of clusters. For removing noisy feature words in clustering procedure, feature selection is conducted by optimizing a trace based criterion subject to some constraint in an unsupervised manner. After relation clustering procedure, we employ a discriminative category matching (DCM) to find typical and discriminative words to represent different relations. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our algorithm."

In this sense, language can be structured in respect to various independent features. And whether it is structured (to more than a trivial extent) in respect to, say, regular historical change, social intercourse, meaning, or distribution - or to what extent it is structured in any of these respects - is a matter decidable by investigation. Here we will discuss how each language can be described in terms of a distributional structure, i.e. in terms of the occurrence of parts (ultimately sounds) relative to other parts, and how this description is complete without intrusion of other features such as history or meaning. It goes without saying that other studies of language - historical, psychological, etc.-are also possible, both in relation to distributional structure and independently of it."
