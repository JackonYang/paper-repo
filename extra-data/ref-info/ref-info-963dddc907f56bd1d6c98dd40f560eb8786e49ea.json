Trackers based on Kalman filters are of limited use; because they are based on Gaussian densities which are unimodal, they cannot represent simultaneous alternative hypotheses. Extensions to the Kalman filter to handle multiple data associations work satisfactorily in the simple case of point targets, but do not extend naturally to continuous curves. A new, stochastic algorithm is proposed here, the Condensation algorithm \u2014 Conditional Density Propagation over time. It uses \u2018factored sampling\u2019, a method previously applied to interpretation of static images, in which the distribution of possible interpretations is represented by a randomly generated set of representatives. The Condensation algorithm combines factored sampling with learned dynamical models to propagate an entire probability distribution for object position and shape, over time. The result is highly robust tracking of agile motion in clutter, markedly superior to what has previously been attainable from Kalman filtering. Notwithstanding the use of stochastic methods, the algorithm runs in near real-time."

Models can be hand-built, but it is far more effective and less time-consuming to learn them from a training set. Techniques to do this exist both for shape, and for shape and motion jointly. This paper extends the range of shape and motion models in two significant ways. The first is to model jointly the random variations in shape arising within an object-class and those occuring during object motion. The resulting algorithm is applied to tracking of plants captured by a video camera mounted on an agricultural robot. The second addresses the tracking of coupled objects such as head and lips. In both cases, new algorithms are shown to make important contributions to tracking performance."

Taking a Bayesian approach, a posterior measure is defined on the tracking/target parameter space by combining a narrowband sensor array manifold model with a high resolution imaging model, and a prior based on airplane dynamics. The Newtonian force equations governing rigid body dynamics are utilized to form the prior density on airplane motion. The conditional mean estimates are generated using a random sampling algorithm based on jump-diffusion processes for empirically generating MMSE estimates of functions of these random target positions, orientations, and type under the posterior measure. Results are presented on target tracking and identification from an implementation of the algorithm on a networked Silicon Graphics workstation and DECmpp/MasPar parallel machine."

This system provides for the integrated treatment of matching and measurement errors that arise during motion tracking. These two sources of error have very different distributions and are best handled by separate computational mechanisms. These errors can be treated in an integrated way by using the computation of variance in predicted feature measurements to determine the probability of correctness for each potential matching feature. In return, a best-first search procedure uses these probabilities to find consistent sets of matches, which eliminates the need to treat outliers during the analysis of measurement errors. The most reliable initial matches are used to reduce the parameter variance on further iterations, minimizing the amount of search required for matching more ambiguous features. These methods allow for much larger frame-to-frame motions than most previous approaches. The resulting system can robustly track models with many degrees of freedom while running on relatively inexpensive hardware. These same techniques can be used to speed verification during model-based recognition."

The method uses the predicted position of known features on the object to find the features in images from one or more cameras, measures the position of the features in the images, and uses these measurements to update the estimates of position, orientation, linear velocity, and angular velocity of the object model. The features usually used are brightness edges that correspond to markings or the edges of solid objects, although point features can be used. The solution for object position and orientation is a weighted least-squares adjustment that includes filtering over time, which reduces the effects of errors, allows extrapolation over times of missing data, and allows the use of stereo information from multiple-camera images that are not coincident in time. The filtering action is derived so as to be optimum if the acceleration is random. (Alternatively, random torque can be assumed for rotation.) The filter is equivalent to a Kalman filter, but for efficiency it is formulated differently in order to take advantage of the dimensionality of the observations and the state vector which occur in this problem. The method can track accurately with arbitrarily large angular velocities, as long as the angular acceleration (or torque) is small. Results are presented showing the successful tracking of partially obscured objects with clutter."

This article combines themes from tracking theory\u2014elastic models and stochastic filtering\u2014with the notion of affine invariance to synthesize a substantially new and demonstrably effective framework for contour tracking.A mechanism is developed for incorporating a shape template into a contour tracker via an affine invariant coupling. In that way the tracker becomes selective for shape and therefore able to ignore background clutter. Affine invariance ensures that the effect of varying viewpoint is accommodated. Use of a standard statistical filtering framework allows uncertainties to be treated systematically, which accommodates object flexibility and un-modeled distortions such as the deformation of a silhouette under motion.The statistical framework also facilitates a further development. In place of heuristically determined spatial scale for feature search, both spatial scale and temporal memory are controlled automatically and in a way that is responsive to the tracking process. Typically, the tracker operates initially in a coarse scale/short memory mode while it searches for a feature. Then spatial scale diminishes to allow more precise localization while memory (temporal scale) lengths to take advantage of motion coherence. All system parameters are determined by natural assumptions and desired tracking performance, leaving none to be fixed heuristically.Versions of the tracker have been implemented at video rate, both on SUN 4 and in parallel, using a network of 11 transputers. The theoretically established properties of automatic control of spatiotemporal scale and of affine invariance are demonstrated using the implemented tracker."

The required density of the state vector is represented as a set of random samples, which are updated and propagated by the algorithm. The method is not restricted by assumptions of linear- ity or Gaussian noise: it may be applied to any state transition or measurement model. A simula- tion example of the bearings only tracking problem is presented. This simulation includes schemes for improving the efficiency of the basic algorithm. For this example, the performance of the bootstrap filter is greatly superior to the standard extended Kalman filter."

A method is described for generating a similar flexible shape model automatically from real image data. A cubic B-spline is used as the shape vector for training the model. Large training sets are used to generate a robust model of the human profile for use in the labelling and tracking of pedestrians in real-world scenes.

During the last 5-6 years active contour models have become popular for finding the contours of such objects. Connected to these models are iterative algorithms for finding the minimizing energy curves making the curves behave dynamically through the iterations. These approaches do however have several disadvantages. The numerical algorithms that are in use constrain the models that can be used. Furthermore, in many cases only local minima can be achieved. In this paper, the author discusses a method for curve detection based on a fully Bayesian approach. A model for image contours which allows the number of nodes on the contours to vary is introduced. Iterative algorithms based on stochastic sampling is constructed, which make it possible to simulate samples from the posterior distribution, making estimates and uncertainty measures of specific quantities available. Further, simulated annealing schemes making the curve move dynamically towards the global minimum energy configuration are presented. In theory, no restrictions on the models are made. In practice, however, computational aspects must be taken into consideration when choosing the models. Much more general models than the one used for active contours may however be applied. The approach is applied to ultrasound images of the left ventricle and to magnetic resonance images of the human brain, and show promising results. >"

Many applications of depth-from-motion, including navigation and manipulation, require algorithms that can estimate depth in an on-line, incremental fashion. This requires a representation that records the uncertainty in depth estimates and a mechanism that integrates new measurements with existing depth estimates to reduce the uncertainty over time. Kalman filtering provides this mechanism. Previous applications of Kalman filtering to depth-from-motion have been limited to estimating depth at the location of a sparse set of features. In this paper, we introduce a new, pixel-based (iconic) algorithm that estimates depth and depth uncertainty at each pixel and incrementally refines these estimates over time. We describe the algorithm and contrast its formulation and performance to that of a feature-based Kalman filtering algorithm. We compare the performance of the two approaches by analyzing their theoretical convergence rates, by conducting quantitative experiments with images of a flat poster, and by conducting qualitative experiments with images of a realistic outdoor-scene model. The results show that the new method is an effective way to extract depth from lateral camera translations. This approach can be extended to incorporate general motion and to integrate other sources of information, such as stereo. The algorithms we have developed, which combine Kalman filtering with iconic descriptions of depth, therefore can serve as a useful and general framework for low-level dynamic vision."

The method operates by extracting two-dimensional models of an object from a sequence of images. The basic idea underlying the technique is to decompose the image of a solid object moving in space into two components: a two-dimensional motion and a two-dimensional shape change. The motion component is factored out and the shape change is represented explicitly by a sequence of two-dimensional models, one corresponding to each image frame. The major assumption underlying the method is that the two-dimensional shape of an object will change slowly from one frame to the next. There is no assumption, however, that the two-dimensional image motion between successive frames will be small.<<ETX>>"

The author extends current methods of parameter solving to handle objects with arbitrary curved surfaces and with any number of internal parameters representing articulation, variable dimensions, or surface deformations. Numerical stabilization methods are developed that take account of inherent inaccuracies in the image measurements and allow useful solutions to be determined even when there are fewer matches than unknown parameters. The Levenberg-Marquardt method is used to always ensure convergence of the solution. These techniques allow model-based vision to be used for a much wider class of problems than was possible with previous methods. Their application is demonstrated for tracking the motion of curved, parameterized objects. >"

The so-called structure-from-motion problem is to infer the structure of these spatial configurations from the sequence of projections. For rigid transformations, a unique metrical reconstruction is known to be possible from three orthographic views of four points. However, human observers seem able to obtain much shape information from a mere pair of views, as is evident in the case of binocular stereo. Moreover, human observers seem to find little use for the information provided by additional views, even though some improvement certainly occurs. The rigidity requirement in its strict form is also relaxed. We indicate how solutions of the structure-from-motion problem can be stratified in such a way that one explicitly knows at which stages various a priori assumptions enter and specific geometrical expertise is required. An affine stage is identified at which only smooth deformation is assumed (thus no rigidity constraint is involved) and no metrical concepts are required. This stage allows one to find the spatial configuration (modulo an affinity) from two views. The addition of metrical methods allows one to find shape from two views, modulo a relief transformation (depth scaling and shear). The addition of a third view then merely serves to settle the calibration. Results of a numerical experiment are discussed."

In this paper, we extend this work by using a physically based framework to learn physically plausible, constrained dynamic models of deforming objects. Traditional physically based vibration modes have been shown to provide a useful mechanism for describing non-rigid motions of articulated and deformable objects. The standard approach relies on assumptions being made about the elastic properties of an object to generate a compact set of real, orthogonal shape parameters which can then be used for tracking and data approximation. We present a method for automatically generating an improved physically based model using a training set of examples of the object deforming, tuning the elastic properties of the object to reflect how the object actually deforms. The resulting model provides a low dimensional shape description that allows accurate temporal extrapolation at low computational cost based on the training motions. Results are shown in which the method is applied to an automatically acquired training set of the outline of a walking pedestrian."

Knowledge is represented in the computer as explicit three-dimensional geometrical models, dynamic filters, and descriptions of behaviour. Model-based vision, based on reasoning with analogue models, avoids many of the classical problems in visual perception: recognition is robust against changes in the image of shape, size, colour and illumination. The three-dimensional understanding of the scene which results also deals naturally with occlusion, and allows the behaviour of vehicles to be interpreted. The experiments with machine vision raise questions about the part played by perceptual context for object recognition in natural vision, and the neural mechanisms which might serve such a role."

In response to a RANSAC requirement, new results are derived on the minimum number of landmarks needed to obtain a solution, and algorithms are presented for computing these minimum-landmark solutions in closed form. These results provide the basis for an automatic system that can solve the LDP under difficult viewing"

This paper extends current methods of parameter solving to handle objects with arbitrary curved surfaces and with any number of internal parameters representing articulations, variable dimensions, or surface deformations. Numerical stabilization methods are developed that take account of inherent inaccuracies in the image measurements and allow useful solutions to be determined even when there are fewer matches than unknown parameters. A standardized modeling language has been developed that can be used to define models and their internal parameters for efficient application to model-based vision. These new techniques allow model- based vision to be used for a much wider class of problems than was possible with earlier methods."

Pixel gray levels and the presence and orientation of edges are viewed as states of atoms or molecules in a lattice-like physical system. The assignment of an energy function in the physical system determines its Gibbs distribution. Because of the Gibbs distribution, Markov random field (MRF) equivalence, this assignment also determines an MRF image model. The energy function is a more convenient and natural mechanism for embodying picture attributes than are the local characteristics of the MRF. For a range of degradation mechanisms, including blurring, nonlinear deformations, and multiplicative or additive noise, the posterior distribution is an MRF with a structure akin to the image model. By the analogy, the posterior distribution defines another (imaginary) physical system. Gradual temperature reduction in the physical system isolates low energy states (``annealing''), or what is the same thing, the most probable states under the Gibbs distribution. The analogous operation under the posterior distribution yields the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the image given the degraded observations. The result is a highly parallel ``relaxation'' algorithm for MAP estimation. We establish convergence properties of the algorithm and we experiment with some simple pictures, for which good restorations are obtained at low signal-to-noise ratios."

Snakes provide a unified account of a number of visual problems, including detection of edges, lines, and subjective contours; motion tracking; and stereo matching.

The limits of applicability of the algorithms are also traced by making the optical degradations more and more severe until the algorithms no longer succeed in their task.

Previous systems have been available to do this for specially illuminated objects or for naturally illuminated but polyhedral objects. Other systems have been able to track nonpolyhedral objects in motion, in some cases from live video, but following only centroids or key-points rather than tracking whole curves. The system described here can track accurately the curved silhouettes of moving non-polyhedral objects at frame-rate, for example hands, lips, legs, vehicles, fruit, and without any special hardware beyond a desktop workstation and a video-camera and framestore. The new algorithms are a synthesis of methods in deformable models, B-splines curve representation and control theory. This paper shows how such a facility can be used to turn parts of the body\u2014for instance, hands and lips\u2014into input devices. Rigid motion of a hand can be used as a 3D mouse with non-rigid gestures signalling a button press or the \u201clifting\u201d of the mouse. Both rigid and non-rigid motions of lips can be tracked independently and used as inputs, for example to animate a computer-generated face."

It is shown that for objects with sharp edges as well as with smooth bounding contours, the set of possible images of a given object is embedded in a linear space spanned by a small number of views. For objects with sharp edges, the linear combination representation is exact. For objects with smooth boundaries, it is an approximation that often holds over a wide range of viewing angles. Rigid transformations (with or without scaling) can be distinguished from more general linear transformations of the object by testing certain constraints placed on the coefficients of the linear combinations.

                "text": "Visual object recognition requires the matching of an image with a set of models stored in memory. In this paper we propose an approach to recognition in which a 3-D object is repIesented by the linear combination of 2-D images of the object. If M { ' is the set of pictures representing a given object, and P is the 2-D image of an object to be recognized, then P is considered an instance of M if P E1=1 ai M for some constants ai. We show that this approach handles correctly rigid 3ltransformations of objects with sharp as well as smooth boundaries, and can also handle non-rigid transformations. The paper is divided into two parts. In the first part we show that the variety of views depicting the same object under different transformations can often be expressed as the linear combinations of a small number of views. In the second part we suggest how this linear combination property may be used in the recognition process.

                "text": "One fifth (4 of 20) of the research articles published in the Journal of Educational Statistics in 1988 include simulation studies that justify or illustrate the authors' conclusions. A similar fraction (6 of 33) of the articles in the 1988 volume of Psychometrika include simulations; comparable proportions could be expected in other journals at the boundary of theoretical statistics and social/psychological applications. Due in part to the complexity of the problems tackled today and in part to the availability of cheap, powerful computing\u2014by no means independent influences\u2014simulation and Monte Carlo methods have become both necessary and practical tools for statisticians and applied workers in quantitative areas of education and psychology. Simulation has become popular\u2014not only in the quantitative social sciences, but in all of the mathematical sciences from physics to operations research to number theory\u2014because it is almost always easy to do. This ease of use makes the simulation experimenter vulnerable to two common pitfalls. Selection of the basic source of \"random numbers\" is often passive: Whatever is available in the computer's standard subroutine library is used. However, the fact that a pseudo-random number generator appears in a popular software package or operating system is hardly reason to trust it, as is shown by the infamous RANDU generator, once popular on IBM mainframes and PDP mini-computers, and by the generators burned into RAM on today's PCs. Simulation design and reporting also deserve special care. Some attempt must be made to assess the accuracy of the simulation estimates: One should accurately estimate and report SE (6) as well as 6. In addition, enough detail should be reported that the interested reader can replicate the study and check the results, just as with other experiments. Yet these considerations are also easy to overlook. Brian D. Ripley's Stochastic Simulation is a short, yet ambitious, survey of modern simulation techniques. Three themes run throughout the book. First, one shoud not take basic simulation subroutines for granted, especially on minior microcomputers where they tend to be poor implementations, implementations of poor algorithms, or both. Second, design of experiments, or variance reduction as it is known in this field, deserves greater consideration. Third, modern methods make it possible to simulate and analyze processes that are dependent over time, and using such processes opens the door to new simulation techniques, such as simulated annealing in optimization. Ripley intends this book to be a \"comprehensive guide,\" and it is indeed most accurately described as a researcher's handbook with examples and"
