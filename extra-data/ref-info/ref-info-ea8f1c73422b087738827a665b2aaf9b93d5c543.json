The algorithm works by beginning in a very naive state of knowledge about phrase structure. By repeatedly comparing the results of bracketing in the current state to proper bracketing provided in the training corpus, the system learns a set of simple structural transformations that can be applied to reduce error. After describing the algorithm, we present results and compare these results to other recent results in automatic grammar induction."

                "text": "A CORPUS-BASED APPROACH TO LANGUAGE LEARNING Eric Brill Supervisor: Mitchell Marcus One goal of computational linguistics is to discover a method for assigning a rich structural annotation to sentences that are presented as simple linear strings of words; meaning can be much more readily extracted from a structurally annotated sentence than from a sentence with no structural information. Also, structure allows for a more in-depth check of the well-formedness of a sentence. There are two phases to assigning these structural annotations: rst, a knowledge base is created and second, an algorithm is used to generate a structural annotation for a sentence based upon the facts provided in the knowledge base. Until recently, most knowledge bases were created manually by language experts. These knowledge bases are expensive to create and have not been used e ectively in structurally parsing sentences from other than highly restricted domains. The goal of this dissertation is to make signi cant progress toward designing automata that are able to learn some structural aspects of human language with little human guidance. In particular, we describe a learning algorithm that takes a small structurally annotated corpus of text and a larger unannotated corpus as input, and automatically learns how to assign accurate structural descriptions to sentences not in the training corpus. The main tool we use to automatically discover structural information about language from corpora is transformation-based error-driven learning. The distribution of errors produced by an imperfect annotator is examined to learn an ordered list of transformations that can be applied to provide an accurate structural annotation. We demonstrate the application of this learning algorithm iv to part of speech tagging and parsing. Successfully applying this technique to create systems that learn could lead to robust, trainable and accurate natural language processing systems. v"

                "text": "Selectional constraints are limitations on the applicability of predicates to arguments. For example, the statement \"The number two is blue\" may be syntactically well formed, but at some level it is anomalous-- scBLUE is not a predicate that can be applied to numbers. \nIn this dissertation, I propose a new, information-theoretic account of selectional constraints. Unlike previous approaches, this proposal requires neither the identification of primitive semantic features nor the formalization of complex inferences based on world knowledge. The proposed model assumes instead that lexical items are organized in a conceptual taxonomy according to class membership, where classes are defined simply as sets--that is, extensionally, rather than in terms of explicit features or properties. Selection is formalized in terms of a probabilistic relationship between predicates and concepts: the selectional behavior of a predicate is modeled as its distributional effect on the conceptual classes of its arguments, expressed using the information-theoretic measure of relative entropy. The use of relative entropy leads to an illuminating interpretation of what selectional constraints are: the strength of a predicate's selection for an argument is identified with the quantity of information it carries about that argument. \nIn addition to arguing that the model is empirically adequate, I explore its application to two problems. The first concerns a linguistic question: why some transitive verbs permit implicit direct objects (\"John ate $\\emptyset$\") and others do not (\"*John brought $\\emptyset$\"). It has often been observed informally that the omission of objects is connected to the ease with which the object can be inferred. I have made this observation more formal by positing a relationship between inferability and selectional constraints, and have confirmed the connection between selectional constraints and implicit objects in a set of computational experiments. \nSecond, I have explored the practical applications of the model in resolving syntactic ambiguity. A number of authors have recently begun investigating the use of corpus-based lexical statistics in automatic parsing; the results of computational experiments using the present model suggest that often lexical relationships are better viewed in terms of underlying conceptual relationships such as selectional preference and concept similarity. Thus the information-theoretic measures proposed here can serve not only as components in a theory of selectional constraints, but also as tools for practical natural language processing."

While these taggers obtain high accuracy, linguistic information is captured indirectly, typically in tens of thousands of lexical and contextual probabilities. In (Brill 1992), a trainable rule-based tagger was described that obtained performance comparable to that of stochastic taggers, but captured relevant linguistic information in a small number of simple non-stochastic rules. In this paper, we describe a number of extensions to this rule-based tagger. First, we describe a method for expressing lexical relations in tagging that stochastic taggers are currently unable to express. Next, we show a rule-based approach to tagging unknown words. Finally, we show how the tagger-can be extended into a k-best tagger, where multiple tags can be assigned to words in some cases of uncertainty."

The method learns a series of symbolic transformational rules, which can then be applied in sequence to a test corpus to produce predictions. The learning process only requires counting matches for a given set of rule templates, allowing the method to survey a very large space of possible contextual factors. This paper analyses Brill's approach as an interesting variation on existing decision tree methods, based on experiments involving part-of-speech tagging for both English and ancient Greek corpora. In particular, the analysis throws light on why the new mechanism seems surprisingly resistant to overtraining. A fast, incremental implementation and a mechanism for recording the dependencies that underlie the resulting rule sequence are also described."

In this paper, we present a simple rule-based part of speech tagger which automatically acquires its rules and tags with accuracy comparable to stochastic taggers. The rule-based tagger has many advantages over these taggers, including: a vast reduction in stored information required, the perspicuity of a small set of meaningful rules, ease of finding and implementing improvements to the tagger, and better portability from one tag set, corpus genre or language to another. Perhaps the biggest contribution of this work is in demonstrating that the stochastic method is not the only viable method for part of speech tagging. The fact that a simple rule-based tagger that automatically learns its rules can perform so well should offer encouragement for researchers to further explore rule-based tagging, searching for a better and more expressive set of rule templates and other variations on the simple but effective theme described below."

In this paper, we present a simple rule-based part of speech tagger which automatically acquires its rules and tags with accuracy comparable to stochastic taggers. The rule-based tagger has many advantages over these taggers, including: a vast reduction in stored information required, the perspicuity of a small set of meaningful rules, ease of finding and implementing improvements to the tagger, and better portability from one tag set, corpus genre or language to another. Perhaps the biggest contribution of this work is in demonstrating that the stochastic method is not the only viable method for part of speech tagging. The fact that a simple rule-based tagger that automatically learns its rules can perform so well should offer encouragement for researchers to further explore rule-based tagging, searching for a better and more expressive set of rule templates and other variations on the simple but effective theme described below."
