Despite the widespread use of pre-training models for NLP applications, they almost exclusively focus on text-level manipulation, while neglecting layout and style information that is vital for document image understanding. In this paper, we propose the LayoutLM to jointly model interactions between text and layout information across scanned document images, which is beneficial for a great number of real-world document image understanding tasks such as information extraction from scanned documents. Furthermore, we also leverage image features to incorporate words' visual information into LayoutLM. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that text and layout are jointly learned in a single framework for document-level pre-training. It achieves new state-of-the-art results in several downstream tasks, including form understanding (from 70.72 to 79.27), receipt understanding (from 94.02 to 95.24) and document image classification (from 93.07 to 94.42). The code and pre-trained LayoutLM models are publicly available at https://aka.ms/layoutlm."

However, Key Information Extraction (KIE) from documents as the downstream task of OCR, having a large number of use scenarios in real-world, remains a challenge because documents not only have textual features extracting from OCR systems but also have semantic visual features that are not fully exploited and play a critical role in KIE. Too little work has been devoted to efficiently make full use of both textual and visual features of the documents. In this paper, we introduce PICK, a framework that is effective and robust in handling complex documents layout for KIE by combining graph learning with graph convolution operation, yielding a richer semantic representation containing the textual and visual features and global layout without ambiguity. Extensive experiments on realworld datasets have been conducted to show that our method outperforms baselines methods by significant margins. Our code is available at https://github.com/wenwenyu/PICK-pytorch."

With the help of OCR technology, the description text can be detected and recognized as auxiliary information to remove the visually impaired users\u2019 comprehension barriers. However, for lack of proper logical structure among these OCR text blocks, it is challenging to comprehend the detailed images accurately. To tackle the above problems, we propose a novel end-to-end OCR text reorganizing model. Specifically, we create a Graph Neural Network with an attention map to encode the text blocks with visual layout features, with which an attention-based sequence decoder inspired by the Pointer Network and a Sinkhorn global optimization will reorder the OCR text into a proper sequence. Experimental results illustrate that our model outperforms the other baselines, and the real experiment of the blind users\u2019 experience shows that our model improves their comprehension."

Inspired by the linearization exploration work of Elman [8], we extend BERT to a new model, StructBERT, by incorporating language structures into pre-training. Specifically, we pre-train StructBERT with two auxiliary tasks to make the most of the sequential order of words and sentences, which leverage language structures at the word and sentence levels, respectively. As a result, the new model is adapted to different levels of language understanding required by downstream tasks. The StructBERT with structural pre-training gives surprisingly good empirical results on a variety of downstream tasks, including pushing the state-of-the-art on the GLUE benchmark to 89.0 (outperforming all published models), the F1 score on SQuAD v1.1 question answering to 93.0, the accuracy on SNLI to 91.7."

In VRDs, visual and layout information is critical for document understanding, and texts in such documents cannot be serialized into the one-dimensional sequence without losing information. Classic information extraction models such as BiLSTM-CRF typically operate on text sequences and do not incorporate visual features. In this paper, we introduce a graph convolution based model to combine textual and visual information presented in VRDs. Graph embeddings are trained to summarize the context of a text segment in the document, and further combined with text embeddings for entity extraction. Extensive experiments have been conducted to show that our method outperforms BiLSTM-CRF baselines by significant margins, on two real-world datasets. Additionally, ablation studies are also performed to evaluate the effectiveness of each component of our model."

These approaches corrupt the input by replacing some tokens with [MASK] and then train a model to reconstruct the original tokens. As an alternative, we propose a more sample-efficient pre-training task called replaced token detection. Instead of masking the input, our approach corrupts it by replacing some input tokens with plausible alternatives sampled from a small generator network. Then, instead of training a model that predicts the original identities of the corrupted tokens, we train a discriminative model that predicts whether each token in the corrupted input was replaced by a generator sample or not. Thorough experiments demonstrate this new pre-training task is more efficient than MLM because the model learns from all input tokens rather than just the small subset that was masked out. As a result, the contextual representations learned by our approach substantially outperform the ones learned by methods such as BERT and XLNet given the same model size, data, and compute. The gains are particularly strong for small models; for example, we train a model on one GPU for 4 days that outperforms GPT (trained using 30x more compute) on the GLUE natural language understanding benchmark. Our approach also works well at scale, where we match the performance of RoBERTa, the current state-of-the-art pre-trained transformer, while using less than 1/4 of the compute."

The dataset comprises 199 real, fully annotated, scanned forms. The documents are noisy and vary widely in appearance, making form understanding (FoUn) a challenging task. The proposed dataset can be used for various tasks, including text detection, optical character recognition, spatial layout analysis, and entity labeling/linking. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first publicly available dataset with comprehensive annotations to address FoUn task. We also present a set of baselines and introduce metrics to evaluate performance on the FUNSD dataset, which can be downloaded at https://guillaumejaume.github.io/FUNSD."

                "text": "Information Extraction (IE) for document images is often approached as a BIO tagging problem, where the model sequentially goes through and classifies each recognized input token into one of the information categories. However, such problem setup has two inherent limitations that (1) it can only extract a flat list of information and (2) it assumes that the input data is serialized, often by a simple rule-based script. Nevertheless, real-world documents often contain hierarchical information in the form of two-dimensional language data in which the serialization can be highly non-trivial. To tackle these issues, we propose SPADE$\\spadesuit$ (SPatial DEpendency parser), an end-to-end spatial dependency parser that is serializer-free and capable of modeling an arbitrary number of information layers, making it suitable for parsing structure-rich documents such as receipts and multimodal documents such as name cards. We show that SPADE$\\spadesuit$ outperforms the previous BIO tagging-based approach on name card parsing task and achieves comparable performance on receipt parsing task. Especially, when the receipt images have non-flat manifold representing physical distortion of receipt paper in real-world, SPADE$\\spadesuit$ outperforms the tagging-based method by a large margin of 25.8% highlighting the strong performance of SPADE$\\spadesuit$ over spatially complex document."

Unlike recent language representation models (Peters et al., 2018a; Radford et al., 2018), BERT is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial task-specific architecture modifications. BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing tasks, including pushing the GLUE score to 80.5 (7.7 point absolute improvement), MultiNLI accuracy to 86.7% (4.6% absolute improvement), SQuAD v1.1 question answering Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute improvement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1 (5.1 point absolute improvement)."

                "text": "This paper presents a novel end-to-end system for table understanding in document images called DeepDeSRT. In particular, the contribution of DeepDeSRT is two-fold. First, it presents a deep learning-based solution for table detection in document images. Secondly, it proposes a novel deep learning-based approach for table structure recognition, i.e. identifying rows, columns, and cell positions in the detected tables. In contrast to existing rule-based methods, which rely on heuristics or additional PDF metadata (like, for example, print instructions, character bounding boxes, or line segments), the presented system is data-driven and does not need any heuristics or metadata to detect as well as to recognize tabular structures in document images. Furthermore, in contrast to most existing table detection and structure recognition methods, which are applicable only to PDFs, DeepDeSRT processes document images, which makes it equally suitable for born-digital PDFs (as they can automatically be converted into images) as well as even harder problems, e.g. scanned documents. To gauge the performance of DeepDeSRT, the system is evaluated on the publicly available ICDAR 2013 table competition dataset containing 67 documents with 238 pages overall. Evaluation results reveal that DeepDeSRT outperforms state-of-the-art methods for table detection and structure recognition and achieves F1-measures of 96.77% and 91.44% for table detection and structure recognition, respectively. Additionally, DeepDeSRT is evaluated on a closed dataset from a real use case of a major European aviation company comprising documents which are highly unlike those in ICDAR 2013. Tested on a randomly selected sample from this dataset, DeepDeSRT achieves high detection accuracy for tables which demonstrates the sound generalization capabilities of our system."

In object and scene analysis, deep neural nets are capable of learning a hierarchical chain of abstraction from pixel inputs to concise and descriptive representations. The current work explores this capacity in the realm of document analysis, and confirms that this representation strategy is superior to a variety of popular handcrafted alternatives. Extensive experiments show that (i) features extracted from CNNs are robust to compression, (ii) CNNs trained on non-document images transfer well to document analysis tasks, and (iii) enforcing region-specific feature-learning is unnecessary given sufficient training data. This work also makes available a new labelled subset of the IIT-CDIP collection, containing 400,000 document images across 16 categories."

The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data."

However, relying on corrupting the input with masks, BERT neglects dependency between the masked positions and suffers from a pretrain-finetune discrepancy. In light of these pros and cons, we propose XLNet, a generalized autoregressive pretraining method that (1) enables learning bidirectional contexts by maximizing the expected likelihood over all permutations of the factorization order and (2) overcomes the limitations of BERT thanks to its autoregressive formulation. Furthermore, XLNet integrates ideas from Transformer-XL, the state-of-the-art autoregressive model, into pretraining. Empirically, under comparable experiment settings, XLNet outperforms BERT on 20 tasks, often by a large margin, including question answering, natural language inference, sentiment analysis, and document ranking."

Non-local and non-sequential context is, however, a valuable source of information to improve predictions. In this paper, we introduce GraphIE, a framework that operates over a graph representing a broad set of dependencies between textual units (i.e. words or sentences). The algorithm propagates information between connected nodes through graph convolutions, generating a richer representation that can be exploited to improve word-level predictions. Evaluation on three different tasks \u2014 namely textual, social media and visual information extraction \u2014 shows that GraphIE consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art sequence tagging model by a significant margin."

Advances in document intelligence are driving the need for a unified technology that integrates OCR with various NLP tasks, especially semantic parsing. Since OCR and semantic parsing have been studied as separate tasks so far, the datasets for each task on their own are rich, while those for the integrated post-OCR parsing tasks are relatively insufficient. In this study, we publish a consolidated dataset for receipt parsing as the first step towards post-OCR parsing tasks. The dataset consists of thousands of Indonesian receipts, which contains images and box/text annotations for OCR, and multi-level semantic labels for parsing. The proposed dataset can be used to address various OCR and parsing tasks."

Currently, there are lots of studies on this task for different file formats such as ASCII text and HTML. It also attracts lots of attention to recognize the table structures in PDF files. However, it is hard for the existing methods to accurately recognize the structure of complicated tables in PDF files. The complicated tables contain spanning cells which occupy at least two columns or rows. To address the issue, we propose a novel graph neural network for recognizing the table structure in PDF files, named GraphTSR. Specifically, it takes table cells as input, and then recognizes the table structures by predicting relations among cells. Moreover, to evaluate the task better, we construct a large-scale table structure recognition dataset from scientific papers, named SciTSR, which contains 15,000 tables from PDF files and their corresponding structure labels. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed model is highly effective for complicated tables and outperforms state-of-the-art baselines over a benchmark dataset and our new constructed dataset."

The paper discusses a new system for table structure recognition in untagged PDF documents. It is formulated as a set of configurable parameters and ad-hoc heuristics for recovering table cells. We consider two different configurations for the system and demonstrate experimental results based on the existing competition dataset for both of them."

The SROIE tasks play a key role in many document analysis systems and hold significant commercial potential. Although a lot of work has been published over the years on administrative document analysis, the community has advanced relatively slowly, as most datasets have been kept private. One of the key contributions of SROIE to the document analysis community is to offer a first, standardized dataset of 1000 whole scanned receipt images and annotations, as well as an evaluation procedure for such tasks. The Challenge is structured around three tasks, namely Scanned Receipt Text Localization (Task 1), Scanned Receipt OCR (Task 2) and Key Information Extraction from Scanned Receipts (Task 3). The competition opened on 10th February, 2019 and closed on 5th May, 2019. We received 29, 24 and 18 valid submissions received for the three competition tasks, respectively. This report presents the competition datasets, define the tasks and the evaluation protocols, offer detailed submission statistics, as well as an analysis of the submitted performance. While the tasks of text localization and recognition seem to be relatively easy to tackle, it is interesting to observe the variety of ideas and approaches proposed for the information extraction task. According to the submissions' performance we believe there is still margin for improving information extraction performance, although the current dataset would have to grow substantially in following editions. Given the success of the SROIE competition evidenced by the wide interest generated and the healthy number of submissions from academic, research institutes and industry over different countries, we consider that the SROIE competition can evolve into a useful resource for the community, drawing further attention and promoting research and development efforts in this field."

But current systems for automated document processing still require a lot of configuration work that can only be done by experienced users or administrators. We present an approach for information extraction which purely builds on end-user provided training examples and intentionally omits efficient known extraction techniques like rule based extraction that require intense training and/or information extraction expertise. Our evaluation on a large corpus of business documents shows competitive results of above 85% F1-measure on 10 commonly used fields like document type, sender, receiver and date. The system is deployed and used inside the commercial document management system DocuWare."

Our shallow parsing approach enables building robust neural parser with less than a thousand labeled data. POT is validated on receipt and namecard parsing tasks."

While common implementations of these algorithms employ L$_2$ regularization (often calling it \"weight decay\" in what may be misleading due to the inequivalence we expose), we propose a simple modification to recover the original formulation of weight decay regularization by \\emph{decoupling} the weight decay from the optimization steps taken w.r.t. the loss function. We provide empirical evidence that our proposed modification (i) decouples the optimal choice of weight decay factor from the setting of the learning rate for both standard SGD and Adam and (ii) substantially improves Adam's generalization performance, allowing it to compete with SGD with momentum on image classification datasets (on which it was previously typically outperformed by the latter). Our proposed decoupled weight decay has already been adopted by many researchers, and the community has implemented it in TensorFlow and PyTorch; the complete source code for our experiments is available at this https URL"
