After embedding a time series in a state space using delay coordinates, we ''learn'' the induced nonlinear mapping using local approximation.

We present an error estimate for this technique, and demonstrate its effectiveness by applying it to several examples, including data from the Mackey-Glass delay differential equation, Rayleigh-Benard convection, and Taylor-Couette flow."

Each desires to obtain models of the physical world from limited information. We describe a method to reconstruct the deterministic portion of the equations of motion directly from a data series. These equations of motion represent a vast reduction of a chaotic data set\u2019s observed complexity to a compact, algorithmic specification. This approach employs an informational measure of model optimality to guide searching through the space of dynamical systems. As corollary results, we indicate how to estimate the minimum embedding dimension, extrinsic noise level, metric entropy, and Lyapunov spectrum. Numerical and experimental applications demonstrate the method\u2019s feasibility and limitations. Extensions to estimating parametrized families of dynamical systems from bifurcation data and to spatial pattern evolution are presented. Applications to predicting chaotic data and the design of forecasting, learning, and control systems, are discussed."

We illustrate the method by selecting two common topics in signal processing, prediction and system modelling, and show that nonlinear applications can be handled extremely well by using neural networks. The formalism is a natural, nonlinear extension of the linear Least Mean Squares algorithm commonly used in adaptive signal processing. Simulations are presented that document the additional performance achieved by using nonlinear neural networks. First, we demonstrate that the formalism may be used to predict points in a highly chaotic time series with orders of magnitude increase in accuracy over conventional methods including the Linear Predictive Method and the Gabor-Volterra-Weiner Polynomial Method. Deterministic chaos is thought to be involved in many physical situations including the onset of turbulence in fluids, chemical reactions and plasma physics. Secondly, we demonstrate the use of the formalism in nonlinear system modelling by providing a graphic example in which it is clear that the neural network has accurately modelled the nonlinear transfer function. It is interesting to note that the formalism provides explicit, analytic, global, approximations to the nonlinear maps underlying the various time series. Furthermore, the neural net more\u00a0\u00bb seems to be extremely parsimonious in its requirements for data points from the time series. We show that the neural net is able to perform well because it globally approximates the relevant maps by performing a kind of generalized mode decomposition of the maps. 24 refs., 13 figs. \u00ab\u00a0less"

While a good understanding of the onset of chaos has been achieved, using as a mathematical tool the geometric theory of differentiable dynamical systems, moderately excited chaotic systems require new tools, which are provided by the ergodic theory of dynamical systems. This theory has reached a stage where fruitful contact and exchange with physical experiments has become widespread. The present review is an account of the main mathematical ideas and their concrete implementation in analyzing experiments. The main subjects are the theory of dimensions (number of excited degrees of freedom), entropy (production of information), and characteristic exponents (describing sensitivity to initial conditions). The relations between these quantities, as well as their experimental determination, are discussed. The systematic investigation of these quantities provides us for the first time with a reasonable understanding of dynamical systems, excited well beyond the quasiperiodic regimes. This is another step towards understanding highly turbulent fluids."

It focuses on practical techniques throughout, rather than a rigorous mathematical treatment of the subject. It explores the building of stochastic (statistical) models for time series and their use in important areas of application \u0097forecasting, model specification, estimation, and checking, transfer function modeling of dynamic relationships, modeling the effects of intervention events, and process control. Features sections on: recently developed methods for model specification, such as canonical correlation analysis and the use of model selection criteria; results on testing for unit root nonstationarity in ARIMA processes; the state space representation of ARMA models and its use for likelihood estimation and forecasting; score test for model checking; and deterministic components and structural components in time series models and their estimation based on regression-time series model methods."

This holds both for the worldwide climate of the past 1\u20132 Myr (averaged over periods of \u223c5,000 yr) and for a local climate of the past \u223c7,000 yr with yearly averages.

These fractals are often attractors for i. f. ss and occur as the supports of probability measures associated with functional equations. The existence of certain \u2018p-balanced\u2019 measures for i. f. ss is established, and these measures are uniquely characterized for hyperbolic i. f. ss. The Hausdorff\u2014Besicovitch dimension for some attractors of hyperbolic i. f. ss is estimated with the aid of p-balanced measures. What appears to be the broadest framework for the exactly computable moment theory of p-balanced measures \u2014 that of linear i. f. ss and of probabilistic mixtures of iterated Riemann surfaces \u2014 is presented. This extensively generalizes earlier work on orthogonal polynomials on Julia sets. An example is given of fractal reconstruction with the use of linear i. f. ss and moment theory."

                "text": "A machine is described consisting of a universal non-linear filter, which is a highly adaptable analogue computer, together with a training device. The analogue machine has 18 input quantities from which it can compute in about 2 millisec 94 terms of a polynomial, each term containing products and powers of the input quantities, with adjustable coefficients, and can form their sum. The input quantities may be, for instance, 18 past samples of the values of a stochastic variable which is fed into the machine, and the result of the computation is an output function which contains 94 free variables. The training device optimizes the output by successive adjustment of the variable coefficients, until it has approached a target function as closely as can be achieved with a polynomial of 94 terms, by the criterion of the least mean-square error. This is done by repeatedly feeding into the machine a record of the stochastic process, long enough to be representative, and adjusting the variable coefficients, one at a time after each run, by a strategy which ensures that the error will monotonically decrease from run to run.In order to make the machine an optimum filter it is trained on a record of a noisy process, together with a target record which contains the signal only. It is taught as a predictor by taking as the target function a value of the stochastic process advanced by a certain time interval beyond the last value which goes into the input. It is trained as a simulator, for instance of an unknown mechanism, by feeding it with the input of the mechanism to be simulated at one end and presenting it at the other with its output as target function. The machine will then make itself into a model of the device to be simulated and the non-linear transfer function of the device can be read off from the final setting of the coefficients, as nearly as it can be represented by a 94-term polynomial. The machine is not confined to single-input systems.The machine incorporates 80 analogue multipliers of a novel \u2018piezomagnetic\u2019 type which, in its present form, can perform over 1000 multiplications per second with an error of 0.5% or less.A few examples of the first test applications of the machine are described."

Five years of twice-daily height values of the 200-, 500-, and 850-mb surfaces at a grid of 1003 pointsover the Northern Hemisphere are procured. A weighted root-mean-square height difference is used as ameasure of the difference between two states, or the error. For each pair of states occurring within onemonth of the same time of year, but in different years, the error is computed. There are numerous mediocre analogues but no truly good ones. The smallest errors have an averagedoubling time of about 8 days. Larger errors grow less rapidly. Extrapolation with the aid of a quadratichypothesis indicates that truly small errors would double in about 2.5 days. These rates may be comparedwith a ..."

                "text": "In many applications one encounters the problem of approximating surfaces from data given on a set of scattered points in a two-dimensional domain. The global interpolation methods with Duchon's \u201cthin plate splines\u201d and Hardy's multiquadrics are considered to be of high quality; however, their application is limited, due to computational difficulties, to $ \\sim 150$ data points. In this work we develop some efficient iterative schemes for computing global approximation surfaces interpolating a given smooth data. The suggested iterative procedures can, in principle, handle any number of data points, according to computer capacity. These procedures are extensions of a previous work by Dyn and Levin on iterative methods for computing thin-plate spline interpolants for data given on a square grid. Here the procedures are improved significantly and generalized to the case of data given in a general configuration.The major theme of this work is the development of an iterative scheme for the construction of a smooth surface, presented by global basis functions, which approximates only the smooth components of a set of scattered noisy data. The novelty in the suggested method is in the construction of an iterative procedure for low-pass filtering based on detailed spectral properties of a preconditioned matrix. The general concepts of this approach can also be used in designing iterative computation procedures for many other problems.The interpolation and smoothing procedures are tested, and the theoretical results are verified, by many numerical experiments."
