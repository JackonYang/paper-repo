The model consists of a small set of cooperating independent parallel processes that are capable of helping in the decoding of a spoken utterance either individually or collectively. The processes use the \"hypothesize-and-test\" paradigm. The structure of HEARSAY is illustrated by considering its operation in a particular task situation: voice-chess. The task is to recognize a spoken move in a given board position. Procedures for determination of parameters, segmentation, and phonetic descriptions are outlined. The use of semantic, syntactic, lexical, and phonological sources of knowledge in the generation and verification of hypotheses is described. Preliminary results of recognition of some utterances are given."

In dealing with a human being and a human society, we enjoy the luxury of being irrational, illogical, inconsistent, and incomplete, and yet of coping. In operating a computer, we must meet the rigorous requirements for detailed instructions and absolute precision. If we understood the ability of the human mind to make effective decisions when confronted by complexity, uncertainty, and irrationality then we could use computers a million times more effectively than we do. Recognition of this fact has been a motivation for the spurt of research in the field of neurophysiology. The more we study the information processing aspects of the mind, the more perplexed and impressed we become. It will be a very long time before we understand these processes sufficiently to reproduce them. In any case, the mathematician sees hundreds and thousands of formidable new problems in dozens of blossoming areas, puzzles galore, and challenges to his heart's content. He may never resolve some of these, but he will never be bored. What more can he ask?"
