Office usually consists of a sequence of esses involving a number of tools tributed over several workstations. he interchange of documents between cooperating tools in office systems necessitates a fundamental, common understanding of the structure of documents. For this reason, international standards committees are currently making great efforts to draw up standards that will enable the interchange of documents among open systems. Specifically, the CCITT, or the International Telegraph and Telephone Consultative Committee, the ISO, or the International Organization for Standardization, and the ECMA, or the European Computer Manufacturers Association, have been, or still are, working on the standards shown in the sidebar. The results obtained by ISO and ECMA with regard to the topics of office document architecture, or ODA, and office document interchange formats , or ODIF, are essentially the same in both organizations. In this article, the architectural model , the underlying processing model, and the principles of the interchange formats of the ECMA 101 and ISO drafts are introduced, and possibilities of further development indicated. In its details, the discussion that follows is based on ECMA 101. Document architecture model Document, text, and content. Within the scope of the ODA/ODIF standards , a document is a structured amount of text that can be interchanged as a unit between an originator and a recipient. A document can be interchanged either in image form, to permit its being printed and displayed as intended by the originator, or in processibleform, to permit document editing and layout revision by the recipient. Text is a representation of information for human perception that can be reproduced in two-dimensional form. Text consists of graphic elements such as graphic characters, geometric ele"
