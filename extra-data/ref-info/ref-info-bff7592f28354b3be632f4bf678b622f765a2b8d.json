Therefore we developed a complete benchmarking environment, containing a user front-end to acquire ground truth data as well as mechanisms to evaluate the quality of the recognition results. The tasks involved in the analysis systems were the locating of table regions, identification of cells and mapping of cells to rows and columns. This paper presents our approach towards the comparison of recognition results with the ground truth. The established definitions of recall and precision did not meet our requirements, as we wanted to register even smallest improvements (or changes in general) in the results, even when both results were imperfect. We therefore extended the measures recall and precision in order to deal with recognition probabilities of objects rather than just with Boolean values."

Searching for a set of known table headers (approach 1) works rather well in a significant number of documents. But this approach (though it is implemented tolerant to OCR errors) is not tolerant enough towards some kinds of even minor aberrations. This not only decreases the recognition results, but also, even worse, makes users feel uncomfortable. Pragmatically trying to mimic for what the human eyes might key, leads to our two further, complementary approaches: searching for layout structures which resemble parts of columns (approach 2), and searching for groupings of similar lines (approach 3). The suitability of the approaches for our system requires them to be very simple to implement and simple to explain to users, computationally cheap, and combinable. In the domain of health insurances who receive huge amounts of so called medical liquidations on a daily basis we obtain very good results. On document samples representative for the every day practice of five customers-health insurance companies-tables were spotted as good and as fast as the customers expected the system to be. We thus consider our current approaches as a step towards cognitive adequacy."

While techniques for evaluating the performance of lower-level document analysis tasks such as optical character recognition have gained acceptance in the literature, attempts to formalize the problem for higher-level algorithms, while receiving a fair amount of attention in terms of theory, have generally been less successful in practice, perhaps owing to their complexity. In this paper, we introduce intuitive, easy-to-implement evaluation schemes for the related problems of table detection and table structure recognition. We also present the results of several small experiments, demonstrating how well the methodologies work and the useful sorts of feedback they provide. We first consider the table detection problem. Here algorithms can yield various classes of errors, including non-table regions improperly labeled as tables (insertion errors), tables missed completely (deletion errors), larger tables broken into a number of smaller ones (splitting errors), and groups of smaller tables combined to form larger ones (merging errors). This leads naturally to the use of an edit distance approach for assessing the results of table detection. Next we address the problem of evaluating table structure recognition. Our model is based on a directed acyclic attribute graph, or table DAG. We describe a new paradigm, \u201cgraph probing,\u201d for comparing the results returned by the recognition system and the representation created during ground-truthing. Probing is in fact a general concept that could be applied to other document recognition tasks as well."

T-Recs works on the output of commercial OCR systems that provide the word bounding box geometry together with the text itself (e.g. Xerox ScanWorX). While T-Recs performs well on a number of document categories, business letters still remained a challenging domain because the T-Recs location heuristics are mislead by their header or footer resulting in a low recognition precision. Business letters such as invoices are a very interesting domain for industrial applications due to the large amount of documents to be analyzed and the importance of the data carried within their tables. Hence, we developed a more restrictive approach which is implemented in the T-Recs++ prototype. This paper describes the ideas of the T-Recs++ location and also proposes a quality evaluation measure that reflects the bottom-up strategy of either T-Recs or T-Recs++. Finally, some results comparing both systems on a collection of business letters are given."

This paper describes a general solution for detecting tables based on computing an optimal partitioning of a document into some number of tables. A dynamic programming algorithm is given to solve the resulting optimization problem. This high-level framework is independent of any particular table quality measure and independent of the document medium. Moreover, it does not rely on the presence of ruling lines or other table delimiters. We also present table quality measures based on white space correlation and vertical connected component analysis. These measures can be applied equally well to ASCII text and scanned images. We report on some preliminary experiments using this method to detect tables in both ASCII text and scanned images, yielding promising results. We present detailed evaluation of these results using three different criteria which by themselves pose interesting research questions."

We show that current evaluation scores are insufficient for diagnosing specific errors in page segmentation and fail to identify some classes of serious segmentation errors altogether. This paper introduces a vectorial score that is sensitive to, and identifies, the most important classes of segmentation errors (over, under, and mis-segmentation) and what page components (lines, blocks, etc.) are affected. Unlike previous schemes, our evaluation method has a canonical representation of ground-truth data and guarantees pixel-accurate evaluation results for arbitrary region shapes. We present the results of evaluating widely used segmentation algorithms (x-y cut, smearing, whitespace analysis, constrained text-line finding, docstrum, and Voronoi) on the UW-III database and demonstrate that the new evaluation scheme permits the identification of several specific flaws in individual segmentation methods."

While everyone seems to know what a table is, a precise, analytical definition of \u201ctabularity\u201d remains elusive because some bureaucratic forms, multicolumn text layouts, and schematic drawings share many characteristics of tables. There are significant differences between typeset tables, electronic files designed for display of tables, and tables in symbolic form intended for information retrieval. Most past research has addressed the extraction of low-level geometric information from raster images of tables scanned from printed documents, although there is growing interest in the processing of tables in electronic form as well. Recent research on table composition and table analysis has improved our understanding of the distinction between the logical and physical structures of tables, and has led to improved formalisms for modeling tables. This review, which is structured in terms of generalized paradigms for table processing, indicates that progress on half-a-dozen specific research issues would open the door to using existing paper and electronic tables for database update, tabular browsing, structured information retrieval through graphical and audio interfaces, multimedia table editing, and platform-independent display."

In contrast, programs that filter text streams, software that categorizes documents, agents which alert users, and many other IR systems must make decisions without human input or supervision. It is important to define what constitutes good effectiveness for these autonomous systems, tune the systems to achieve the highest possible effectiveness, and estimate how the effectiveness changes as new data is processed. We show how to do this for binary text classification systems, emphasizing that different goals for the system le ad to different optimal behaviors. Optimizing and estimating effectiveness is greatly aided if classifiers that explicitly estimate the probability of class membership are used. Ranked retrieval is the information retrieval (IR) researc her\u2019s favorite tool for dealing with information overload. Ranked retrieval systems display documents in order of probability of releva nce or some similar measure. Users see the best documents first, anddecide how far down the ranking to go in examining the available information. The central role played by ranking in this appr oach has led researchers to evaluate IR systems primarily, often exclusively, on the quality of their rankings. (See, for instance , the TREC evaluations [1].) In some IR applications, however, ranking is not enough: A company provides an SDI (selective dissemination of information) service which filters newswire feeds. Relevant articles are faxed each morning to clients. Interaction between customer and system takes place infrequently. The cost of resources (tying up phone lines, fax machine paper, etc.) is a factor to consider in operating the system. A text categorization system assigns controlled vocabulary categories to incoming documents as they are stored in a text database. Cost cutting has eliminated manual checking of category assignments."

Lines and tables are among the most frequent graphic, non-textual entities in documents and their detection is directly related to the OCR performance as well as to the document layout description. We propose a workflow for table detection that comprises three distinct steps: (i) image pre-processing; (ii) horizontal and vertical line detection and (iii) table detection. The efficiency of the proposed method is demonstrated by using a performance evaluation scheme which considers a great variety of documents such as forms, newspapers/magazines, scientific journals, tickets/bank cheques, certificates and handwritten documents."

In this paper we report a very simple but extremely powerful approach to detect tables present in document pages. The algorithm relies on the observation that the tables have distinct columns which implies that gaps between the fields are substantially larger than the gaps between the words in text lines. This deceptively simple observation has led to the design of a simple but powerful table detection system with low computation cost. Moreover, mathematical foundation of the approach is also established including formation of a regular expression for ease of implementation."

This paper proposes a representation of segmentations and presegmentations in terms of color images. Such representations allow convenient interchange of ground truth and hypothesized segmentations in the form of standard image formats. The paper formally defines the notions of oversegmentation and undersegmentation in terms of the maximal bipartite match between corresponding pixels. It also defines a number of metrics that quantify the frequency and extent of events in handwriting like kerning, splitting, and merging of characters. It is hoped that these metrics and representations will find wider use in the community and serve as a basis for creating standard training and test databases of segmentation data."

Given a machine segmentation and a ground-truth segmentation, performance measures are needed. We propose to consider the image segmentation problem as one of data clustering and, as a consequence, to use measures for comparing clusterings developed in statistics and machine learning. By doing so, we obtain a variety of performance measures which have not been used before in image processing. In particular, some of these measures have the highly desired property of being a metric. Experimental results are reported on both synthetic and real data to validate the measures and compare them with others."
