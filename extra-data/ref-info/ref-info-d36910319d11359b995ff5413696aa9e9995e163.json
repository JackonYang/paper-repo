The authors propose the application of a Poisson process model of novelty. Its ability to predict novel tokens is evaluated, and it consistently outperforms existing methods. It is applied to a practical statistical coding scheme, where a slight modification is required to avoid divergence. The result is a well-founded zero-frequency model that explains observed differences in the performance of existing methods, and offers a small improvement in the coding efficiency of text compression over the best method previously known. >"

Adaptive coding allows the model to be constructed dynamically by both encoder and decoder during the course of the transmission, and has been shown to incur a smaller coding overhead than explicit transmission of the model's statistics. But there is a basic conflict between the desire to use high-order Markov models and the need to have them formed quickly as the initial part of the message is sent. This paper describes how the conflict can be resolved with partial string matching, and reports experimental results which show that mixed-case English text can be coded in as little as 2.2 bits/ character with no prior knowledge of the source."
