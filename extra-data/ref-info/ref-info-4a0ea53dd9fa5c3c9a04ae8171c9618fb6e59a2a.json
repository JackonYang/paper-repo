It would be astonishing if such a structure did not profoundly modify the response patterns of fibres coming into it. In the cat's visual cortex, the receptive field arrangements of single cells suggest that there is indeed a degree of complexity far exceeding anything yet seen at lower levels in the visual system. In a previous paper we described receptive fields of single cortical cells, observing responses to spots of light shone on one or both retinas (Hubel & Wiesel, 1959). In the present work this method is used to examine receptive fields of a more complex type (Part I) and to make additional observations on binocular interaction (Part II). This approach is necessary in order to understand the behaviour of individual cells, but it fails to deal with the problem of the relationship of one cell to its neighbours. In the past, the technique of recording evoked slow waves has been used with great success in studies of functional anatomy. It was employed by Talbot & Marshall (1941) and by Thompson, Woolsey & Talbot (1950) for mapping out the visual cortex in the rabbit, cat, and monkey. Daniel & Whitteiidge (1959) have recently extended this work in the primate. Most of our present knowledge of retinotopic projections, binocular overlap, and the second visual area is based on these investigations. Yet the method of evoked potentials is valuable mainly for detecting behaviour common to large populations of neighbouring cells; it cannot differentiate functionally between areas of cortex smaller than about 1 mm2. To overcome this difficulty a method has in recent years been developed for studying cells separately or in small groups during long micro-electrode penetrations through nervous tissue. Responses are correlated with cell location by reconstructing the electrode tracks from histological material. These techniques have been applied to"

                "text": "Directionally selective single units have recently been found in the cerebral cortex of cats (Hubel, 1959; Hubel & Wiesel, 1959, 1962), the optic tectum of frogs and pigeons (Lettvin, Maturana, McCulloch & Pitts, 1959; Maturana & Frenk, 1963), and the retinae of rabbits (Barlow & Hill, 1963; Barlow, Hill & Levick, 1964). The term 'directionally selective' means that a unit gives a vigorous discharge of impulses when a stimulus object is moved through its receptive field in one direction (called the preferred direction), whereas motion in the reverse direction (called null) evokes little or no response. The preferred direction differs in different units, and the activity of a set of such units signals the direction of movement of objects in the visual field. In the rabbit the preferred and null directions cannot be predicted from a map of the receptive field showing the regions yielding on or off-responses to stationary spots. Furthermore, the preferred direction is unchanged by changing the stimulus; in particular, reversing the contrast of a spot or a black-white border does not reverse the preferred direction. Hubel & Wiesel (1962) thought that the directional selectivity of the cat's cortical neurons could be explained by the asymmetrical arrangement of on and off zones in the receptive field, and the simple interaction of effects summated over these zones, but the foregoing results rule out this explanation, at least in the rabbit's retina (Barlow & Hill, 1963). In the present paper we go on from this point to describe experiments which show, first, that directional selectivity is not due to optical aberrations of some kind and, secondly, that it is not a simple matter of the latency of response varying systematically across the receptive field. After these negative results we describe experiments upon the organization of directional selectivity within the receptive field, and upon its mechanism. These lead us to the conclusion that the ganglion cells responding to a"

The new methods we have developed for studying this projection using single-unit recording and the precision we have found in the projection itself directed our attention to many of the basic problems inherent in the idea of topographical localization in the visual system. The present paper is concerned with an examination of these problems particularly as they pertain to the eye. The nature of the projection of the visual fields on the LGN will be described in the following paper (Bishop, Kozak, Levick & Vakkur, 1962). In order to describe a direction in the visual field a suitable system of co-ordinates is required, the direction being defined in terms of angles from a reference axis and plane. Under experimental conditions the visual field will consist of a tangent screen or perimeter. In addition, the reference axis and plane of the visual field co-ordinate system must be defined in relation to the projection of retinal landmarks into the visual field. Unless this is the case the nature of the projection of the visual fields on to the brain centres will vary with the position of the eyes. Thus the orientation of the eyeballs should be known and for this purpose an axis and plane of reference for the eye must be defined in relation to appropriate retinal landmarks. Even before the development of vision the direction of gravity provided the vertical co-ordinate as the basic reference for the orientation of the organism in its environment. The development of vision, particularly binocular vision, has added a second fundamental reference, namely the horizontal co-ordinate determined visually from the horizon. The direction of gravity and the plane of the horizon are the axis and plane of reference used by the animal in its interpretation of the visual world. If our system"

These are the historic, anatomic, pathologic, and biologic aspects of the vertebrate visual system. The author\u2019s approach was primarily anatomic. Therefore, this section describes in minute detail the gross and microscopic structures concerned with the visual pathways which center chiefly on man, apes, and monkeys. Naturally, there is some repetition concerning the retina and optic radiation from the author\u2019s previous works. However, the 418 pages devoted to these and other structures portray the system as a whole in an orderly fashion and with considerable new material, including a detailed account of the blood supply and drainage. The most helpful part of the anatomic portion deals with the general theory of the organization of the nervous systems and visual functions. Here one finds in review an interpretation of neuronal patterns, especially retinal elements. Biographic sketches with photographs of those who have made significant contributions to this phase of the subject are scattered throughout this section. The first section of this book deals historically with the study of the visual system. In dealing with the pathologic and biologic sections, the historical aspect is also stressed as each topic of discussion is brought into focus."

There is, in such case, no difference between the visual appearance of an object in relief and its perspective projection on a plane surface; and hence pictorial representations of distant objects, when those circumstances which would prevent or disturb the illusion are carefully excluded, may be rendered such perfect resemblances of the objects they are intended to represent as to be mistaken for them; the Diorama is an instance of this. But this similarity no longer exists when the object is placed so near the eyes that to view it the optic axes must converge; under these conditions a different perspective projection of it is seen by each eye, and these perspectives are more dissimilar as the convergence of the optic axes becomes greater. This fact may be easily verified by placing any figure of three dimensions, an outline cube for instance, at a moderate distance before the eyes, and while the head is kept perfectly steady, viewing it with each eye successively while the other is closed. Plate XI. fig. 13. represents the two perspective projections of a cube; b is that seen by the right eye, and a that presented to the left eye; the figure being supposed to be placed about seven inches immediately before the spectator. The appearances, which are by this simple experiment rendered so obvious, may be easily inferred from the established laws of perspective; for the same object in relief is, when viewed by a different eye, seen from two points of sight at a distance from each other equal to the line joining the two eyes. Yet they seem to have escaped the attention of every philosopher and artist who has treated of the subjects of vision and perspective. I can ascribe this inattention to a phenomenon leading to the important and curious consequences, which will form the subject of the present communication, only to this circumstance; that the results being contrary to a principle which was very generally maintained by optical writers, viz. that objects can be seen single only when their images fall on corresponding points of the two retin\u00e6, an hypothesis which will be hereafter discussed, if the consideration ever arose in their minds, it was hastily discarded under the conviction, that if the pictures presented to the two eyes are under certain circumstances dissimilar, their differences must be so small that they need not be taken into account."

Our method is to find what sort of stimulus causes the largest activity in one nerve fiber and then what is the exciting aspect of that stimulus such that variations in everything else cause little change in the response. It has been known for the past 20 years that each fiber is connected not to a few rods and cones in the retina but to very many over a fair area. Our results show that for the most part within that area, it is not the light intensity itself but rather the pattern of local variation of intensity that is the exciting factor. There are four types of fibers, each type concerned with a different sort of pattern. Each type is uniformly distributed over the whole retina of the frog. Thus, there are four distinct parallel distributed channels whereby the frog's eye informs his brain about the visual image in terms of local pattern independent of average illumination. We describe the patterns and show the functional and anatomical separation of the channels. This work has been done on the frog, and our interpretation applies only to the frog."

                "text": "Eye movements may be described in terms of two components: conjugate and disjunctive. A pure conjugate eye movement is one in which the two eyes move in a parallel fashion, while in a disjunctive movement changes occur in the orientation of one eye with respect to the other. A typical situation calling for a disjunctive movement is the change in binocular observation from a far to a near target, when the fixation lines of the two eyes have to converge. Recordings of eye movement responses to the presentation of targets requiring convergence show the movements to be slow compared with their reaction time (Westheimer &AMitchell, 1956). In this respect they differ from the most commonly occurring conjugate eye movements, the saccadic movements. It is clear now that saccadic eye movements are not guided, in that no adjustments in response to visual clues are made during the movement (Westheimer, 1954). The time characteristics of disjunctive movements, on the other hand, would theoretically allow correction of movements during their course on the basis of visual information. That the elements for such a control system exist is evidenced by the following two facts: (1) the sensory system on which such a control system would depend is capable of making very fine discriminations-retinal disparities of less than a minute of arc can be detected-and (2) the muscular system is quite fast and capable of making fine gradations in response. The experiments reported in this paper fall into two groups. Those describing the eye movement responses to simple types of convergence stimuli are given in Part I, and those in which responses are studied to special stimulus situations designed to elucidate the properties of the control mechanism for disjunctive eye movements are contained in Part II."
