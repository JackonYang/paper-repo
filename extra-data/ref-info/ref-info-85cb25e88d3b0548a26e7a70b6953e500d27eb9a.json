The text component is represented as a sample from a hidden topic model, learned with latent Dirichlet allocation, and images are represented as bags of visual (SIFT) features. Two hypotheses are investigated: that 1) there is a benefit to explicitly modeling correlations between the two components, and 2) this modeling is more effective in feature spaces with higher levels of abstraction. Correlations between the two components are learned with canonical correlation analysis. Abstraction is achieved by representing text and images at a more general, semantic level. The two hypotheses are studied in the context of the task of cross-modal document retrieval. This includes retrieving the text that most closely matches a query image, or retrieving the images that most closely match a query text. It is shown that accounting for cross-modal correlations and semantic abstraction both improve retrieval accuracy. The cross-modal model is also shown to outperform state-of-the-art image retrieval systems on a unimodal retrieval task."

Learning the joint distribution of image regions and words has many applications. We consider in detail predicting words associated with whole images (auto-annotation) and corresponding to particular image regions (region naming). Auto-annotation might help organize and access large collections of images. Region naming is a model of object recognition as a process of translating image regions to words, much as one might translate from one language to another. Learning the relationships between image regions and semantic correlates (words) is an interesting example of multi-modal data mining, particularly because it is typically hard to apply data mining techniques to collections of images. We develop a number of models for the joint distribution of image regions and words, including several which explicitly learn the correspondence between regions and words. We study multi-modal and correspondence extensions to Hofmann's hierarchical clustering/aspect model, a translation model adapted from statistical machine translation (Brown et al.), and a multi-modal extension to mixture of latent Dirichlet allocation (MoM-LDA). All models are assessed using a large collection of annotated images of real scenes. We study in depth the difficult problem of measuring performance. For the annotation task, we look at prediction performance on held out data. We present three alternative measures, oriented toward different types of task. Measuring the performance of correspondence methods is harder, because one must determine whether a word has been placed on the right region of an image. We can use annotation performance as a proxy measure, but accurate measurement requires hand labeled data, and thus must occur on a smaller scale. We show results using both an annotation proxy, and manually labeled data."

Given photos of a sports event, all that is necessary to provide a pixel-level labeling of objects and background is a set of newspaper articles about this sport and one to five labeled images. Our model is motivated by the observation that words in text corpora share certain context and feature similarities with visual objects. We describe images using visual words, a new region-based representation. The proposed model is based on kernelized canonical correlation analysis which finds a mapping between visual and textual words by projecting them into a latent meaning space. Kernels are derived from context and adjective features inside the respective visual and textual domains. We apply our method to a challenging dataset and rely on articles of the New York Times for textual features. Our model outperforms the state-of-the-art in annotation. In segmentation it compares favorably with other methods that use significantly more labeled training data."

At the heart of our new annotation model lies a novel latent variable regression approach to capture correlations between image or video features and annotation texts. Instead of sharing a set of latent topics between the 2 data modalities as in the formulation of correspondence LDA in [2], our approach introduces a regression module to correlate the 2 sets of topics, which captures more general forms of association and allows the number of topics in the 2 data modalities to be different. We demonstrate the power of tr-mmLDA on 2 standard annotation datasets: a 5000-image subset of COREL and a 2687-image LabelMe dataset. The proposed association model shows improved performance over correspondence LDA as measured by caption perplexity."

We achieve this using generative models from the statistical text literature: probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (pLSA), and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). In text analysis these are used to discover topics in a corpus using the bag-of-words document representation. Here we discover topics as object categories, so that an image containing instances of several categories is modelled as a mixture of topics. The models are applied to images by using a visual analogue of a word, formed by vector quantizing SIFT like region descriptors. We investigate a set of increasingly demanding scenarios, starting with image sets containing only two object categories through to sets containing multiple categories (including airplanes, cars, faces, motorbikes, spotted cats) and background clutter. The object categories sample both intra-class and scale variation, and both the categories and their approximate spatial layout are found without supervision. We also demonstrate classification of unseen images and images containing multiple objects. Performance of the proposed unsupervised method is compared to the semi-supervised approach of [7].1 1This work was sponsored in part by the EU Project CogViSys, the University of Oxford, Shell Oil, and the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency."

However, these models ignore spatial relationships among local topic labels in an image and suffers from information loss by representing image feature using the index of its closest match in the codebook. In this paper, we propose Topic Random Field (TRF) to tackle these two problems. Specifically, TRF defines a Markov Random Field over hidden labels of an image, to enforce the spatial coherence between topic labels for neighboring regions. Moreover, TRF utilizes a noise channel to model the generation of local image features, and avoids the off-line process of building visual codebook. We provide details of variational inference and parameter learning for TRF. Experimental evaluations on three image data sets show that TRF achieves better segmentation performance."

We introduce a method that adapts object models acquired in a particular visual domain to new imaging conditions by learning a transformation that minimizes the effect of domain-induced changes in the feature distribution. The transformation is learned in a supervised manner and can be applied to categories for which there are no labeled examples in the new domain. While we focus our evaluation on object recognition tasks, the transform-based adaptation technique we develop is general and could be applied to nonimage data. Another contribution is a new multi-domain object database, freely available for download. We experimentally demonstrate the ability of our method to improve recognition on categories with few or no target domain labels and moderate to large changes in the imaging conditions."

                "text": "Existing approaches to multi-view learning are particularly effective when the views are either independent (i.e, multi-kernel approaches) or fully dependent (i.e., shared latent spaces). However, in real scenarios, these assumptions are almost never truly satisfied. Recently, two methods have attempted to tackle this problem by factorizing the information and learn separate latent spaces for modeling the shared (i.e., correlated) and private (i.e., independent) parts of the data. However, these approaches are very sensitive to parameters setting or initialization. In this paper we propose a robust approach to factorizing the latent space into shared and private spaces by introducing orthogonality constraints, which penalize redundant latent representations. Furthermore, unlike previous approaches, we simultaneously learn the structure and dimensionality of the latent spaces by relying on a regularizer that encourages the latent space of each data stream to be low dimensional. To demonstrate the benefits of our approach, we apply it to two existing shared latent space models that assume full dependence of the views, the sGPLVM and the sKIE, and show that our constraints improve the performance of these models on the task of pose estimation from monocular images."

Intuitively, annotations provide evidence for the class label, and the class label provides evidence for annotations. For example, an image of class highway is more likely annotated with words \u201croad,\u201d \u201ccar,\u201d and \u201ctraffic\u201d than words \u201cfish,\u201d \u201cboat,\u201d and \u201cscuba.\u201d In this paper, we develop a new probabilistic model for jointly modeling the image, its class label, and its annotations. Our model treats the class label as a global description of the image, and treats annotation terms as local descriptions of parts of the image. Its underlying probabilistic assumptions naturally integrate these two sources of information. We derive an approximate inference and estimation algorithms based on variational methods, as well as efficient approximations for classifying and annotating new images. We examine the performance of our model on two real-world image data sets, illustrating that a single model provides competitive annotation performance, and superior classification performance."

The object is represented by a set of viewpoint invariant region descriptors so that recognition can proceed successfully despite changes in viewpoint, illumination and partial occlusion. The temporal continuity of the video within a shot is used to track the regions in order to reject unstable regions and reduce the effects of noise in the descriptors. The analogy with text retrieval is in the implementation where matches on descriptors are pre-computed (using vector quantization), and inverted file systems and document rankings are used. The result is that retrieved is immediate, returning a ranked list of key frames/shots in the manner of Google. The method is illustrated for matching in two full length feature films."

However, LDA does not capture correlations between topics. In this paper, we introduce the pachinko allocation model (PAM), which captures arbitrary, nested, and possibly sparse correlations between topics using a directed acyclic graph (DAG). The leaves of the DAG represent individual words in the vocabulary, while each interior node represents a correlation among its children, which may be words or other interior nodes (topics). PAM provides a flexible alternative to recent work by Blei and Lafferty (2006), which captures correlations only between pairs of topics. Using text data from newsgroups, historic NIPS proceedings and other research paper corpora, we show improved performance of PAM in document classification, likelihood of held-out data, the ability to support finer-grained topics, and topical keyword coherence."

The LDA model assumes that the words of each document arise from a mixture of topics, each of which is a distribution over the vocabulary. A limitation of LDA is the inability to model topic correlation even though, for example, a document about genetics is more likely to also be about disease than X-ray astronomy. This limitation stems from the use of the Dirichlet distribution to model the variability among the topic proportions. In this paper we develop the correlated topic model (CTM), where the topic proportions exhibit correlation via the logistic normal distribution [J. Roy. Statist. Soc. Ser. B 44 (1982) 139--177]. We derive a fast variational inference algorithm for approximate posterior inference in this model, which is complicated by the fact that the logistic normal is not conjugate to the multinomial. We apply the CTM to the articles from Science published from 1990--1999, a data set that comprises 57M words. The CTM gives a better fit of the data than LDA, and we demonstrate its use as an exploratory tool of large document collections."

Shared dimensionality reduction aims to represent multiple observationspaces within the same model. Previously suggested models have been limited tothe scenarios where the observations have been generated from the same manifold.In this thesis we present a Gaussian Process Latent Variable Model (GP-LVM)[33] for shared dimensionality reduction without making assumptions about therelationship between the observations. Further we suggest an extension to Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) called Non Consolidating Component Analysis (NCCA). The proposed algorithm extends classical CCA to represent the fullvariance of the data opposed to only the correlated. We compare the suggestedGP-LVM model to existing models and show results on real-world problems exemplifying the advantages of our approach."

We first show that the method can learn the nonlinear mapping between corresponding views of objects, filling in missing data as needed to synthesize novel views. We then show that the method can learn a mapping between human degrees of freedom and robotic degrees of freedom for a humanoid robot, allowing robotic imitation of human poses from motion capture data."

We assume that the number of mixture components is unknown a priori and is to be inferred from the data. In this setting it is natural to consider sets of Dirichlet processes, one for each group, where the well-known clustering property of the Dirichlet process provides a nonparametric prior for the number of mixture components within each group. Given our desire to tie the mixture models in the various groups, we consider a hierarchical model, specifically one in which the base measure for the child Dirichlet processes is itself distributed according to a Dirichlet process. Such a base measure being discrete, the child Dirichlet processes necessarily share atoms. Thus, as desired, the mixture models in the different groups necessarily share mixture components. We discuss representations of hierarchical Dirichlet processes in terms of a stick-breaking process, and a generalization of the Chinese restaurant process that we refer to as the \u201cChinese restaurant franchise.\u201d We present Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms for posterior inference in hierarchical Dirichlet process mixtures and describe applications to problems in information retrieval and text modeling."

The embedding is performed implicitly, by specifying the inner products between each pair of points in the embedding space. This information is contained in the so-called kernel matrix, a symmetric and positive semidefinite matrix that encodes the relative positions of all points. Specifying this matrix amounts to specifying the geometry of the embedding space and inducing a notion of similarity in the input space---classical model selection problems in machine learning. In this paper we show how the kernel matrix can be learned from data via semidefinite programming (SDP) techniques. When applied to a kernel matrix associated with both training and test data this gives a powerful transductive algorithm---using the labeled part of the data one can learn an embedding also for the unlabeled part. The similarity between test points is inferred from training points and their labels. Importantly, these learning problems are convex, so we obtain a method for learning both the model class and the function without local minima. Furthermore, this approach leads directly to a convex method for learning the 2-norm soft margin parameter in support vector machines, solving an important open problem."

This method, \"Expectation Propagation,\" unifies two previous techniques: assumed-density filtering, an extension of the Kalman filter, and loopy belief propagation, an extension of belief propagation in Bayesian networks. Loopy belief propagation, because it propagates exact belief states, is useful for a limited class of belief networks, such as those which are purely discrete. Expectation Propagation approximates the belief states by only retaining expectations, such as mean and varitmce, and iterates until these expectations are consistent throughout the network. This makes it applicable to hybrid networks with discrete and continuous nodes. Experiments with Gaussian mixture models show Expectation Propagation to be donvincingly better than methods with similar computational cost: Laplace's method, variational Bayes, and Monte Carlo. Expectation Propagation also provides an efficient algorithm for training Bayes point machine classifiers."
