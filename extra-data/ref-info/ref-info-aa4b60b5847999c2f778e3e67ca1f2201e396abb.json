It would be astonishing if such a structure did not profoundly modify the response patterns of fibres coming into it. In the cat's visual cortex, the receptive field arrangements of single cells suggest that there is indeed a degree of complexity far exceeding anything yet seen at lower levels in the visual system. In a previous paper we described receptive fields of single cortical cells, observing responses to spots of light shone on one or both retinas (Hubel & Wiesel, 1959). In the present work this method is used to examine receptive fields of a more complex type (Part I) and to make additional observations on binocular interaction (Part II). This approach is necessary in order to understand the behaviour of individual cells, but it fails to deal with the problem of the relationship of one cell to its neighbours. In the past, the technique of recording evoked slow waves has been used with great success in studies of functional anatomy. It was employed by Talbot & Marshall (1941) and by Thompson, Woolsey & Talbot (1950) for mapping out the visual cortex in the rabbit, cat, and monkey. Daniel & Whitteiidge (1959) have recently extended this work in the primate. Most of our present knowledge of retinotopic projections, binocular overlap, and the second visual area is based on these investigations. Yet the method of evoked potentials is valuable mainly for detecting behaviour common to large populations of neighbouring cells; it cannot differentiate functionally between areas of cortex smaller than about 1 mm2. To overcome this difficulty a method has in recent years been developed for studying cells separately or in small groups during long micro-electrode penetrations through nervous tissue. Responses are correlated with cell location by reconstructing the electrode tracks from histological material. These techniques have been applied to"

It is shown that rather general numerical constraints roughly determine the dimensions of memorizing models for the mammalian brain, and from these is derived a general model for archicortex. The addition of further constraints leads to the notion of a simple representation, which is a way of translating a great deal of information into the firing of about 200 out of a population of 10 $^5$ cells. It is shown that if about 10 $^5$ simple representations are stored in such a population of cells, very little information about a single learnt event is necessary to provoke its recall. A detailed numerical examination is made of a particular example of this kind of memory, and various general conclusions are drawn from the analysis. The insight gained from these models is used to derive theories for various archicortical areas. A functional interpretation is given of the cells and synapses of the area entorhinalis, the prcsubiculum, the prosubiculum, the cornu ammonis and the fascia dentata. Many predictions are made, a substantial number of which must be true if the theory is correct. A general functional classification of typical archicortical cells is proposed."

Such texture pairs could not be discriminated from each other by the human visual system without scrutiny. Unfortunately, Markov processes are inherently one-dimensional while the general processes underlying visual texture discrimination are two-dimensional. Here three new methods are introduced that generate two-dimensional non-Markovian textures with different third-order but identical first- and second-order statistics. All three methods generate texture pairs that cannot be discriminated from each other. The lack of texture discrimination is the more astonishing since the individual elements that form the texture pair are clearly perceived as being very different. However, a counterexample was found that yields discrimination although the texture pair has approximately identical second-order statistics. This case can be explained by assuming that early feature extractors do some preprocessing. These new demonstrations give support to a model of texture discrimination in which the stimulus is first analyzed by local feature extractors that can detect only simple features such as dots and edges of given sizes and orientations. Then the outputs of these simple extractors are evaluated by a global processor that can compute only second- or first-order statistics (that is can compare at most two such outputs)."

In the previous paper we have given a quantitative description of visual control of flight orientation in the fly. This description can account for fixation, tracking and some instances of spontaneous pattern preference behaviour. The phenomenological theory outlines the basic logical organization of the visual control system of the fly. It requires the neural network between the receptors and the flight muscles to perform two main computations on the visual input. One computation extracts movement information (the term r (\u03c8)\u03c8 b of the phenomenological equation). The other provides position information (the term D (\u03c8))."

A simple, straightforward explanation is that high-frequency noise introduced by the sampling and quantizing must be removed by low-pass filtering to improve the signal-to-noise ratio and hence signal detectability or recognition. Experiments reported here, suggested on the basis of a different model, show instead that noise bands that are spectrally adjacent to the picture's spectrum are considerably more effective in suppressing recognition."

Two methods for clustering a rectangular array of dots into two halves were studied: one increased the separation between the left and right halves, and the other increased the density of one of the halves. Significant effects were found for array height on the perception of \u2018separation\u2019 patterns, and for overall dot density on the \u2018density\u2019 patterns. The results indicate that global properties of dot patterns affect the immediate perception of clusters, and consequently attempts to simulate human perception must incorporate the processing of such global properties. The results also indicate that different perceptual processes operate on dot proximity in perceiving the two kinds of pattern. It is suggested that these processes are in fact complementary: one detects perceptual edges, while the other groups areas of similar dot density."

The display is the central problem. Source messages might be recoded into equal information units presented one at a time to the user, or a temporal or spatial display of the message may permit the user to recode the message perceptually into manageable units. The performance of these alternatives has been examined using a kinesthetic-tactile display for English text. This device consists of eight finger rests, each of which can move in 26 directions in three-dimensional space. Two methods of programming this device to present information were investigated. In the \"traveling-wave\" presentation, a three-dimensional traveling wave of finger movements moves across the display representing a sequence of symbols. This presentation is an example of the case in which the user recodes the source messages perceptually. In the \"typewriter\" presentation, the subject's fingers are moved corresponding to the way he would actively move them if he were typing. The latter proved to be the more effective, yielding a transmission rate of 4.5 bits/sec."
