For the generation of the N-best sentence list an HMM-based recognizer including a bigram language model is used. The parsing of the sentences is achieved by a bottom-up chart parser for stochastic context-free grammars which produces the parse tree of the input sentence as well as the word tags. From a collection of corpora we extract the linguistic resources to build the lexicon, a word bigram model and the stochastic context-free grammar. Results from experiments indicate an increase of the word and sentence recognition rate when using the proposed combination scheme."

Thus linguistic knowledge beyond the lexicon level is incorporated in the recognition process. Another novel feature of the system is that the HMM is applied in such a way that the difficult problem of segmenting a line of text into individual words is avoided. A number of experiments with various language models and large vocabularies have been conducted. The language models used in the system were also analytically compared based on their perplexity."

The only assumption made about the data is that it is written in English. This allows the application of statistical language models in order to improve the performance of our system. Several experiments have been performed using both single and multiple writer data. Lexica of variable size (from 10,000 to 50,000 words) have been used. The use of language models is shown to improve the accuracy of the system (when the lexicon contains 50,000 words, the error rate is reduced by /spl sim/50 percent for single writer data and by /spl sim/25 percent for multiple writer data). Our approach is described in detail and compared with other methods presented in the literature to deal with the same problem. An experimental setup to correctly deal with unconstrained text recognition is proposed."

The input data is processed first by a lexicon-driven word recognizer based on HMMs to generate a list of the candidate N-best-scoring word hypotheses as well as the segmentation of such word hypotheses into characters. An NN classifier is used to generate a score for each segmented character and in the end, the scores from the HMM and the NN classifiers are combined to optimize performance. Experimental results show that for an 80,000-word vocabulary, the hybrid HMM/NN system improves by about 10% the word recognition rate over the HMM system alone."

We describe an algorithm for using a probabilistic Earley parser and a stochastic context-free grammar (SCFG) to generate word transition probabilities at each frame for a Viterbi decoder. We show that using an SCFG as a language model improves the word error rate from 34.6% (bigram) to 29.6% (SCFG), and the semantic sentence recognition error from from 39.0% (bigram) to 34.1% (SCFG). In addition, we get a further reduction to 28.8% word error by mixing the bigram and SCFG LMs. We also report on our preliminary results from using discourse-context information in the LM."

Digital images of words are recognized and alternatives for the identity of each are generated. Local word collocation statistics and a probabilistic chart parsing algorithm are used to determine the top N best parses for each sentence using the alternatives provided for the identity of each word by the recognition system. An approach in which text recognition and understanding are tightly integrated is discussed. An objective of this approach is to provide the capacity to process images of unrestricted English text. A large-scale lexicon, which supports the system, was acquired by training on corpora of over 3,000,000 words. The focus is on the implementation and performance of the probabilistic lattice chart parser.<<ETX>>"

This corpus is a collection of texts that comprise about one million word instances. The database includes 1,066 forms produced by approximately 400 different writers. A total of 82,227 word instances out of a vocabulary of 10,841 words occur in the collection. The database consists of full English sentences. It can serve as a basis for a variety of handwriting recognition tasks. However, it is expected that the database would be particularly useful for recognition tasks where linguistic knowledge beyond the lexicon level is used, because this knowledge can be automatically derived from the underlying corpus. The database also includes a few image-processing procedures for extracting the handwritten text from the forms and the segmentation of the text into lines and words."

A word recognition algorithm first determines a set of words (called a neighborhood) from a lexicon that are visually similar to each input word image. Syntactic classifications for the words and the transition probabilities between those classifications are input to the Viterbi algorithm. The Viterbi algorithm determines the sequence of syntactic classes (the states of an underlying Markov process) for each sentence that have the maximum a posteriori probability, given the observed neighborhoods. The performance of the word recognition algorithm is improved by removing words from neighborhoods with classes that are not included on the estimated state sequence. An experimental application is demonstrated with a neighborhood generation algorithm that produces a number of guesses about the identity of each word in a running text. The use of zero, first and second order transition probabilities and different levels of noise in estimating the neighborhood are explored."

The paper first introduces key notions in language modeling and probabilistic parsing, and briefly reviews some previous approaches to using syntactic structure for language modeling. A lexicalized probabilistic top-down parser is then presented, which performs very well, in terms of both the accuracy of returned parses and the efficiency with which they are found, relative to the best broad-coverage statistical parsers. A new language model that utilizes probabilistic top-down parsing is then outlined, and empirical results show that it improves upon previous work in test corpus perplexity. Interpolation with a trigram model yields an exceptional improvement relative to the improvement observed by other models, demonstrating the degree to which the information captured by our parsing model is orthogonal to that captured by a trigram model. A small recognition experiment also demonstrates the utility of the model."

With the method described in the paper the usability of the database is greatly improved because accurate bounding box information and ground truth for individual words (including punctuation characters) is now available as well. Applying the segmentation scheme on 417 pages of handwritten text a correct word segmentation rate of 98% has been achieved, producing correct bounding boxes for over 25,000 handwritten words."

In the first method, we describe the fixed length modeling scheme where each character model is assigned the same number of states. The second method considered is the Bakis length modeling where the number of model states is set to a given fraction of the average number of observations of the corresponding character. In the third modeling scheme the number of model states is set to a specified quantile of the corresponding character length histogram. This method is called quantile length modeling. A comparison of different length modeling schemes was carried out with a handwriting recognition system using off-line images of cursively handwritten English words from the IAM database. For the fixed length modeling, a recognition rate of 61% was achieved. Using the Bakis or quantile length modeling the word recognition rates could be improved to over 69%."

We have applied our ideas and techniques to the specific task of identifying the city, state and zipcode fields in handwritten addresses. Given the image of a handwritten address, our algorithm produces a ranking of the 76,121-entry database of valid (city, state, zip) triples in the U.S. and in nearly 75% of the cases, the correct entry for the input address is assigned a rank of at most 10."

Due to this property the optimal values of the language weight and word insertion penalty for balancing acoustic and linguistic probabilities is affected by the length of word sequence. To deal with this problem, a new language model is developed based on the Bernoulli trial model taking the length of the word sequence into account.

This paper describes a set of concrete bestpractices that document analysis researchers can use toget good results with neural networks. The mostimportant practice is getting a training set as large aspossible: we expand the training set by adding a newform of distorted data. The next most important practiceis that convolutional neural networks are better suited forvisual document tasks than fully connected networks. Wepropose that a simple \"do-it-yourself\" implementation ofconvolution with a flexible architecture is suitable formany visual document problems. This simpleconvolutional neural network does not require complexmethods, such as momentum, weight decay, structure-dependentlearning rates, averaging layers, tangent prop,or even finely-tuning the architecture. The end result is avery simple yet general architecture which can yieldstate-of-the-art performance for document analysis. Weillustrate our claims on the MNIST set of English digitimages."

As a function of constraint length the performance of optimal convolutional codes is shown to be superior to that of block codes of the same length, the relative improvement increasing with rate.
