An answer to this question, including a description of an automatic computer program, is given for problems up to the size where 200 numbers are to be placed in 10 groups. Two basic types of problem are discussed and illustrated. * This paper is the result of work supported by the Social Science Research Council and by the Bureau of General Research of Kansas State College; also by the courtesies extended to the author by the University of Illinois when he visited there during the summer of 1956.

Given n sets, this procedure permits their reduction to n \u2212 1 mutually exclusive sets by considering the union of all possible n(n \u2212 1)/2 pairs and selecting a union having a maximal value for the functional relation, or objective function, that reflects the criterion chosen by the investigator. By repeating this process until only one group remains, the complete hierarchical structure and a quantitative estimate of the loss associated with each stage in the grouping can be obtained. A general flowchart helpful in computer programming and a numerical example are included."

In this paper we attempt to demonstrate that there exists a class of techniques more suitably oriented toward the capabilities of the digital computer than are conventional analytic statistical techniques. We maintain that these techniques are capable of considering details in social sciences data, that is, relating the individuals described in the data."
