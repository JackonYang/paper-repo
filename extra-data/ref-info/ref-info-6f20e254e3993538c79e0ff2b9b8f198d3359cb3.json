                "text": "In two recent studies of the cat's striate cortex (Hubel, 1959; Hubel & Wiesel, 1959) single units were shown to react to light stimuli in a highly specific manner. Most units responded either feebly or not at all to stimulation of the retina with diffuse light, but gave brisk responses to stationary or moving restricted spots of light. Responses to moving spots often varied with the direction of movement. It was clear that such responses must be the result of complex integrative mechanisms. The present study was undertaken to find out whether similar responses occur in retinal ganglion cells or cells of the dorsal lateral geniculate body. Lateral geniculate units have not previously been studied with restricted light stimulation, and although the cat's retinal ganglion cell has been extensively investigated by Kuffler and his co-workers (Kuffler, 1953; iKuffler, FitzHugh & Barlow, 1957), responses to moving spots were not examined. Thus it has not been possible to say whether the complex activity of cortical units originates in the cortex itself, or at lower levels. Methods for stereotaxic depth recordings in the unanaesthetized unrestrained animal were developed in order to make cortical and depth studies under similar conditions. These techniques make it possible to record from single units from virtually any part of the brain of the freely moving animal."

                "text": "THE DISCHARGES carried in the optic nerve fibers contain all the information which the central nervous system receives from the retina. A correct interpretation of discharge patterns therefore constitutes an important step in the analysis of visual events. Further, investigations of nervous activity arising in the eye reveal many aspects of the functional organization of the neural elements within the retina itself. Following studies of discharges in the optic nerve of the eel\u2019s eye by Adrian and Matthews (2,3), Hartline and his colleagues described the discharge pattern in the eye of the Limulus in a series of important and lucid papers (for a summary see 20). In the Limulus the relationship between the stimulus to the primary receptor cell and the nerve discharges proved relatively simple, apparently because the connection between sense cell and nerve fiber was a direct one. Thus, when stimulation is confined to one receptor the discharge in a single Limulus nerve fiber will provide a good indication of excitatory events which take place as a result of photochemical processes. Discharges last for the duration of illumination and their frequency is a measure of stimulus strength. Lately, however, it was shown by Hartline et al. (22) that inhibitory interactions may be revealed when several receptors are excited. On the whole, the Limulus preparation shows many features which are similar to other simple sense organs, for instance, stretch receptors. In the latter, however, instead of photochemical events, stretch-deformation acts as the adequate stimulus on sensory terminals and is translated into a characteristic discharge pattern. The discharge from the cold-blooded vertebrate retina (mainly frogs) proved much more complex. Hartline found three main types when recording from single optic nerve fibers: (i) \u201con\u201d discharges, similar to those in the Limulus, firing for the duration of the light stimulus, (ii) \u201coff\u201d discharges appearing when a light stimulus was withdrawn, and (iii) \u2018con-off\u201d discharges, a combination of the former two, with activity confined mainly to onset and cessation of illumination. The mammalian discharge patterns were studied in a number of species by Granit and his co-workers in the course of their extensive work on the physiology of the visual system (summaries in 13, 15). On the whole, they did not observe any fundamental differences between frog and mammalian discharge types (see later)."

These methods eliminate anaesthetics, paralysing drugs, brain-stem lesions, and other acute experimental procedures. They make it possible to record electrical events in the higher central nervous system with the animal in a normal state, and to correlate these electrical events with such variables as waking state, attention, learning, and motor activity. The present paper describes a method for unit recording from the cortex of unanaesthetized, unrestrained cats, and presents some observations from the striate cortex. The objectives have been (1) to observe maintained unit activity under various conditions such as sleep and wakefulness, and (2) to find for each unit the natural stimuli which most effectively influence firing. Of 400 units observed, some 200 are presented here because of their common characteristics. Since there is reason to believe that the remainiing 200 units were afferent fibres from the lateral geniculate nucleus, these will be described in a separate paper. A preliminary account of some of this work has been given elsewhere (Hubel, 1958)."

It adds to the usual viewing and illuminating beam two stimulating beams whose patterns may also be viewed and photographed. A large region of the mammalian fundus can be surveyed, the eye being in the center of a spherical coordinate system.The design provides measured adaptive and stimulating parameters over the photopic range, sufficient to study intensity, color, timing, and spatial interaction in the retinal mechanisms. Extension to mesopia and scotopia is possible.Associated optically and mechanically are devices for locating, holding, and directing the eye and head of anaesthetized cats (or monkeys). The eye holder carries a small micromanipulator to control the direction and feed of microelectrodes. This arrangement provides stable electrical contact with single optic ganglion cells for long periods.The method does not interfere with normal metabolism and optical functioning of the eye."

Results obtained applying this technique to the study of spinal reflexes have already been reported by Brock, Coombs & Eccles (1952, 1953), Eccles (1952), Eccles, Fatt & Koketsu (1954) and Woodbury & Patton (1952). While in the studies just quoted attention was focused on the abrupt responses elicitable in anaesthetized preparations, an effort was made in this research to analyse the activity of preparations presenting the sustained responses described by Sherrington. Whereas it was usually easy to determine whether the electrode was located in primary sensory fibres, interneurones or motoneurones, it was found difficult to establish whether the potentials were recorded from somata or axons of post-synaptic units, and whether they originated in 'normal' or in damaged units. The results to be described will show the importance of clarifying these problems, and may justify the rather extensive discussion of the techniques employed and of the criteria used for selecting results and for identifying somatic or axonal origin of the recorded potentials."
