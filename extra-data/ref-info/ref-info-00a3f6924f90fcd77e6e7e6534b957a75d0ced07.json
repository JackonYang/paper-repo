Previous algorithms for taxonomy induction have typically focused on independent classifiers for discovering new single relationships based on hand-constructed or automatically discovered textual patterns. By contrast, our algorithm flexibly incorporates evidence from multiple classifiers over heterogenous relationships to optimize the entire structure of the taxonomy, using knowledge of a word's coordinate terms to help in determining its hypernyms, and vice versa. We apply our algorithm on the problem of sense-disambiguated noun hyponym acquisition, where we combine the predictions of hypernym and coordinate term classifiers with the knowledge in a preexisting semantic taxonomy (WordNet 2.1). We add 10,000 novel synsets to WordNet 2.1 at 84% precision, a relative error reduction of 70% over a non-joint algorithm using the same component classifiers. Finally, we show that a taxonomy built using our algorithm shows a 23% relative F-score improvement over WordNet 2.1 on an independent testset of hypernym pairs."

Next, these patterns can be applied to extend existing ontologies or semantic networks with new relations. The experiments have been performed with the Simple English Wikipedia and WordNet 1.7. A new algorithm has been devised for automatically generalising the lexical patterns found in the encyclopedia entries. We have found general patterns for the hyperonymy, hyponymy, holonymy and meronymy relations and, using them, we have extracted more than 1200 new relationships that did not appear in WordNet originally. The precision of these relationships ranges between 0.61 and 0.69, depending on the relation."

This paperintroduces KnowItAll, a system that aims to automate the tedious process ofextracting large collections of facts from the web in an autonomous,domain-independent, and scalable manner.The paper describes preliminary experiments in which an instance of KnowItAll, running for four days on a single machine, was able to automatically extract 54,753 facts. KnowItAll associates a probability with each fact enabling it to trade off precision and recall. The paper analyzes KnowItAll's architecture and reports on lessons learned for the design of large-scale information extraction systems."

A first step towards exploiting this data automatically could be to extract pairs of a given semantic relation from text documents - for example all pairs of a person and her birthdate. One strategy for this task is to find text patterns that express the semantic relation, to generalize these patterns, and to apply them to a corpus to find new pairs. In this paper, we show that this approach profits significantly when deep linguistic structures are used instead of surface text patterns. We demonstrate how linguistic structures can be represented for machine learning, and we provide a theoretical analysis of the pattern matching approach. We show the benefits of our approach by extensive experiments with our prototype system LEILA."

This is difficult because most high-performance named entity recognition systems operate by sequentially classifying words as to whether or not they participate in an entity name; however, the most useful similarity measures score entire candidate names. To correct this mismatch we formalize a semi-Markov extraction process, which is based on sequentially classifying segments of several adjacent words, rather than single words. In addition to allowing a natural way of coupling high-performance NER methods and high-performance similarity functions, this formalism also allows the direct use of other useful entity-level features, and provides a more natural formulation of the NER problem than sequential word classification. Experiments in multiple domains show that the new model can substantially improve extraction performance over previous methods for using external dictionaries in NER."

Roughly speaking, we extend SHOIN with all expressive means that were suggested to us by ontology developers as useful additions to OWL-DL, and which, additionally, do not affect its decidability and practicability. We consider complex role inclusion axioms of the form R o S \u2291 R or S o R \u2291 R to express propagation of one property along another one, which have proven useful in medical terminologies. Furthermore, we extend SHOIN with reflexive, antisymmetric, and irreflexive roles, disjoint roles, a universal role, and constructs \u2203R. Self, allowing, for instance, the definition of concepts such as a \"narcist\". Finally, we consider negated role assertions in Aboxes and qualified number restrictions. The resulting logic is called SROIQ. We present a rather elegant tableau-based reasoning algorithm: it combines the use of automata to keep track of universal value restrictions with the techniques developed for SHOIQ. The logic SROIQ has been adopted as the logical basis for the next iteration of OWL, OWL 1.1."

The main contributions are: i) a method for exploiting generic patterns by filtering incorrect instances using the Web; and ii) a principled measure of pattern and instance reliability enabling the filtering algorithm. We present an empirical comparison of Espresso with various state of the art systems, on different size and genre corpora, on extracting various general and specific relations. Experimental results show that our exploitation of generic patterns substantially increases system recall with small effect on overall precision."

This data is best exploited infavailable as arelational table that we could use for answering precise queries or running data mining tasks.We explore a technique for extracting such tables from document collections that requires only a handful of training examples from users. These examples are used to generate extraction patterns, that in turn result in new tuples being extracted from the document collection.We build on this idea and present our Snowball system. Snowball introduces novel strategies for generating patterns and extracting tuples from plain-text documents.At each iteration of the extraction process, Snowball evaluates the quality of these patterns and tuples without human intervention,and keeps only the most reliable ones for the next iteration. In this paper we also develop a scalable evaluation methodology and metrics for our task, and present a thorough experimental evaluation of Snowball and comparable techniques over a collection of more than 300,000 newspaper documents."

But search engines often limit the number of available queries. As a result, query-intensive NLP applications such as Information Extraction (IE) distribute their query load over several days, making IE a slow, offline process.This paper introduces a novel architecture for IE that obviates queries to commercial search engines. The architecture is embodied in a system called KnowItNow that performs high-precision IE in minutes instead of days. We compare KnowItNow experimentally with the previously-published KnowItAll system, and quantify the tradeoff between recall and speed. KnowItNow's extraction rate is two to three orders of magnitude higher than KnowItAll's."

A document has a phrase if all content words in the phrase are within a window of a certain size. The window sizes for different types of phrases are different and are determined using a decision tree. Phrases are more important than individual terms. Consequently, documents in response to a query are ranked with matching phrases given a higher priority. We utilize WordNet to disambiguate word senses of query terms. Whenever the sense of a query term is determined, its synonyms, hyponyms, words from its definition and its compound words are considered for possible additions to the query. Experimental results show that our approach yields between 23% and 31% improvements over the best-known results on the TREC 9, 10 and 12 collections for short (title only) queries, without using Web data."

For Web data the XML-oriented query engine is leveraged to provide very rich search options that cannot be expressed in traditional Web search engines: concept-aware and link-aware querying that takes into account the implicit structure and context of Web pages. The benefits of the SphereSearch engine are demonstrated by experiments with a large and richly tagged but non-schematic open encyclopedia extended with external documents."

However, with respect to English to Hindi translation, this assumption does not hold well always. At least eleven different patterns can be found in the Hindi translation of English sentences in which the main verb is \u201chave\u201d or any of its declensions. This poses a serious problem for designing any English to Hindi translation system. Traditionally such variations are termed as \u201ctranslation divergence\u201d. Typically a study of divergence considers some standard translation pattern for a given input sentence structure. A translation is said to be a divergence if it deviates from this standard pattern. However, this is not the case with the abovementioned sentence structures. We term this ambiguity as \u201cpattern ambiguity\u201d. In this ongoing work we propose a rule-based scheme to resolve the ambiguity using word senses given by WordNet."

Fuzzy duplicates are multiple seemingly distinct tuples, which represent the same real-world entity. We propose two novel criteria that enable characterization of fuzzy duplicates more accurately than is possible with existing techniques. Using these criteria, we propose a novel framework for the fuzzy duplicate elimination problem. We show that solutions within the new framework result in better accuracy than earlier approaches. We present an efficient algorithm for solving instantiations within the framework. We evaluate it on real datasets to demonstrate the accuracy and scalability of our algorithm."

The combination has synergies that can boost the combined performance. This paper presents the theoretical model and extensive experimental results on three data collections. Our experiments show improved classification results over state-of-the-art classification techniques such as the Spectral Graph Transducer and Transductive Support Vector Machines, particularly for the case of sparse training."
