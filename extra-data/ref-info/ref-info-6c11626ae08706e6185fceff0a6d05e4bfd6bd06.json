The convolutional architecture of our model allows it to scale to realistic image sizes whilst using a compact parametrization. In experiments on the NORB dataset, we show our model extracts latent \"flow fields\" which correspond to the transformation between the pair of input frames. We also use our model to extract low-level motion features in a multi-stage architecture for action recognition, demonstrating competitive performance on both the KTH and Hollywood2 datasets."

This can be interpreted as saying that if V is large compared to U then we are in a domain where preventing collapse is not a major concern, therefore the model\u2019s learning is mostly antiHebbian and aimed towards reducing temporal variability and improving coherence. On the other hand, if V is smaller than U , then collapsing is becoming a concern and the model\u2019s learning switches to Hebbian, aimed at increasing the variability of the output in response to the input. This update rule elegantly combines the anti-Hebbian term (Eq. 2) proposed by Mitchison (1991) with standard Hebbian learning."

In this work we study unsupervised feature learning in the context of temporally coherent video data. We focus on feature learning from unlabeled video data, using the assumption that adjacent video frames contain semantically similar information. This assumption is exploited to train a convolutional pooling auto-encoder regularized by slowness and sparsity. We establish a connection between slow feature learning to metric learning and show that the trained encoder can be used to define a more temporally and semantically coherent metric."

By learning to predict missing frames or extrapolate future frames from an input video sequence, the model discovers both spatial and temporal correlations which are useful to represent complex deformations and motion patterns. The models we propose are largely borrowed from the language modeling literature, and adapted to the vision domain by quantizing the space of image patches into a large dictionary. We demonstrate the approach on both a filling and a generation task. For the first time, we show that, after training on natural videos, such a model can predict non-trivial motions over short video sequences."

Do we really need millions of semantically-labeled images to train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)? In this paper, we present a simple yet surprisingly powerful approach for unsupervised learning of CNN. Specifically, we use hundreds of thousands of unlabeled videos from the web to learn visual representations. Our key idea is that visual tracking provides the supervision. That is, two patches connected by a track should have similar visual representation in deep feature space since they probably belong to same object or object part. We design a Siamese-triplet network with a ranking loss function to train this CNN representation. Without using a single image from ImageNet, just using 100K unlabeled videos and the VOC 2012 dataset, we train an ensemble of unsupervised networks that achieves 52% mAP (no bounding box regression). This performance comes tantalizingly close to its ImageNet-supervised counterpart, an ensemble which achieves a mAP of 54.4%. We also show that our unsupervised network can perform competitively in other tasks such as surface-normal estimation."

Our framework can be learned in a completely unsupervised manner from a large collection of videos. However, more importantly, because our approach models the prediction framework on these mid-level elements, we can not only predict the possible motion in the scene but also predict visual appearances - how are appearances going to change with time. This yields a visual \"hallucination\" of probable events on top of the scene. We show that our method is able to accurately predict and visualize simple future events, we also show that our approach is comparable to supervised methods for event prediction."

Large quantities of unlabeled video data can be easily obtained from the Internet. These videos possess the implicit weak label that they are sequences of temporally and semantically coherent images. We leverage this information to learn temporal embeddings for video frames by associating frames with the temporal context that they appear in. To do this, we propose a scheme for incorporating temporal context based on past and future frames in videos, and compare this to other contextual representations. In addition, we show how data augmentation using multi-resolution samples and hard negatives helps to significantly improve the quality of the learned embeddings. We evaluate various design decisions for learning temporal embeddings, and show that our embeddings can improve performance for multiple video tasks such as retrieval, classification, and temporal order recovery in unconstrained Internet video."

Our model uses an encoder LSTM to map an input sequence into a fixed length representation. This representation is decoded using single or multiple decoder LSTMs to perform different tasks, such as reconstructing the input sequence, or predicting the future sequence. We experiment with two kinds of input sequences - patches of image pixels and high-level representations (\"percepts\") of video frames extracted using a pretrained convolutional net. We explore different design choices such as whether the decoder LSTMs should condition on the generated output. We analyze the outputs of the model qualitatively to see how well the model can extrapolate the learned video representation into the future and into the past. We further evaluate the representations by finetuning them for a supervised learning problem - human action recognition on the UCF-101 and HMDB-51 datasets. We show that the representations help improve classification accuracy, especially when there are only few training examples. Even models pretrained on unrelated datasets (300 hours of YouTube videos) can help action recognition performance."

The desired patches need to satisfy two requirements: 1) to be representative, they need to occur frequently enough in the visual world; 2) to be discriminative, they need to be different enough from the rest of the visual world. The patches could correspond to parts, objects, \"visual phrases\", etc. but are not restricted to be any one of them. We pose this as an unsupervised discriminative clustering problem on a huge dataset of image patches. We use an iterative procedure which alternates between clustering and training discriminative classifiers, while applying careful cross-validation at each step to prevent overfitting. The paper experimentally demonstrates the effectiveness of discriminative patches as an unsupervised mid-level visual representation, suggesting that it could be used in place of visual words for many tasks. Furthermore, discriminative patches can also be used in a supervised regime, such as scene classification, where they demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on the MIT Indoor-67 dataset."

In this paper, we propose using unsupervised feature learning as a way to learn features directly from video data. More specifically, we present an extension of the Independent Subspace Analysis algorithm to learn invariant spatio-temporal features from unlabeled video data. We discovered that, despite its simplicity, this method performs surprisingly well when combined with deep learning techniques such as stacking and convolution to learn hierarchical representations. By replacing hand-designed features with our learned features, we achieve classification results superior to all previous published results on the Hollywood2, UCF, KTH and YouTube action recognition datasets. On the challenging Hollywood2 and YouTube action datasets we obtain 53.3% and 75.8% respectively, which are approximately 5% better than the current best published results. Further benefits of this method, such as the ease of training and the efficiency of training and prediction, will also be discussed.

The principal benefit of our method is that it can be applied without human intervention to a particular application or data set, learning the specific invariances necessary for excellent feature performance on that data. Our algorithm relies on the ability to track image patches over time using optical flow. With the wide availability of high frame rate video (eg: on the web, from a robot), good tracking is straightforward to achieve. The algorithm then optimizes feature parameters such that patches corresponding to the same physical location have feature descriptors that are as similar as possible while simultaneously maximizing the distinctness of descriptors for different locations. Thus, our method captures data or application specific invariances yet does not require any manual supervision. We apply our algorithm to learn domain-optimized versions of SIFT and HOG. SIFT and HOG features are excellent and widely used. However, they are general and by definition not tailored to a specific domain. Our domain-optimized versions offer a substantial performance increase for classification and correspondence tasks we consider. Furthermore, we show that the features our method learns are near the optimal that would be achieved by directly optimizing the test set performance of a classifier. Finally, we demonstrate that the learning often allows fewer features to be used for some tasks, which has the potential to dramatically improve computational concerns for very large data sets."

The challenge is to capture the complementary information on appearance from still frames and motion between frames. We also aim to generalise the best performing hand-crafted features within a data-driven learning framework. \n \nOur contribution is three-fold. First, we propose a two-stream ConvNet architecture which incorporates spatial and temporal networks. Second, we demonstrate that a ConvNet trained on multi-frame dense optical flow is able to achieve very good performance in spite of limited training data. Finally, we show that multitask learning, applied to two different action classification datasets, can be used to increase the amount of training data and improve the performance on both. Our architecture is trained and evaluated on the standard video actions benchmarks of UCF-101 and HMDB-51, where it is competitive with the state of the art. It also exceeds by a large margin previous attempts to use deep nets for video classification."

Learning of such higher order features, however, has been much more difficult than standard dictionary learning, because of the high dimensionality and because standard learning criteria are not applicable. Here, we show how one can cast the problem of learning higher-order features as the problem of learning a parametric family of manifolds. This allows us to apply a variant of a de-noising autoencoder network to learn higher-order features using simple gradient based optimization. Our experiments show that the approach can outperform existing higher-order models, while training and inference are exact, fast, and simple."

The model is composed of two stages of processing: an early feature representation layer and a second layer in which invariances are explicitly represented. Invariances are learned as the result of factoring apart the temporally stable and dynamic components embedded in the early feature representation. The structure contained in these components is made explicit in the activities of second-layer units that capture invariances in both form and motion. When trained on natural movies, the first layer produces a factorization, or separation, of image content into a temporally persistent part representing local edge structure and a dynamic part representing local motion structure, consistent with known response properties in early visual cortex (area V1). This factorization linearizes statistical dependencies among the first-layer units, making them learnable by the second layer. The second-layer units are split into two populations according to the factorization in the first layer. The form-selective units receive their input from the temporally persistent part (local edge structure) and after training result in a diverse set of higher-order shape features consisting of extended contours, multiscale edges, textures, and texture boundaries. The motion-selective units receive their input from the dynamic part (local motion structure) and after training result in a representation of image translation over different spatial scales and directions, in addition to more complex deformations. These representations provide a rich description of dynamic natural images and testable hypotheses regarding intermediate-level representation in visual cortex."

Encouraged by these results, we provide an extensive empirical evaluation of CNNs on large-scale video classification using a new dataset of 1 million YouTube videos belonging to 487 classes. We study multiple approaches for extending the connectivity of a CNN in time domain to take advantage of local spatio-temporal information and suggest a multiresolution, foveated architecture as a promising way of speeding up the training. Our best spatio-temporal networks display significant performance improvements compared to strong feature-based baselines (55.3% to 63.9%), but only a surprisingly modest improvement compared to single-frame models (59.3% to 60.9%). We further study the generalization performance of our best model by retraining the top layers on the UCF-101 Action Recognition dataset and observe significant performance improvements compared to the UCF-101 baseline model (63.3% up from 43.9%)."

A local learning rule is proposed, which allows a network to learn to generalize across such transformations. During the learning phase, the network is exposed to temporal sequences of patterns undergoing the transformation. An application of the algorithm is presented in which the network learns invariance to shift in retinal position. Such a principle may be involved in the development of the characteristic shift invariance property of complex cells in the primary visual cortex, and also in the development of more complicated invariance properties of neurons in higher visual areas."

Most current methods build classifiers based on complex handcrafted features computed from the raw inputs. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are a type of deep model that can act directly on the raw inputs. However, such models are currently limited to handling 2D inputs. In this paper, we develop a novel 3D CNN model for action recognition. This model extracts features from both the spatial and the temporal dimensions by performing 3D convolutions, thereby capturing the motion information encoded in multiple adjacent frames. The developed model generates multiple channels of information from the input frames, and the final feature representation combines information from all channels. To further boost the performance, we propose regularizing the outputs with high-level features and combining the predictions of a variety of different models. We apply the developed models to recognize human actions in the real-world environment of airport surveillance videos, and they achieve superior performance in comparison to baseline methods."

One approach to understanding such response properties of visual neurons has been to consider their relationship to the statistical structure of natural images in terms of efficient coding7\u201312. Along these lines, a number of studies have attempted to train unsupervised learning algorithms on natural images in the hope of developing receptive fields with similar properties13\u201318, but none has succeeded in producing a full set that spans the image space and contains all three of the above properties. Here we investigate the proposal8,12 that a coding strategy that maximizes sparseness is sufficient to account for these properties. We show that a learning algorithm that attempts to find sparse linear codes for natural scenes will develop a complete family of localized, oriented, bandpass receptive fields, similar to those found in the primary visual cortex. The resulting sparse image code provides a more efficient representation for later stages of processing because it possesses a higher degree of statistical independence among its outputs."

The computer vision community has tried to tackle various video analysis problems independently. As a consequence, even though some really good hand-crafted features have been proposed there is a lack of generic features for video analysis. On the other hand, the image domain has progressed rapidly by using features from deep convolutional networks. These deep features are proving to be generic and perform well on variety of image tasks. In this work we propose Convolution 3D (C3D) feature, a generic spatio-temporal feature obtained by training a deep 3-dimensional convolutional network on a large annotated video dataset comprising objects, scenes, actions, and other frequently occurring concepts. We show that by using spatio-temporal convolutions the trained features encapsulate appearance and motion cues and perform well on different video classification tasks. C3D has three main advantages. First, it is generic: achieving state-ofthe-art results on object recognition, scene classification, sport classification, and action similarity labeling in videos. Second, it is compact: obtaining better accuracy than best hand-crafted features and best deep image features with a lower dimensional feature descriptor. Third, it is efficient to compute: 91 times faster than current hand-crafted features, and two orders of magnitude faster than current deeplearning based video classification methods."

To achieve accurate activity forecasting, our approach models the effect of the physical environment on the choice of human actions. This is accomplished by the use of state-of-the-art semantic scene understanding combined with ideas from optimal control theory. Our unified model also integrates several other key elements of activity analysis, namely, destination forecasting, sequence smoothing and transfer learning. As proof-of-concept, we focus on the domain of trajectory-based activity analysis from visual input. Experimental results demonstrate that our model accurately predicts distributions over future actions of individuals. We show how the same techniques can improve the results of tracking algorithms by leveraging information about likely goals and trajectories."

Each half of the network \"sees\" one fragment of the object, and tries to produce as output a set of 4 parameters that have high mutual information with the 4 parameters output by the other half of the network. Given the ensemble of training patterns, the 4 parameters on which the two halves of the network can agree are the position, orientation, and size of the whole object, or some recoding of them. After training, the network can reject instances of other shapes by using the fact that the predictions made by its two halves disagree. If two competing networks are trained on an unlabelled mixture of images of two objects, they cluster the training cases on the basis of the objects' shapes, independently of the position, orientation, and size."

Accordingly, if a neuron codes for a physical parameter then its output should also change slowly, despite its rapidly fluctuating inputs. We demonstrate that a model neuron which adapts to make its output vary smoothly over time can learn to extract invariances implicit in its input. This learning consists of a linear combination of Hebbian and anti-Hebbian synaptic changes, operating simultaneously upon the same connection weights but at different time scales. This is shown to be sufficient for the unsupervised learning of simple spatio-temporal invariances."

This creates cubically many parameters, which form a three-dimensional interaction tensor. We describe a low-rank approximation to this interaction tensor that uses a sum of factors, each of which is a three-way outer product. This approximation allows efficient learning of transformations between larger image patches. Since each factor can be viewed as an image filter, the model as a whole learns optimal filter pairs for efficiently representing transformations. We demonstrate the learning of optimal filter pairs from various synthetic and real image sequences. We also show how learning about image transformations allows the model to perform a simple visual analogy task, and we show how a completely unsupervised network trained on transformations perceives multiple motions of transparent dot patterns in the same way as humans."

Early animal studies have identified learning mechanisms that are based on reward and punishment such that animals tend to avoid actions that lead to punishment whereas rewarded actions are reinforced. However, most algorithms for reward-based learning are only applicable if the dimensionality of the state-space is sufficiently small or its structure is sufficiently simple. Therefore, the question arises how the problem of learning on high-dimensional data is solved in the brain. In this article, we propose a biologically plausible generic two-stage learning system that can directly be applied to raw high-dimensional input streams. The system is composed of a hierarchical slow feature analysis (SFA) network for preprocessing and a simple neural network on top that is trained based on rewards. We demonstrate by computer simulations that this generic architecture is able to learn quite demanding reinforcement learning tasks on high-dimensional visual input streams in a time that is comparable to the time needed when an explicit highly informative low-dimensional state-space representation is given instead of the high-dimensional visual input. The learning speed of the proposed architecture in a task similar to the Morris water maze task is comparable to that found in experimental studies with rats. This study thus supports the hypothesis that slowness learning is one important unsupervised learning principle utilized in the brain to form efficient state representations for behavioral learning."

Slow feature analysis (SFA) is a new method for learning invariant or slowly varying features from a vectorial input signal. It is based on a nonlinear expansion of the input signal and application of principal component analysis to this expanded signal and its time derivative. It is guaranteed to find the optimal solution within a family of functions directly and can learn to extract a large number of decor-related features, which are ordered by their degree of invariance. SFA can be applied hierarchically to process high-dimensional input signals and extract complex features. SFA is applied first to complex cell tuning properties based on simple cell output, including disparity and motion. Then more complicated input-output functions are learned by repeated application of SFA. Finally, a hierarchical network of SFA modules is presented as a simple model of the visual system. The same unstructured network can learn translation, size, rotation, contrast, or, to a lesser degree, illumination invariance for one-dimensional objects, depending on only the training stimulus. Surprisingly, only a few training objects suffice to achieve good generalization to new objects. The generated representation is suitable for object recognition. Performance degrades if the network is trained to learn multiple invariances simultaneously."

We show how the external teacher can be replaced by internally derived teaching signals. These signals are generated by using the assumption that different parts of the perceptual input have common causes in the external world. Small modules that look at separate but related parts of the perceptual input discover these common causes by striving to produce outputs that agree with each other (Fig. la). The modules may look at different modalities (such as vision and touch), or the same modality at different times (for example, the consecutive two-dimensional views of a rotating three-dimensional object), or even spatially adjacent parts of the same image. Our simulations show that when our learning procedure is applied to adjacent patches of two-dimensional images, it allows a neural network that has no prior knowledge of the third dimension to discover depth in random dot stereograms of curved surfaces."

Similarly, when a human observes a short video, it is easy to decide if the event taking place in the video is normal or unexpected, even if the video depicts a an unfamiliar place for the viewer. This is in contrast with work in surveillance and outlier event detection, where the models rely on thousands of hours of video recorded at a single place in order to identify what constitutes an unusual event. In this work we present a simple method to identify videos with unusual events in a large collection of short video clips. The algorithm is inspired by recent approaches in computer vision that rely on large databases. In this work we show how, relying on large collections of videos, we can retrieve other videos similar to the query to build a simple model of the distribution of expected motions for the query. Consequently, the model can evaluate how unusual is the video as well as make event predictions. We show how a very simple retrieval model is able to provide reliable results."

One proposed feature extraction strategy is motivated by the observation that the meaning of sensory data, such as the identity of a moving visual object, is often more persistent than the activation of any single sensory receptor. This notion is embodied in the slow feature analysis (SFA) algorithm, which uses slowness as a heuristic by which to extract semantic information from multidimensional time series. Here, we develop a probabilistic interpretation of this algorithm, showing that inference and learning in the limiting case of a suitable probabilistic model yield exactly the results of SFA. Similar equivalences have proved useful in interpreting and extending comparable algorithms such as independent component analysis. For SFA, we use the equivalent probabilistic model as a conceptual springboard with which to motivate several novel extensions to the algorithm."

In this article, we show that the same principle of independence maximization can explain the emergence of phase- and shift-invariant features, similar to those found in complex cells. This new kind of emergence is obtained by maximizing the independence between norms of projections on linear subspaces (instead of the independence of simple linear filter outputs).

We found that these visualizations allow us to analyze object detection systems in new ways and gain new insight into the detector\u2019s failures. For example, when we visualize the features for high scoring false alarms, we discovered that, although they are clearly wrong in image space, they often look deceptively similar to true positives in feature space. This result suggests that many of these false alarms are caused by our choice of feature space, and supports that creating a better learning algorithm or building bigger datasets is unlikely to correct these errors without improving the features. By visualizing feature spaces, we can gain a more intuitive understanding of recognition systems."

However, the term `sparse' has been used in two different ways - firstly to describe codes in which few neurons are active at any time (`population sparseness'), and secondly to describe codes in which each neuron's lifetime response distribution has high kurtosis (`lifetime sparseness'). Although these ideas are related, they are not identical, and the most common measure of lifetime sparseness - the kurtosis of the lifetime response distributions of the neurons - provides no information about population sparseness. We have measured the population sparseness and lifetime kurtosis of several biologically inspired coding schemes. We used three measures of population sparseness (population kurtosis, Treves-Rolls sparseness and `activity sparseness'), and found them to be in close agreement with one another. However, we also measured the lifetime kurtosis of the cells in each code. We found that lifetime kurtosis is uncorrelated with population sparseness for the codes we used. Lifetime kurtosis is not, therefore, a useful measure of the population sparseness of a code. Moreover, the Gabor-like codes, which are often assumed to have high population sparseness (since they have high lifetime kurtosis), actually turned out to have rather low population sparseness. Surprisingly, principal components filters produced the codes with the highest population sparseness."

                "text": "The theory of reinforcement learning provides a normative account, deeply rooted in psychological and neuroscientific perspectives on animal behaviour, of how agents may optimize their control of an environment. To use reinforcement learning successfully in situations approaching real-world complexity, however, agents are confronted with a difficult task: they must derive efficient representations of the environment from high-dimensional sensory inputs, and use these to generalize past experience to new situations. Remarkably, humans and other animals seem to solve this problem through a harmonious combination of reinforcement learning and hierarchical sensory processing systems, the former evidenced by a wealth of neural data revealing notable parallels between the phasic signals emitted by dopaminergic neurons and temporal difference reinforcement learning algorithms. While reinforcement learning agents have achieved some successes in a variety of domains, their applicability has previously been limited to domains in which useful features can be handcrafted, or to domains with fully observed, low-dimensional state spaces. Here we use recent advances in training deep neural networks to develop a novel artificial agent, termed a deep Q-network, that can learn successful policies directly from high-dimensional sensory inputs using end-to-end reinforcement learning. We tested this agent on the challenging domain of classic Atari 2600 games. We demonstrate that the deep Q-network agent, receiving only the pixels and the game score as inputs, was able to surpass the performance of all previous algorithms and achieve a level comparable to that of a professional human games tester across a set of 49 games, using the same algorithm, network architecture and hyperparameters. This work bridges the divide between high-dimensional sensory inputs and actions, resulting in the first artificial agent that is capable of learning to excel at a diverse array of challenging tasks."

The motivation was to encode the transform and not the image that is being acted upon by the transform, so that motion can be separated from appearance. This model was applied in a convolutional way by Taylor et al. (2010). Memisevic (2011) proposed Gated Autoencoders which are same as GRBMs, except that the generative probabilistic model is replaced by an autoencoder with sparsity."

The major disadvantage of the TRBM is that exact inference is extremely hard, since even computing a Gibbs update for a single variable of the posterior is exponentially expensive. This difficulty has necessitated the use of a heuristic inference procedure, that nonetheless was accurate enough for successful learning. In this paper we introduce the Recurrent TRBM, which is a very slight modification of the TRBM for which exact inference is very easy and exact gradient learning is almost tractable. We demonstrate that the RTRBM is better than an analogous TRBM at generating motion capture and videos of bouncing balls."

Although DNNs work well whenever large labeled training sets are available, they cannot be used to map sequences to sequences. In this paper, we present a general end-to-end approach to sequence learning that makes minimal assumptions on the sequence structure. Our method uses a multilayered Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to map the input sequence to a vector of a fixed dimensionality, and then another deep LSTM to decode the target sequence from the vector. Our main result is that on an English to French translation task from the WMT-14 dataset, the translations produced by the LSTM achieve a BLEU score of 34.8 on the entire test set, where the LSTM's BLEU score was penalized on out-of-vocabulary words. Additionally, the LSTM did not have difficulty on long sentences. For comparison, a phrase-based SMT system achieves a BLEU score of 33.3 on the same dataset. When we used the LSTM to rerank the 1000 hypotheses produced by the aforementioned SMT system, its BLEU score increases to 36.5, which is close to the previous state of the art. The LSTM also learned sensible phrase and sentence representations that are sensitive to word order and are relatively invariant to the active and the passive voice. Finally, we found that reversing the order of the words in all source sentences (but not target sentences) improved the LSTM's performance markedly, because doing so introduced many short term dependencies between the source and the target sentence which made the optimization problem easier."

It is shown that even a single developing cell of a layered network exhibits a remarkable set of optimization properties that are closely related to issues in statistics, theoretical physics, adaptive signal processing, the formation of knowledge representation in artificial intelligence, and information theory. The network studied is based on the visual system. These results are used to infer an information-theoretic principle that can be applied to the network as a whole, rather than a single cell. The organizing principle proposed is that the network connections develop in such a way as to maximize the amount of information that is preserved when signals are transformed at each processing stage, subject to certain constraints. The operation of this principle is illustrated for some simple cases.<<ETX>>"

The neural network, which has 60 million parameters and 650,000 neurons, consists of five convolutional layers, some of which are followed by max-pooling layers, and three fully connected layers with a final 1000-way softmax. To make training faster, we used non-saturating neurons and a very efficient GPU implementation of the convolution operation. To reduce overfitting in the fully connected layers we employed a recently developed regularization method called \"dropout\" that proved to be very effective. We also entered a variant of this model in the ILSVRC-2012 competition and achieved a winning top-5 test error rate of 15.3%, compared to 26.2% achieved by the second-best entry."

The algorithm does not assume any knowledge of the input distributions, and is defined here for the zero-noise limit. Under these conditions, information maximization has extra properties not found in the linear case (Linsker 1989). The nonlinearities in the transfer function are able to pick up higher-order moments of the input distributions and perform something akin to true redundancy reduction between units in the output representation. This enables the network to separate statistically independent components in the inputs: a higher-order generalization of principal components analysis. We apply the network to the source separation (or cocktail party) problem, successfully separating unknown mixtures of up to 10 speakers. We also show that a variant on the network architecture is able to perform blind deconvolution (cancellation of unknown echoes and reverberation in a speech signal). Finally, we derive dependencies of information transfer on time delays. We suggest that information maximization provides a unifying framework for problems in \"blind\" signal processing."

In ICA, given an input x, we would like to transform it into an encoding y = Wx such that the components yj are as statistically independent as possible. The notion of independence has been quantified in numerous ways \u2013 correlation, kurtosis, \u201cnon-Gaussianity\u201d, differential entropy (negentropy), mutual information, etc. ICA has been used to solve the cocktail party problem. The motivation is that if we can obtain N signals that are as independent as possible, then they should correspond to the N speakers. Jutten and Herault (1991) proposed a neural network architecture to solve this problem."

The dependency is measured by the average mutual information (MI) of the outputs. The source signals and the mixing matrix are unknown except for the number of the sources. The Gram-Charlier expansion instead of the Edgeworth expansion is used in evaluating the MI. The natural gradient approach is used to minimize the MI. A novel activation function is proposed for the on-line learning algorithm which has an equivariant property and is easily implemented on a neural network like model. The validity of the new learning algorithm are verified by computer simulations."

According to this rule, changes in synaptic weight result from a conjunction of short-term temporal changes in the inputs and the output. Formally, This is like the differential rule proposed by Klopf (1986) and Kosko (1986), except for a change of sign, which gives it an anti-Hebbian character. By itself this rule is insufficient. A weight conservation condition is needed to prevent the weights from collapsing to zero, and some further constraintimplemented here by a biasing termto select particular sets of weights from the subspace of those which give minimal variation. As an example, I show that this rule will generate center-surround receptive fields that remove temporally varying linear gradients from the inputs."

By far the most common approach is to assume that the density has a parametric form. \n \nBy contrast we derive a differential learning rule called EMMA that optimizes entropy by way of kernel density estimation. Entropy and its derivative can then be calculated by sampling from this density estimate. The resulting parameter update rule is surprisingly simple and efficient. \n \nWe will show how EMMA can be used to detect and correct corruption in magnetic resonance images (MRI).

We present a new model, based on the CRBM that preserves its most important computational properties and includes multiplicative three-way interactions that allow the effective interaction weight between two units to be modulated by the dynamic state of a third unit. We factor the three-way weight tensor implied by the multiplicative model, reducing the number of parameters from O(N3) to O(N2). The result is an efficient, compact model whose effectiveness we demonstrate by modeling human motion. Like the CRBM, our model can capture diverse styles of motion with a single set of parameters, and the three-way interactions greatly improve the model's ability to blend motion styles or to transition smoothly among them."

The model is trained to decode the state at the last time step of the encoder using another LSTM to predict the future and/or reconstruct the input sequence back. Ranzato et al. (2014) also proposed a model that tries to predict future image patches."

We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O. 1. Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms."

The key point is to use estimates of directional vectors rather than resort to their hypothesised value. By using estimates of the directional vectors obtained via blind identification, i.e. without knowing the array manifold, beamforming is made robust with respect to array deformations, distortion of the wave front, pointing errors etc., so that neither array calibration nor physical modelling is necessary. Rather suprisingly, \u2018blind beamformers\u2019 may outperform \u2018informed beamformers\u2019 in a plausible range of parameters, even when the array is perfectly known to the informed beamformer. The key assumption on which blind identification relies is the statistical independence of the sources, which is exploited using fourth-order cumulants. A computationally efficient technique is presented for the blind estimation of directional vectors, based on joint diagonalisation of fourth-order cumulant matrices; its implementation is described, and its performance is investigated by numerical experiments."

The g\u2019s become non-linear but the non-linear part is fixed, not learned. This brings us to the main drawback of this approach which is that we need to engineer the non-linear projection to expose interesting features. It is not clear how to do this for a general input sequence. The SFA part is just applying an affine transformation to this engineered space to find the directions along which the data is changing the slowest. Arguably, most of the heavy lifting needs to be done by the non-linear projection. The situation is somewhat analogous to that faced in designing good kernel functions for use in Support Vector Machines. Another drawback, as mentioned by the authors, is that the computational complexity becomes prohibitive as size of the non-linear space (say, D) increases because we need to compute a covariance matrix of size D\u00d7D and apply PCA to it which takes O(D3) time. Moreover, this is a batch method which makes it hard to apply to very large datasets. Wiskott and Sejnowski (2002) also show how SFA modules can be stacked to create hierarchical networks."

However, surprisingly this paper revealed that it does not need to reduce the data rate for achieving that much of small errors. It proved that we can get some positive data rate that has the same small error probability and also there is an upper bound of the data rate, which means we cannot achieve the data rate with any encoding scheme that has small enough error probability over the upper bound."

Recently, there has been increasing interest in learning to infer correspondences from data using relational, spatiotemporal, and bilinear variants of deep learning methods. These methods use multiplicative interactions between pixels or between features to represent correlation patterns across multiple images. In this paper, we review the recent work on relational feature learning, and we provide an analysis of the role that multiplicative interactions play in learning to encode relations. We also discuss how square-pooling and complex cell models can be viewed as a way to represent multiplicative interactions and thereby as a way to encode relations."
