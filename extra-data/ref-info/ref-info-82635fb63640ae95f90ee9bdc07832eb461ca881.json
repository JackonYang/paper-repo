The model is scale and translation invariant. In the training phase, image regions that optimize an objective function are automatically located in the training images, without requiring any user annotation such as bounding boxes. The objective function measures visual similarity between training image pairs, using the spatial distribution of both appearance patches and edges. The optimization is initialized using discriminative features. The model enables the detection (localization) of multiple instances of the object class in test images, and can be used as a precursor to training other visual models that require bounding box annotation. The detection performance of the model is assessed on the PASCAL Visual Object Classes Challenge 2006 test set. For a number of object classes the performance far exceeds the current state of the art of fully supervised methods."

Four object classes were selected: motorbikes, bicycles, cars and people. Twelve teams entered the challenge. In this chapter we provide details of the datasets, algorithms used by the teams, evaluation criteria, and results achieved."

We use the semantics of image labels to integrate prior knowledge about inter-class relationships into the visual appearance learning. We show how to build and train a semantic hierarchy of discriminative classifiers and how to use it to perform object detection. We evaluate how our approach influences the classification accuracy and speed on the Pascal VOC challenge 2006 dataset, a set of challenging real-world images. We also demonstrate additional features that become available to object recognition due to the extension with semantic inference tools- we can classify high-level categories, such as animals, and we can train part detectors, for example a window detector, by pure inference in the semantic network."

The original Caltech-101 [1] was collected by choosing a set of object categories, downloading examples from Google Images and then manually screening out all images that did not fit the category. Caltech-256 is collected in a similar manner with several improvements: a) the number of categories is more than doubled, b) the minimum number of images in any category is increased from 31 to 80, c) artifacts due to image rotation are avoided and d) a new and larger clutter category is introduced for testing background rejection. We suggest several testing paradigms to measure classification performance, then benchmark the dataset using two simple metrics as well as a state-of-the-art spatial pyramid matching [2] algorithm. Finally we use the clutter category to train an interest detector which rejects uninformative background regions."

We took part in three of the image analysis competitions: image classification, object detection and object segmentation. In the classification task of the evaluation our method produced comparatively good performance, the 4th best of 19 submissions. In contrast, our detection results were quite modest. Our method's segmentation accuracy was the best of all submissions. Our approach for the classification task is based on fused classifications by numerous global image features, including histograms of local features. The object detection combines similar classification of automatically extracted image segments and the previously obtained scene type classifications. The object segmentations are obtained in a straightforward fashion from the detection results."

Traditional approaches require applying a battery of different classifiers to the image, at multiple locations and scales. This can be slow and can require a lot of training data since each classifier requires the computation of many different image features. In particular, for independently trained detectors, the (runtime) computational complexity and the (training-time) sample complexity scale linearly with the number of classes to be detected. We present a multitask learning procedure, based on boosted decision stumps, that reduces the computational and sample complexity by finding common features that can be shared across the classes (and/or views). The detectors for each class are trained jointly, rather than independently. For a given performance level, the total number of features required and, therefore, the runtime cost of the classifier, is observed to scale approximately logarithmically with the number of classes. The features selected by joint training are generic edge-like features, whereas the features chosen by training each class separately tend to be more object-specific. The generic features generalize better and considerably reduce the computational cost of multiclass object detection"

The approach is capable of learning a compact and low dimensional representation for multiple visual categories from multiple view points without labeling of the training instances. The learnt object components range from local structures over line segments to global silhouette-like descriptions. This representation can be used to discover object categories in a totally unsupervised fashion. Furthermore we employ the representation as the basis for building a supervised multi-category detection system making efficient use of training examples and out-performing pure features-based representations. The proposed speed-ups make the system scale to large databases. Experiments on three databases show that the approach improves the state-of-the-art in unsupervised learning as well as supervised detection. In particular we improve the state-of-the-art on the challenging PASCALpsila06 multi-class detection tasks for several categories."

The idea is to characterize a signal with a gradient vector derived from a generative probability model and to subsequently feed this representation to a discriminative classifier. We propose to apply this framework to image categorization where the input signals are images and where the underlying generative model is a visual vocabulary: a Gaussian mixture model which approximates the distribution of low-level features in images. We show that Fisher kernels can actually be understood as an extension of the popular bag-of-visterms. Our approach demonstrates excellent performance on two challenging databases: an in-house database of 19 object/scene categories and the recently released VOC 2006 database. It is also very practical: it has low computational needs both at training and test time and vocabularies trained on one set of categories can be applied to another set without any significant loss in performance."

Following a common consensus in the field, we do not assume that a figure- ground segmentation is available prior to recognition. However, in contrast to most standard approaches for object class recognition, our approach automati- cally segments the object as a result of the categorization. This combination of recognition and segmentation into one process is made pos- sible by our use of an Implicit Shape Model, which integrates both into a common probabilistic framework. In addition to the recognition and segmentation result, it also generates a per-pixel confidence measure specifying the area that supports a hypothesis and how much it can be trusted. We use this confidence to derive a nat- ural extension of the approach to handle multiple objects in a scene and resolve ambiguities between overlapping hypotheses with a novel MDL-based criterion. In addition, we present an extensive evaluation of our method on a standard dataset for car detection and compare its performance to existing methods from the literature. Our results show that the proposed method significantly outper- forms previously published methods while needing one order of magnitude less training examples. Finally, we present results for articulated objects, which show that the proposed method can categorize and segment unfamiliar objects in differ- ent articulations and with widely varying texture patterns, even under significant partial occlusion."

Given a set of images known to contain the target category from a similar viewpoint, learning is translation and scale-invariant; does not require alignment or correspondence between the training images, and is robust to clutter and occlusion. Category models are probabilistic constellations of parts, and their parameters are estimated by maximizing the likelihood of the training data. The appearance of the parts, as well as their mutual position, relative scale and probability of detection are explicitly described in the model. Recognition takes place in two stages. First, a feature-finder identifies promising locations for the model\u201ds parts. Second, the category model is used to compare the likelihood that the observed features are generated by the category model, or are generated by background clutter. The flexible nature of the model is demonstrated by results over six diverse object categories including geometrically constrained categories (e.g. faces, cars) and flexible objects (such as animals)."

This paper presents a large-scale evaluation of an approach that represents images as distributions (signatures or histograms) of features extracted from a sparse set of keypoint locations and learns a Support Vector Machine classifier with kernels based on two effective measures for comparing distributions, the Earth Mover\u2019s Distance and the \u03c72 distance. We first evaluate the performance of our approach with different keypoint detectors and descriptors, as well as different kernels and classifiers. We then conduct a comparative evaluation with several state-of-the-art recognition methods on four texture and five object databases. On most of these databases, our implementation exceeds the best reported results and achieves comparable performance on the rest. Finally, we investigate the influence of background correlations on recognition performance via extensive tests on the PASCAL database, for which ground-truth object localization information is available. Our experiments demonstrate that image representations based on distributions of local features are surprisingly effective for classification of texture and object images under challenging real-world conditions, including significant intra-class variations and substantial background clutter."

Such data is useful for supervised learning and quantitative evaluation. To achieve this, we developed a web-based tool that allows easy image annotation and instant sharing of such annotations. Using this annotation tool, we have collected a large dataset that spans many object categories, often containing multiple instances over a wide variety of images. We quantify the contents of the dataset and compare against existing state of the art datasets used for object recognition and detection. Also, we show how to extend the dataset to automatically enhance object labels with WordNet, discover object parts, recover a depth ordering of objects in a scene, and increase the number of labels using minimal user supervision and images from the web.\n"

The learned model is used for automatic visual recognition and semantic segmentation of photographs. Our discriminative model exploits novel features, based on textons, which jointly model shape and texture. Unary classification and feature selection is achieved using shared boosting to give an efficient classifier which can be applied to a large number of classes. Accurate image segmentation is achieved by incorporating these classifiers in a conditional random field. Efficient training of the model on very large datasets is achieved by exploiting both random feature selection and piecewise training methods. \n \nHigh classification and segmentation accuracy are demonstrated on three different databases: i) our own 21-object class database of photographs of real objects viewed under general lighting conditions, poses and viewpoints, ii) the 7-class Corel subset and iii) the 7-class Sowerby database used in [1]. The proposed algorithm gives competitive results both for highly textured (e.g. grass, trees), highly structured (e.g. cars, faces, bikes, aeroplanes) and articulated objects (e.g. body, cow)."

This bag of keypoints method is based on vector quantization of affine invariant descriptors of image patches. We propose and compare two alternative implementations using different classifiers: Naive Bayes and SVM. The main advantages of the method are that it is simple, computationally efficient and intrinsically invariant. We present results for simultaneously classifying seven semantic visual categories. These results clearly demonstrate that the method is robust to background clutter and produces good categorization accuracy even without exploiting geometric information."

To perform localization, one can take a sliding window approach, but this strongly increases the computational cost, because the classifier function has to be evaluated over a large set of candidate subwindows. In this paper, we propose a simple yet powerful branch-and-bound scheme that allows efficient maximization of a large class of classifier functions over all possible subimages. It converges to a globally optimal solution typically in sublinear time. We show how our method is applicable to different object detection and retrieval scenarios. The achieved speedup allows the use of classifiers for localization that formerly were considered too slow for this task, such as SVMs with a spatial pyramid kernel or nearest neighbor classifiers based on the chi2-distance. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of the resulting systems on the UIUC Cars dataset, the PASCAL VOC 2006 dataset and in the PASCAL VOC 2007 competition."

We show that it is possible to learn much information about a category from just one, or a handful, of images. The key insight is that, rather than learning from scratch, one can take advantage of knowledge coming from previously learned categories, no matter how different these categories might be. We explore a Bayesian implementation of this idea. Object categories are represented by probabilistic models. Prior knowledge is represented as a probability density function on the parameters of these models. The posterior model for an object category is obtained by updating the prior in the light of one or more observations. We test a simple implementation of our algorithm on a database of 101 diverse object categories. We compare category models learned by an implementation of our Bayesian approach to models learned from by maximum likelihood (ML) and maximum a posteriori (MAP) methods. We find that on a database of more than 100 categories, the Bayesian approach produces informative models when the number of training examples is too small for other methods to operate successfully."

The detector uses a cascade that unites the handling of similar object classes while separating off classes at appropriate levels of the cascade. No prior knowledge about the relationship between classes is needed as the classifier structure is automatically determined during the training phase. The detection nodes in the cascade use Haar wavelet features and Gentle AdaBoost, however the approach is not dependent on the specific features used and can easily be extended to other cases. Experiments are presented for several numbers of object classes and the approach is compared to other classifying schemes. The results demonstrate a large efficiency gain that is particularly prominent for a greater number of classes. Also the complexity of the training scales well with the number of classes."

Firstly, an all-in-all labeling framework is proposed to group visual knowledge of three levels: scene level (global geometric description), object level (segmentation, sketch representation, hierarchical decomposition), and low-mid level (2.1D layered representation, object boundary attributes, curve completion, etc.). Much of this data has not appeared in previous databases. In addition, And-Or Graph is used to organize visual elements to facilitate top-down labeling. An annotation tool is developed to realize and integrate all tasks. With this tool, we've been able to create a database consisting of more than 636,748 annotated images and video frames. Lastly, the data is organized into 13 common subsets to serve as benchmarks for diverse evaluation endeavors."

A complex scene is described by proto-concepts like vegetation, water, fire, sky etc. These proto-concepts are represented by low level features, where we use natural images statistics to compactly represent color invariant texture information by a Weibull distribution. We introduce the notion of contextures which preserve the context of textures in a visual scene with an occurrence histogram (context) of similarities to proto-concept descriptors (texture). In contrast to a codebook approach, we use the similarity to all vocabulary elements to generalize beyond the code words. Visual descriptors are attained by combining different types of contexts with different texture parameters. The visual scene descriptors are generalized to visual categories by training a support vector machine. We evaluate our approach on 3 different datasets: 1) 50 categories for the TRECVID video dataset; 2) the Caltech 101-object images; 3) 89 categories being the intersection of the Corel photo stock with the Art Explosion photo stock. Results show that our approach is robust over different datasets, while maintaining competitive performance."

After reviewing existing edge and gradient based descriptors, we show experimentally that grids of histograms of oriented gradient (HOG) descriptors significantly outperform existing feature sets for human detection. We study the influence of each stage of the computation on performance, concluding that fine-scale gradients, fine orientation binning, relatively coarse spatial binning, and high-quality local contrast normalization in overlapping descriptor blocks are all important for good results. The new approach gives near-perfect separation on the original MIT pedestrian database, so we introduce a more challenging dataset containing over 1800 annotated human images with a large range of pose variations and backgrounds."

There are three key contributions. The first is the introduction of a new image representation called the \u201cIntegral Image\u201d which allows the features used by our detector to be computed very quickly. The second is a simple and efficient classifier which is built using the AdaBoost learning algorithm (Freund and Schapire, 1995) to select a small number of critical visual features from a very large set of potential features. The third contribution is a method for combining classifiers in a \u201ccascade\u201d which allows background regions of the image to be quickly discarded while spending more computation on promising face-like regions. A set of experiments in the domain of face detection is presented. The system yields face detection performance comparable to the best previous systems (Sung and Poggio, 1998; Rowley et al., 1998; Schneiderman and Kanade, 2000; Roth et al., 2000). Implemented on a conventional desktop, face detection proceeds at 15 frames per second."

This technique works by partitioning the image into increasingly fine sub-regions and computing histograms of local features found inside each sub-region. The resulting \"spatial pyramid\" is a simple and computationally efficient extension of an orderless bag-of-features image representation, and it shows significantly improved performance on challenging scene categorization tasks. Specifically, our proposed method exceeds the state of the art on the Caltech-101 database and achieves high accuracy on a large database of fifteen natural scene categories. The spatial pyramid framework also offers insights into the success of several recently proposed image descriptions, including Torralba\u2019s \"gist\" and Lowe\u2019s SIFT descriptors."

In recent years, \u201cnatural\u201d images have become popular in the study of vision and have been used to show apparently impressive progress in building such models. Here, we challenge the use of uncontrolled \u201cnatural\u201d images in guiding that progress. In particular, we show that a simple V1-like model\u2014a neuroscientist's \u201cnull\u201d model, which should perform poorly at real-world visual object recognition tasks\u2014outperforms state-of-the-art object recognition systems (biologically inspired and otherwise) on a standard, ostensibly natural image recognition test. As a counterpoint, we designed a \u201csimpler\u201d recognition test to better span the real-world variation in object pose, position, and scale, and we show that this test correctly exposes the inadequacy of the V1-like model. Taken together, these results demonstrate that tests based on uncontrolled natural images can be seriously misleading, potentially guiding progress in the wrong direction. Instead, we reexamine what it means for images to be natural and argue for a renewed focus on the core problem of object recognition\u2014real-world image variation."

In this paper, we take recognition one step further by developing features for non-planar objects. We consider the description of objects with locally smoothly varying surface. For this class of objects, colour invariant histogram matching has proven to be very encouraging. However, matching many local colour cubes is computationally demanding. We propose a compact colour descriptor, which we call Wiccest, requiring only 12 numbers to locally capture colour and texture information. The Wiccest features are shown to be fairly insensitive to photometric effects like shadow, shading, and illumination colour. Moreover, we demonstrate the features to be applicable to highly compressed images while retaining discriminative power."

The object is represented by a set of viewpoint invariant region descriptors so that recognition can proceed successfully despite changes in viewpoint, illumination and partial occlusion. The temporal continuity of the video within a shot is used to track the regions in order to reject unstable regions and reduce the effects of noise in the descriptors. The analogy with text retrieval is in the implementation where matches on descriptors are pre-computed (using vector quantization), and inverted file systems and document rankings are used. The result is that retrieved is immediate, returning a ranked list of key frames/shots in the manner of Google. The method is illustrated for matching in two full length feature films."

To be more concrete, we aim at finding a good match function for the problem of object/scene categorization which considers the spatial constraints against heavy clutter and occlusion. Our solution is a partial match kernel under the histogram representation which varies simultaneously at both the feature and spatial resolutions, named as the Feature and Spatial Covariant (FESCO) kernel. Both the FESCO kernel and its late fusion alternative achieve better match accuracy than Spatial Pyramid Match [13] and Pyramid Match [11]. We also apply the keypoint features to video indexing. And on a large scale TRECVID data sets of over 300 hours videos, to our best knowledge, this approach achieves the state-of-the-art result for a single feature."

Our system achieves a two-fold improvement in average precision over the best performance in the 2006 PASCAL person detection challenge. It also outperforms the best results in the 2007 challenge in ten out of twenty categories. The system relies heavily on deformable parts. While deformable part models have become quite popular, their value had not been demonstrated on difficult benchmarks such as the PASCAL challenge. Our system also relies heavily on new methods for discriminative training. We combine a margin-sensitive approach for data mining hard negative examples with a formalism we call latent SVM. A latent SVM, like a hidden CRF, leads to a non-convex training problem. However, a latent SVM is semi-convex and the training problem becomes convex once latent information is specified for the positive examples. We believe that our training methods will eventually make possible the effective use of more latent information such as hierarchical (grammar) models and models involving latent three dimensional pose."

Our approach couples topic models originally developed for text analysis with spatial transformations, and thus consistently accounts for geometric constraints. By building integrated scene models, we may discover contextual relationships, and better exploit partially labeled training images. We first consider images of isolated objects, and show that sharing parts among object categories improves detection accuracy when learning from few examples. Turning to multiple object scenes, we propose nonparametric models which use Dirichlet processes to automatically learn the number of parts underlying each object category, and objects composing each scene. The resulting transformed Dirichlet process (TDP) leads to Monte Carlo algorithms which simultaneously segment and recognize objects in street and office scenes.\n"

Kernel-based classification methods can learn complex decision boundaries, but a kernel over unordered set inputs must somehow solve for correspondences epsivnerally a computationally expensive task that becomes impractical for large set sizes. We present a new fast kernel function which maps unordered feature sets to multi-resolution histograms and computes a weighted histogram intersection in this space. This \"pyramid match\" computation is linear in the number of features, and it implicitly finds correspondences based on the finest resolution histogram cell where a matched pair first appears. Since the kernel does not penalize the presence of extra features, it is robust to clutter. We show the kernel function is positive-definite, making it valid for use in learning algorithms whose optimal solutions are guaranteed only for Mercer kernels. We demonstrate our algorithm on object recognition tasks and show it to be accurate and dramatically faster than current approaches"

Firstly, images are segmented into regions, which are classified into region types using a variety of features. A mapping between region types and keywords supplied with the images, is then learned, using a method based around EM. This process is analogous with learning a lexicon from an aligned bitext. For the implementation we describe, these words are nouns taken from a large vocabulary. On a large test set, the method can predict numerous words with high accuracy. Simple methods identify words that cannot be predicted well. We show how to cluster words that individually are difficult to predict into clusters that can be predicted well -- for example, we cannot predict the distinction between train and locomotive using the current set of features, but we can predict the underlying concept. The method is trained on a substantial collection of images. Extensive experimental results illustrate the strengths and weaknesses of the approach."

Moreover, they offer an attractive compromise between information content and repeatability and encompass a wide variety of local shape structures. We also define a translation and scale invariant descriptor encoding the geometric configuration of the segments within a kAS, making kAS easy to reuse in other frameworks, for example, as a replacement or addition to interest points (IPs). Software for detecting and describing kAS is released at http://lear.inrialpes.fr/software. We demonstrate the high performance of kAS within a simple but powerful sliding-window object detection scheme. Through extensive evaluations, involving eight diverse object classes and more than 1,400 images, we (1) study the evolution of performance as the degree of feature complexity k varies and determine the best degree, (2) show that kAS substantially outperform IPs for detecting shape-based classes, and (3) compare our object detector to the recent state-of-the-art system by Dalal and Triggs (2005)."

In this paper, we provide a framework for placing local object detection in the context of the overall 3D scene by modeling the interdependence of objects, surface orientations, and camera viewpoint. Most object detection methods consider all scales and locations in the image as equally likely. We show that with probabilistic estimates of 3D geometry, both in terms of surfaces and world coordinates, we can put objects into perspective and model the scale and location variance in the image. Our approach reflects the cyclical nature of the problem by allowing probabilistic object hypotheses to refine geometry and vice-versa. Our framework allows painless substitution of almost any object detector and is easily extended to include other aspects of image understanding. Our results confirm the benefits of our integrated approach."

To arrive at a challenge problem, we provide a general scheme for the systematic examination of automated concept detection methods, by decomposing the generic video indexing problem into 2 unimodal analysis experiments, 2 multimodal analysis experiments, and 1 combined analysis experiment. For each experiment, we evaluate generic video indexing performance on 85 hours of international broadcast news data, from the TRECVID 2005/2006 benchmark, using a lexicon of 101 semantic concepts. By establishing a minimum performance on each experiment, the challenge problem allows for component-based optimization of the generic indexing issue, while simultaneously offering other researchers a reference for comparison during indexing methodology development. To stimulate further investigations in intermediate analysis steps that inuence video indexing performance, the challenge offers to the research community a manually annotated concept lexicon, pre-computed low-level multimedia features, trained classifier models, and five experiments together with baseline performance, which are all available at http://www.mediamill.nl/challenge/."

While a large number of algorithms for stereo correspondence have been developed, relatively little work has been done on characterizing their performance. In this paper, we present a taxonomy of dense, two-frame stereo methods. Our taxonomy is designed to assess the different components and design decisions made in individual stereo algorithms. Using this taxonomy, we compare existing stereo methods and present experiments evaluating the performance of many different variants. In order to establish a common software platform and a collection of data sets for easy evaluation, we have designed a stand-alone, flexible C++ implementation that enables the evaluation of individual components and that can easily be extended to include new algorithms. We have also produced several new multi-frame stereo data sets with ground truth and are making both the code and data sets available on the Web. Finally, we include a comparative evaluation of a large set of today's best-performing stereo algorithms."

Finding salient locations in image data is crucial for these tasks. Observing that most current methods use only the luminance information of the images, we investigate the use of colour information in interest point detection. A way to use multi-channel information in the Harris corner detector is explored and different colour spaces are evaluated. To determine the characteristic scale of an interest point, a new colour scale selection method is presented. We show that using colour information and boosting salient colours results in improved performance in retrieval tasks."

We propose a definition of importance and show how this may be estimated reliably from data harvested from human observers.

TRECVid completed its fifth annual cycle at the end of 2005 and in 2006 TRECVid will involve almost 70 research organizations, universities and other consortia. Throughout its existence, TRECVid has benchmarked both interactive and automatic/manual searching for shots from within a video corpus,automatic detection of a variety of semantic and low-level video features, shot boundary detection and the detection of story boundaries in broadcast TV news. This paper will give an introduction to information retrieval (IR) evaluation from both a user and a system perspective, high-lighting that system evaluation is by far the most prevalent type of evaluation carried out. We also include a summary of TRECVid as an example of a system evaluation bench-marking campaign and this allows us to discuss whether such campaigns are a good thing or a bad thing. There are arguments for and against these campaigns and we present some of them in the paper concluding that on balance they have had a very positive impact on research progress."

The description of color is hampered by the large amount of variations which causes the measured color values to vary significantly. In this paper we aim to extend the description of local features with color information. To accomplish a wide applicability of the color descriptor, it should be robust to: 1. photometric changes commonly encountered in the real world, 2. varying image quality; from high quality images to snap-shot photo quality and compressed internet images. Based on these requirements we derive a set of color descriptors. The set of proposed descriptors are compared by extensive testing on multiple applications areas, namely, matching, retrieval and classification, and on a wide variety of image qualities. The results show that color descriptors remain reliable under photometric and geometrical changes, and with decreasing image quality. For all experiments a combination of color and shape outperforms a pure shape-based approach."

Our method is based on higher order conditional random fields and uses potentials defined on sets of pixels (image segments) generated using unsupervised segmentation algorithms. These potentials enforce label consistency in image regions and can be seen as a generalization of the commonly used pairwise contrast sensitive smoothness potentials. The higher order potential functions used in our framework take the form of the Robust Pn model and are more general than the Pn Potts model recently proposed by Kohli et al. We prove that the optimal swap and expansion moves for energy functions composed of these potentials can be computed by solving a st-mincut problem. This enables the use of powerful graph cut based move making algorithms for performing inference in the framework. We test our method on the problem of multi-class object segmentation by augmenting the conventional crf used for object segmentation with higher order potentials defined on image regions. Experiments on challenging data sets show that integration of higher order potentials quantitatively and qualitatively improves results leading to much better definition of object boundaries. We believe that this method can be used to yield similar improvements for many other labelling problems."

This article reviews the current practice and then theoretically and empirically examines several suitable tests. Based on that, we recommend a set of simple, yet safe and robust non-parametric tests for statistical comparisons of classifiers: the Wilcoxon signed ranks test for comparison of two classifiers and the Friedman test with the corresponding post-hoc tests for comparison of more classifiers over multiple data sets. Results of the latter can also be neatly presented with the newly introduced CD (critical difference) diagrams."

When people play the game they help determine the contents of images by providing meaningful labels for them. If the game is played as much as popular online games, we estimate that most images on the Web can be labeled in a few months. Having proper labels associated with each image on the Web would allow for more accurate image search, improve the accessibility of sites (by providing descriptions of images to visually impaired individuals), and help users block inappropriate images. Our system makes a significant contribution because of its valuable output and because of the way it addresses the image-labeling problem. Rather than using computer vision techniques, which don't work well enough, we encourage people to do the work by taking advantage of their desire to be entertained."

Buckley and Voorhees recently demonstrated that retrieval systems can be efficiently and effectively evaluated using incomplete judgments via the bpref measure [6]. When relevance judgments are complete, the value of bpref is an approximation to the value of average precision using complete judgments. However, when relevance judgments are incomplete, the value of bpref deviates from this value, though it continues to rank systems in a manner similar to average precision evaluated with a complete judgment set. In this work, we propose three evaluation measures that (1) are approximations to average precision even when the relevance judgments are incomplete and (2) are more robust to incomplete or imperfect relevance judgments than bpref. The proposed estimates of average precision are simple and accurate, and we demonstrate the utility of these estimates using TREC data."

A Relay Boost (RL.Boost) algorithm is proposed to solve this imbalanced data problem by fusing multiple features extracted from the multimedia data. As a modified RankBoost algorithm, RL.Boost directly minimizes the ranking loss, rather than the classification error. RL.Boost also iteratively samples positive/negative pairs for a more balanced data set to get diverse weak ranking with different features, and combines them in a ranking ensemble. Experiments on the standard TRECVID 2005 benchmark data set show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm."

The first approach is based on global hierarchical colour histograms, using Locality Sensitive Hashing for fast retrieval. The second approach uses local feature descriptors (SIFT) and for retrieval exploits techniques used in the information retrieval community to compute approximate set intersections between documents using a min-Hash algorithm.\n The requirements for near-duplicate images vary according to the application, and we address two types of near duplicate definition: (i) being perceptually identical (e.g. up to noise, discretization effects, small photometric distortions etc); and (ii) being images of the same 3D scene (so allowing for viewpoint changes and partial occlusion). We define two shots to be near-duplicates if they share a large percentage of near-duplicate frames.\n We focus primarily on scalability to very large image and video databases, where fast query processing is necessary. Both methods are designed so that only a small amount of data need be stored for each image. In the case of near-duplicate shot detection it is shown that a weak approximation to histogram matching, consuming substantially less storage, is sufficient for good results. We demonstrate our methods on the TRECVID 2006 data set which contains approximately 165 hours of video (about 17.8M frames with 146K key frames), and also on feature films and pop videos."

At some point in the analysis these streams need to be fused. In this paper, we consider two classes of fusion schemes, namely early fusion and late fusion. The former fuses modalities in feature space, the latter fuses modalities in semantic space. We show by experiment on 184 hours of broadcast video data and for 20 semantic concepts, that late fusion tends to give slightly better performance for most concepts. However, for those concepts where early fusion performs better the difference is more significant."
