This mainly arises from that the representation of pixel-level image usually lacks of high-level semantic information as in its matched sentence. In this work, we propose a semantic-enhanced image and sentence matching model, which can improve the image representation by learning semantic concepts and then organizing them in a correct semantic order. Given an image, we first use a multi-regional multi-label CNN to predict its semantic concepts, including objects, properties, actions, etc. Then, considering that different orders of semantic concepts lead to diverse semantic meanings, we use a context-gated sentence generation scheme for semantic order learning. It simultaneously uses the image global context containing concept relations as reference and the groundtruth semantic order in the matched sentence as supervision. After obtaining the improved image representation, we learn the sentence representation with a conventional LSTM, and then jointly perform image and sentence matching and sentence generation for model learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our learned semantic concepts and order, by achieving the state-of-the-art results on two public benchmark datasets."

Inferring the latent semantic alignment between objects or other salient stuffs (e.g. snow, sky, lawn) and the corresponding words in sentences allows to capture fine-grained interplay between vision and language, and makes image-text matching more interpretable. Prior works either simply aggregate the similarity of all possible pairs of regions and words without attending differentially to more and less important words or regions, or use a multi-step attentional process to capture limited number of semantic alignments which is less interpretable. In this paper, we present Stacked Cross Attention to discover the full latent alignments using both image regions and words in sentence as context and infer the image-text similarity. Our approach achieves the state-of-the-art results on the MS-COCO and Flickr30K datasets. On Flickr30K, our approach outperforms the current best methods by 22.1% in text retrieval from image query, and 18.2% in image retrieval with text query (based on Recall@1). On MS-COCO, our approach improves sentence retrieval by 17.8% and image retrieval by 16.6% (based on Recall@1 using the 5K test set)."

These tasks include image-sentence matching, i.e., given an image query, retrieving relevant sentences and vice versa, and region-phrase matching or visual grounding, i.e., matching a phrase to relevant regions. This paper investigates two-branch neural networks for learning the similarity between these two data modalities. We propose two network structures that produce different output representations. The first one, referred to as an embedding network, learns an explicit shared latent embedding space with a maximum-margin ranking loss and novel neighborhood constraints. Compared to standard triplet sampling, we perform improved neighborhood sampling that takes neighborhood information into consideration while constructing mini-batches. The second network structure, referred to as a similarity network, fuses the two branches via element-wise product and is trained with regression loss to directly predict a similarity score. Extensive experiments show that our networks achieve high accuracies for phrase localization on the Flickr30K Entities dataset and for bi-directional image-sentence retrieval on Flickr30K and MSCOCO datasets."

Many efforts have been made to import ontology into information matchmaking and retrieval. This trend is further accelerated by the convergence of various high-level concepts and low-level features supported by ontologies. In this paper we propose a comparison between traditional keyword based image retrieval and the promising ontology based image retrieval. To be complete, we construct the ontologies not only on text annotation, but also on a combination of text annotation and image feature. The experiments are conducted on a medium-sized data set including about 4000 images. The result proved the efficacy of utilizing both text and image features in a multi modality ontology to improve the image retrieval."

We propose to handle such a task with the guidance of a knowledge base that incorporate many abstract concepts. Our method is a two-step process where we first build a multi-entity-label image recognition model to predict abstract concepts as image labels and then leverage them in the second step as an external semantic attention and constrained inference in the caption generation model for describing images that depict unseen/novel objects. Evaluations show that our models outperform most of the prior work for out-of-domain captioning on MSCOCO and are useful for integration of knowledge and vision in general."

Learning appropriate representations for multi-modal data is crucial for the cross-modal retrieval performance. Unlike existing image-text retrieval approaches that embed image-text pairs as single feature vectors in a common representational space, we propose to incorporate generative processes into the cross-modal feature embedding, through which we are able to learn not only the global abstract features but also the local grounded features. Extensive experiments show that our framework can well match images and sentences with complex content, and achieve the state-of-the-art cross-modal retrieval results on MSCOCO dataset."

                "text": "This paper considers the task of matching images and sentences. The challenge consists in discriminatively embedding the two modalities onto a shared visual-textual space. Existing work in this field largely uses Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) for text feature learning and employs off-the-shelf Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for image feature extraction. Our system, in comparison, differs in two key aspects. Firstly, we build a convolutional network amenable for fine-tuning the visual and textual representations, where the entire network only contains four components, i.e., convolution layer, pooling layer, rectified linear unit function (ReLU), and batch normalisation. End-to-end learning allows the system to directly learn from the data and fully utilise the supervisions. Secondly, we propose instance loss according to viewing each multimodal data pair as a class. This works with a large margin objective to learn the inter-modal correspondence between images and their textual descriptions. Experiments on two generic retrieval datasets (Flickr30k and MSCOCO) demonstrate that our method yields competitive accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, in language person retrieval, we improve the state of the art by a large margin. Code is available at this https URL com/layumi/Image-Text-Embedding"

But exactly how such data can be harnessed and organized remains a critical problem. We introduce here a new database called \u201cImageNet\u201d, a large-scale ontology of images built upon the backbone of the WordNet structure. ImageNet aims to populate the majority of the 80,000 synsets of WordNet with an average of 500-1000 clean and full resolution images. This will result in tens of millions of annotated images organized by the semantic hierarchy of WordNet. This paper offers a detailed analysis of ImageNet in its current state: 12 subtrees with 5247 synsets and 3.2 million images in total. We show that ImageNet is much larger in scale and diversity and much more accurate than the current image datasets. Constructing such a large-scale database is a challenging task. We describe the data collection scheme with Amazon Mechanical Turk. Lastly, we illustrate the usefulness of ImageNet through three simple applications in object recognition, image classification and automatic object clustering. We hope that the scale, accuracy, diversity and hierarchical structure of ImageNet can offer unparalleled opportunities to researchers in the computer vision community and beyond."

Current solutions for this task usually rely on an extra step of extracting hypothesis regions (i.e., region proposals), resulting in redundant computation and sub-optimal performance. In this work, we achieve the interpretable and contextualized multi-label image classification by developing a recurrent memorized-attention module. This module consists of two alternately performed components: i) a spatial transformer layer to locate attentional regions from the convolutional feature maps in a region-proposal-free way and ii) an LSTM (Long-Short Term Memory) sub-network to sequentially predict semantic labeling scores on the located regions while capturing the global dependencies of these regions. The LSTM also output the parameters for computing the spatial transformer. On large-scale benchmarks of multi-label image classification (e.g., MS-COCO and PASCAL VOC 07), our approach demonstrates superior performances over other existing state-of-the-arts in both accuracy and efficiency."

This is achieved by gathering images of complex everyday scenes containing common objects in their natural context. Objects are labeled using per-instance segmentations to aid in precise object localization. Our dataset contains photos of 91 objects types that would be easily recognizable by a 4 year old. With a total of 2.5 million labeled instances in 328k images, the creation of our dataset drew upon extensive crowd worker involvement via novel user interfaces for category detection, instance spotting and instance segmentation. We present a detailed statistical analysis of the dataset in comparison to PASCAL, ImageNet, and SUN. Finally, we provide baseline performance analysis for bounding box and segmentation detection results using a Deformable Parts Model."

This allows more complex questions to be answered using the predominant neural network-based approach than has previously been possible. It particularly allows questions to be asked about the contents of an image, even when the image itself does not contain the whole answer. The method constructs a textual representation of the semantic content of an image, and merges it with textual information sourced from a knowledge base, to develop a deeper understanding of the scene viewed. Priming a recurrent neural network with this combined information, and the submitted question, leads to a very flexible visual question answering approach. We are specifically able to answer questions posed in natural language, that refer to information not contained in the image. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on two publicly available datasets, Toronto COCO-QA [23] and VQA [1] and show that it produces the best reported results in both cases."

Humans can learn about the characteristics of objects and the relationships that occur between them to learn a large variety of visual concepts, often with few examples. This paper investigates the use of structured prior knowledge in the form of knowledge graphs and shows that using this knowledge improves performance on image classification. We build on recent work on end-to-end learning on graphs, introducing the Graph Search Neural Network as a way of efficiently incorporating large knowledge graphs into a vision classification pipeline. We show in a number of experiments that our method outperforms standard neural network baselines for multi-label classification."

Our pipeline effectively unifies joint image-text embedding models with multimodal neural language models. We introduce the structure-content neural language model that disentangles the structure of a sentence to its content, conditioned on representations produced by the encoder. The encoder allows one to rank images and sentences while the decoder can generate novel descriptions from scratch. Using LSTM to encode sentences, we match the state-of-the-art performance on Flickr8K and Flickr30K without using object detections. We also set new best results when using the 19-layer Oxford convolutional network. Furthermore we show that with linear encoders, the learned embedding space captures multimodal regularities in terms of vector space arithmetic e.g. *image of a blue car* - \"blue\" + \"red\" is near images of red cars. Sample captions generated for 800 images are made available for comparison."

Cognition is core to tasks that involve not just recognizing, but reasoning about our visual world. However, models used to tackle the rich content in images for cognitive tasks are still being trained using the same datasets designed for perceptual tasks. To achieve success at cognitive tasks, models need to understand the interactions and relationships between objects in an image. When asked \u201cWhat vehicle is the person riding?\u201d, computers will need to identify the objects in an image as well as the relationships riding(man, carriage) and pulling(horse, carriage) to answer correctly that \u201cthe person is riding a horse-drawn carriage.\u201d In this paper, we present the Visual Genome dataset to enable the modeling of such relationships. We collect dense annotations of objects, attributes, and relationships within each image to learn these models. Specifically, our dataset contains over 108K images where each image has an average of $$35$$35 objects, $$26$$26 attributes, and $$21$$21 pairwise relationships between objects. We canonicalize the objects, attributes, relationships, and noun phrases in region descriptions and questions answer pairs to WordNet synsets. Together, these annotations represent the densest and largest dataset of image descriptions, objects, attributes, relationships, and question answer pairs."

However, traditional CMH methods usually apply batch learning for generating hash functions and codes. They are inefficient for the retrieval of web images which usually have streaming fashion. Online learning can be exploited for CMH. But existing online hashing methods still cannot solve two essential problems: efficient updating of hash codes and analysis of cross-modal correlation. In this paper, we propose Online Cross-modal Hashing (OCMH) which can effectively address the above two problems by learning the shared latent codes (SLC). In OCMH, hash codes can be represented by the permanent SLC and dynamic transfer matrix. Therefore, inefficient updating of hash codes is transformed to the efficient updating of SLC and transfer matrix, and the time complexity is irrelevant to the database size. Moreover, SLC is shared by all the modalities, and thus it can encode the latent cross-modal correlation, which further improves the overall cross-modal correlation between heterogeneous data. Experimental results on two real-world multi-modal web image datasets: MIR Flickr and NUS-WIDE, demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of OCMH for online cross-modal web image retrieval.\n \n"

Inspired by hard negative mining, the use of hard negatives in structured prediction, and ranking loss functions, we introduce a simple change to common loss functions used for multi-modal embeddings. That, combined with fine-tuning and use of augmented data, yields significant gains in retrieval performance. We showcase our approach, VSE++, on MS-COCO and Flickr30K datasets, using ablation studies and comparisons with existing methods. On MS-COCO our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 8.8% in caption retrieval and 11.3% in image retrieval (at R@1)."

In this paper we present a system, called FaceNet, that directly learns a mapping from face images to a compact Euclidean space where distances directly correspond to a measure offace similarity. Once this space has been produced, tasks such as face recognition, verification and clustering can be easily implemented using standard techniques with FaceNet embeddings asfeature vectors. Our method uses a deep convolutional network trained to directly optimize the embedding itself, rather than an intermediate bottleneck layer as in previous deep learning approaches. To train, we use triplets of roughly aligned matching / non-matching face patches generated using a novel online triplet mining method. The benefit of our approach is much greater representational efficiency: we achieve state-of-the-artface recognition performance using only 128-bytes perface. On the widely used Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) dataset, our system achieves a new record accuracy of 99.63%. On YouTube Faces DB it achieves 95.12%. Our system cuts the error rate in comparison to the best published result [15] by 30% on both datasets."

These findings were the basis of our ImageNet Challenge 2014 submission, where our team secured the first and the second places in the localisation and classification tracks respectively. We also show that our representations generalise well to other datasets, where they achieve state-of-the-art results.

Below we present the origin of this Special Issue and then give an overview of the papers included. The papers emanate from the International Workshop on Intelligent Computing in Pattern Analysis/Synthesis (IWICPAS 2006), which ran as a satellite workshop of the 18th International Conference on Pattern Recognition. The former took place in Xi\u2019an on 26\u201327 August 2006 and the latter in Hong Kong on 20\u201324 August 2006, both in P. R. China. IWICPAS brought together people from academia and industry in the fields of computer vision and pattern recognition, and most of the pattern recognition algorithms presented have been employed on vision-related applications. The IWICPAS Workshop attracted a record number of 264 paper submissions from 20 countries. From these 264 papers, 51 were accepted. The proceedings were published as a book in the LNCS (Lecture Notes in Computer Science) series of Springer-Verlag. Thereafter, out of these 51 papers, nine were selected for this Special Issue. These were then substantially extended and went through another round of reviewing. We strongly believe that it is now an ideal time to publish this Special Issue with the aforesaid selected papers. The contents will provide readers of IJCM with cutting-edge and topical information for their related research. As we look forward to the future, we envisage computer vision and pattern recognition research to significantly benefit from cognitive science and psychology, as evidenced in the paper by Oyekoya and Stentiford. This Special Issue starts with three papers on feature generation and selection. The next two papers focus on the classical segmentation problem, which is a basic task in various image processing systems. After three compression and coding related papers, the last paper deals with the interaction between the human vision system and a computerized visual information management system. We now highlight the core contributions of each of the papers. In the paper \u2018BTF modelling using BRDF texels\u2019, Filip and Haindl developed two schemes to enlarge Bidirectional Texture Function (BTF) data. The two schemes perform best for spatially random BTF. In their paper \u2018Combinatorial and statistical methods for part selection for object recognition\u2019, Zhao et al. presented a statistical method for choosing image patches and then using these patches for object detection and classification.

                "text": "We introduce the \"exponential linear unit\" (ELU) which speeds up learning in deep neural networks and leads to higher classification accuracies. Like rectified linear units (ReLUs), leaky ReLUs (LReLUs) and parametrized ReLUs (PReLUs), ELUs alleviate the vanishing gradient problem via the identity for positive values. However, ELUs have improved learning characteristics compared to the units with other activation functions. In contrast to ReLUs, ELUs have negative values which allows them to push mean unit activations closer to zero like batch normalization but with lower computational complexity. Mean shifts toward zero speed up learning by bringing the normal gradient closer to the unit natural gradient because of a reduced bias shift effect. While LReLUs and PReLUs have negative values, too, they do not ensure a noise-robust deactivation state. ELUs saturate to a negative value with smaller inputs and thereby decrease the forward propagated variation and information. Therefore, ELUs code the degree of presence of particular phenomena in the input, while they do not quantitatively model the degree of their absence. In experiments, ELUs lead not only to faster learning, but also to significantly better generalization performance than ReLUs and LReLUs on networks with more than 5 layers. On CIFAR-100 ELUs networks significantly outperform ReLU networks with batch normalization while batch normalization does not improve ELU networks. ELU networks are among the top 10 reported CIFAR-10 results and yield the best published result on CIFAR-100, without resorting to multi-view evaluation or model averaging. On ImageNet, ELU networks considerably speed up learning compared to a ReLU network with the same architecture, obtaining less than 10% classification error for a single crop, single model network."

                "text": "Lecture Notes for the MSc/DTC module. The brain is a complex computing machine which has evolved to give the ttest output to a given input. Neural computation has as goal to describe the function of the nervous system in mathematical and computational terms. By analysing or simulating the resulting equations, one can better understand its function, research how changes in parameters would eect the function, and try to mimic the nervous system in hardware or software implementations. Neural Computation is a bit like physics, that has been successful in describing numerous physical phenomena. However, approaches developed in those elds not always work for neural computation, because: 1. Physical systems are best studied in reduced, simplied circumstances, but the nervous system is hard to study in isolation. Neurons require a narrow range of operating conditions (temperature, oxygen, presence of other neurons, ion concentrations, ...) under which they work as they should. These conditions are hard to reproduce outside the body. Secondly, the neurons form a highly interconnected network. The function of the nervous systems depends on this connectivity and interaction, by trying to isolate the components, you are likely to alter the function. 2. It is not clear how much detail one needs to describe the computations in the brain. In these lectures we shall see various description levels. 3. Neural signals and neural connectivity are hard to measure, especially, if disturbance and damage to the nervous system is to be kept minimal. Perhaps Neural Computation has more in common with trying to gure out how a complicated machine, such as a computer or car works. Knowledge of the basic physics helps, but is not sucient. Luckily there are factors which perhaps make understanding the brain easier than understanding an arbitrary complicated machine: 1. There is a high degree of conservation across species. This means that animal studies can be used to gain information about the human brain. Furthermore, study of, say, the visual system might help to understand the auditory system. 2. The nervous system is able to develop by combining on one hand a only limited amount of genetic information and, on the other hand, the input it receives. Therefore it might be possible to nd the organising principles and develop a brain from there. This would be easier than guring out the complete 'wiring diagram'. 3. The nervous system is exible and robust, neurons die everyday. This stands \u2026"
