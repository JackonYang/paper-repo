The system, called Satz, makes simple estimates of the parts of speech of the tokens immediately preceding and following each punctuation mark, and uses these estimates as input to a machine learning algorithm that then classifies the punctuation mark. Satz is very fast both in training and sentence analysis, and its combined robustness and accuracy surpass existing techniques. The system needs only a small lexicon and training corpus, and has been shown to transfer quickly and easily from English to other languages, as demonstrated on Franch and German."

                "text": "Researchers in both machine translation (e.g., Brown et al. 1990) and bilingual lexicography (e.g., Klavans and Tzoukermann 1990) have recently become interested in studying bilingual corpora, bodies of text such as the Canadian Hansards (parliamentary proceedings), which are available in multiple languages (such as French and English). One useful step is to align the sentences, that is, to identify correspondences between sentences in one language and sentences in the other language.This paper will describe a method and a program (align) for aligning sentences based on a simple statistical model of character lengths. The program uses the fact that longer sentences in one language tend to be translated into longer sentences in the other language, and that shorter sentences tend to be translated into shorter sentences. A probabilistic score is assigned to each proposed correspondence of sentences, based on the scaled difference of lengths of the two sentences (in characters) and the variance of this difference. This probabilistic score is used in a dynamic programming framework to find the maximum likelihood alignment of sentences.It is remarkable that such a simple approach works as well as it does. An evaluation was performed based on a trilingual corpus of economic reports issued by the Union Bank of Switzerland (UBS) in English, French, and German. The method correctly aligned all but 4% of the sentences. Moreover, it is possible to extract a large subcorpus that has a much smaller error rate. By selecting the best-scoring 80% of the alignments, the error rate is reduced from 4% to 0.7%. There were more errors on the English-French subcorpus than on the English-German subcorpus, showing that error rates will depend on the corpus considered; however, both were small enough to hope that the method will be useful for many language pairs.To further research on bilingual corpora, a much larger sample of Canadian Hansards (approximately 90 million words, half in English and and half in French) has been aligned with the align program and will be available through the Data Collection Initiative of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL/DCI). In addition, in order to facilitate replication of the align program, an appendix is provided with detailed c-code of the more difficult core of the align program."

Given a corpus annotated with sentence boundaries, our model learns to classify each occurrence of., ?, and ! as either a valid or invalid sentence boundary. The training procedure requires no hand-crafted rules, lexica, part-of-speech tags, or domain-specific information. The model can therefore be trained easily on any genre of English, and should be trainable on any other Romanalphabet language. Performance is comparable to or better than the performance of similar systems, but we emphasize the simplicity of retraining for new domains."

Within our framework, we carry out a large number of experiments to understand better and explain why phrase-based models out-perform word-based models. Our empirical results, which hold for all examined language pairs, suggest that the highest levels of performance can be obtained through relatively simple means: heuristic learning of phrase translations from word-based alignments and lexical weighting of phrase translations. Surprisingly, learning phrases longer than three words and learning phrases from high-accuracy word-level alignment models does not have a strong impact on performance. Learning only syntactically motivated phrases degrades the performance of our systems."

As with other kinds of data, the value of bitexts largely depends on the efficacy of the available data mining tools. The first step in extracting useful information from bitexts is to find corresponding words and/or text segment boundaries in their two halves (bitext maps).This article advances the state of the art of bitext mapping by formulating the problem in terms of pattern recognition. From this point of view, the success of a bitext mapping algorithm hinges on how well it performs three tasks: signal generation, noise filtering, and search. The Smooth Injective Map Recognizer (SIMR) algorithm presented here integrates innovative approaches to each of these tasks. Objective evaluation has shown that SIMR's accuracy is consistently high for language pairs as diverse as French/English and Korean/English. If necessary, SIMR's bitext maps can be efficiently converted into segment alignments using the Geometric Segment Alignment (GSA) algorithm, which is also presented here.SIMR has produced bitext maps for over 200 megabytes of French-English bitexts. GSA has converted these maps into alignments. Both the maps and the alignments are available from the Linguistic Data Consortium."

A vital component of any Web-based information agent is a set of wrappers that can extract the relevant data from semistructured information sources. Our novel approach to wrapper induction is based on the idea of hierarchical information extraction, which turns the hard problem of extracting data from an arbitrarily complex document into a series of easier extraction tasks. We introduce an inductive algorithm, STALKER, that generates high accuracy extraction rules based on user-labeled training examples. Labeling the training data represents the major bottleneck in using wrapper induction techniques, and our experimental results show that STALKER does significantly better then other approaches; on one hand, STALKER requires up to two orders of magnitude fewer examples than other algorithms, while on the other hand it can handle information sources that could not be wrapped by existing techniques."
