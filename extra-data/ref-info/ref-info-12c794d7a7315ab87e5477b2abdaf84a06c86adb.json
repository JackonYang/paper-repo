This facilitates matching between quite disparate views-wide baseline stereo. Two extensions are made to the current small baseline algorithms: first, and most importantly, a viewpoint invariant measure is developed for assessing the affinity of corner neighbourhoods over image pairs; second, algorithms are given for generating putative corner matches between image pairs using local homographies. Two novel infrastructure developments are also described: the automatic generation of local homographies, and the combination of possibly conflicting sets of matches prior to RANSAC estimation. The wide baseline matching algorithm is demonstrated on a number of image pairs with varying relative motion, and for different scene types. All processing is automatic."

The robot is not given a map of the environment, but it does have access to a collection of training examples, each of which specifies the video image observed when the robot is at a particular location and orientation. We address two variants of this problem: how to estimate translation of a moving robot assuming the orientation is known, and how to estimate translation and orientation for a mobile robot. Performing scene reconstruction to construct a metric map of the environment using only video images is difficult. We avoid this by using an approach in which the robot learns to convert a set of image measurements into a representation of its pose (position and orientation). This provides a metric estimate of the robot's location within a region covered by the statistical map we build. Localization can be performed online without a prior location estimate, The conversion from visual data to camera pose is implemented using a multilayer neural network that is trained using backpropagation. An aspect of the approach is the use of an inconsistency measure to eliminate incorrect data and estimate components of the pose vector. The experimental data reported in this paper suggests that the accuracy and flexibility of the technique is good, while the online computational cost is very low."

It has the advantage of simplicity of implementation. The prevailing view is, however, that it is extremely susceptible to noise and hence virtually useless for most purposes. This paper challenges that view, by showing that by preceding the algorithm with a very simple normalization (translation and scaling) of the coordinates of the matched points, results are obtained comparable with the best iterative algorithms. This improved performance is justified by theory and verified by extensive experiments on real images."

It has the advantage of simplicity of implementation. The prevailing view is, however, that it is extremely susceptible to noise and hence virtually useless for most purposes. The paper challenges that view, by showing that by preceding the algorithm with a very simple normalization (translation and scaling) of the coordinates of the matched points, results are obtained comparable with the best iterative algorithms. This improved performance is justified by theory and verified by extensive experiments on real images.<<ETX>>"

After briefly discussing how the task function approach can be applied to tasks which include the use of visual features, the authors give a simplified control expression which explicitly takes into account the case of moving objects. Estimating the target velocity while performing the tracking control leads to a kind of adaptive control scheme. The authors then consider the specific case of a square target and derive all the components of the control scheme. They present some experimental results obtained at the video rate in an experimental system composed of a camera mounted on the end effector of a six-DOF robot.<<ETX>>"

The author describes recent work employing mathematical methods drawn from linear algebra, projective geometry, algebraic geometry, the theory of transversality and the theory of least squares approximation. Many problems in reconstructions are best tackled using methods from projective or algebraic geometry. However, these methods are not widely known to researchers in computer vision. As a consequence, purely algebraic methods are often used instead, leading to large and complicated expressions, which are difficult to interpret. many of the arguments in this volume illustrate the speed and efficiency of geometric methods for solving certain problems that arise in reconstruction. This book is a good starting point for anyone interested in the application of different mathematical techniques to the rapidly expanding field of computer vision, especially in the areas of vehicle guidance, robotics and remote sensing."

This problem is relevant not only to photographic surveying1 but also to binocular vision2, where the non-visual information available to the observer about the orientation and focal length of each eye is much less accurate than the optical information supplied by the retinal images themselves. The problem also arises in monocular perception of motion3, where the two projections represent views which are separated in time as well as space. As Marr and Poggio4 have noted, the fusing of two images to produce a three-dimensional percept involves two distinct processes: the establishment of a 1:1 correspondence between image points in the two views\u2014the \u2018correspondence problem\u2019\u2014and the use of the associated disparities for determining the distances of visible elements in the scene. I shall assume that the correspondence problem has been solved; the problem of reconstructing the scene then reduces to that of finding the relative orientation of the two viewpoints."

It introduces the idea of using powers of the intensities in the different color bands of a color image and combinations thereof for the construction of the moments. First, a complete classification is made of all functions of such moments which are invariant under both affine deformations of the pattern (thus achieving viewpoint invariance) as well as linear changes of the intensity values in the individual color bands (hence, coping with changes in the irradiance pattern due to different lighting conditions and/or viewpoints). The discriminant power and classification performance of these new invariants for color pattern recogniti on has been tested on a data set consisting of images of real outdoors advertising panels. Furthermore, a comparison to moment invariants presented in literature ([1] and [2]) that come closest sto the aimed type of invariants is made and new approaches to improve their performance are presented."
