An optimal recipe for classifying such patterns is described. It combines the use of an orthonormal expansion for the logarithm of probability functions, with the generation of a joint probability distribution from lower-order marginals. The unwieldy nature of the optimal recipe leads to the consideration of dependence represented by a Markov chain and a two-dimensional analog called a Markov mesh. The Markov chain has a \"reflecting\" property in that the r th order nonstationary chain implies that a point depends on its r nearest neighbors on each side. By scanning along a grid-filling curve so that the 2r neighbors of a point are geometrically close to it, certain spatial dependencies are obtained. The grid-filling curves are sequences of functions which have Hilbert \"space-filling\" curves as their limit. This simple approach does not provide for many of the spatial dependencies that should be considered. A novel extension of Markov chain methods into two dimensions leads to the Markov mesh which economically takes care of a much larger class of spatial dependencies. Likelihood ratio classification based on Markov chain and Markov mesh assumptions requires the estimation of a much smaller number of parameters than the general case. The development presented in this paper is new and need not be restricted to binary variables."

The Bayes smoothing algorithm yields the a posteriori distribution of the scene value at each pixel, given the total noisy image, in a recursive way. The a posteriori distribution together with a criterion of optimality then determine a Bayes estimate of the scene. The algorithm presented is an extension of a 1-D Bayes smoothing algorithm to 2-D and it gives the optimum Bayes estimate for the scene value at each pixel. Computational concerns in 2-D, however, necessitate certain simplifying assumptions on the model and approximations on the implementation of the algorithm. In particular, the scene (noiseless image) is modeled as a Markov mesh random field, a special class of Markov random fields, and the Bayes smoothing algorithm is applied on overlapping strips (horizontal/vertical) of the image consisting of several rows (columns). It is assumed that the signal (scene values) vector sequence along the strip is a vector Markov chain. Since signal correlation in one of the dimensions is not fully used along the edges of the strip, estimates are generated only along the middle sections of the strips. The overlapping strips are chosen such that the union of the middle sections of the strips gives the whole image. The Bayes smoothing algorithm presented here is valid for scene random fields consisting of multilevel (discrete) or continuous random variables."

A texture model is a mathematical procedure capable of producing and describing a textured image. We explore the use of Markov random fields as texture models. The binomial model, where each point in the texture has a binomial distribution with parameter controlled by its neighbors and ``number of tries'' equal to the number of gray levels, was taken to be the basic model for the analysis. A method of generating samples from the binomial model is given, followed by a theoretical and practical analysis of the method's convergence. Examples show how the parameters of the Markov random field control the strength and direction of the clustering in the image. The power of the binomial model to produce blurry, sharp, line-like, and blob-like textures is demonstrated. Natural texture samples were digitized and their parameters were estimated under the Markov random field model. A hypothesis test was used for an objective assessment of goodness-of-fit under the Markov random field model. Overall, microtextures fit the model well. The estimated parameters of the natural textures were used as input to the generation procedure. The synthetic microtextures closely resembled their real counterparts, while the regular and inhomogeneous textures did not."

The assumptions at the boundary are made for convenience. For a second-order field, the available pixels which are diagonally adjacent to pixel i are additionally included in ai; thus, each interior pixel has eight neighbours. The hierarchy can clearly be continued but, although the main methods in the paper apply to more general M.r.f.s, we shall only consider second-order fields in actual reconstructions; we view a first-order assumption to be unrealistic for most practical purposes. It should be stressed that we make no pretence of causal modelling in the specification (2). Equally, in a Bayesian framework, {p(x)) is to be viewed merely as our prior distribution for the true scene x*.

Pixel gray levels and the presence and orientation of edges are viewed as states of atoms or molecules in a lattice-like physical system. The assignment of an energy function in the physical system determines its Gibbs distribution. Because of the Gibbs distribution, Markov random field (MRF) equivalence, this assignment also determines an MRF image model. The energy function is a more convenient and natural mechanism for embodying picture attributes than are the local characteristics of the MRF. For a range of degradation mechanisms, including blurring, nonlinear deformations, and multiplicative or additive noise, the posterior distribution is an MRF with a structure akin to the image model. By the analogy, the posterior distribution defines another (imaginary) physical system. Gradual temperature reduction in the physical system isolates low energy states (``annealing''), or what is the same thing, the most probable states under the Gibbs distribution. The analogous operation under the posterior distribution yields the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the image given the degraded observations. The result is a highly parallel ``relaxation'' algorithm for MAP estimation. We establish convergence properties of the algorithm and we experiment with some simple pictures, for which good restorations are obtained at low signal-to-noise ratios."

In practice, the sites may represent points or regions in space and the random variables may be either continuous or discrete. The main statistical objectives are the following: firstly, to provide a means of using the available concomitant information, particularly the configuration of the sites, to attach a plausible probability distribution to the random vector X; secondly, to estimate any unknown parameters in the distribution from the realization x; thirdly, where possible, to quantify the extent of disagreement between hypothesis and observation."

Similar models and associated optimization algorithms appear regularly in other work involving immense spatial systems; some examples are the studies in these proceedings on statistical mechanical systems (e.g. ferromagnets, spin-glasses and random fields), the work of Hinton and Sejnowski [14], Hopfield [15], and von der Malsburg and Bienenstock [19], in neural modeling and perceptual inference, and other work in image analysis, e.g. Besag [2], Kiiveri and Campbell [17], Cross and Jain [5], Cohen and Cooper [4], Elliott and Derin [7], Deviver [6], Grenander [11], and Marroquin [20].

In fact, until very recently, there has been little interest among statisticians in image processing problems, with the notable exception of Paul Switzer, whose pioneering work, particularly in the context of satellite data (see, for example, Switzer, 1980, 1983), has done much to awaken others, including the present author."

(1953) is presented along with an exposition of the relevant theory, techniques of application and methods and difficulties of assessing the error in Monte Carlo estimates. Examples of the methods, including the generation of random orthogonal matrices and potential applications of the methods to numerical problems arising in statistics, are discussed. For numerical problems in a large number of dimensions, Monte Carlo methods are often more efficient than conventional numerical methods. However, implementation of the Monte Carlo methods requires sampling from high dimensional probability distributions and this may be very difficult and expensive in analysis and computer time. General methods for sampling from, or estimating expectations with respect to, such distributions are as follows. (i) If possible, factorize the distribution into the product of one-dimensional conditional distributions from which samples may be obtained. (ii) Use importance sampling, which may also be used for variance reduction. That is, in order to evaluate the integral J = X) p(x)dx = Ev(f), where p(x) is a probability density function, instead of obtaining independent samples XI, ..., Xv from p(x) and using the estimate J, = Zf(xi)/N, we instead obtain the sample from a distribution with density q(x) and use the estimate J2 = Y{f(xj)p(x1)}/{q(xj)N}. This may be advantageous if it is easier to sample from q(x) thanp(x), but it is a difficult method to use in a large number of dimensions, since the values of the weights w(xi) = p(x1)/q(xj) for reasonable values of N may all be extremely small, or a few may be extremely large. In estimating the probability of an event A, however, these difficulties may not be as serious since the only values of w(x) which are important are those for which x -A. Since the methods proposed by Trotter & Tukey (1956) for the estimation of conditional expectations require the use of importance sampling, the same difficulties may be encountered in their use. (iii) Use a simulation technique; that is, if it is difficult to sample directly from p(x) or if p(x) is unknown, sample from some distribution q(y) and obtain the sample x values as some function of the corresponding y values. If we want samples from the conditional dis"

Frequently, processes are needed which reduce ambiguity and noise, and select the best label among several possible choices. Relaxation labeling processes are just such a class of algorithms. They are based on the parallel use of local constraints between labels. This paper develops a theory to characterize the goal of relaxation labeling. The theory is founded on a definition of con-sistency in labelings, extending the notion of constraint satisfaction. In certain restricted circumstances, an explicit functional exists that can be maximized to guide the search for consistent labelings. This functional is used to derive a new relaxation labeling operator. When the restrictions are not satisfied, the theory relies on variational cal-culus. It is shown that the problem of finding consistent labelings is equivalent to solving a variational inequality. A procedure nearly identical to the relaxation operator derived under restricted circum-stances serves in the more general setting. Further, a local convergence result is established for this operator. The standard relaxation labeling formulas are shown to approximate our new operator, which leads us to conjecture that successful applications of the standard methods are explainable by the theory developed here. Observations about con-vergence and generalizations to higher order compatibility relations are described."

When doing this we shall concentrate our attention on the configurations and neglect the corresponding questions for images; see Notes A. A reader can therefore in the present chapter think of the identification rule R as EQUAL, treating images as identical to configuration. Important advances have been made in metric pattern theory after the appearance of Volume I, some of which are contained in two reports by Hwang and Thrift, see Bibliography; much of this chapter is devoted to presenting their results."

This paper introduces a new perspective toward relaxation-that of considering it as a process for reordering labels attached to nodes in a graph. This new perspective is used to establish the formal equivalence between relaxation and another widely used algorithm, local maxima selection. The equivalence specifies conditions under which a family of cooperative relaxation algorithms, which generalize the well-known ones, decompose into purely local ones. Since these conditions are also sufficient for guaranteeing the convergence of relaxation processes, they serve as stopping criteria. We feel that equivalences such as these are necessary for the proper application of relaxation and maxima selection in complex speech and vision understanding systems."

Much as in X-ray transmission tomography and other modes of computerized tomography, the quality of the reconstructed image in PET is very sensitive to the mathematical algorithm to be used for reconstruction. In this article, we tailor a mathematical model to the physics of positron emissions, and we use the model to describe the basic image reconstruction problem of PET as a standard problem in statistical estimation from incomplete data. We describe various estimation procedures, such as the maximum likelihood (ML) method (using the EM algorithm), the method of moments, and the least squares method. A computer simulation of a PET experiment is then used to demonstrate the ML and the least squares reconstructions. The main purposes of this article are to report on what we believe is an..."

Treatment estimates are closely related to those resulting from a generalized least squares analysis in which the covariance structure for the environmental effects has a particular form. However, the main emphases are on the accuracy of treatment estimates under a fixed smooth trend plus error model and the exploratory power of the basic method to isolate trend effects of unknown form. Although the detailed development is for the one-dimensional case, generalizations of the smoothness concept and extensions to two dimensions are also discussed. Application of the basic method is illustrated on three data sets and the results compared with other analyses."

Although the basic idea was formulated many years ago, the method is not as widely known or adopted as perhaps it should be. The topics and examples discussed in this paper are intended to promote the understanding and extend the practicability of the spline smoothing methodology. Particular subjects covered include the basic principles of the method; the relation with moving average and other smoothing methods; the automatic choice of the amount of smoothing; and the use of residuals for diagnostic checking and model adaptation. The question of providing inference regions for curves-and for relevant properties of curves--is approached via a finite-dimensional Bayesian formulation."

The probability of a pattern on a single row, and the probability of a pattern on one row given the pattern on the other, define a row by row (Markovian) probability generating process on the double infinite square lattice. The probability of any finite pattern on this lattice is determined by a finite number of steps in this process. The five parameter distribution of atom pattern defined by the row by row process contains a three parameter family of isotropic distributions. A subfamily of these isotropic distributions is the exact solution of the Ising model for the hard core lattice gas, with exclusion of nearest neighbor sites and second neighbor interaction for cases where the interaction parameter is suitably related to the coverage. The free energy and the partition function for this gas are derived mathematically and are presented explicitly in terms of the concentration."

The targets included two different row crops (corn and soybeans), a continuous canopy (alfalfa) and bare ground. After a short review of the statistics of Rayleigh fading backscatter, the data processing method and the results of the experiment are analyzed. Comparison with theory shows adequate agreement with the experimental results provided crop type, soil moisture condition and incidence angle are correctly incorporated in the target model. Because recent studies indicate that a high degree of precision is required for mapping vegetotion types with radar, it is necessary to acquire as much a priori knowledge of target fading characteristics as possible."

The first of these is a subclass of hierarchical log linear models. Each of its models can be represented by an undirected graph. In the second class each model corresponds to a particular kind of a directed graph instead and can be characterized by a nontrivial factorization of the joint distribution in terms of response variables. We derive decomposable or multiplicative models as the intersecting class. This result has useful consequences for exploratory types of analysis as well as for the model interpretation: we can give an aid for detecting well-fitting decomposable models in a transformation of the observed contingency table and each decomposable model may be interpreted with the help of an undirected or directed graph."

This inconsistency diagnostic fundamentally differentiates the behaviour of likelihood based and Bayes \"confidence\" regions from those of the unconditional sampling approach.
