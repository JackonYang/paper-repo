This can sometimes be done if we are prepared to assume stationarity in both time and space (see Baktlett, 1971a) but, unfortunately, such an assumption is unlikely to be realistic in our context. However, when this approach is justifiable, it is of course helpful to check that our spatial models are consistent with it; for simple examples, see Besag (1972a). Otherwise, regarding the transient spatial structure of a spatial-temporal process, this is almost always intractable and hence there exists a need to set up and examine purely spatial schemes without recourse to temporal considerations."

                "text": "SUMMARY Suppose that there is correlation between the yields of successive or adjacent experimental units. An estimator of treatment effects using the residuals of adjacent plots as a concomitant variable is investigated. It is shown to be very close to the maximum likelihood estimator when the errors form a first-order autoregressive series. In the analysis of experimental data it is quite commonly assumed that observations on successive or adjacent units have independent errors. In randomized experiments this assumption is justified by the randomization. But sometimes an analysis making explicit allowance for correlation between adjacent units will be valuable, either because higher precision can be obtained, or because non-randomized data are under analysis. One procedure for allowing for correlation is to introduce a specific model for the error variability, for example, a first-order autoregressive process where the units are arranged in time or along a line. Williams (1952) suggested appropriate designs for this case and developed the method of analysis. Another, apparently quite different, method (Papadakis, 1937; Bartlett, 1938) proceeds as follows. The yield of each unit is corrected for the mean effect over all units receiving the same treatment. The average of the corrected yields of adjacent units is then used as a concomitant variable in the analysis of covariance. No explicit probability model is assumed in forming the adjusted estimate of the treatment effects. The conditions under which the estimates of precision so obtained are meaningful seem never to have been defined. The object of the present paper is to consider Papadakis's procedure in more detail and, in particular, to show its connexion with the analysis based on an autoregressive process. Variation is considered in only one dimension, although the method was originally proposed for spatial variation in two dimensions."

It collects together a great amount of material and clarifies a number of points admirably. For example, the Hammersley-Clifford theorem now appears very much more accessible. On the questipn of joint versus conditional specifications, there is probably no point in being very partisan, as there are plainly arguments on both sides. I must confess, however, that I still find a conditional specification natural only in a context where the conditionings occur in a natural (\"temporal\") sequence, so that the sequence of conditioning sigma-fields is monotone, and there are no unobvious restrictions on the conditional probabilities, as there are in abundance in the spatial case. One feels, however, that all these questions will find their proper resolution when the process is embedded in a spatiotemporal process, as Professor Bartlett has done in the paper quoted (1971a) and as I did myself in a special case in my paper on topographic correlation (Whittle, 1962). Properties of the equilibrium spatial process follow nicely in some cases from those of the spatiotemporal process. For example, Spitzer has shown that a process which is both spatially and temporally first-order Markov (with appropriate definition), and is moreover reversible, has an equilibrium spatial distribution which is second-order Markov. The \"awkward normalizing factor\" which Mr Besag mentions at the end of Section 2 is of course important in its own right, and none other than the partition function in statistical mechanical contexts. Mr Besag indicates some hope that conditional descriptions will resolve the questions of non-identifiability mentioned at the end of Section 5. In fact, though, as long as the model is Gaussian these non-identifiabilities are intrinsic and unavoidable, however one may have chosen to specify the Gaussian process. Finally, I might mention that both Mr Besag and I might have achieved a better fit with our models had we docked the central spike off the correlogram, which presumably reflects uncorrelated noise superimposed on the variable of the spatial model. In one of the cases I examined in Whittle (1954) the correlogram followed the predicted form (a Bessel function) very well except just at the origin."

There is then no longer any degeneracy associated with the conditional probability models. This is the approach taken in the present paper. It has been made possible by the advent of the celebrated Hammersley-Clifford theorem which, sadly, has remained unpublished by its authors. Finally, in this section, we examine the problems and implications of deriving the' joint probability structure associated with the site variables, given their individual conditional distributions. We no longer restrict attention to \"nearest-neighbour\" models nor even to lattice schemes but instead consider a fairly arbitary system of sites. Suppose then that we are concerned with afinite collection of random variables, X,, ...,X,, which are associated with sites labelled 1, ...,n, respectively. For each site, P(xilx,,...., xi-,,xw, ...,x,), the conditional distribution of Xi, given all other site values, 1s specified and we require the joint probability distribution of the variables. Our terminology will be appropriate to discrete variables but the arguments equally extend to the continuous case. We make the following important assumption : if x,, ...,x, can individually occur at the sites 1, ...,n, respectively, then they can occur together. Formally, if P(x,) >0 for each i, then P(x,, . . . ,x,) >0. This is called the positivity condition by Hammersley and Clifford (1971) and will be assumed throughout the present paper."

It collects together a great amount of material and clarifies a number of points admirably. For example, the Hammersley-Clifford theorem now appears very much more accessible. On the questipn of joint versus conditional specifications, there is probably no point in being very partisan, as there are plainly arguments on both sides. I must confess, however, that I still find a conditional specification natural only in a context where the conditionings occur in a natural (\"temporal\") sequence, so that the sequence of conditioning sigma-fields is monotone, and there are no unobvious restrictions on the conditional probabilities, as there are in abundance in the spatial case. One feels, however, that all these questions will find their proper resolution when the process is embedded in a spatiotemporal process, as Professor Bartlett has done in the paper quoted (1971a) and as I did myself in a special case in my paper on topographic correlation (Whittle, 1962)."

In either case, x,,can be thought of as reflecting variations in soil fertility and& as reflecting the intrinsic variability of the wheat itself, from plot to plot (cf. Whittle, 1954). Unfortunately, for either the simultaneous or conditional probability scheme, {Xi,,) is no longer a finite-order process and this leads to complications in maximum-likelihood estimation and in testing goodness of fit. It is intended to discuss such problems elsewhere. However, returning to the general form of the correlogram, I doubt whether docking the central spike really satisfies Professor Whittle. His evidence (Whittle, 1956), based partially upon the results in Fairfield Smith (1938), that, in agricultural uniformity trials, covariance functions often decay as a power of distance, rather than exponentially, at least for large lags, still conflicts with both the simultaneous and conditional multinormal schemes."

Ideally, even when dealing with a process at a single instant of time, we should first set up an intuitively plausible spatial-temporal model and then derive the resulting instantaneous spatial structure. This can sometimes be done if we are prepared to assume stationarity in both time and space (see Bartlett, 1971a) but, unfortunately, such an assumption is unlikely to be realistic in our context. However, when this approach is justifiable, it is of course helpful to check that our spatial models are consistent with it; for simple examples, ee Besag (1972a). Otherwise, regarding the transient spatial structure of a spatial-temporal process, this is almost always intractable and hence there xists a need to set up and examine purely spatial schemes without recourse to temporal considerations."

A Markov process on a torus In this paper we construct a stationary process on the square lattice formed by all the pairs of positive and negative integers, in which the random variables, Xmn,, say, are identically normally distributed and satisfy a Markovian property. We do this by first constructing a similar such process on a lattice torus and letting the size of the latter tend to infinity."

It is shown that although standard techniques for deriving the correlogram analytically are not immediately appropriate, it is, nevertheless, possible to give a simple solution in a certain region of the plane provided that the number of regressors is small. The remainder of the correlogram tends to be analytically awkward but can be very easily calculated numerically. Three specific examples arising from the literature are discussed in detail."

Results are obtained in ? 3 for several kinds of plot. Results are also obtained (?4) on the dependence of the yield variance on plot geometry for very small and very large plots. Special attention is paid to the case for which the covariance follows a power law at large distances. It is well known that, in order to explain the observed variation of yield variance with size and shape of plot, it is necessary to allow the possibility of correlation between yield densities at any two points in the plot. (We shall restrict ourselves to the stationary case, for which the expected yield density is constant over the area.) Moreover, it appears that this spatial correlation must often fall off relatively slowly with increasing distance between the two points; as a power function of the distance rather than as an exponential. The same behaviour is shown by observations on yarn diameter, flood height (Feller, 1951), and response from population samples. The calculations of this article will apply to these cases, too, but for concreteness we shall continue to speak of plots and yields (although we shall sonmetimes use the word 'region' instead of 'plot ', indicating that we do not confine ourselves to two dimensions). The type of calculation most usually made is to evaluate the yield variance for a plot of definite size and shape, and for a given spatial covariance function p(s). However, the inverse calculation would probably be more useful in general: to determine the covariance function from a knowledge of yield variance as a function of plot geometry. Such a procedure would enable one to make use of experimental results to obtain at least a partial estimate of p(s). We consider this question in ? 3. A solution of one form of problein is most easily reached by using a Mellin transform, so that the covariance which falls off as a power of the distance,"

The species are fairly matched and the result of conflict is the invasion by one of the species of territory held by the other. A simple stochastic model for this process is described and rules are given for the calculation, as a function of time, of the probabilities that individual territories and groups of territories are held by a single species. Asymptotic results are given for the pattern of territories held by a single species, and here a remarkable distinction is seen between the cases of one-dimensional and two-dimensional competition and the case of three-dimensional competition. The process of invasion is contrasted with two relatively benign processes, that in which an exchange of territories is arranged and that in which a spatial alternation of species may be beneficial to the community. The implications of the long-term behaviour of such processes are discussed. It is suggested further that, under certain ideal conditions, it may be possible to estimate the duration of a spatial struggle for life by observing at some time the configuration of territories held by each species."

My contribution to a conference at Sheffield in 1973 aimed, at least in part, to supply such a review and forms the basis of this monograph; but in these prefatory remarks I must still make clear what I decided to discuss, and what I have omitted. Broadly speaking, the coverage is that included in seminars and lectures I have given on this theme since 1969. We may divide problems of spatial pattern (in contrast with complete random chaos) into (i) detecting departures from randomness, Oi) analysing such departures when detected, for example, in relation to some stochastic model and (iii) special problems which require separate consideration; for example, sophisticated problems of pattern recognition in specific fields, such as the computer reading of handwriting or recognition of chromosomes."

A graphical review of variances, etc., reported in the literature for thirty-nine other blank experiments indicates that the results of most such experiments conform to the same law. It is shown that the above law can be generalized (so as to be applicable to any size of field) by applying a certain adjustment to the regression coefficient b', so as to give a modified coefficient b applicable to an \u201cinfinite\u201d field. From this generalized relationship there has been deduced an expression ((4), p. 16) to indicate average relative efficiencies to be expected for randomized block experiments with varying numbers of plots per block in a field for which the coefficient b is known. A formulae (5), which may be used to estimate the most efficient size of plot for any given experiment, has also been deduced. The cost of using plots of other than the most efficient size is indicated graphically in Fig. 7."

We are interested in finding patterns yielding the least limiting variance of the observed values, when the points are situated within a circle with infinitely increasing radius. In section 4, a solution is presented for the correlation function (3.5) and some ranges of point densities. The solution is obtained by solving the related geometrical problem of covering a plane by circles in such a way that the circles mutually intersect as little as possible (see section 3). From the results obtained it follows that, in contradistinction to the linear case, no unique pattern of points is optimum for all convex correlation functions simultaneously. The efficiency of patterns in general use is, however, quite good. In section 5, finally, we study a subclass of convex correlation functions of an isotropic plane process, consisting of functions that admit a spectral representation in terms of the simple correlation function (5.2)."

Such descriptions are too often the mere multiplication of examples, the working out of the same ideas upon other material without any enlargement of the philosophical concepts involved. Not the least of the debts which we owe to the Danish school of plant geographers and ecologists is that they have not been content to be merely imitators, but have extended the boundaries of our knowledge. In particular, we owe to Warming and Raunkiaer the recognition of the importance of autecological studies of which biology stands in such need to-day. But to Raunkiaer we also owe the application of exact quantitative methods to the analysis of vegetation and the statistical treatment of plant communities. The translation of Raunkiaer's works into English is therefore particularly welcome, since the original papers written in Danish have only been known to many workers from summaries.The Life Forms of Plants and Statistical Plant Geography: being the Collected Papers of C.

In both cases, the field (iv) is defined onZv, and (v) at anyx\u03b5Zv, takes on one of two states. The current paper shows that a MRF is a GRF and vice versa even when (i)\u2212(v) are relaxed, i.e., even if one relaxes translation invariance, replaces first order bykth order, allows for many states and replaces finite domains of Zv by arbitrary finite sets. This is achieved at the expense of using a many body rather than a pair potential, which turns out to be natural even in the classical (nearest neighbor) case when Zv is replaced by a triangular lattice."

Hammersley and Clifford [3] proved the same result for the more general case when the domain is the set of sites of an arbitrary finite graph and the number of possible states for each site is finite. In order to show this, they extended the notion of a Gibbs ensemble to embrace more complex interactions than occur on the cubic lattice. Their method was circuitous and showed merely the existence of a potential function for a Markov field with little indication of its form. In [4], Preston gives a more direct approach to the two-state problem and presents an explicit formula for the potential. We show here that the equivalence of Markov fields and Gibbs ensembles follows immediately from a very simple application of the Mobius inversion theorem of [5] which allows us to construct a natural expression for the potential function of a Markov field. We confine our attention to the set of sites of an arbitrary finite graph and allow each site to be in any one of a countable set of states. The two-state solution of Preston emerges as a corollary."

There is then no longer any degeneracy associated with the conditional probability models. This is the approach taken in the present paper. It has been made possible by the advent of the celebrated Hammersley-Clifford theorem which, sadly, has remained unpublished by its authors. Finally, in this section, we examine the problems and implications of deriving the joint probability structure associated with the site variables, given their individual conditional distributions. We no longer restrict attention to \"nearest-neighbour\" models nor even to lattice schemes but instead consider a fairly arbitary system of sites. Suppose then that we are concerned with afinite collection of random variables, Xi, ..., X., which are associated with sites labelled 1, ..., n, respectively. For each site, P(Xi jX 1, ...,) xi-, lxi+i xn), the conditional distribution fXi, given all other site values, is specified and we require the joint probability distribution fthe variables. Our terminology will be appropriate o discrete variables but the arguments equally extend to the continuous case. We make the following important assumption: if xi, ..., xn can individually occur at the sites 1, . .., n, respectively, then they can occur together. Formally, if P(xi) > O for each i, then P(x1, .. ., xn) > 0. This is called the positivity condition by Hammersley and Clifford (1971) and will be assumed throughout the present paper."
