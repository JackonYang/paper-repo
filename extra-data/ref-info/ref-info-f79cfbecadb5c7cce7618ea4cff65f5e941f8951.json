Several document analysis tasks require merging or splitting certain document elements to form others. The suitability of the commonly used precision and recall for such division/aggregation tasks is arguable, since their underlying assumption is that the granularity of the items at input is the same as at output. We propose a new pair of evaluation metrics that better suit document analysis\u2019 needs and show their application to several table tasks. In the process, we present a number of robust table location algorithms with which we draw a road-map for creating Hidden Markov Models for the task."

The scope of the approach is to recognize tables contained in PDF documents as a 2-dimensional grid on a Cartesian plane and extract them as a set of cells equipped by 2-dimensional coordinates. Experiments, carried out on a dataset composed of tables contained in documents coming from different domains, shows that the approach is well performing in recognizing table cells.The approach aims at improving PDF document annotation and information extraction by providing an output that can be further processed for understanding table and document contents."

Unfortunately, the lack of standard, ground-truthed datasets coupled with the ambiguous nature of how humans interpret tabular data has made it difficult to compare the obtained results between different systems developed by different research groups.\n With reference to these approaches, we describe our experiences in comparing our algorithm for table detection and structure recognition to another recently published system using a freely available dataset of 75 PDF documents. Based on examples from this dataset, we define several classes of errors and propose how they can be treated consistently to eliminate ambiguities and ensure the repeatability of the results and their comparability between different systems from different research groups."

Past experience with standard datasets providing ground-truth for character recognition and page segmentation tasks supports this belief. In the process of attempting to evaluate several table recognition algorithms we have been developing, however, we have uncovered a number of serious hurdles connected with the ground-truthing of tables. This problem may, in fact, be much more difficult than it appears. We present a detailed analysis of why table ground-truthing is so hard, including the notions that there may exist more than one acceptable \"truth\" and/or incomplete or partial \"truths\"."

The thesis offers a formal description of the table and the description and evaluation of a system which provides instances of that model for table examples. There are three parts to the thesis. The first looks at tables in general terms, suggests where their complexities are to be found, and reviews the literature dealing with research into tables in other fields. The second part introduces a layered model of the table and provides some notational equipment for encoding tables in these component layers. The final part discusses the design, implementation and evaluation of a system which produces an instance of the model for the tables found in a document. It also discusses the design and collection of a corpus of tables used for the training and evaluation of the system. The thesis catalogues a laxge number of phenomena discovered in the corpus collected during the research and provides appropriate terminology."

Today, quite a large number of different approaches facing these tasks have been described in literature or are available as part of commercial OCR systems that claim to deal with tables on the scanned documents and to treat them accordingly.\n However, the problem of detecting tables is not yet solved at all. Different approaches have different strengths and weak points. Some fail in certain situations or layouts where others perform better. How shall one know, which approach or system is the best for his specific job? The answer to this question raises the demand for an objective comparison of different approaches which address the same task of spotting tables and recognizing their structure.\n This paper describes our approach towards establishing a complete and publicly available, hence open environment for the benchmarking of table spotting and structural analysis. We provide free access to the ground truthing tool and evaluation mechanism described in this paper, describe the ideas behind and we also provide ground truth for the 547 documents of the UNLV and UW-3 datasets that contain tables.\n In addition, we applied the quality measures to the results that were generated by the T-Recs system which we developed some years ago and which we started to further advance since a few months."

While techniques for evaluating the performance of lower-level document analysis tasks such as optical character recognition have gained acceptance in the literature, attempts to formalize the problem for higher-level algorithms, while receiving a fair amount of attention in terms of theory, have generally been less successful in practice, perhaps owing to their complexity. In this paper, we introduce intuitive, easy-to-implement evaluation schemes for the related problems of table detection and table structure recognition. We also present the results of several small experiments, demonstrating how well the methodologies work and the useful sorts of feedback they provide. We first consider the table detection problem. Here algorithms can yield various classes of errors, including non-table regions improperly labeled as tables (insertion errors), tables missed completely (deletion errors), larger tables broken into a number of smaller ones (splitting errors), and groups of smaller tables combined to form larger ones (merging errors). This leads naturally to the use of an edit distance approach for assessing the results of table detection. Next we address the problem of evaluating table structure recognition. Our model is based on a directed acyclic attribute graph, or table DAG. We describe a new paradigm, \u201cgraph probing,\u201d for comparing the results returned by the recognition system and the representation created during ground-truthing. Probing is in fact a general concept that could be applied to other document recognition tasks as well."

Therefore we developed a complete benchmarking environment, containing a user front-end to acquire ground truth data as well as mechanisms to evaluate the quality of the recognition results. The tasks involved in the analysis systems were the locating of table regions, identification of cells and mapping of cells to rows and columns. This paper presents our approach towards the comparison of recognition results with the ground truth. The established definitions of recall and precision did not meet our requirements, as we wanted to register even smallest improvements (or changes in general) in the results, even when both results were imperfect. We therefore extended the measures recall and precision in order to deal with recognition probabilities of objects rather than just with Boolean values."

In contrast, programs that filter text streams, software that categorizes documents, agents which alert users, and many other IR systems must make decisions without human input or supervision. It is important to define what constitutes good effectiveness for these autonomous systems, tune the systems to achieve the highest possible effectiveness, and estimate how the effectiveness changes as new data is processed. We show how to do this for binary text classification systems, emphasizing that different goals for the system le ad to different optimal behaviors. Optimizing and estimating effectiveness is greatly aided if classifiers that explicitly estimate the probability of class membership are used. Ranked retrieval is the information retrieval (IR) researc her\u2019s favorite tool for dealing with information overload. Ranked retrieval systems display documents in order of probability of releva nce or some similar measure. Users see the best documents first, anddecide how far down the ranking to go in examining the available information. The central role played by ranking in this appr oach has led researchers to evaluate IR systems primarily, often exclusively, on the quality of their rankings. (See, for instance , the TREC evaluations [1].) In some IR applications, however, ranking is not enough: A company provides an SDI (selective dissemination of information) service which filters newswire feeds. Relevant articles are faxed each morning to clients. Interaction between customer and system takes place infrequently. The cost of resources (tying up phone lines, fax machine paper, etc.) is a factor to consider in operating the system. A text categorization system assigns controlled vocabulary categories to incoming documents as they are stored in a text database. Cost cutting has eliminated manual checking of category assignments."

A generic model is designed to support the different stages of tabular composition, including the editing of logical structure, the specification of layout structure, and the formatting of concrete tables. The model separates table's logical structure from its layout structure, which consists of tabular topology and typographic style. The notion of an abstract table, which describes the logical relationships among tabular items, is formally defined and a set of logical operations is proposed to manipulate tables based on these logical relationships. An abstract table can be visualized through a layout structure specified by a set of topological rules, which determine the relative placement of tabular items in two dimensions, and a set of style rules, which determine the final appearance of different items. The absolute placement of a concrete table can be automatically generated by applying a layout specification to an abstract line. An NP-complete problem arises in the formatting process that uses automatic line breaking and determines the physical dimension of a table to satisfy user-specified size constraints. An algorithm has been designed to solve the formatting problem in polynomial time for typical tables. Based on the tabular model, a prototype tabular composition system has been implemented in a UNIX, X Windows environment. This prototype provides an interactive interface to edit the logical structure, the topology and the styles of tables. It allows us to manipulate tables based on the logical relationships tabular items, regardless of where the items are placed in the layout structure, and capable of presenting a table in different topologies and styles so that we can select a high-quality layout structure."
