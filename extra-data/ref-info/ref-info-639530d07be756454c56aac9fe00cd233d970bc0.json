For text detection, a region-based method utilizing multiple features and cascade AdaBoost classifier is adopted. For text localization, a window grouping method integrating text line competition analysis is used to generate text lines. Then within each text line, local binarization is used to extract candidate connected components (CCs) and non-text CCs are filtered out by Markov Random Fields (MRF) model, through which text line can be localized accurately. Experiments on the public benchmark ICDAR 2003 Robust Reading and Text Locating Dataset show that our system is comparable to the best existing methods both in accuracy and speed."

The MST is obtained from the graph, since sets of similar regions are the most significant factors in texts extraction techniques.

The main result is that the leading 2005 entry has improved significantly on the leading 2003 entry, with an increase in average f-score from 0.5 to 0.62, where the f-score is the same adapted information retrieval measure used for the 2003 competition. The paper also discusses the Web-based deployment and evaluation of text locating systems, and one of the leading entries has now been deployed in this way. This mode of usage could lead to more complete and more immediate knowledge of the strengths and weaknesses of each newly developed system."

Digital cameras attached to cellular phones, PDAs, or wearable computers, and standalone image or video devices are highly mobile and easy to use; they can capture images of thick books, historical manuscripts too fragile to touch, and text in scenes, making them much more versatile than desktop scanners. Should robust solutions to the analysis of documents captured with such devices become available, there will clearly be a demand in many domains. Traditional scanner-based document analysis techniques provide us with a good reference and starting point, but they cannot be used directly on camera-captured images. Camera-captured images can suffer from low resolution, blur, and perspective distortion, as well as complex layout and interaction of the content and background. In this paper we present a survey of application domains, technical challenges, and solutions for the analysis of documents captured by digital cameras. We begin by describing typical imaging devices and the imaging process. We discuss document analysis from a single camera-captured image as well as multiple frames and highlight some sample applications under development and feasible ideas for future development."

The proposed face detection integrates information over image space and scale because the face can be recognized even if a small warp is applied. We must calibrate raw classifier outputs for information integration. Two salient contributions of this paper are calibration for a boosted cascade classifier and a distribution-based face detection. We first propose a new calibration method that converts the raw classifier outputs into posterior probabilities. This calibration method enables us to obtain a \"Face Likelihood Distribution \"from an input scene. The second contribution is the distribution-based face detection, which evaluates the local face likelihood distribution over space and scale. In contrast, existing methods evaluate the face similarity value only at that point, which causes misdetection. Experimental results using 170 input scenes, which might or might not include faces, show that the proposed method improves the detection rate by about 5%."

Conditional random fields offer several advantages over hidden Markov models and stochastic grammars for such tasks, including the ability to relax strong independence assumptions made in those models. Conditional random fields also avoid a fundamental limitation of maximum entropy Markov models (MEMMs) and other discriminative Markov models based on directed graphical models, which can be biased towards states with few successor states. We present iterative parameter estimation algorithms for conditional random fields and compare the performance of the resulting models to HMMs and MEMMs on synthetic and natural-language data."

One of the particular problems of interest is minimum error classification in which the misclassification probability is to be minimized based on a given set of training samples. In this paper, we propose a new formulation for the minimum error classification problem, together with a fundamental technique for designing a classifier that approaches the objective of minimum classification error in a more direct manner than traditional methods. We contrast the new method to several traditional classifier designs in typical experiments to demonstrate the superiority of the new learning formulation. The method can be applied to other classifier structures as well. Experimental results pertaining to a speech recognition task are also provided to show the effectiveness of the new technique."

The major restriction is that the energy function's smoothness term must only involve pairs of pixels. We propose two algorithms that use graph cuts to compute a local minimum even when very large moves are allowed. The first move we consider is an /spl alpha/-/spl beta/-swap: for a pair of labels /spl alpha/,/spl beta/, this move exchanges the labels between an arbitrary set of pixels labeled a and another arbitrary set labeled /spl beta/. Our first algorithm generates a labeling such that there is no swap move that decreases the energy. The second move we consider is an /spl alpha/-expansion: for a label a, this move assigns an arbitrary set of pixels the label /spl alpha/. Our second algorithm, which requires the smoothness term to be a metric, generates a labeling such that there is no expansion move that decreases the energy. Moreover, this solution is within a known factor of the global minimum. We experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on image restoration, stereo and motion."

We show that such problems can be formalized in the framework of sequential decision-making. If the false positive and false negative error rates are given, the optimal strategy in terms of the shortest average time to decision (number of measurements used) is the Wald's sequential probability ratio test (SPRT). We built on the optimal SPRT test and enlarge its capabilities to problems with dependent measurements. We show how to overcome the requirements of SPRT - (i) a priori ordered measurements and (ii) known joint probability density functions. We propose an algorithm with near optimal time and error rate trade-off, called WaldBoost, which integrates the AdaBoost algorithm for measurement selection and ordering and the joint probability density estimation with the optimal SPRT decision strategy. The WaldBoost algorithm is tested on the face detection problem. The results are superior to the state-of-the-art methods in the average evaluation time and comparable in detection rates."

The focus this time is on graph algorithms, which are increasingly critical for a wide range of applications, such as network connectivity, circuit design, scheduling, transaction processing, and resource allocation. In this book, Sedgewick offers the same successful blend of theory and practice with concise implementations that can be tested on real applications, which has made his work popular with programmers for many years. Algorithms in C, Third Edition, Part 5: Graph Algorithms is the second book in Sedgewick's thoroughly revised and rewritten series. The first book, Parts 1-4, addresses fundamental algorithms, data structures, sorting, and searching. A forthcoming third book will focus on strings, geometry, and a range of advanced algorithms. Each book's expanded coverage features new algorithms and implementations, enhanced descriptions and diagrams, and a wealth of new exercises for polishing skills. A focus on abstract data types makes the programs more broadly useful and relevant for the modern object-oriented programming environment.Coverage includes: A complete overview of graph properties and types Diagraphs and DAGs Minimum spanning trees Shortest paths Network flows Diagrams, sample C code, and detailed algorithm descriptions The Web site for this book (http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~rs/) provides additional source code for programmers along with numerous support materials for educators.A landmark revision, Algorithms in C, Third Edition, Part 5 provides a complete tool set for programmers to implement, debug, and use graph algorithms across a wide range of computer applications."

Initially, strokes are grouped into text line strings according to off-stroke distances. Each text line string is segmented into text lines by dynamic programming (DP) optimizing a cost function trained by the minimum classification error (MCE) method. Over-segmented text lines are then merged with a support vector machine (SVM) classifier for making merge/non-merge decisions, and last, a spatial merge module corrects the segmentation errors caused by delayed strokes. In experiments on the TUAT Kondate database, the proposed approach achieves the Entity Detection Metric (EDM) rate of 0.8816, the Edit-Distance Rate (EDR) of 0.1234, which demonstrates the superiority of our approach."
