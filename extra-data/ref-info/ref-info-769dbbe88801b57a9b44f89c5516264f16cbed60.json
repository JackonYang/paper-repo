It is shown that the leaving-one-out method in combination with the maximum likelihood criterion can be efficiently used for the optimal estimation of interpolation parameters.

The task of these distributions is to predict the probability of a new word by looking at M or even all predecessor words. The conventional approach is to limit M to 1 or 2 and to interpolate the resulting bigram and trigram models with a unigram model in a linear fashion. However, there are many other structures that can be used to model the probabilistic dependences between the predecessor word and the word to be predicted. The structures considered in this paper are: nonlinear interpolation as an alternative to linear interpolation; equivalence classes for word histories and single words; cache memory and word associations. For the optimal estimation of nonlinear and linear interpolation parameters, the leaving-one-out method is systematically used. For the determination of word equivalence classes in a bigram model, an automatic clustering procedure has been adapted. To capture long-distance dependences, we consider various models for word-by-word dependences; the cache model may be viewed as a special type of self-association. Experimental results are presented for two text databases, a Germany database and an English database."

A number of interesting differences from smoothing emerge. The insights gained from a probabilistic view of this problem point towards new directions for language modelling. The ideas of this paper are also applicable to other problems such as the modelling of triphomes in speech, and DNA and protein sequences in molecular biology. The new algorithm is compared with smoothing on a two million word corpus. The methods prove to be about equally accurate, with the hierarchical model using fewer computational resources."

Specifically, the problem is to estimate the probability that a given word will be the next word uttered. Algorithms are presented for automatically constructing a binary decision tree designed to estimate these probabilities. At each node of the tree there is a yes/no question relating to the words already spoken, and at each leaf there is a probability distribution over the allowable vocabulary. Ideally, these nodal questions can take the form of arbitrarily complex Boolean expressions, but computationally cheaper alternatives are also discussed. Some results obtained on a 5000-word vocabulary with a tree designed to predict the next word spoken from the preceding 20 words are included. The tree is compared to an equivalent trigram model and shown to be superior. >"

The probability scores are the novel contribution of this work. Probabilities are based on a noisy channel model. It is assumed that the typist knows what words he or she wants to type but some noise is added on the way to the keyboard (in the form of typos and spelling errors). Using a classic Bayesian argument of the kind that is popular in the speech recognition literature (Jelinek, 1985), one can often recover the intended correction, c, from a typo, t, by finding the correction c that maximizes Pr(c) Pr(t/c). The first factor, Pr(c), is a prior model of word probabilities; the second factor, Pr(t/c), is a model of the noisy channel that accounts for spelling transformations on letter sequences (e.g., insertions, delections, substitutions and reversals). Both sets of probabilities were trained on data collected from the Associated Press (AP) newswire. This text is ideally suited for this purpose since it contains a large number of typos (about two thousand per month)."

Although several methods have been used, their suitability has been on empirical evaluation rather than a well-founded model. The authors propose the application of a Poisson process model of novelty. Its ability to predict novel tokens is evaluated, and it consistently outperforms existing methods. It is applied to a practical statistical coding scheme, where a slight modification is required to avoid divergence. The result is a well-founded zero-frequency model that explains observed differences in the performance of existing methods, and offers a small improvement in the coding efficiency of text compression over the best method previously known. >"
