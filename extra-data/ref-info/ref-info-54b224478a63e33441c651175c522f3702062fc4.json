This paper presents a large-scale evaluation of an approach that represents images as distributions (signatures or histograms) of features extracted from a sparse set of keypoint locations and learns a Support Vector Machine classifier with kernels based on two effective measures for comparing distributions, the Earth Mover\u2019s Distance and the \u03c72 distance. We first evaluate the performance of our approach with different keypoint detectors and descriptors, as well as different kernels and classifiers. We then conduct a comparative evaluation with several state-of-the-art recognition methods on four texture and five object databases. On most of these databases, our implementation exceeds the best reported results and achieves comparable performance on the rest. Finally, we investigate the influence of background correlations on recognition performance via extensive tests on the PASCAL database, for which ground-truth object localization information is available. Our experiments demonstrate that image representations based on distributions of local features are surprisingly effective for classification of texture and object images under challenging real-world conditions, including significant intra-class variations and substantial background clutter."

Our approach considers object categorization and figure-ground segmentation as two interleaved processes that closely collaborate towards a common goal. As shown in our work, the tight coupling between those two processes allows them to benefit from each other and improve the combined performance.\n\nThe core part of our approach is a highly flexible learned representation for object shape that can combine the information observed on different training examples in a probabilistic extension of the Generalized Hough Transform. The resulting approach can detect categorical objects in novel images and automatically infer a probabilistic segmentation from the recognition result. This segmentation is then in turn used to again improve recognition by allowing the system to focus its efforts on object pixels and to discard misleading influences from the background. Moreover, the information from where in the image a hypothesis draws its support is employed in an MDL based hypothesis verification stage to resolve ambiguities between overlapping hypotheses and factor out the effects of partial occlusion.\n\nAn extensive evaluation on several large data sets shows that the proposed system is applicable to a range of different object categories, including both rigid and articulated objects. In addition, its flexible representation allows it to achieve competitive object detection performance already from training sets that are between one and two orders of magnitude smaller than those used in comparable systems.\n"

While categorization algorithms tend to agree in using local descriptors, they differ in the choice of the classifier, with some using generative models and others discriminative approaches. This paper presents a method for object category detection which integrates a generative model with a discriminative classifier. For each object category, we generate an appearance codebook, which becomes a common vocabulary for the generative and discriminative methods. Given a query image, the generative part of the algorithm finds a set of hypotheses and estimates their support in location and scale. Then, the discriminative part verifies each hypothesis on the same codebook activations. The new algorithm exploits the strengths of both original methods, minimizing their weaknesses. Experiments on several databases show that our new approach performs better than its building blocks taken separately. Moreover, experiments on two challenging multi-scale databases show that our new algorithm outperforms previously reported results"

Our primary focus is the development of a learning-based approach to the problem that makes use of a sparse, part-based representation. A vocabulary of distinctive object parts is automatically constructed from a set of sample images of the object class of interest; images are then represented using parts from this vocabulary, together with spatial relations observed among the parts. Based on this representation, a learning algorithm is used to automatically learn to detect instances of the object class in new images. The approach can be applied to any object with distinguishable parts in a relatively fixed spatial configuration; it is evaluated here on difficult sets of real-world images containing side views of cars, and is seen to successfully detect objects in varying conditions amidst background clutter and mild occlusion. In evaluating object detection approaches, several important methodological issues arise that have not been satisfactorily addressed in the previous work. A secondary focus of this paper is to highlight these issues, and to develop rigorous evaluation standards for the object detection problem. A critical evaluation of our approach under the proposed standards is presented."

Moreover, they offer an attractive compromise between information content and repeatability and encompass a wide variety of local shape structures. We also define a translation and scale invariant descriptor encoding the geometric configuration of the segments within a kAS, making kAS easy to reuse in other frameworks, for example, as a replacement or addition to interest points (IPs). Software for detecting and describing kAS is released at http://lear.inrialpes.fr/software. We demonstrate the high performance of kAS within a simple but powerful sliding-window object detection scheme. Through extensive evaluations, involving eight diverse object classes and more than 1,400 images, we (1) study the evolution of performance as the degree of feature complexity k varies and determine the best degree, (2) show that kAS substantially outperform IPs for detecting shape-based classes, and (3) compare our object detector to the recent state-of-the-art system by Dalal and Triggs (2005)."

This use of patches is equivalent to a fullyconnected part-based model, for which the presented approach offers an efficient procedure to determine the best fit. While other approaches that use fully connected models have a high complexity in the number of parts used, we achieve linear complexity in that variable, because we only allow RST-matchings. The presented approach is used for object recognition in images: by matching images that contain certain objects to a test image, we can detect whether the test image contains an object of that class or not. We evaluate this approach on the Caltech data and obtain very competitive results."

As in that work, we first apply Gabor filters at all positions and scales; feature complexity and position/scale invariance are then built up by alternating template matching and max pooling operations. We refine the approach in several biologically plausible ways, using simple versions of sparsification and lateral inhibition. We demonstrate the value of retaining some position and scale information above the intermediate feature level. Using feature selection we arrive at a model that performs better with fewer features. Our final model is tested on the Caltech 101 object categories and the UIUC car localization task, in both cases achieving state-of-the-art performance. The results strengthen the case for using this class of model in computer vision."

A classifier is then learned for each of these parts, and feature selection is used to determine the most discriminative ones. This approach allows robust pan detection, and it is invariant under scale changes-that is, neither the training images nor the test images have to be normalized. The proposed method is evaluated in car detection tasks with significant variations in viewing conditions, and promising results are demonstrated. Different local regions, classifiers and feature selection methods are quantitatively compared. Our evaluation shows that local invariant descriptors are an appropriate representation for object classes such as cars, and it underlines the importance of feature selection."

The model is scale and translation invariant. In the training phase, image regions that optimize an objective function are automatically located in the training images, without requiring any user annotation such as bounding boxes. The objective function measures visual similarity between training image pairs, using the spatial distribution of both appearance patches and edges. The optimization is initialized using discriminative features. The model enables the detection (localization) of multiple instances of the object class in test images, and can be used as a precursor to training other visual models that require bounding box annotation. The detection performance of the model is assessed on the PASCAL Visual Object Classes Challenge 2006 test set. For a number of object classes the performance far exceeds the current state of the art of fully supervised methods."

First, we introduce a descriptor that represents local image shape and its spatial layout, together with a spatial pyramid kernel. These are designed so that the shape correspondence between two images can be measured by the distance between their descriptors using the kernel. Second, we generalize the spatial pyramid kernel, and learn its level weighting parameters (on a validation set). This significantly improves classification performance. Third, we show that shape and appearance kernels may be combined (again by learning parameters on a validation set).\n Results are reported for classification on Caltech-101 and retrieval on the TRECVID 2006 data sets. For Caltech-101 it is shown that the class specific optimization that we introduce exceeds the state of the art performance by more than 10%."

This technique works by partitioning the image into increasingly fine sub-regions and computing histograms of local features found inside each sub-region. The resulting \"spatial pyramid\" is a simple and computationally efficient extension of an orderless bag-of-features image representation, and it shows significantly improved performance on challenging scene categorization tasks. Specifically, our proposed method exceeds the state of the art on the Caltech-101 database and achieves high accuracy on a large database of fifteen natural scene categories. The spatial pyramid framework also offers insights into the success of several recently proposed image descriptions, including Torralba\u2019s \"gist\" and Lowe\u2019s SIFT descriptors."

After reviewing existing edge and gradient based descriptors, we show experimentally that grids of histograms of oriented gradient (HOG) descriptors significantly outperform existing feature sets for human detection. We study the influence of each stage of the computation on performance, concluding that fine-scale gradients, fine orientation binning, relatively coarse spatial binning, and high-quality local contrast normalization in overlapping descriptor blocks are all important for good results. The new approach gives near-perfect separation on the original MIT pedestrian database, so we introduce a more challenging dataset containing over 1800 annotated human images with a large range of pose variations and backgrounds."

An entropy-based feature detector is used to select regions and their scale within the image. In learning the parameters of the scale-invariant object model are estimated. This is done using expectation-maximization in a maximum-likelihood setting. In recognition, this model is used in a Bayesian manner to classify images.

We achieve this using a model developed in the statistical text literature: probabilistic latent semantic analysis (pLSA). In text analysis, this is used to discover topics in a corpus using the bag-of-words document representation. Here we treat object categories as topics, so that an image containing instances of several categories is modeled as a mixture of topics. The model is applied to images by using a visual analogue of a word, formed by vector quantizing SIFT-like region descriptors. The topic discovery approach successfully translates to the visual domain: for a small set of objects, we show that both the object categories and their approximate spatial layout are found without supervision. Performance of this unsupervised method is compared to the supervised approach of Fergus et al. (2003) on a set of unseen images containing only one object per image. We also extend the bag-of-words vocabulary to include 'doublets' which encode spatially local co-occurring regions. It is demonstrated that this extended vocabulary gives a cleaner image segmentation. Finally, the classification and segmentation methods are applied to a set of images containing multiple objects per image. These results demonstrate that we can successfully build object class models from an unsupervised analysis of images."

This paper shows that support vector machines (SVM's) can generalize well on difficult image classification problems where the only features are high dimensional histograms. Heavy-tailed RBF kernels of the form K(x, y) = e(-rho)Sigma(i)/xia-yia/b with a < or = 1 and b < or = 2 are evaluated on the classification of images extracted from the Corel stock photo collection and shown to far outperform traditional polynomial or Gaussian radial basis function (RBF) kernels. Moreover, we observed that a simple remapping of the input x(i)-->x(i)(a) improves the performance of linear SVM's to such an extend that it makes them, for this problem, a valid alternative to RBF kernels."

The object is represented by a set of viewpoint invariant region descriptors so that recognition can proceed successfully despite changes in viewpoint, illumination and partial occlusion. The temporal continuity of the video within a shot is used to track the regions in order to reject unstable regions and reduce the effects of noise in the descriptors. The analogy with text retrieval is in the implementation where matches on descriptors are pre-computed (using vector quantization), and inverted file systems and document rankings are used. The result is that retrieved is immediate, returning a ranked list of key frames/shots in the manner of Google. The method is illustrated for matching in two full length feature films."

This emergent representation is then used to refine the lower-level object detection results. We evaluate the proposed method with data from Pascal VOC Challenge 2006 image classification and object detection competition. The proposed techniques for exploiting global classification results are found to significantly improve the accuracy of local object detection."

A retinally connected neural network examines small windows of an image, and decides whether each window contains a face. The system arbitrates between multiple networks to improve performance over a single network. We use a bootstrap algorithm for training, which adds false detections into the training set as training progresses. This eliminates the difficult task of manually selecting non-face training examples, which must be chosen to span the entire space of non-face images. Comparisons with another state-of-the-art face detection system are presented; our system has better performance in terms of detection and false-positive rates."
