Simulated annealing (e.g. Kirkpatrick et alo 1983, Bridle & Moore 1984, Ackley et al. 1985) is a stochastic computational technique for finding optimal solutions to combinatorial problems for which the combinatorial explosion phenomenon rules out the possibility of systematically examining each alternative. It is currently being applied to the practical problem of optimizing the physical design of computer circuitry, and to the theoretical problems of resolving patterns of auditory and visual stimulation into meaningful arrangements of phonemes and three-dimensional objects. Grammatical parsing -resolving unanalysed linear sequences of words into meaningful grammatical structures -can be regarded as a perception problem logically analogous to those just cited, and simulated annealing holds great promise as a parsing technique."

The present book seems in part responsive to this program, having the same title as Bar-Hillel (1964). 3. See papers collected in Hintikka and Suppes (1970). 4. Dretske (1981), Israel and Perry (forthcoming). Peer commentary in Dretske (1983), especially that of Haber, did not accept Dretske's attempted analogies to the metrics of Shannon and Weaver. The notion of \"information pickup\" implies a preestablished harmony of the world and the mind, disregarding the well-known arbitrariness of language. 5. While Fodor (1986) does gives a cogent criticism of attempts to locate information \"in the world\", the alternative \"intentional\" conception that he advocates relies on questionable assumptions of an \"internal code\" wherein such information is \"encoded\". The problem, of course, lies in unpacking this metaphor. Falling into the custom of taking the computational metaphor of mind literally, he resuscitates our old familiar homunculus (in computational disguise as the \"executive\") to provide a way out of the problem of node labels being of higher logical type than the nodes that they label. A simpler resolution follows from Harris's recognition that natural language has no :separate metalanguage. See also Fodor (forthcoming). 6. See especially Harris (1982), and Harris, Gottfried, Ryckman, et al. (in press). 7. This thus cuts deeper than the naive rule-counting metrics for adjudication of grammars advocated not so long ago by generativists (see Ryckman 1986). 8. This work is reported in depth in Harris et al. (in press). These science languages occupy a place between natural language and mathematics, the chief difference from the former being that operator-argument likelihoods are much more strongly defined, amounting in most cases to simple binary selection rather than a graded scale. One of the many interesting aspects of this research is determining empirically the form of argumentation in science. The logical apparatus of deduction and other forms of inference are required only for various uses to which language may be put, rather than being the semantic basis for natural language, as has sometimes been claimed. 9. This is a refinement of the notion of distributional meaning developed in, e.g., Harris (1954). 10. The case of zero likelihood is covered by the word classes of the first constraint. 11. An example is the elision of one of a small set of operators including appear, arrive, show up, which have high likelihood under expect, in I expect John momentarily. The adverb momentarily can only modify the elided to arrive, etc., since neither expect nor John is asserted to be momentary. The infinitive to, the suffix -ly, and the status of momentarily as a modifier are the results of other reductions that are described in detail in Harris (1982). 12. For a computer implementation, see Johnson (1987). I am grateful to Tom Ryckman for helpful comments on an early draft of this review. THE COMPUTATIONAL ANALYSIS OF ENGLISH: A CORPUS-BASED APPROACH"
