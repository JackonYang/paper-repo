It is shown that documents have an obvious hierarchical structure in their geometry which is represented by a tree. A small number of rules are introduced to transform the geometric structure into the logical structure which represents the semantics. The virtual field separator technique is employed to utilize the information carried by special constituents of documents such as field separators and frames, keeping the number of transformation rules small. Experimental results on a variety of document formats have shown that the proposed method is applicable to most of the documents commonly encountered in daily use, although there is still room for further refinement of the transformation rules.<<ETX>>"

Several critical functions have been investigated and the technical approaches are discussed. The first is the segmentation and classification of digitized printed documents into regions of text and images. A nonlinear, run-length smoothing algorithm has been used for this purpose. By using the regular features of text lines, a linear adaptive classification scheme discriminates text regions from others. The second technique studied is an adaptive approach to the recognition of the hundreds of font styles and sizes that can occur on printed documents. A preclassifier is constructed during the input process and used to speed up a well-known pattern-matching method for clustering characters from an arbitrary print source into a small sample of prototypes. Experimental results are included."

Out of all the functions required for the entire process from document scanning through recognition, these have been investigated and implemented: skew detection and correction, region (block) segmentation, and mathematical expression recognition. The algorithms have been designed for high speed as much as possible. This experimental system is implemented entirely in software on a work station under X-windows.

                "text": "A system for interpretation of images of paper-based line drawings is described. Since a typical drawing contains both text strings and graphics, an algorithm has been developed to locate and separate text strings of various font sizes, styles, and orientations. This is accomplished by applying the Hough transform to the centroids of connected components in the image. The graphics in the segmented image are processed to represent thin entities by their core-lines and thick objects by their boundaries. The core-lines and boundaries are segmented into straight line segments and curved lines. The line segments and their interconnections are analyzed to locate minimum redundancy loops which are adequate to generate a succinct description of the graphics. Such a description includes the location and attributes of simple polygonal shapes, circles, and interconnecting lines, and a description of the spatial relationships and occlusions among them. Hatching and filling patterns are also identified. The performance of the system is evaluated using several test images, and the results are presented. The superiority of these algorithms in generating meaningful interpretations of graphics, compared to conventional data compression schemes, is clear from these results. >"

A description is given of an efficient method for recognition of these loop-structured symbols. The proposed method consists of two processes: symbol segmentation and symbol identification. Symbol identification is achieved by a powerful hybrid method which uses heuristics to mediate between template matching and feature extraction. The entire symbol recognition process is carried out under a decision-tree control strategy. The entire recognition system for circuit diagrams is briefly explained, including character string recognition and connecting line analysis. >"
