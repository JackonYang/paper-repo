Examples of the content we use include color, texture, and shape of image objects and regions. Potential applications include medical (`Give me other images that contain a tumor with a texture like this one'), photo-journalism (`Give me images that have blue at the top and red at the bottom'), and many others in art, fashion, cataloging, retailing, and industry. Key issues include derivation and computation of attributes of images and objects that provide useful query functionality, retrieval methods based on similarity as opposed to exact match, query by image example or user drawn image, the user interfaces, query refinement and navigation, high dimensional database indexing, and automatic and semi-automatic database population. We currently have a prototype system written in X/Motif and C running on an RS/6000 that allows a variety of queries, and a test database of over 1000 images and 1000 objects populated from commercially available photo clip art images. In this paper we present the main algorithms for color texture, shape and sketch query that we use, show example query results, and discuss future directions."

New tools are needed to help users create, manage, and retrieve images from these collections. We are developing QBIC (query by image content), a prototype system that allows a user to create and query image databases in which the image content -- the colors, textures, shapes, and layout of images and the objects they contain -- is used as the basis of queries. This paper describes two sets of algorithms in QBIC. The first are methods that allow `query by color drawing,' a form of query in which a user draws an approximate color version of an image, and similar images are retrieved. These are automatic algorithms in the sense that no user action is necessary during database population. Secondly, we describe algorithms for semi-automatic identification of image objects during database population, improving the speed and usability of this manually-intensive step. Once outlined, detailed queries on the content-properties of these individual objects can be made at query time."

These images do not represent one discrete moment of time, as do a photograph or single video frame. Rather, one image reflects the aggregate of the temporal changes that occur in a moving image sequence with the salient features preserved. By the application of an affine transformation and non-linear temporal processing, multiple frames of an image sequence, which may include variations in focal-length or field-of-view, are combined to create a single still image. The still image may have multi-resolution patches, a larger field-of-view, or higher overall resolution than any individual frame in the original image sequence. It may also contain selected salient objects from any one of the sequence of video frames. The still can be created automatically or with user intervention.

The dominant background changes in the image plane mostly due to camera operations and motion (zoom, pan, tilt, track etc.). We address the problem of computation of the dominant image transformation over time and demonstrate how this can be effectively used for efficient video representation through video mosaicing and image registration. We formulate the problem of dominant component estimation as that of model based robust estimation using M estimators with direct, multi resolution methods. In addition to 2D affine and plane projective models, that have been used in the past for describing image motion using direct methods, we also employ a true 3D model of motion and scene structure imaged with uncalibrated cameras. This model parameterizes the image motion as that due to a planar component and a parallax component. For rigid 3D scenes imaged under camera motion only, least squares (LS) methods with the plane and parallax parameterization are also presented. Furthermore, in the context of robust estimation, in contrast with previous approaches for similar problems, our algorithm employs an automatic computation of a scale parameter that is crucial in rejecting the non dominant components as outliers.<<ETX>>"

These tools allow the user's creativity to directly interact with the essential features of each video by offering spatial and temporal clues. This paper introduces the basic concept and describes prototype versions of the tools as implemented in a video handling system.

One such representation, called layered representation, has recently been proposed. Although a number of algorithms have been developed for computing these representations, there has not been a consolidated effort into developing a precise mathematical formulation of the problem. This paper presents one such formulation based on maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) of mixture models and the minimum description length (MDL) encoding principle. The three major issues in layered motion representation are: (i) how many motion models adequately describe image motion, (ii) what are the motion model parameters, and (iii) what is the spatial support layer for each motion model.<<ETX>>"

The image sequence can be decomposed into a set of overlapping layers, where each layer's motion is described by a smooth flow field. The discontinuities in the description are then attributed to object opacities rather than to the flow itself, mirroring the structure of the scene. A set of techniques is devised for segmenting images into coherently moving regions using affine motion analysis and clustering techniques. It is possible to decompose an image into a set of layers along with information about occlusion and depth ordering. The techniques are applied to a flower garden sequence. The scene can be analyzed into four layers, and, the entire 30-frame sequence can be represented with a single image of each layer, along with associated motion parameters.<<ETX>>"
