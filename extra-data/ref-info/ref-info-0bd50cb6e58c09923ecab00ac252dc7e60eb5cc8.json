However, there are still many questions about the best way to learn such extractors. In this paper we investigate four orthogonal improvements: integrating named entity linking (NEL) and coreference resolution into argument identification for training and extraction, enforcing type constraints of linked arguments, and partitioning the model by relation type signature. We evaluate sentential extraction performance on two datasets: the popular set of NY Times articles partially annotated by Hoffmann et al. (2011) and a new dataset, called GORECO, that is comprehensively annotated for 48 common relations. We find that using NEL for argument identification boosts performance over the traditional approach (named entity recognition with string match), and there is further improvement from using argument types. Our best system boosts precision by 44% and recall by 70%."

Separately, there have been active pursuits in leveraging databases for distant supervision in information extraction, yet such methods are often limited to binary relations and none can handle nested events. In this paper, we generalize distant supervision to complex knowledge extraction, by proposing the first approach to learn a semantic parser for extracting nested event structures without annotated examples, using only a database of such complex events and unannotated text. The key idea is to model the annotations as latent variables, and incorporate a prior that favors semantic parses containing known events. Experiments on the GENIA event extraction dataset show that our approach can learn from and extract complex biological pathway events. Moreover, when supplied with just five example words per event type, it becomes competitive even among supervised systems, outperforming 19 out of 24 teams that participated in the original shared task."

Knowledge-based weak supervision, using structured data to heuristically label a training corpus, works towards this goal by enabling the automated learning of a potentially unbounded number of relation extractors. Recently, researchers have developed multi-instance learning algorithms to combat the noisy training data that can come from heuristic labeling, but their models assume relations are disjoint --- for example they cannot extract the pair Founded(Jobs, Apple) and CEO-of(Jobs, Apple). \n \nThis paper presents a novel approach for multi-instance learning with overlapping relations that combines a sentence-level extraction model with a simple, corpus-level component for aggregating the individual facts. We apply our model to learn extractors for NY Times text using weak supervision from Free-base. Experiments show that the approach runs quickly and yields surprising gains in accuracy, at both the aggregate and sentence level."

However, this introduces a challenging learning scenario where the relation expressed by a pair of entities found in a sentence is unknown. For example, a sentence containing Balzac and France may express BornIn or Died, an unknown relation, or no relation at all. Because of this, traditional supervised learning, which assumes that each example is explicitly mapped to a label, is not appropriate. We propose a novel approach to multi-instance multi-label learning for RE, which jointly models all the instances of a pair of entities in text and all their labels using a graphical model with latent variables. Our model performs competitively on two difficult domains."

We investigate an alternative paradigm that does not require labeled corpora, avoiding the domain dependence of ACE-style algorithms, and allowing the use of corpora of any size. Our experiments use Freebase, a large semantic database of several thousand relations, to provide distant supervision. For each pair of entities that appears in some Freebase relation, we find all sentences containing those entities in a large unlabeled corpus and extract textual features to train a relation classifier. Our algorithm combines the advantages of supervised IE (combining 400,000 noisy pattern features in a probabilistic classifier) and unsupervised IE (extracting large numbers of relations from large corpora of any domain). Our model is able to extract 10,000 instances of 102 relations at a precision of 67.6%. We also analyze feature performance, showing that syntactic parse features are particularly helpful for relations that are ambiguous or lexically distant in their expression."

As relations might be mentioned across sentences, inter-sentence information can be leveraged to improve distantly supervised relation extraction. To effectively exploit inter-sentence information, we propose a ranking based approach, which first learns a scoring function based on a listwise learning-to-rank model and then uses it for multi-label relation extraction. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of our method for aggregating information across sentences. Additionally, to further improve the ranking of high-quality extractions, we propose an effective method to rank relations from different entity pairs. This method can be easily integrated into our overall relation extraction framework, and boosts the precision significantly.\n \n"

The majority of this knowledge is scattered in the vast and rapidly growing research literature. To automate knowledge extraction, machine learning approaches typically require annotated examples, which are expensive and time-consuming to acquire. Recently, there has been increasing interest in leveraging databases for distant supervision in knowledge extraction, but existing applications focus almost exclusively on newswire domains. In this paper, we present the first attempt to formulate the distant supervision problem for pathway extraction and apply a state-of-the-art method to extracting pathway interactions from PubMed abstracts. Experiments show that distant supervision can effectively compensate for the lack of annotation, attaining an accuracy approaching supervised results. From 22 million PubMed abstracts, we extracted 1.5 million pathway interactions at a precision of 25%. More than 10% of interactions are mentioned in the context of one or more cancer types, analysis of which yields interesting insights."

Recent approaches have used existing knowledge bases to learn to extract information with promising results, one of those approaches being distant supervision. Distant supervision is an unsupervised method which uses background information from the Linking Open Data cloud to automatically label sentences with relations to create training data for relation classifiers. In this paper we propose the use of distant supervision for relation extraction from the Web. Although the method is promising, existing approaches are still not suitable for Web extraction as they suffer from three main issues: data sparsity, noise and lexical ambiguity. Our approach reduces the impact of data sparsity by making entity recognition tools more robust across domains and extracting relations across sentence boundaries using unsupervised co- reference resolution methods. We reduce the noise caused by lexical ambiguity by employing statistical methods to strategically select training data. To combine information extracted from multiple sources for populating knowledge bases we present and evaluate several information integration strategies and show that those benefit immensely from additional relation mentions extracted using co-reference resolution, increasing precision by 8%. We further show that strategically selecting training data can increase precision by a further 3%."

After initially focusing on recognizing proteins and binary interactions, the community has recently shifted their attention to the more ambitious task of recognizing complex, nested event structures. State-of-the-art systems use a pipeline architecture in which the candidate events are identified first, and subsequently the arguments. This fails to leverage joint inference among events and arguments for mutual disambiguation. Some joint approaches have been proposed, but they still lag much behind in accuracy. In this paper, we present the first joint approach for bio-event extraction that obtains state-of-the-art results. Our system is based on Markov logic and adopts a novel formulation by jointly predicting events and arguments, as well as individual dependency edges that compose the argument paths. On the BioNLP'09 Shared Task dataset, it reduced F1 errors by more than 10% compared to the previous best joint approach."

This paper describes a SVM-based approach to relation extraction that is applied to both types. Adapted features and techniques for counter-acting bias in SVM models are used to deal with specific issues that arise in the inter-sentential case. It was found that the structured features used for intrasentential relation extraction can be easily adapted for the inter-sentential case and provides comparable performance."

Machine learning approaches to this task require either manual annotation or, in the case of distant supervision, existing structured sources of the same schema. The need for existing datasets can be avoided by using a universal schema: the union of all involved schemas (surface form predicates as in OpenIE, and relations in the schemas of preexisting databases). This schema has an almost unlimited set of relations (due to surface forms), and supports integration with existing structured data (through the relation types of existing databases). To populate a database of such schema we present matrix factorization models that learn latent feature vectors for entity tuples and relations. We show that such latent models achieve substantially higher accuracy than a traditional classification approach. More importantly, by operating simultaneously on relations observed in text and in pre-existing structured DBs such as Freebase, we are able to reason about unstructured and structured data in mutually-supporting ways. By doing so our approach outperforms stateof- the-Art distant supervision."

However, their model has a high order of time complexity, and thus cannot be applied in practice. In this work, we develop a much faster model whose time complexity is linear in the number of sentences. Our model adopts a greedy bottom-up approach, with two linear-chain CRFs applied in cascade as local classifiers. To enhance the accuracy of the pipeline, we add additional constraints in the Viterbi decoding of the first CRF. In addition to efficiency, our parser also significantly outperforms the state of the art. Moreover, our novel approach of post-editing, which modifies a fully-built tree by considering information from constituents on upper levels, can further improve the accuracy."

A discourse relation can be expressed explicitly or implicitly, and takes two arguments realized as sentences, clauses, or in some rare cases, phrases. Sixteen teams from three continents participated in this task. For the first time in the history of the CoNLL shared tasks, participating teams, instead of running their systems on the test set and submitting the output, were asked to deploy their systems on a remote virtual machine and use a web-based evaluation platform to run their systems on the test set. This meant they were unable to actually see the data set, thus preserving its integrity and ensuring its replicability. In this paper, we present the task definition, the training and test sets, and the evaluation protocol and metric used during this shared task. We also summarize the different approaches adopted by the participating teams, and present the evaluation results. The evaluation data sets and the scorer will serve as a benchmark for future research on shallow discourse parsing."

However, enumerating paths between two entities is very expensive, and existing approaches typically resort to approximation with a sampled subset. This problem is particularly acute when text is jointly modeled with KB relations and used to provide direct evidence for facts mentioned in it. In this paper, we propose the first exact dynamic programming algorithm which enables efficient incorporation of all relation paths of bounded length, while modeling both relation types and intermediate nodes in the compositional path representations. We conduct a theoretical analysis of the efficiency gain from the approach. Experiments on two datasets show that it addresses representational limitations in prior approaches and improves accuracy in KB completion."

The main limitation of these approaches is that they require semistructured training data in the form of question-answer pairs, which is difficult to obtain in specialized domains or lowresource languages. We propose two inexpensive methods for training alignment models solely using free text, by generating artificial question-answer pairs from discourse structures. Our approach is driven by two representations of discourse: a shallow sequential representation, and a deep one based on Rhetorical Structure Theory. We evaluate the proposed model on two corpora from different genres and domains: one from Yahoo! Answers and one from the biology domain, and two types of non-factoid questions: manner and reason. We show that these alignment models trained directly from discourse structures imposed on free text improve performance considerably over an information retrieval baseline and a neural network language model trained on the same data."

For each event, its text trigger, class, and arguments are extracted. In contrast to the prevailing approaches in the domain, events can be arguments of other events, resulting in a nested structure that better captures the underlying biological statements. We divide the task into independent steps which we approach as machine learning problems. We define a wide array of features and in particular make extensive use of dependency parse graphs. A rule-based post-processing step is used to refine the output in accordance with the restrictions of the extraction task. In the shared task evaluation, the system achieved an F-score of 51.95% on the primary task, the best performance among the participants."

Such structures can be formalized by the notion of a frame (a.k.a. template), which comprises a set of related events and prototypical participants and event transitions. Identifying frames is a prerequisite for information extraction and natural language generation, and is usually done manually. Methods for inducing frames have been proposed recently, but they typically use ad hoc procedures and are difficult to diagnose or extend. In this paper, we propose the first probabilistic approach to frame induction, which incorporates frames, events, and participants as latent topics and learns those frame and event transitions that best explain the text. The number of frame components is inferred by a novel application of a split-merge method from syntactic parsing. In end-to-end evaluations from text to induced frames and extracted facts, our method produces state-of-the-art results while substantially reducing engineering effort."

The main changes this year include: (a) the inclusion of ambiguous queries, i.e., queries that point to multiple real-life entities with the same name; (b) accepting outputs created through inference; and (c) a simplification of the task and of the input format by removing references to the knowledge base for the entities included in queries. The SF track attracted 31 registered teams, out of which 18 teams submitted at least one run. The highest score this year was 36.72 F1, with a median of 19.80 F1."

Domain-general coreference resolution algorithms perform poorly on biomedical documents, because the cues they rely on such as gender are largely absent in this domain, and because they do not encode domain-specific knowledge such as the number and type of participants required in chemical reactions. Moreover, it is difficult to directly encode this knowledge into most coreference resolution algorithms because they are not rule-based. Our rule-based architecture uses sequentially applied hand-designed \u201csieves\u201d, with the output of each sieve informing and constraining subsequent sieves. This architecture provides a 3.2% increase in throughput to our Reach event extraction system with precision parallel to that of the stricter system that relies solely on syntactic patterns for extraction."

Shifting to a new domain requires the user to name the target relations and to manually create new extraction rules or hand-tag new training examples. This manual labor scales linearly with the number of target relations. This paper introduces Open IE (OIE), a new extraction paradigm where the system makes a single data-driven pass over its corpus and extracts a large set of relational tuples without requiring any human input. The paper also introduces TEXTRUNNER, a fully implemented, highly scalable OIE system where the tuples are assigned a probability and indexed to support efficient extraction and exploration via user queries. We report on experiments over a 9,000,000 Web page corpus that compare TEXTRUNNER with KNOWITALL, a state-of-the-art Web IE system. TEXTRUNNER achieves an error reduction of 33% on a comparable set of extractions. Furthermore, in the amount of time it takes KNOWITALL to perform extraction for a handful of pre-specified relations, TEXTRUNNER extracts a far broader set of facts reflecting orders of magnitude more relations, discovered on the fly. We report statistics on TEXTRUNNER\u2019s 11,000,000 highest probability tuples, and show that they contain over 1,000,000 concrete facts and over 6,500,000more abstract assertions."

The best-performing systems so far have been pipelines of simple subtask-specific local classifiers. A natural drawback of such approaches are cascading errors introduced in early stages of the pipeline. We present three joint models of increasing complexity designed to overcome this problem. The first model performs joint trigger and argument extraction, and lends itself to a simple, efficient and exact inference algorithm. The second model captures correlations between events, while the third model ensures consistency between arguments of the same event. Inference in these models is kept tractable through dual decomposition. The first two models outperform the previous best joint approaches and are very competitive with respect to the current state-of-the-art. The third model yields the best results reported so far on the BioNLP 2009 shared task, the BioNLP 2011 Genia task and the BioNLP 2011 Infectious Diseases task."

Previous algorithms for taxonomy induction have typically focused on independent classifiers for discovering new single relationships based on hand-constructed or automatically discovered textual patterns. By contrast, our algorithm flexibly incorporates evidence from multiple classifiers over heterogenous relationships to optimize the entire structure of the taxonomy, using knowledge of a word's coordinate terms to help in determining its hypernyms, and vice versa. We apply our algorithm on the problem of sense-disambiguated noun hyponym acquisition, where we combine the predictions of hypernym and coordinate term classifiers with the knowledge in a preexisting semantic taxonomy (WordNet 2.1). We add 10,000 novel synsets to WordNet 2.1 at 84% precision, a relative error reduction of 70% over a non-joint algorithm using the same component classifiers. Finally, we show that a taxonomy built using our algorithm shows a 23% relative F-score improvement over WordNet 2.1 on an independent testset of hypernym pairs."

However, we show that the scores produced by such models can be aggregated to define powerful entity-level features between clusters of mentions. Using these features, we train an entity-centric coreference system that learns an effective policy for building up coreference chains incrementally. The mention pair scores are also used to prune the search space the system works in, allowing for efficient training with an exact loss function. We evaluate our system on the English portion of the 2012 CoNLL Shared Task dataset and show that it improves over the current state of the art."

In this paper, we present a representation learning approach, in which we transform surface features into a latent space that facilitates RST discourse parsing. By combining the machinery of large-margin transition-based structured prediction with representation learning, our method jointly learns to parse discourse while at the same time learning a discourse-driven projection of surface features. The resulting shift-reduce discourse parser obtains substantial improvements over the previous state-of-the-art in predicting relations and nuclearity on the RST Treebank."

Errors in named-entity linking (NEL), on the other hand, are often caused by superficial modeling of entity context. This paper demonstrates that these two tasks are complementary. We introduce NECO, a new model for named entity linking and coreference resolution, which solves both problems jointly, reducing the errors made on each. NECO extends the Stanford deterministic coreference system by automatically linking mentions to Wikipedia and introducing new NEL-informed mention-merging sieves. Linking improves mention-detection and enables new semantic attributes to be incorporated from Freebase, while coreference provides better context modeling by propagating named-entity links within mention clusters. Experiments show consistent improvements across a number of datasets and experimental conditions, including over 11% reduction in MUC coreference error and nearly 21% reduction in F1 NEL error on ACE 2004 newswire data."

Some unsupervised approaches have been proposed (e.g., Haghighi and Klein (2007)), but they are less accurate. In this paper, we present the first unsupervised approach that is competitive with supervised ones. This is made possible by performing joint inference across mentions, in contrast to the pairwise classification typically used in supervised methods, and by using Markov logic as a representation language, which enables us to easily express relations like apposition and predicate nominals. On MUC and ACE datasets, our model outperforms Haghigi and Klein's one using only a fraction of the training data, and often matches or exceeds the accuracy of state-of-the-art supervised models."

The algorithm uses a similarity graph to encourage similar n-grams to have similar POS tags. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on a domain adaptation task, where we assume that we have access to large amounts of unlabeled data from the target domain, but no additional labeled data. The similarity graph is used during training to smooth the state posteriors on the target domain. Standard inference can be used at test time. Our approach is able to scale to very large problems and yields significantly improved target domain accuracy."

The goal of the research described here is to automatically create a computer understandable world wide knowledge base whose content mirrors that of the World Wide Web. Such a knowledge base would enable much more effective retrieval of Web information, and promote new uses of the Web to support knowledge-based inference and problem solving. Our approach is to develop a trainable information extraction system that takes two inputs: an ontology defining the classes and relations of interest, and a set of training data consisting of labeled regions of hypertext representing instances of these classes and relations. Given these inputs, the system learns to extract information from other pages and hyperlinks on the Web. This paper describes our general approach, several machine learning algorithms for this task, and promising initial results with a prototype system."

Our approach makes use of large amounts of unlabeled data in a graph-based semi-supervised learning framework.

The label-propagated graph is used within a frame-semantic parser and, for unknown predicates, results in over 15% absolute improvement in frame identification accuracy and over 13% absolute improvement in full frame-semantic parsing F1 score on a blind test set, over a state-of-the-art supervised baseline."

Distinguishing discourse entities that die out after just one mention (singletons) from those that lead longer lives (coreferent) would benefit NLP applications such as coreference resolution, protagonist identification, topic modeling, and discourse coherence. We build a logistic regression model for predicting the singleton/coreferent distinction, drawing on linguistic insights about how discourse entity lifespans are affected by syntactic and semantic features. The model is effective in its own right (78% accuracy), and incorporating it into a state-of-the-art coreference resolution system yields a significant improvement."

We show that the random walk probabilities computed (at great expense) by PRA provide no discernible benefit to performance on this task, so they can safely be dropped. This allows us to define a simpler algorithm for generating feature matrices from graphs, which we call subgraph feature extraction (SFE). In addition to being conceptually simpler than PRA, SFE is much more efficient, reducing computation by an order of magnitude, and more expressive, allowing for much richer features than paths between two nodes in a graph. We show experimentally that this technique gives substantially better performance than PRA and its variants, improving mean average precision from .432 to .528 on a knowledge base completion task using the NELL KB."

Two independent lines of recent research have attempted to improve these mention-pair classifiers, one by learning a mention-ranking model to rank preceding mentions for a given anaphor, and the other by training an entity-mention classifier to determine whether a preceding cluster is coreferent with a given mention. We propose a cluster-ranking approach to coreference resolution that combines the strengths of mention rankers and entity-mention models. We additionally show how our cluster-ranking framework naturally allows discourse-new entity detection to be learned jointly with coreference resolution.

Two independent lines of recent research have attempted to improve these mention-pair classifiers, one by learning amentionranking model to rank preceding mentions for a given anaphor, and the other by training an entity-mention classifier to determine whether a preceding cluster is coreferent with a given mention. We propose a cluster-ranking approach to coreference resolution that combines the strengths of mention rankers and entitymention models. We additionally show how our cluster-ranking framework naturally allows discourse-new entity detection to be learned jointly with coreference resolution. Experimental results on the ACE data sets demonstrate its superior performance to competing approaches."

This approach can lead to incorrect decisions as lower precision features often overwhelm the smaller number of high precision ones. To overcome this problem, we propose a simple coreference architecture based on a sieve that applies tiers of deterministic coreference models one at a time from highest to lowest precision. Each tier builds on the previous tier's entity cluster output. Further, our model propagates global information by sharing attributes (e.g., gender and number) across mentions in the same cluster. This cautious sieve guarantees that stronger features are given precedence over weaker ones and that each decision is made using all of the information available at the time. The framework is highly modular: new coreference modules can be plugged in without any change to the other modules. In spite of its simplicity, our approach outperforms many state-of-the-art supervised and unsupervised models on several standard corpora. This suggests that sieve-based approaches could be applied to other NLP tasks."

                "text": "MOTIVATION\nAdvances in sequencing technology have led to an exponential growth of genomics data, yet it remains a formidable challenge to interpret such data for identifying disease genes and drug targets. There has been increasing interest in adopting a systems approach that incorporates prior knowledge such as gene networks and genotype-phenotype associations. The majority of such knowledge resides in text such as journal publications, which has been undergoing its own exponential growth. It has thus become a significant bottleneck to identify relevant knowledge for genomic interpretation as well as to keep up with new genomics findings.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn the Literome project, we have developed an automatic curation system to extract genomic knowledge from PubMed articles and made this knowledge available in the cloud with a Web site to facilitate browsing, searching and reasoning. Currently, Literome focuses on two types of knowledge most pertinent to genomic medicine: directed genic interactions such as pathways and genotype-phenotype associations. Users can search for interacting genes and the nature of the interactions, as well as diseases and drugs associated with a single nucleotide polymorphism or gene. Users can also search for indirect connections between two entities, e.g. a gene and a disease might be linked because an interacting gene is associated with a related disease.\n\n\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION\nLiterome is freely available at literome.azurewebsites.net. Download for non-commercial use is available via Web services."

We show that a soft inference procedure based on a combination of constrained, weighted, random walks through the knowledge base graph can be used to reliably infer new beliefs for the knowledge base. More specifically, we show that the system can learn to infer different target relations by tuning the weights associated with random walks that follow different paths through the graph, using a version of the Path Ranking Algorithm (Lao and Cohen, 2010b). We apply this approach to a knowledge base of approximately 500,000 beliefs extracted imperfectly from the web by NELL, a never-ending language learner (Carlson et al., 2010). This new system improves significantly over NELL's earlier Horn-clause learning and inference method: it obtains nearly double the precision at rank 100, and the new learning method is also applicable to many more inference tasks."

The shared task consists of three sub-tasks, each of which addresses bio-molecular event extraction at a different level of specificity. The data was developed based on the GENIA event corpus. The shared task was run over 12 weeks, drawing initial interest from 42 teams. Of these teams, 24 submitted final results. The evaluation results are encouraging, indicating that state-of-the-art performance is approaching a practically applicable level and revealing some remaining challenges."

This paper argues that autonomously \"Semantifying Wikipedia\" is the best way to solve the problem. We choose Wikipedia as an initial data source, because it is comprehensive, not too large, high-quality, and contains enough manually-derived structure to bootstrap an autonomous, self-supervised process. We identify several types of structures which can be automatically enhanced in Wikipedia (e.g., link structure, taxonomic data, infoboxes, etc.), and we describea prototype implementation of a self-supervised, machine learning system which realizes our vision. Preliminary experiments demonstrate the high precision of our system's extracted data - in one case equaling that of humans."

Both parsers obtain state-of-the-art performance, and use a very simple API consisting of, minimally, two lines of Scala code. We accompany this code with a visualization library that runs the two parsers in parallel, and displays the two generated discourse trees side by side, which provides an intuitive way of comparing the two parsers."

While most existing coreference work is driven by pairwise decisions, our model is fully generative, producing each mention from a combination of global entity properties and local attentional state. Despite being unsupervised, our system achieves a 70.3 MUC F1 measure on the MUC-6 test set, broadly in the range of some recent supervised results."

Unlike most previous work in event structure or semantic role learning, our system does not use supervised techniques, hand-built knowledge, or predefined classes of events or roles. Our unsupervised learning algorithm uses coreferring arguments in chains of verbs to learn both rich narrative event structure and argument roles. By jointly addressing both tasks, we improve on previous results in narrative/frame learning and induce rich frame-specific semantic roles."

In this Prospective, we present the prevalence of mutations and copy-number alterations with predictive associations across solid tumors at different levels of stringency for gene-drug targetability. More than 90% of The Cancer Genome Atlas samples have potentially targetable alterations, the majority with multiple events, illustrating the challenges for treatment prioritization given the complexity of the genomic landscape. Nearly 80% of the variants in rarely mutated oncogenes are of uncertain functional significance, reflecting the gap in our understanding of the relevance of many alterations potentially linked to therapeutic actions. Access to targeted agents in early clinical trials could affect treatment decision in 75% of patients with cancer. Prospective implementation of large-scale molecular profiling and standardized reports of predictive biomarkers are fundamental steps for making precision cancer medicine a reality."

This will only be achieved by following the process as described in Schorr in a step by step fashion. An organization must however be willing to, as Schorr states in Chapter 16, `create the spark, ignite change'! Only then can it happen!

This book documents the first serious attempt to construct automatically and use nonsemantic computational structures for text summarization. Daniel Marcu develops a semantics-free theoretical framework that is both general enough to be applicable to naturally occurring texts and concise enough to facilitate an algorithmic approach to discourse analysis. He presents and evaluates two discourse parsing methods: one uses manually written rules that reflect common patterns of usage of cue phrases such as \"however\" and \"in addition to\"; the other uses rules that are learned automatically from a corpus of discourse structures. By means of a psycholinguistic experiment, Marcu demonstrates how a discourse-based summarizer identifies the most important parts of texts at levels of performance that are close to those of humans. \nMarcu also discusses how the automatic derivation of discourse structures may be used to improve the performance of current natural language generation, machine translation, summarization, question answering, and information retrieval systems."
