Two classes of approaches are first studied and discussed in general terms: data-driven and model-driven. In the latter, some specific approaches like rule-based or formal grammar are usually studied on very stereotyped documents providing honest results, while in the former artificial neural networks are often considered for small patterns with good results. Our understanding of these techniques let us to believe that a hybrid model is a more appropriate solution for structure extraction. Based on this standpoint, we proposed a Perceptive Neural Network based approach using a static topology that possesses the characteristics of a dynamic neural network. Thanks to its transparency, it allows a better representation of the model elements and the relationships between the logical and the physical components. Furthermore, it possesses perceptive cycles providing some capacities in data refinement and correction. Tested on several kinds of documents, the results are better than those of a static Multilayer Perceptron."

Different from previous work, we introduce features that capture the positions of phrases in document with respect to logical sections found in scientific discourse. We also introduce features that capture salient morphological phenomena found in scientific keyphrases, such as whether a candidate keyphrase is an acronyms or uses specific terminologically productive suffixes. We have implemented these features on top of a baseline feature set used by Kea [1]. In our evaluation using a corpus of 120 scientific publications multiply annotated for keyphrases, our system significantly outperformed Kea at the p < .05 level. As we know of no other existing multiply annotated keyphrase document collections, we have also made our evaluation corpus publicly available. We hope that this contribution will spur future comparative research."

This paper employs Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) for the task of extracting various common fields from the headers and citation of research papers. The basic theory of CRFs is becoming well-understood, but best-practices for applying them to real-world data requires additional exploration. This paper makes an empirical exploration of several factors, including variations on Gaussian, exponential and hyperbolic-L1 priors for improved regularization, and several classes of features and Markov order. On a standard benchmark data set, we achieve new state-of-the-art performance, reducing error in average F1 by 36%, and word error rate by 78% in comparison with the previous best SVM results. Accuracy compares even more favorably against HMMs."

In this NN architecture, called Transparent Neural Network (TNN), the document structure is stretched along the layers, allowing an interpretation decomposition from physical (NN input) to logical (NN output) level. The intermediate layers represent successive interpretation steps. Each neuron is apparent and associated to a logical element. The recognition proceeds by repetitive perceptive cycles propagating the information through the layers. In case of low recognition rate, an enhancement is achieved by error backpropagation leading to correct or pick up a more adapted input feature subset. Several feature subsets are created using a modified filter method. The first experiments performed on scientific documents are encouraging."

The other is reference alignment in which attribute values are aligned to the bibliographic record to enrich the vocabulary of the bibliographic database. We first propose a statistical model for attribute extraction that represents both the syntactical structure of references and OCR error patterns. Then, we perform experiments using bibliographic references obtained from scanned images of papers in journals and transactions and show that useful attribute values are extracted from OCR-processed references.

Specifically, the system focuses on: 1) Extracting researcher profiles automatically from the Web; 2) Integrating the publication data into the network from existing digital libraries; 3) Modeling the entire academic network; and 4) Providing search services for the academic network. So far, 448,470 researcher profiles have been extracted using a unified tagging approach. We integrate publications from online Web databases and propose a probabilistic framework to deal with the name ambiguity problem. Furthermore, we propose a unified modeling approach to simultaneously model topical aspects of papers, authors, and publication venues. Search services such as expertise search and people association search have been provided based on the modeling results. In this paper, we describe the architecture and main features of the system. We also present the empirical evaluation of the proposed methods."

Machine learning methods offer robust and adaptable automatic metadata extraction. We describe a support vector machine classification-based method for metadata extraction from header part of research papers and show that it outperforms other machine learning methods on the same task. The method first classifies each line of the header into one or more of 15 classes. An iterative convergence procedure is then used to improve the line classification by using the predicted class labels of its neighbor lines in the previous round. Further metadata extraction is done by seeking the best chunk boundaries of each line. We found that discovery and use of the structural patterns of the data and domain based word clustering can improve the metadata extraction performance. An appropriate feature normalization also greatly improves the classification performance. Our metadata extraction method was originally designed to improve the metadata extraction quality of the digital libraries Citeseer [S. Lawrence et al., (1999)] and EbizSearch [Y. Petinot et al., (2003)]. We believe it can be generalized to other digital libraries."

However, CiteSeer currently faces significant challenges that must be overcome in order to improve the quality of the service and guarantee that CiteSeer will continue to be a valuable, up-to-date resource well into the foreseeable future. This paper describes a new architectural framework for CiteSeer system deployment, named CiteSeer Plus. The new framework supports distributed indexing and storage for load balancing and fault-tolerance as well as modular service deployment to increase system flexibility and reduce maintenance costs. In order to facilitate novel approaches to information extraction, a blackboard framework is built into the architecture."

We explore the use of hidden Markov models for information extraction tasks, specifically focusing on how to learn model structure from data and how to make the best use of labeled and unlabeled data. We show that a manually-constructed model that contains multiple states per extraction field outperforms a model with one state per field, and discuss strategies for learning the model structure automatically from data. We also demonstrate that the use of distantly-labeled data to set model parameters provides a significant improvement in extraction accuracy. Our models are applied to the task of extracting important fields from the headers of computer science research papers, and achieve an extraction accuracy of 92.9%."

That the human mind makes a holistic approach to vision rather than a disintegrated approach is shown to be useful for document analysis. Since the major constituent components textual or non-textual in a document page are arranged in a rectilinear fashion, rectilinear/isothetic decomposition of different components are made on a document page. After representing the page as a feature set of its polygonal covers corresponding to the distinct regions of interest, each polygon is iteratively decomposed into the sub-polygons tightly enclosing the corresponding sub-components to capture the overall information as well as the necessary details to the desired level of precision. Subsequently, these components and sub-components are analyzed using Gestalt laws/properties, which have been explained in detail in the context of this work. Text regions, tabular structures, and various graphic objects readily admit some of the Gestalt properties. We have tested our algorithm on several benchmark datasets, and some relevant results have been produced here to demonstrate the effectiveness and elegance of the proposed method."

Conditional random fields offer several advantages over hidden Markov models and stochastic grammars for such tasks, including the ability to relax strong independence assumptions made in those models. Conditional random fields also avoid a fundamental limitation of maximum entropy Markov models (MEMMs) and other discriminative Markov models based on directed graphical models, which can be biased towards states with few successor states. We present iterative parameter estimation algorithms for conditional random fields and compare the performance of the resulting models to HMMs and MEMMs on synthetic and natural-language data."

                "text": "All recorded information in a traditional library is analogue in nature. The analogue information can include printed books, periodical articles, manuscripts, cards, photographs, vinyl disks, video and audio tapes. However, when analogue information is fed into a computer, it is broken down into 0s and 1s changing its characteristics from analogue to digital. These bits of data can be re-combined for manipulation and compressed for storage. Voluminous encyclopaedias that take-up yards of shelf-space in analogue form can fit into a small space on a computer drive or stored on to a CD ROM disc, which can be searched, retrieved, manipulated and sent over the network. One of the most important traits of digital information is that it is not fixed in the way that texts printed on a paper are. Digital texts are neither final nor finite, and are not fixed either in essence or in form except, when it is printed out as a hard copy. Flexibility is one of the chief assets of digital information. An endless number of identical copies can be created from a digital file, because a digital file does not decay by copying. Moreover, digital information can be made accessible from remote location simultaneously by a large number of users. Digitisation is the process of converting the content of physical media (e.g., periodical articles, books, manuscripts, cards, photographs, vinyl disks, etc.) into digital format. In most library applications, digitisation normally results in documents that are accessible from the web site of a library and thus, on ABSTRACT"

For example, hidden Markov models are used for analyzing biological sequences, linguistic-grammar-based probabilistic models for identifying RNA secondary structure, and probabilistic evolutionary models for inferring phylogenies of sequences from different organisms. This book gives a unified, up-to-date and self-contained account, with a Bayesian slant, of such methods, and more generally to probabilistic methods of sequence analysis. Written by an interdisciplinary team of authors, it is accessible to molecular biologists, computer scientists, and mathematicians with no formal knowledge of the other fields, and at the same time presents the state of the art in this new and important field."

In this experiment, the UDL prototype has been compared with the NDL prototype. The two prototypes were then evaluated by separate users with various Information Technology IT backgrounds.
