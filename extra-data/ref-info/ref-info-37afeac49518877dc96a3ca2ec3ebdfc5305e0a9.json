                "text": "We present a statistical characterization of texture images in the context of an overcomplete complex wavelet transform. The characterization is based on empirical observations of statistical regularities in such images, and parameterized by (1) the local autocorrelation of the coe\u00c6cients in each subband; (2) both the local auto-correlation and cross-correlation of coe\u00c6cient magnitudes at other orientations and spatial scales; and (3) the rst few moments of the image pixel histogram. We develop an e\u00c6cient algorithm for synthesizing random images subject to these constraints using alternated projections, and demonstrate its e ectiveness on a wide range of synthetic and natural textures. In particular, we show that many important structural elements in textures (e.g., edges, repeated patterns or alternated patches of simpler texture), can be captured through joint second order statistics of the coe\u00c6cient magnitudes. We also show the exibility of the representation, by applying to a variety of tasks which can be viewed as constrained image synthesis problems, such as spatial and spectral extrapolation. 1Instituto de Optica, CSIC, Serrano 121, 28006 Madrid, SPAIN. iodpm79@pinar2.csic.es 2Center for Neural Science, and Courant Inst. of Mathematical Sciences, New York University, New York, NY 10003. eero.simoncelli@nyu.edu JP is supported by a fellowship from the Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cienti cas (CSIC), and the Comision Interministerial de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CICYT, Spain), under grant TIC97-325.

Vision is arguably our most important sensory system, judging from both the ubiquity of visual forms of communication, and the large proportion of the human brain devoted to visual processing. Nevertheless, it has proven di\u00c6cult to establish a good mathematical de nition (in the form of a statistical model) for visual images. The set of visual images is enormous, and yet only a small fraction of these are likely to be encountered in a natural setting [43, 25, 19, 54]. Thus, a statistical prior model, even one that partially captures these variations in likelihood, can substantially bene t image processing and arti cial vision systems. In addition, many authors have proposed that biological visual systems have evolved to take advantage of the statistical properties of the signals to which they are exposed [e.g., 3, 4, 2], thus suggesting a direct link between image statistics and visual processing. In order to characterize visual images statistically, one must make some sort of restriction on the probability model. The most common assumptions are locality (the characterization is speci ed on local spatial neighborhoods), stationarity (the statistics depend only on relative spatial position within the image), and a parametric form for the density (e.g., Gaussian). The subclass of images that we commonly call \\visual texture\" seems most consistent with local stationary density models. Traditional de nitions of texture can be classi ed into \\structural\" and \\statistical\" [34], the rst consisting of a set of repeated deterministic features, and the second corresponding to a sample drawn from a probability density. Such a distinction has turned out to be somewhat arti cial: For example, Zhu et al. [69] have demonstrated that is possible to capture and reproduce structural elements in texture using purely statistical models. Furthermore, many real-world textures seem to incorporate both aspects, in that they can be described as a set of repeating structural elements subject to some randomness in their location, size, color, orientation, etc. This observation leads us to seek a single method of representing textures. In this paper, we develop a fully statistical description, and demonstrate that it is also able to capture and reproduce a wide variety of structural elements. Julesz pioneered the statistical characterization of textures by hypothesizing that the Nth-order joint empirical densities (for some unspeci ed N) of neighborhoods of image pixels, could be used to partition textures into classes that are indistinguishable to a human observer [40]. This work thus established the use of both the locality and stationarity assumptions, the goal of determining a minimal set of statistical constraints, and the validation of texture models using human observers. Since then, researchers have explored a wide variety of approaches for texture characterization and synthesis. One of the most basic distinctions between the various approaches is the choice of representation. Starting with Julesz, many authors have worked directly on the statistical attributes of local spatial neighborhoods of pixels, typically in the form of a Markov random eld [e.g., 35, 42, 17]. But most others attempt to simplify the description of the density by rst processing with a set of linear lters, such as Gabor lters or a multiscale basis. The use of localized multi-scale multi-orientation sets of bandpass lters is inspired by what is known of biological visual processing, and justi ed by recent studies of the higher-order statistical properties of such representations (we discuss this further in section 1). These lters may be held xed, or chosen adaptively depending on the image statistics [e.g., 10, 26, 22, 59, 51]. Assuming a preconditioning subband decomposition, most texture characterizations"

We propose a technique, based on independent component analysis, for choosing the set of filters that yield the most informative marginals, meaning that the product over the marginals most closely approximates the joint probability density function of the filter outputs. The algorithm is implemented using a steerable filter space. Experiments involving both texture classification and synthesis show that compared to principal components analysis, ICA provides superior performance for modeling of natural and synthetic textures."

This model leads to the derivation of texture analysis and synthesis algorithms designed to estimate the texture parameters and to reconstruct the original texture field from these parameters. The texture field is assumed to be a realization of a regular homogeneous random field, which is characterized in general by a mixed spectral distribution. The texture field is orthogonally decomposed into a purely indeterministic component and a deterministic component. The deterministic component is further orthogonally decomposed into a harmonic component, and a generalized-evanescent component. Both analytical and experimental results show that the deterministic components should be parameterized separately from the purely indeterministic component. The model is very efficient in terms of the number of parameters required to faithfully represent textures. Reconstructed textures are practically indistinguishable from the originals. >"

First, the marginal densities of the coefficients have extended heavy tails. Second, the joint densities exhibit variance dependencies not captured by second-order models. We examine properties of the class of Gaussian scale mixtures, and show that these densities can accurately characterize both the marginal and joint distributions of natural image wavelet coefficients. This class of model suggests a Markov structure, in which wavelet coefficients are linked by hidden scaling variables corresponding to local image structure. We derive an estimator for these hidden variables, and show that a nonlinear \"normalization\" procedure can be used to Gaussianize the coefficients."

                "text": "Recent studies of cortical simple cell function suggest that the primitives of image representation in vision have a wavelet form similar to Gabor elementary functions (EFs). It is shown that textures and fully textured images can be practically decomposed into, and synthesized from, a finite set of EFs. Textured-images can be synthesized from a set of EFs using an image coefficient library. Alternatively, texturing of contoured (cartoonlike) images is analogous to adding chromaticity information to contoured images. A method for texture discrimination and image segmentation using local features based on the Gabor approach is introduced. Features related to the EF's parameters provide efficient means for texture discrimination and classification. This method is invariant under rotation and translation. The performance of the classification appears to be robust with respect to noisy conditions. The results show the insensitivity of the discrimination to relatively high noise levels, comparable to the performances of the human observer.<<ETX>>"

A texture model is a mathematical procedure capable of producing and describing a textured image. We explore the use of Markov random fields as texture models. The binomial model, where each point in the texture has a binomial distribution with parameter controlled by its neighbors and ``number of tries'' equal to the number of gray levels, was taken to be the basic model for the analysis. A method of generating samples from the binomial model is given, followed by a theoretical and practical analysis of the method's convergence. Examples show how the parameters of the Markov random field control the strength and direction of the clustering in the image. The power of the binomial model to produce blurry, sharp, line-like, and blob-like textures is demonstrated. Natural texture samples were digitized and their parameters were estimated under the Markov random field model. A hypothesis test was used for an objective assessment of goodness-of-fit under the Markov random field model. Overall, microtextures fit the model well. The estimated parameters of the natural textures were used as input to the generation procedure. The synthetic microtextures closely resembled their real counterparts, while the regular and inhomogeneous textures did not."

Stochastic methods are developed for the generation of pairs of synthetic texture fields possessing multiple gray levels, significant spatial correlation, and joint moments or probability densities of controllable form. Results of several visual discrimination experiments with these computer generated texture fields are then presented. It is demonstrated, for the stochastic models investigated, that humans cannot effortlessly discriminate between pairs of spatially correlated texture fields with differing third-order probability densities when their lower order densities are pairwise equal. This is a further verification of Julesz's conjecture. Also, it is shown that human observers are sensitive to relatively small changes in the spatial autocorrelation function. Examples are presented of discriminable texture fields with identical means, variances, autocorrelation functions, and third-order nearest neighbor moments."

This model can closely replicate a given textured image or produce another image that although distinct from the original, has the same general visual characteristics and the same first and second-order gray-level statistics as the original image. The texture synthesis algorithm, proposed contains three distinct components: a moving-average (MA) filter, a filter excitation function, and a gray-level histogram. The analysis portion of the texture synthesis algorithm derives the three from a given image. The synthesis portion convolves the MA filter kernel with the excitation function, adds noise, and modifies the histogram of the result. The advantages of this texture model over others include conceptually and computationally simple and robust parameter estimation, inherent stability, parsimony in the number of parameters, and synthesis through convolution. The authors describe a procedure for deriving the correct MA kernel using a signal enhancement algorithm, demonstrate the effectiveness of the model by using it to mimic several diverse textured images, discuss its applicability to the problem of infrared background simulation, and include detailed algorithms for the implementation of the model. >"

FRAME combines attractive aspects of two important themes in texture modeling: multi-channel filtering and Markov random field (MRF) modeling. It incorporates the responses of a set of well selected filters into the distribution over a random field and hence has a much stronger descriptive ability than the traditional MRF models. Furthermore, it interprets and clarifies many previous concepts and methods for texture analysis and synthesis from a unified point of view. Algorithms are proposed for probability inference, stochastic simulation and filter selection. Experiments on a variety of textures are described to illustrate our theory and to show the performance of our algorithms. These experiments demonstrate that many textures previously considered as different categories can be modeled and synthesized in a common framework."

                "text": "This article presents a statistical theory for texture modeling. This theory combines filtering theory and Markov random field modeling through the maximum entropy principle, and interprets and clarifies many previous concepts and methods for texture analysis and synthesis from a unified point of view. Our theory characterizes the ensemble of images I with the same texture appearance by a probability distribution f(I) on a random field, and the objective of texture modeling is to make inference about f(I), given a set of observed texture examples.In our theory, texture modeling consists of two steps. (1) A set of filters is selected from a general filter bank to capture features of the texture, these filters are applied to observed texture images, and the histograms of the filtered images are extracted. These histograms are estimates of the marginal distributions of f( I). This step is called feature extraction. (2) The maximum entropy principle is employed to derive a distribution p(I), which is restricted to have the same marginal distributions as those in (1). This p(I) is considered as an estimate of f( I). This step is called feature fusion. A stepwise algorithm is proposed to choose filters from a general filter bank. The resulting model, called FRAME (Filters, Random fields And Maximum Entropy), is a Markov random field (MRF) model, but with a much enriched vocabulary and hence much stronger descriptive ability than the previous MRF models used for texture modeling. Gibbs sampler is adopted to synthesize texture images by drawing typical samples from p(I), thus the model is verified by seeing whether the synthesized texture images have similar visual appearances to the texture images being modeled. Experiments on a variety of 1D and 2D textures are described to illustrate our theory and to show the performance of our algorithms. These experiments demonstrate that many textures which are previously considered as from different categories can be modeled and synthesized in a common framework."

The method is based on a characterization of the statistical properties of natural images represented in a complex wavelet decomposition. Specifically, we decompose the noisy image into wavelet subbands, estimate the autocorrelation of both the noise-free raw coefficients and their magnitudes within each subband, impose these statistics by projecting onto the space of images having the desired autocorrelations, and reconstruct an image from the modified wavelet coefficients. This process is applied repeatedly, and can be accelerated to produce optimal results in only a few iterations. Denoising results compare favorably to three reference methods, both perceptually and in terms of mean squared error."

Specifically, the paper presents random field models for noisy and textured image data based upon a hierarchy of GD. It then presents dynamic programming based segmentation algorithms for noisy and textured images, considering a statistical maximum a posteriori (MAP) criterion. Due to computational concerns, however, sub-optimal versions of the algorithms are devised through simplifying approximations in the model. Since model parameters are needed for the segmentation algorithms, a new parameter estimation technique is developed for estimating the parameters in a GD. Finally, a number of examples are presented which show the usefulness of the Gibbsian model and the effectiveness of the segmentation algorithms and the parameter estimation procedures."

The basis of the method is to encode the textural information by sampling both the power spectrum and the histogram of homogeneously textured images. The spectrum is sampled in a log-polar grid using a pyramid Gabor scheme. The input image is split into a set of 16 Gabor channels (using four spatial frequency levels and four orientations), plus a low- pass residual (LPR). The energy and equivalent bandwidths of each channel, as well as the LPR power spectrum and the histogram, are measured and the latter two are compressed. The synthesis process consists of generating 16 Gabor filtered independent noise signals with spectral centers equal to those of the Gabor filters, whose energy and equivalent bandwidths are calculated to reproduce the measured values. These bandpass signals are mixed into a single image, whose LPR power spectrum and histogram are modified to match the original fea- tures. Despite the coarse sampling scheme used, very good results have been achieved with nonstructured textures as well as with some quasi- periodic textures. Besides being applicable to a wide range of textures, the method is robust (stable, fully automatic, linear, and with a fixed code length) and compact (it uses only 69 parameters). \u00a9 1996 Society of Photo- Optical Instrumentation Engineers."

Our model combines kernel estimation with clustering, to obtain a semiparametric probability mass function estimate which summarizes -- rather than contains -- the training data. Because the model is cluster based, it is inferable from a limited set of training data, despite the model's high dimensionality. Moreover, its functional form allows recursive implementation that avoids exponential growth in required memory as the number of dimensions increases. Experimental results are presented for each of the three applications considered."

On the contrary, real images have complex and important structure that can be exploited for image processing, recognition and analysis. There have been many proposed approaches to the principled statistical modeling of images, but each has been limited in either the complexity of the models or the complexity of the images. We present a non-parametric multi-scale statistical model for images that can be used for recognition, image de-noising, and in a \"generative mode\" to synthesize high quality textures."

Pairs of wavelet coefficients, corresponding to basis functions at adjacent spatial locations, orientations, and scales, are found to be non-Gaussian in both their marginal and joint statistical properties. Specifically, their marginals are heavy-tailed, and although they are typically decorrelated, their magnitudes are highly correlated. We propose a Markov model that explains these dependencies using a linear predictor for magnitude coupled with both multiplicative and additive uncertainties, and show that it accounts for the statistics of a wide variety of images including photographic images, graphical images, and medical images. In order to directly demonstrate the power of the model, we construct an image coder called EPWIC (embedded predictive wavelet image coder), in which subband coefficients are encoded one bitplane at a time using a nonadaptive arithmetic encoder that utilizes conditional probabilities calculated from the model. Bitplanes are ordered using a greedy algorithm that considers the MSE reduction per encoded bit. The decoder uses the statistical model to predict coefficient values based on the bits it has received. Despite the simplicity of the model, the rate-distortion performance of the coder is roughly comparable to the best image coders in the literature."

Textures are modeled as irradiance patterns containing a limited range of spatial frequencies, where mutually distinct textures differ significantly in their dominant characterizing frequencies. By encoding images into multiple narrow spatial frequency and orientation channels, the slowly varying channel envelopes (amplitude and phase) are used to segregate textural regions of different spatial frequency, orientation, or phase characteristics. Thus, an interpretation of image texture as a region code, or carrier of region information, is emphasized. The channel filters used, known as the two-dimensional Gabor functions, are useful for these purposes in several senses: they have tunable orientation and radial frequency bandwidths and tunable center frequencies, and they optimally achieve joint resolution in space and in spatial frequency. By comparing the channel amplitude responses, one can detect boundaries between textures. Locating large variations in the channel phase responses allows discontinuities in the texture phase to be detected. Examples are given of both types of texture processing using a variety of real and synthetic textures. >"

This model consists of three stages: (1) convolution of the image with a bank of even-symmetric linear filters followed by half-wave rectification to give a set of responses modeling outputs of V1 simple cells, (2) inhibition, localized in space, within and among the neural-response profiles that results in the suppression of weak responses when there are strong responses at the same or nearby locations, and (3) texture-boundary detection by using wide odd-symmetric mechanisms. Our model can predict the salience of texture boundaries in any arbitrary gray-scale image.

Quantitative predictions of the degree of discriminability of different texture pairs match well with experimental measurements of discriminability in human observers."

This principle consists of two parts. The first is the maximum entropy principle for feature binding (or fusion): for a given set of observed feature statistics, a distribution can be built to bind these feature statistics together by maximizing the entropy over all distributions that reproduce them. The second part is the minimum entropy principle for feature selection: among all plausible sets of feature statistics, we choose the set whose maximum entropy distribution has the minimum entropy. Computational and inferential issues in both parts are addressed; in particular, a feature pursuit procedure is proposed for approximately selecting the optimal set of features. The minimax entropy principle is then corrected by considering the sample variation in the observed feature statistics, and an information criterion for feature pursuit is derived. The minimax entropy principle is applied to texture modeling, where a novel Markov random field (MRF) model, called FRAME (filter, random field, and minimax entropy), is derived, and encouraging results are obtained in experiments on a variety of texture images. The relationship between our theory and the mechanisms of neural computation is also discussed."

                "text": "A 2D Gabor filter can be realized as a sinusoidal plane wave of some frequency and orientation within a two dimensional Gaussian envelope. Its spatial extent, frequency and orientation preferences as well as bandwidths are easily controlled by the parameters used in generating the filters. However, there is an \u201cuncertainty relation\u201d associated with linear filters which limits the resolution simultaneously attainable in space and frequency. Daugman (1985) has determined that 2D Gabor filters are members of a class of functions achieving optimal joint resolution in the 2D space and 2D frequency domains. They have also been found to be a good model for two dimensional receptive fields of simple cells in the striate cortex (Jones 1985; Jones et al. 1985).The characteristic of optimal joint resolution in both space and frequency suggests that these filters are appropriate operators for tasks requiring simultaneous measurement in these domains. Texture discrimination is such a task. Computer application of a set of Gabor filters to a variety of textures found to be preattentively discriminable produces results in which differently textured regions are distinguished by firstorder differences in the values measured by the filters. This ability to reduce the statistical complexity distinguishing differently textured region as well as the sensitivity of these filters to certain types of local features suggest that Gabor functions can act as detectors of certain \u201ctexton\u201d types. The performance of the computer models suggests that cortical neurons with Gabor like receptive fields may be involved in preattentive texture discrimination."

Textures correspond to statistical ensembles, whereas images are spatially finite samples of a texture. The main ideas underlying the use of visual textures in experimental and theoretical analyses of preattentive vision are summarized, with an emphasis on the distinction between texture ensembles and images. The Julesz conjecture [ Perception2, 391 ( 1973)] is that preattentive discrimination of textures is possible only for textures that have different second-order correlation statistics. Recently Yellot [ J. Opt. Soc. Am. A10, 777 ( 1993)] claimed that the triple correlation uniqueness (TCU) theorem, a mathematical result that every monochromatic image of finite size is uniquely determined (up to translation) by its third-order statistics, makes higher-order variants of the Julesz conjecture trivial. However, the TCU theorem applies to individual images, and not to texture ensembles, and thus is of limited relevance to the study of texture perception."

It is shown analytically that this locus of solutions is maximally localized in both space and frequency if the channel filters used are Gabor wavelets. A constrained solution is obtained by imposing a stabilizing term that develops naturally from the assumptions on the signal. The measurement of frequencies is then cast as an ill-posed extremum problem regularized by the stabilizing term, leading to an iterative constraint propagation algorithm. The technique is demonstrated by application to a variety of 2-D textured images. >"

To understand the representation of images by the mammalian visual system, it might therefore be useful to consider the statistics of images from the natural environment (i.e., images with trees, rocks, bushes, etc). In this study, various coding schemes are compared in relation to how they represent the information in such natural images. The coefficients of such codes are represented by arrays of mechanisms that respond to local regions of space, spatial frequency, and orientation (Gabor-like transforms). For many classes of image, such codes will not be an efficient means of representing information. However, the results obtained with six natural images suggest that the orientation and the spatial-frequency tuning of mammalian simple cells are well suited for coding the information in such images if the goal of the code is to convert higher-order redundancy (e.g., correlation between the intensities of neighboring pixels) into first-order redundancy (i.e., the response distribution of the coefficients). Such coding produces a relatively high signal-to-noise ratio and permits information to be transmitted with only a subset of the total number of cells. These results support Barlow's theory that the goal of natural vision is to represent the information in the natural environment with minimal redundancy."

The properties of the operator which approximates a signal at a given resolution were studied. It is shown that the difference of information between the approximation of a signal at the resolutions 2/sup j+1/ and 2/sup j/ (where j is an integer) can be extracted by decomposing this signal on a wavelet orthonormal basis of L/sup 2/(R/sup n/), the vector space of measurable, square-integrable n-dimensional functions. In L/sup 2/(R), a wavelet orthonormal basis is a family of functions which is built by dilating and translating a unique function psi (x). This decomposition defines an orthogonal multiresolution representation called a wavelet representation. It is computed with a pyramidal algorithm based on convolutions with quadrature mirror filters. Wavelet representation lies between the spatial and Fourier domains. For images, the wavelet representation differentiates several spatial orientations. The application of this representation to data compression in image coding, texture discrimination and fractal analysis is discussed. >"

This ability depends on the redundancy of the representation used to describe the class of images. In 1951, Shannon [Bell. Syst. Tech. J. 30, 50 (1951)] showed how to estimate bounds on the entropy and redundancy of an information source from predictability data. The entropy, in turn, gives a measure of the limits to error-free information compaction. An experiment was devised in which human observers interactively restored missing gray levels from 128 X 128 pixel pictures with 16 gray levels. For eight images, the redundancy ranged from 46%, for a complicated picture of foliage, to 74%, for a picture of a face. For almost-complete pictures, but not for noisy pictures, this performance can be matched by a nearest-neighbor predictor."

Understanding what these regularities are can enable natural images to be coded more efficiently. In this paper, we describe some of the forms of structure that are contained in natural images, and we show how these are related to the response properties of neurons at early stages of the visual system. Many of the important forms of structure require higher-order (i.e. more than linear, pairwise) statistics to characterize, which makes models based on linear Hebbian learning, or principal components analysis, inappropriate for finding efficient codes for natural images. We suggest that a good objective for an efficient coding of natural scenes is to maximize the sparseness of the representation, and we show that a network that learns sparse codes of natural scenes succeeds in developing localized, oriented, bandpass receptive fields similar to those in the mammalian striate cortex."

This kind of image decomposition is an unexplored image-processing method that is complementary to the well-explored method of filtering in spatial frequency bands; the latter technique is rotation-invariant, whereas the former technique is scale-invariant. The complementarity of these two approaches is explicit in the fact that orientation and spatial frequency are orthogonal variables in the two-dimensional Fourier plane, and the filters employed in the one method depend only on the radial variable, whereas those employed in the other method depend only on the angular variable. The biological significance of multiscale (spatial frequency selective) image analysis has been well-recognized and often cited, yet orientation selectivity is a far more striking property of neural architecture in cortical visual areas. In the present paper, we begin to explore some coding properties of the scale-invariant orientation variable, paying particular attention to its perceptual significance in texture segmentation and compact image coding. Examples of orientation-coded pictures are presented with data compression to 0.3 bits per pixel."

Understanding what these regularities are can enable natural images to be coded more eeciently. In this paper, we describe some of the forms of structure that are contained in natural images, and we show how these are related to the response properties of neurons at early stages of the visual system. Many of the important forms of structure require higher-order (i.e., more than linear, pairwise) statistics to characterize, which makes models based on linear Hebbian learning, or principal components analysis, inappropriate for nding eecient codes for natural images. We suggest that a good objective for an eecient coding of natural scenes is to maximize the sparseness of the representation, and we show that a network that learns sparse codes of natural scenes succeeds in developing localized, oriented, bandpass receptive elds similar to those in the primate striate cortex."

These transforms are conjoint spatial/spectral representations, which provide a complete image description in terms of locally windowed 2-D spectral coordinates embedded within global 2-D spatial coordinates. In the present neural network approach, based on interlaminar interactions involving two layers with fixed weights and one layer with adjustable weights, the network finds coefficients for complete conjoint 2-D Gabor transforms without restrictive conditions. In wavelet expansions based on a biologically inspired log-polar ensemble of dilations, rotations, and translations of a single underlying 2-D Gabor wavelet template, image compression is illustrated with ratios up to 20:1. Also demonstrated is image segmentation based on the clustering of coefficients in the complete 2-D Gabor transform. >"

Such texture pairs could not be discriminated from each other by the human visual system without scrutiny. Unfortunately, Markov processes are inherently one-dimensional while the general processes underlying visual texture discrimination are two-dimensional. Here three new methods are introduced that generate two-dimensional non-Markovian textures with different third-order but identical first- and second-order statistics. All three methods generate texture pairs that cannot be discriminated from each other. The lack of texture discrimination is the more astonishing since the individual elements that form the texture pair are clearly perceived as being very different. However, a counterexample was found that yields discrimination although the texture pair has approximately identical second-order statistics. This case can be explained by assuming that early feature extractors do some preprocessing. These new demonstrations give support to a model of texture discrimination in which the stimulus is first analyzed by local feature extractors that can detect only simple features such as dots and edges of given sizes and orientations. Then the outputs of these simple extractors are evaluated by a global processor that can compute only second- or first-order statistics (that is can compare at most two such outputs)."

In this image a rectangular areacomposed of small X-shaped patterns appears as a distinctregion against a background of L-shaped patterns. Thissegregation occurs rapidly and unconsciously, without effort or search. The rectangular area composed of T- shaped patterns, however, does not appear as a distinct region in this sense. It is very easy to discriminate amongall three pattems, but only the X and L regions displayspontaneous segregation. This distinction between pat- tern discrimination and perceptual segregation gives par-ticular interest to the study of this aspect of visual textureperception. Other aspects of texture perception include the role of texture in the perception of surface orientation and shape and the influence of surface texture in de-termining color appearance. In this paper we limit con-sideration to the phenomenon of segregation.Pure texture-based segregation is not a very importantphenomenon in everyday visual experience. Objects are not usually distinguished from their backgrounds purely by textural differences. In this respect, the study of puretexture differences (in the absence of differences in bright-ness, color, depth, or other properties) is analogous to thestudy of isoluminant color differences, which also are notvery common in natural scenes. The relative rarity ofisoluminant color discrimination in the real world does not imply that color perception is an unimportant compo-nent of seeing. Similarly, the rarity of pure texture differ-ences does not reduce the potential importance of textureperception, especially in the visual processing of complexscenes."

Most edge detection schemes ignore the composite nature of these edges, resulting in systematic errors in detection and localization. The problem of detecting and localizing these edges is addressed, along with the problem of false responses in smoothly shaded regions with constant gradient of the image brightness. A class of nonlinear filters, known as quadratic filters, is appropriate for this task, while linear filters are not. Performance criteria are derived for characterizing the SNR, localization and multiple responses of these filters in a manner analogous to Canny's criteria for linear filters. A two-dimensional version of the approach is developed which has the property of being able to represent multiple edges at the same location and determine the orientation of each to any desired precision. This permits junctions to be localized without rounding. Experimental results are presented.<<ETX>>"

It is shown that if we apply this transformation to a Fourier pair, the two resulting signals can also form a Fourier pair when the filters used in each domain maintain a dual relationship. For a large class of \"self-dual\" filters, a perfect symmetry exists, so that the lowpass scaling-rotating variant filtering (SRVF) is the same in both domains, thus commuting with the Fourier transform operator. The lowpass SRVF of an image is often referred to as a \"foveated\" image, whereas its Fourier pair (the lowpass SRVF of its spectrum) can be realized as a local spectrum estimation around the point of attention. This lowpass SRVF is equivalent to a log-polar warping of the image representation followed by a lowpass invariant filtering and the corresponding inverse warping. The use of the log-polar warped representation allows us to extend the one-dimensional (1-D) scale transform to higher dimensions, in particular to images, for which we have defined a scale-rotation invariant representation. We also present an efficient implementation using steerable filters to compute both the foveated image and the local spectrum."

We may test whether a given code is sufficient, in the sense of retaining all the information that the human perceives, and necessary, in the sense of retaining only that information. The latter is a test of efficiency. Here, we explore a code modeled on the simple cells of the primate striate cortex. The Cortex transform maps a digital image into a set of subimages (layers) that are bandpass in spatial frequency and orientation. The layers are sampled so as to minimize the number of samples and still avoid aliasing. Samples are quantized in a manner that exploits the bandpass contrast-masking properties of human vision. The entropy of the samples is computed to provide a lower bound on the code size. Finally, the image is reconstructed from the code. We devise psychophysical methods for comparing the original and reconstructed images to evaluate the sufficiency of the code. When each resolution is coded at the threshold for detection artifacts, the image-code size is about 1 bit/pixel."

The center/surround receptive field profiles of neurons in the retina and geniculate are far from an orthogonal set, but a given neuron can still be regarded as a decorrelator of the incoming signal in the sense that it responds primarily to changes in the image. At the level of the brain's visual cortex, the introduction of the new variable of orientation selectivity can be regarded not only as a means for providing orientation labels for image structure, but also more basically as an effective decorrelator of the neural representation. The present image coding simulations, based on quantitative neurobiological data about the code primitives, provide measures of the bit-rate efficiency of such oriented, quadrature, neural codes. Demonstrations of data compression to below 1 bit/pixel in cortically-based, quadrature self-similar wavelet image codes are also provided.<<ETX>>"

Here that fact is used to prove that every finite image composed of discrete colors is determined up to translation by its third-order statistics. Consequently, if two texture samples have identical third-order statistics, they must be physically identical images and thus visually nondiscriminable by definition. It follows that a third-order version of Julesz\u2019s long-abandoned conjecture about spontaneous texture discrimination is necessarily true (notwithstanding such well-known counterexamples as the odd and even textures). The second-order (i.e., original) version of that conjecture is not necessarily true: physically distinct finite images with identical second-order statistics can be constructed, so counterexamples are possible. However, the counterexamples that one finds in the literature are either nonexact or difficult to reconstruct. A new principle is described that permits the easy construction of discriminable black and white texture samples that have strictly identical second-order statistics and thus provide exact counterexamples to the Julesz conjecture."

Although this approach performs well, it has a number of disadvantages. In particular, exact MAP estimates cannot be computed, approximate MAP estimates are computationally expensive to compute, and unsupervised parameter estimation of the MRF is difficult. The authors propose a new approach to Bayesian image segmentation that directly addresses these problems. The new method replaces the MRF model with a novel multiscale random field (MSRF) and replaces the MAP estimator with a sequential MAP (SMAP) estimator derived from a novel estimation criteria. Together, the proposed estimator and model result in a segmentation algorithm that is not iterative and can be computed in time proportional to MN where M is the number of classes and N is the number of pixels. The also develop a computationally efficient method for unsupervised estimation of model parameters. Simulations on synthetic images indicate that the new algorithm performs better and requires much less computation than MAP estimation using simulated annealing. The algorithm is also found to improve classification accuracy when applied to the segmentation of multispectral remotely sensed images with ground truth data."

Pixel gray levels and the presence and orientation of edges are viewed as states of atoms or molecules in a lattice-like physical system. The assignment of an energy function in the physical system determines its Gibbs distribution. Because of the Gibbs distribution, Markov random field (MRF) equivalence, this assignment also determines an MRF image model. The energy function is a more convenient and natural mechanism for embodying picture attributes than are the local characteristics of the MRF. For a range of degradation mechanisms, including blurring, nonlinear deformations, and multiplicative or additive noise, the posterior distribution is an MRF with a structure akin to the image model. By the analogy, the posterior distribution defines another (imaginary) physical system. Gradual temperature reduction in the physical system isolates low energy states (``annealing''), or what is the same thing, the most probable states under the Gibbs distribution. The analogous operation under the posterior distribution yields the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the image given the degraded observations. The result is a highly parallel ``relaxation'' algorithm for MAP estimation. We establish convergence properties of the algorithm and we experiment with some simple pictures, for which good restorations are obtained at low signal-to-noise ratios."

Moreover, it minimizes distance and is nonexpansive, and therefore shares two of the more important properties of ordinary linear orthogonal projections onto closed linear manifolds. In this paper, we exploit the properties of these operators to develop several iterative algorithms for image restoration from partial data which permit any number of nonlinear constraints of a certain type to be subsumed automatically. Their common conceptual basis is as follows. Every known property of an original image f is envisaged as restricting it to lie in a well-defined closed convex set. Thus, m such properties place f in the intersection E0 = Ei of the corresponding closed convex sets E1,E2,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Em. Given only the projection operators Pi onto the individual Ei's, i = 1 \u2192 m, we restore f by recursive means. Clearly, in this approach, the realization of the Pi's in a Hilbert space setting is one of the major synthesis problems. Section I describes the geometrical significance of the three main theorems in considerable detail, and most of the underlying ideas are illustrated with the aid of simple diagrams. Section II presents rules for the numerical implementation of 11 specific projection operators which are found to occur frequently in many signal-processing applications, and the Appendix contains proofs of all the major results."

Wavelet transforms are also unstable with respect to dilations of the input signal and, in two dimensions, rotations of the input signal. The authors formalize these problems by defining a type of translation invariance called shiftability. In the spatial domain, shiftability corresponds to a lack of aliasing; thus, the conditions under which the property holds are specified by the sampling theorem. Shiftability may also be applied in the context of other domains, particularly orientation and scale. Jointly shiftable transforms that are simultaneously shiftable in more than one domain are explored. Two examples of jointly shiftable transforms are designed and implemented: a 1-D transform that is jointly shiftable in position and scale, and a 2-D transform that is jointly shiftable in position and orientation. The usefulness of these image representations for scale-space analysis, stereo disparity measurement, and image enhancement is demonstrated. >"

We \u201cpaint\u201d an image with a series of spline brush strokes. Brush strokes are chosen to match colors in a source image. A painting is built up in a series of layers, starting with a rough sketch drawn with a large brush. The sketch is painted over with progressively smaller brushes, but only in areas where the sketch differs from the blurred source image. Thus, visual emphasis in the painting corresponds roughly to the spatial energy present in the source image. We demonstrate a technique for painting with long, curved brush strokes, aligned to normals of image gradients. Thus we begin to explore the expressive quality of complex brush strokes. Rather than process images with a single manner of painting, we present a framework for describing a wide range of visual styles. A style is described as an intuitive set of parameters to the painting algorithm that a designer can adjust to vary the style of painting. We show examples of images rendered with different styles, and discuss long-term goals for expressive rendering styles as a general-purpose design tool for artists and animators. CR"

                "text": "Scratches on old films must be removed since these are more noticeable on higher definition and digital televisions. Wires that suspend actors or cars must be carefully erased during post production of special effects shots. Both of these are time consuming tasks but can be addressed by the following image restoration process: given the locations of noisy pixels to be replaced and a prototype image, restore those noisy pixels in a natural way. We call it image noise removal and this paper describes its fast iterative algorithm. Most existing algorithms for removing image noise use either frequency domain information (e.g low pass filtering) or spatial domain information (e.g median filtering or stochastic texture generation). The few that do combine the two domains place the limitation that the image be band limited and the band limits be known. Our algorithm works in both spatial and frequency domains without placing the limitations about band limits, making it possible to fully exploit advantages from each domain. While global features and large textures are captured in frequency domain, local continuity and sharpness are maintained in spatial domain. With a judicious choice of operations and domains in which they work, our dual-domain approach can reconstruct many contiguous noisy pixels in areas with large patterns while maintaining continuity of features such as lines. In addition, the image intensity does not have to be uniform. These are significant advantages over existing algorithms. Our algorithm is based on a general framework of projection onto convex sets (POCS). Any image analysis technique that can be described as a closed convex set can be cleanly plugged into the iteration loop of our algorithm. This is another important advantage of our algorithm.

We show how the target acquisition probabilities and, conversely, the ranges at which objects can be detected are changed by the inclusion of atmospheric effects. It is assumed that images are contrast limited rather than noise limited, as is indeed the case with most visible, near-infrared, and thermal infrared sensors. For short focal lengths with low angular magnification, atmospheric effects on target acquisition are negligible. However, for longer focal lengths with large angular magnification, resolution is limited by the atmosphere, and this has a strong adverse effect on target acquisition probabilities, times, and ranges. The considerable improvement possible with image correction for atmospheric blur automatically in a fraction of a second is significant for contrast-limited imaging and is also discussed. Knowledge of the atmospheric modulation transfer function is essential to good system design and is also useful in image restoration for any type of target or object. Finally, a new target-transferfunction model is suggested that considers the overall image-spectrum target received by the human visual system rather than only the main harmonic detail as in the Johnson chart model.
