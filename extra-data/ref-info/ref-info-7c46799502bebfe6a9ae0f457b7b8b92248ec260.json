The distortion is defined as the expected value of some function of the error between the input and the output of the quantizer. Equations are derived for the parameters of a quantizer with minimum distortion. The equations are not soluble without recourse to numerical methods, so an algorithm is developed to simplify their numerical solution. The case of an input signal with normally distributed amplitude and an expected squared error distortion measure is explicitly computed and values of the optimum quantizer parameters are tabulated. The optimization of a quantizer subject to the restriction that both input and output levels be equally spaced is also treated, and appropriate parameters are tabulated for the same case as above."

This algorithm can be used with any kind of signal amplitude distributions ranging from analytical probability density functions (pdf) to experimental 'density functions. In the particular case of known pdf like uniform, Gaussian, Laplacian and Gamma densities, it gives results which agree or are better than those previously published /2,4,5,6/. The same type of algorithmic procedure may also be used for block-of-samples quantization; in this case the statistics average must be replaced by the time average. In addition, the simplicity of the proposed algorithm allows to envisage a real-time, microprocessor based, block adaptive quantizer implementation in which the quantizer parameters are periodically updated and transmitted with each data block. This technique can be used, for instance, to optimally quantize the speech coding parameters derived from the low bit rates speech compression algorithm as described in [7]."

                "text": "This paper treats the problem of optimal selection of data quantization levels for minimum error. No assumptions are made regarding the underlying statistics of the process to be quantized. A finite precursor sample of the data is analyzed to infer the underlying distribution. Selection of optimum quantization levels can then be related to the generation of an optimum histogram for the data record. The optimum histogram is obtained by a dynamic programming approach for both least mean square error and minimum Chebychev error criteria. Transmitted data can then be quantized according to levels specified by the histogram. The process can be repeated periodically either with a new data sample, if the underlying process is nonstationary, or performed on the accumulated record in the stationary case. INTRODUCTION An important error source in digital telemetering applications arises in the quantization of analog signals prior to transmission which are to be reconstituted as analog signals upon reception. The encoding/decoding scheme, mutually agreed to by transmitter and receiver, is as follows. L Quantization intervals I1,I2,...,IL and corresponding quantization levels Q1,Q2 ...Qi , Ii, are agreed to. The intervals Ii are usually contiguous and cover the total possible range of input signal voltages x(t). At a particular sampling instant tk, the input analog signal voltage x(tk) is quantized to the level Qi corresponding to the bin interval Ii it has fallen in. The level Qi (or a symbol representation thereof) is transmitted and the receiver reconstructed signal will be based on the assumption that x(t) had value Qi at the sampling instant. Of course, an irreparable error is made and even with noiseless channels x(t) can not be reproduced with perfect fidelity at the receiver output. Up to the point of diminishing return where quantization is no greater a contributor to output error than are transmitter, channel and receiver noise, additional levels of quantization will reduce the error; but, at the expense of increased transmitted data rate. Thus, both for fidelity and data rate considerations, the choice of quantization intervals and levels is an important one and should be made under the guidance of a minimum-distortion-with-minimum-levels policy to the extent that such a criterion can be devised. For the rare case in which the stochastic signal x(t) has a known a priori probability density function (pdf) Max, reference 1, has provided an optimum solution. Here we present a method that requires no such a priori knowledge and provides additionally remarkably good estimates of tile unknown underlying pdf. MINIMAL A POSTERIORI ERROR HISTOGRAM CRITERION In Max\u2019s method the contiguous quantization intervals Ii = (D1,D2), I2 = [D2, D3)..., IL = [DL,DL+1) (DI = 4 ,DL+1 = 4 ) and associated quantization levels Qi are selected to minimize a distortion D which is defined as the a priori expected value of a differentiable . on f of the quantization error; By differentiating D with respect the levels Qi and division points Di, Max obtains 2L-1 simultaneous equations for the unknown parameters. For the particular case he treats in depth, D is the mean square error (f(x)=x) and the system of equations becomes"

                "text": "In 1948 W. R. Bennett used a companding model for nonuniform quantization and proposed the formula D \\: = \\: \\frac{1}{12N^{2}} \\: \\int \\: p(x) [ E(x) ]^{-2} \\dx for the mean-square quantizing error where N is the number of levels, p (x) is the probability density of the input, and E \\prime (x) is the slope of the compressor curve. The formula, an approximation based on the assumption that the number of levels is large and overload distortion is negligible, is a useful tool for analytical studies of quantization. This paper gives a heuristic argument generalizing Bennett's formula to block quantization where a vector of random variables is quantized. The approach is again based on the asymptotic situation where N , the number of quantized output vectors, is very large. Using the resulting heuristic formula, an optimization is performed leading to an expression for the minimum quantizing noise attainable for any block quantizer of a given block size k . The results are consistent with Zador's results and specialize to known results for the one- and two-dimensional cases and for the case of infinite block length (k \\rightarrow \\infty) . The same heuristic approach also gives an alternate derivation of a bound of Elias for multidimensional quantization. Our approach leads to a rigorous method for obtaining upper bounds on the minimum distortion for block quantizers. In particular, for k = 3 we give a tight upper bound that may in fact be exact. The idea of representing a block quantizer by a block \"compressor\" mapping followed with an optimal quantizer for uniformly distributed random vectors is also explored. It is not always possible to represent an optimal quantizer with this block companding model."

All of these measures involve some form of distortion measure between the second order properties of the speech processes producing the waveforms instead of an average of the waveform error power. In particular, they depend on the power spectral densities or linear models of the speech process. In this report the properties and interrelations of several such measures are developed. In particular, the relative strengths or equivalences of the various implications and applications of these measures to prediction, detection, and coding are summarized. (Author)"

A reference pattern for each word to be recognized is stored as a time pattern of linear prediction coefficients (LPC). The total log prediction residual of an input signal is minimized by optimally registering the reference LPC onto the input autocorrelation coefficients using the dynamic programming algorithm (DP). The input signal is recognized as the reference word which produces the minimum prediction residual. A sequential decision procedure is used to reduce the amount of computation in DP. A frequency normalization with respect to the long-time spectral distribution is used to reduce effects of variations in the frequency response of telephone connections. The system has been implemented on a DDP-516 computer for the 200-word recognition experiment. The recognition rate for a designated male talker is 97.3 percent for telephone input, and the recognition time is about 22 times real time."

                "text": "The main purpose of this paper is to describe a process for partitioning an N-dimensional population into k sets on the basis of a sample. The process, which is called 'k-means,' appears to give partitions which are reasonably efficient in the sense of within-class variance. That is, if p is the probability mass function for the population, S = {S1, S2, * *, Sk} is a partition of EN, and ui, i = 1, 2, * , k, is the conditional mean of p over the set Si, then W2(S) = ff=ISi f z u42 dp(z) tends to be low for the partitions S generated by the method. We say 'tends to be low,' primarily because of intuitive considerations, corroborated to some extent by mathematical analysis and practical computational experience. Also, the k-means procedure is easily programmed and is computationally economical, so that it is feasible to process very large samples on a digital computer. Possible applications include methods for similarity grouping, nonlinear prediction, approximating multivariate distributions, and nonparametric tests for independence among several variables. In addition to suggesting practical classification methods, the study of k-means has proved to be theoretically interesting. The k-means concept represents a generalization of the ordinary sample mean, and one is naturally led to study the pertinent asymptotic behavior, the object being to establish some sort of law of large numbers for the k-means. This problem is sufficiently interesting, in fact, for us to devote a good portion of this paper to it. The k-means are defined in section 2.1, and the main results which have been obtained on the asymptotic behavior are given there. The rest of section 2 is devoted to the proofs of these results. Section 3 describes several specific possible applications, and reports some preliminary results from computer experiments conducted to explore the possibilities inherent in the k-means idea. The extension to general metric spaces is indicated briefly in section 4. The original point of departure for the work described here was a series of problems in optimal classification (MacQueen [9]) which represented special"

We examine this work on the theory of optimum points of stratification from the point of view of their applications and we point out inherent logical difficulties in the procedures in \u00a7 2. In \u00a7 3, we propose a type of two-stage stratified sampling procedure to overcome the logical difficulties and study the actual performance in numerical terms of the proposed sampling procedure as applied to two probability density functions. In \u00a7\u00a7 4 and 5 we comment respectively on the salient features of the proposed sampling procedure and on the significance of the results of the investigations carried out here."
