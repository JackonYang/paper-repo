This article shows how a general heuristic principle for scale selection can be applied to the problem of detecting and localizing junctions. In a first uncommitted processing step initial hypotheses about interesting scale levels (and regions of interest) are generated from scales where normalized differential invariants assume maxima over scales (and space). Then, based on this scale (and region) information, a more refined processing stage is invoked tuned to the task at hand. The resulting method is the first junction detector with automatic scale selection. Whereas this article deals with the specific problem of junction detection, the underlying ideas apply also to other types of differential feature detectors, such as blob detectors, edge detectors, and ridge defectors.<<ETX>>"

                "text": "When computing descriptors of image data, the type of information that can be extracted may be strongly dependent on the scales at which the image operators are applied. This article presents a systematic methodology for addressing this problem. A mechanism is presented for automatic selection of scale levels when detecting one-dimensional image features, such as edges and ridges.A novel concept of a scale-space edge is introduced, defined as a connected set of points in scale-space at which: (i) the gradient magnitude assumes a local maximum in the gradient direction, and (ii) a normalized measure of the strength of the edge response is locally maximal over scales. An important consequence of this definition is that it allows the scale levels to vary along the edge. Two specific measures of edge strength are analyzed in detail, the gradient magnitude and a differential expression derived from the third-order derivative in the gradient direction. For a certain way of normalizing these differential descriptors, by expressing them in terms of so-called \u03b3-normalized derivatives, an immediate consequence of this definition is that the edge detector will adapt its scale levels to the local image structure. Specifically, sharp edges will be detected at fine scales so as to reduce the shape distortions due to scale-space smoothing, whereas sufficiently coarse scales will be selected at diffuse edges, such that an edge model is a valid abstraction of the intensity profile across the edge.Since the scale-space edge is defined from the intersection of two zero-crossing surfaces in scale-space, the edges will by definition form closed curves. This simplifies selection of salient edges, and a novel significance measure is proposed, by integrating the edge strength along the edge. Moreover, the scale information associated with each edge provides useful clues to the physical nature of the edge.With just slight modifications, similar ideas can be used for formulating ridge detectors with automatic selection, having the characteristic property that the selected scales on a scale-space ridge instead reflect the width of the ridge.It is shown how the methodology can be implemented in terms of straightforward visual front-end operations, and the validity of the approach is supported by theoretical analysis as well as experiments on real-world and synthetic data."

In other words, it generates coarse segmentation cues, and can hence be seen as preceding further processing, which can then be properly tuned. It is argued that once such information is available, many other processing tasks can become much simpler. Experiments on real imagery demonstrate that the proposed theory gives intuitive results."

This article emphasizes the need for including explicit mechanisms for automatic scale selection in feature tracking algorithms in order to: (i) adapt the local scale of processing to the local image structure, and (ii) adapt to the size variations that may occur over time. The problems of corner detection and blob detection are treated in detail, and a combined framework for feature tracking is presented. The integrated tracking algorithm overcomes some of the inherent limitations of exposing fixed-scale tracking methods to image sequences in which the size variations are large. It is also shown how the stability over time of scale descriptors can be used as a part of a multi-cue similarity measure for matching. Experiments on real-world sequences are presented showing the performance of the algorithm when applied to (individual) tracking of corners and blobs."

Size variations of image structures can occur for several reasons, e.g. because the world contains objects of different physical size, because surface textures contain structures at different scales, and because of perspective effects and noise in the image formation process. A proper representation of scale is essential to most visual tasks requiring stable descriptors of image structure. In certain problems, such as shape-from-texture, scale variations in an image also constitute a primary cue in its own right."

As an example the range of ?-values is determined such that a second derivative of Gaussian filter kernel detects ridges but not edges. Some results of this relatively simple ridge detector are shown for two-dimensional images."

                "text": "In practice the relevant details of images exist only over a restricted range of scale. Hence it is important to study the dependence of image structure on the level of resolution. It seems clear enough that visual perception treats images on several levels of resolution simultaneously and that this fact must be important for the study of perception. However, no applicable mathematically formulated theory to deal with such problems appers to exist. In this paper it is shown that any image can be embedded in a one-parameter family of derived images (with resolution as the parameter) in essentially only one unique way if the constraint that no spurious detail should be generated when the resolution is diminished, is applied. The structure of this family is governed by the well known diffusion equation (a parabolic, linear, partial differential equation of the second order). As such the structure fits into existing theories that treat the front end of the visual system as a continuous tack of homogeneous layer, characterized by iterated local processing schemes. When resolution is decreased the images becomes less articulated because the extrem (\u201clight and dark blobs\u201d) disappear one after the other. This erosion of structure is a simple process that is similar in every case. As a result any image can be described as a juxtaposed and nested set of light and dark blobs, wherein each blod has a limited range of resolution in which it manifests itself. The structure of the family of derived images permits a derivation of the sampling density required to sample the image at multiple scales of resolution. The natural scale along the resolution axis (leading to an informationally uniform sampling density) is logarithmic, thus the structure is apt for the description of size invariances."

In particular, if one assumes scale space filters to be linear, isotropic convolution filters, then two conditions (viz. recursivity and scale-invariance) suffice to narrow down the collection of possible filters to a family that essentially depends on one parameter which determines the qualitative shape of the filter. Gaussian filters correspond to one particular value of this shape-parameter. For other values the filters exhibit a more complicated pattern of excitatory and inhibitory regions. This might well be relevant to the study of the neurophysiology of biological visual systems, for recent research shows the existence of extensive disinhibitory regions outside the periphery of the classical center-surround receptive field of LGN and retinal ganglion cells (in cats). Such regions cannot be accounted for by models based on the second order derivative of the Gaussian. Finally, the authors investigate how this work ties in with another axiomatic approach of scale space operators which focuses on the semigroup properties of the operator family. The authors show that only a discrete subset of filters gives rise to an evolution which can be characterized by means of a partial differential equation. >"

The goal is to relate the results of this analysis to the structure of the picture, which is determined by the physics of the image generation process. Candidates for contour points are the maximal magnitudes of the gray-value gradient for different scales in the direction of the gradient. Based on the output of such a bank of gradient filters, a procedure is proposed to select automatically a suitable scale, and with that, the size of the right convolution kernel. The application of poorly adapted filters, which make the exact localization of gray-value corners or T-, X-, and Y-junctions more difficult, is thus avoided. Possible gaps at such junctions are discussed for images of real scenes, and possibilities for the closure of some of these gaps are demonstrated when the extrema of the magnitudes of the gray-value gradients are used. >"

Even the best edge operators can not reliably detect these two-dimensional features. This contribution proposes a solution to the two-dimensional problem. In this paper, I address the following: \u2022 'L'-junction detection. Previous attempts, relying on the second differentials of the image surface have essentially measured image curvature. Recently Harris [Harris 87] implemented a 'corner' detector that is based only on first differentials. I provide a mathematical proof to explain how this algorithm estimates image curvature. Although this algorithm will isolate image 'L'junctions, its performance cannot be predicted for T'-junctions and other higher order image structures. \u2022 Instead, an image representation is proposed that exploits the richness of the local differential geometrical 'topography ' of the intensity surface. Theoretical and experimental results are presented which demonstrate how idealised instances of two-dimensional surface features such as junctions can be characterised by the differential geometry of a simple facet model. \u2022 Preliminary results are very encouraging. Current studies are concerned with the extension to real data. I am investigating statistical noise models to provide a measure of 'confidence' in the geometric labelling. The richness and sparseness of a two-dimensional structure can be exploited in many high-level vision processes. I intend to use my representation to explore some of these fields in future work."

Estimating such deformations constitutes an important subtask in several computer vision problems relating to image correspondence and shape estimation. The following subjects are treated: The problem of decomposing affine flow fields into simpler components is analysed in detail. A canonical parametrization is presented based on singular value decomposition, which naturally separates the rotationally invariant components of the flow field from the rotationally variant ones. A novel mechanism is presented for automatic selection of scale levels when estimating local affine deformations. This mechanism is expressed within a multiscale framework where disparity estimates are computed in a hierarchical coarse-to-fine manner and corrected using iterative techniques. Then, deformation estimates are selected from the scales that minimize a certain normalized residual over scales. Finally, the descriptors so obtained serve as initial data for computing refined estimates of the local deformations.<<ETX>>"

The need for two scale parameters is emphasized: a local scale, for describing the amount of smoothing used for suppressing noise and irrelevant details when computing primitive texture descriptors from image data; and an integration scale, for describing the size of the region in space over which the statistics of the local descriptors is accummulated. The proposed computational model is expressed completely in terms of different invariants defined from Gaussian derivatives at multiple scales in scale-space. The resulting texture description can be combined with various assumptions about surface texture to estimate local surface orientation. Two specific assumptions, weak isotropy and constant area, are explored in more detail.

A front-end vision system is designed to establish a convenient format of some sampled scalar field, which is suited for postprocessing by various dedicated routines. The emphasis is on the motivations and implications of symmetries of the environment; they pose natural, a priori constraints on the design of a front-end.The focus is on static images, defined on a multidimensional spatial domain, for which it is assumed that there are no a priori preferred points, directions, or scales. In addition, the front-end is required to be linear. These requirements are independent of any particular image geometry and express the front-end's pure syntactical, \u201cbottom up\u201d nature.It is shown that these symmetries suffice to establish the functionality properties of a front-end. For each location in the visual field and each inner scale it comprises a hierarchical family of tensorial apertures, known as the Gaussian family, the lowest order of which is the normalised Gaussian. The family can be truncated at any given order in a consistent way. The resulting set constitutes a basis for alocal jet bundle.\nNote that scale-space theory shows up here without any call upon the \u201cprohibition of spurious detail\u201d, which, in some way or another, usually forms the basic starting point for \u201cdiffusion-like\u201d scale-space theories."

Notably, this descriptor comprises two scale parameters; a local scale parameter describing the amount of smoothing used in derivative computations, and an integration scale parameter determining over how large a region in space the statistics of regional descriptors is accumulated.Experimental results for both synthetic and natural images are presented, and the relation with models of biological vision is briefly discussed."

                "text": "This thesis, within the subfield of computer science known as computer vision, deals with the use of scale-space analysis in early low-level processing of visual information. The main contributions comprise the following five subjects: The formulation of a scale-space theory for discrete signals. Previously, the scale-space concept has been expressed for continuous signals only. We propose that the canonical way to construct a scale-space for discrete signals is by convolution with a kernel called the discrete analogue of the Gaussian kernel, or equivalently by solving a semi-discretized version of the diffusion equation. Both the one-dimensional and two-dimensional cases are covered. An extensive analysis of discrete smoothing kernels is carried out for one-dimensional signals and the discrete scale-space properties of the most common discretizations to the continuous theory are analysed. A representation, called the scale-space primal sketch, which gives a formal description of the hierarchical relations between structures at different levels of scale. It is aimed at making information in the scale-space representation explicit. We give a theory for its construction and an algorithm for computing it. A theory for extracting significant image structures and determining the scales of these structures from this representation in a solely bottom-up data-driven way. Examples demonstrating how such qualitative information extracted from the scale-space primal sketch can be used for guiding and simplifying other early visual processes. Applications are given to edge detection, histogram analysis and classification based on local features. Among other possible applications one can mention perceptual grouping, texture analysis, stereo matching, model matching and motion. A detailed theoretical analysis of the evolution properties of critical points and blobs in scale-space, comprising drift velocity estimates under scale-space smoothing, a classification of the possible types of generic events at bifurcation situations and estimates of how the number of local extrema in a signal can be expected to decrease as function of the scale parameter. For two-dimensional signals the generic bifurcation events are annihilations and creations of extremum-saddle point pairs. Interpreted in terms of blobs, these transitions correspond to annihilations, merges, splits and creations. Experiments on different types of real imagery demonstrate that the proposed theory gives perceptually intuitive results."

The method also enables the user to measure degree of diffuseness, height of edges, and bar edge width. The Gaussian difference signatures and apparent width signatures used are defined. To sift out the major edges, subsets of edge pixels must be selected. For describing the local gray level, landscape averaging needs to be done in a noncommittal fashion, as opposed to fitting a specific function blindly to data. Edge focusing, which is a coarse-to-fine traversal of brightness changes, deals with the subsets, whereas signatures may be thought of as a kind of reasonably cleverly done averaging. This method is of importance for distinguishing between illumination phenomena and object edges, performing depth-from-focus in single images, and in junction analysis.<<ETX>>"

The shape adaptation procedure adapts the smoothing operation to the local ridge structures, which allows interrupted ridges to be joined without destroying essential singularities such as branching points and enforces continuity of their directional fields. The scale selection procedure estimates local ridge width and adapts the amount of smoothing to the local amount of noise. In addition, a ridgeness measure is defined, which reflects how well the local image structure agrees with a qualitative ridge model, and is used for spreading the results of shape adaptation into noisy areas. The combined approach makes it possible to resolve fine scale structures in clear areas while reducing the risk of enhancing noise in blurred or fragmented areas. The result is a reliable and adaptively detailed estimate of the ridge orientation field and ridge width, as well as a smoothed grey-level version of the input image. We propose that these general techniques should be of interest to developers of automatic fingerprint identification systems as well as in other applications of processing related types of imagery."

This representation is constructed by detecting peaks and ridges in the difference of lowpass (DOLP) transform. Descriptions of shapes which are encoded in this representation may be matched efficiently despite changes in size, orientation, or position. Motivations for a multiple resolution representation are presented first, followed by the definition of the DOLP transform. Techniques are then presented for encoding a symbolic structural description of forms from the DOLP transform. This process involves detecting local peaks and ridges in each bandpass image and in the entire three-dimensional space defined by the DOLP transform. Linking adjacent peaks in different bandpass images gives a multiple resolution tree which describes shape. Peaks which are local maxima in this tree provide landmarks for aligning, manipulating, and matching shapes. Detecting and linking the ridges in each DOLP bandpass image provides a graph which links peaks within a shape in a bandpass image and describes the positions of the boundaries of the shape at multiple resolutions. Detecting and linking the ridges in the DOLP three-space describes elongated forms and links the largest peaks in the tree. The principles for determining the correspondence between symbols in pairs of such descriptions are then described. Such correspondence matching is shown to be simplified by using the correspondence at lower resolutions to constrain the possible correspondence at higher resolutions."

A genuinely discrete scale-space theory is developed and its connection to the continuous scale-space theory is explained. Special attention is given to discretization effects, which occur when results from the continuous scale-space theory are to be implemented computationally. The 1D problem is solved completely in an axiomatic manner. For the 2D problem, the author discusses how the 2D discrete scale space should be constructed. The main results are as follows: the proper way to apply the scale-space theory to discrete signals and discrete images is by discretization of the diffusion equation, not the convolution integral; the discrete scale space obtained in this way can be described by convolution with the kernel, which is the discrete analog of the Gaussian kernel, a scale-space implementation based on the sampled Gaussian kernel might lead to undesirable effects and computational problems, especially at fine levels of scale; the 1D discrete smoothing transformations can be characterized exactly and a complete catalogue is given; all finite support 1D discrete smoothing transformations arise from repeated averaging over two adjacent elements (the limit case of such an averaging process is described); and the symmetric 1D discrete smoothing kernels are nonnegative and unimodal, in both the spatial and the frequency domain. >"

To understand the representation of images by the mammalian visual system, it might therefore be useful to consider the statistics of images from the natural environment (i.e., images with trees, rocks, bushes, etc). In this study, various coding schemes are compared in relation to how they represent the information in such natural images. The coefficients of such codes are represented by arrays of mechanisms that respond to local regions of space, spatial frequency, and orientation (Gabor-like transforms). For many classes of image, such codes will not be an efficient means of representing information. However, the results obtained with six natural images suggest that the orientation and the spatial-frequency tuning of mammalian simple cells are well suited for coding the information in such images if the goal of the code is to convert higher-order redundancy (e.g., correlation between the intensities of neighboring pixels) into first-order redundancy (i.e., the response distribution of the coefficients). Such coding produces a relatively high signal-to-noise ratio and permits information to be transmitted with only a subset of the total number of cells. These results support Barlow's theory that the goal of natural vision is to represent the information in the natural environment with minimal redundancy."

A scheme is proposed where junction candidates are first detected in a multiscale preprocessing step, which generates junction candidates with associated regions of interest. These junction features are matched to edges based on spatial coincidence. For each matched pair, a tentative break point is introduced at the edge point closest to the junction. Finally, these feature combinations serve as input for an MDL approximation method which tests the validity of the break point hypotheses and classifies the resulting edge segments as either \u201cstraight\u201d or \u201ccurved.\u201d Experiments on real world image data demonstrate the viability of the approach."

Various families of operators with special kinds of symmetries (such as translation, rotation, magnification) are explicitly constructed in 1-D, 2-D, and 3-D. A concept of 'order' is defined, and finite orthonormal bases of functions closely connected with the operators of various orders are constructed. Linear transformations between the various representations are considered. The method is based on two fundamental assumptions: a decrease of resolution should not introduce spurious detail, and the local operators should be self-similar under changes of resolution. These assumptions merely sum up the even more general need for homogeneity isotropy, scale invariance, and separability of independent dimensions of front-end processing in the absence of a priori information. >"

The structure of current AFIS closely resembles the manual procedure used by human experts (McCabe et al., 1992), and can be briefly described as follows: \n \n \nEnhance the fingerprint image. This usually involves a filtering step to suppress noise. The output from this step can be either a better grey-level image or a binary image in which the ridge structure of the original is preserved. \n \n \nExtract the ridge structure of the fingerprint, i.e., build a graph-like representation of the skeletonized ridges and their incidence relations. \n \n \nClassify the fingerprint according to its ridge structure at a coarse scale. This reduces the search space, thus speeding up the procedure. \n \n \nDetect minutiae, i.e. singularities in the ridge structure, such as bifurcations and ridge endings. Then, build a feature vector of the fingerprint. \n \n \nStore the feature vectors in a database for later use and/or search for fingerprints with matching feature vectors (which will most likely correspond to the same person)."

We show that these properties taken together constrain the structure of receptive fields to a very large degree. Only those field structures that arise as solutions of a certain linear partial differential equation of the second order prove to satisfy these general constraints. The equation admits of complete, orthonormal families of solutions. These families have to be regarded as the possible receptive field families subject to certain symmetry conditions. They can be transformed into each other via unitary transformations. Thus a single representation suffices to construct all the others. This theory permits us to classify the possible linear receptive field structures exhaustively, and to define their internal and external interrelations. This induces a principled taxonomy of linear receptive fields."

The carbide distribution of microscopic specimen images is assessed by classifying according to so-called 'degree' and 'type' of the specimen. 'Degree' is represented by features extracted with automatic scale selection, and 'type' information is computed from second-moment descriptors. In combination with a morphological verification scheme, this pattern classifier shares large similarities with current manual techniques. Compared to previous work, the new classification scheme has several advantages: the significant scale of the carbide agglomeration is calculated explicitly, and the method is less sensitive to the variance of spatial connectivity than a morphological approach."

The use of isotropic and anisotropic fine-to-coarse transformations of grey level images is discussed, and an extension of the approach to multi-valued images is proposed, where cross-interactions between the different colour channels are allowed."

Theorems that estimate local Lipschitz exponents of functions from the evolution across scales of their wavelet transform are reviewed. It is then proven that the local maxima of the wavelet transform modulus detect the locations of irregular structures and provide numerical procedures to compute their Lipschitz exponents. The wavelet transform of singularities with fast oscillations has a particular behavior that is studied separately. The local frequency of such oscillations is measured from the wavelet transform modulus maxima. It has been shown numerically that one- and two-dimensional signals can be reconstructed, with a good approximation, from the local maxima of their wavelet transform modulus. As an application, an algorithm is developed that removes white noises from signals by analyzing the evolution of the wavelet transform maxima across scales. In two dimensions, the wavelet transform maxima indicate the location of edges in images. >"

It is a pleasant surprise that the mathematics of touching and contact can be developed along the same algebraic lines as that of linear systems theory. In this paper we exhibit the relevant spectral transform, delta functions and sampling theorems. We do this mainly for a piecewise representation of the geometrical object boundary by Monge patches, i.e. in a representation by (umbral) functions. For this representation, the analogy with the linear systems theory is obvious, and a source of inspiration for the treatment of geometric contact using a spectrum of directions."

A new 'difference-of-offset-Gaussians' or DOOG neural mechanism was identified, which provided a plausible neural mechanism for generating such Gaussian derivative-like fields. The DOOG mechanism and the associated Gaussian derivative model provided a better approximation to the data than did the Gabor or other competing models. A model-free Wiener filter analysis provided independent confirmation of these results. A machine vision system was constructed to simulate human foveal retinal vision, based on Gaussian derivative filters. It provided edge and line enhancement (deblurring) and noise suppression, while retaining all the information in the original image."

This article deals with the axiomatic formulation of the special type of multi-scale representation known as scale-space representation. Specifically, this work is concerned with the problem of how different choices of basic assumptions (scale-space axioms) restrict the class of permissible smoothing operations.A scale-space formulation previously expressed for discrete signals is adapted to the continuous domain. The basic assumptions are that the scale-space family should be generated by convolution with a one-parameter family of rotationally symmetric smoothing kernels that satisfy a semi-group structure and obey a causality condition expressed as a non-enhancement requirement of local extrema. Under these assumptions, it is shown that the smoothing kernel is uniquely determined to be a Gaussian.Relations between this scale scale-space formulation and recent formulations based on scale invariance are explained in detail. Connections are also pointed out to approaches based on non-uniform smoothing."
