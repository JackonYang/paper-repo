In this paper we present a new image representation which provides a transformation from the raw pixel data to a small set of image regions which are coherent in color and texture space. This so-called \"blobworld\" representation is based on segmentation using the expectation-maximization algorithm on combined color and texture features. The texture features we use for the segmentation arise from a new approach to texture description and scale selection. We describe a system that uses the blobworld representation to retrieve images. An important and unique aspect of the system is that, in the context of similarity-based querying, the user is allowed to view the internal representation of the submitted image and the query results. Similar systems do not offer the user this view into the workings of the system; consequently, the outcome of many queries on these systems can be quite inexplicable, despite the availability of knobs for adjusting the similarity metric."

In this framework, a user labels an image as positive if the image contains the concept. Each example image is a bag of instances (sub-images) where only the bag is labeled-not the individual instances (sub-images). From a small collection of positive and negative examples, the system learns the concept and uses it to retrieve images that contain the concept from a large database. The learned \"concepts\" are simple templates that capture the color, texture and spatial properties of the class of images. We introduced this method earlier in the domain of natural scene classification using simple, low resolution sub-images as instances. In this paper, we extend the bag generator (the mechanism which takes an image and generates a set of instances) to generate more complex instances using multiple cues on segmented high resolution images. We show that this method can be used to learn certain object class concepts (e.g. cars) in addition, to natural scenes."

Our method follows the texture recognition work of De Bonet and Viola (1998). We use feature vectors which capture the joint occurrence of local features at multiple resolutions. The distribution of feature vectors for a set of training images of an object class is estimated by clustering the data and then forming a mixture of Gaussian models. The mixture model is further refined by determining which clusters are the most discriminative for the class and retaining only those clusters. After the model is learned, test images are classified by computing the likelihood of their feature vectors with respect to the model. We present promising results in applying our technique to face detection and car detection."

In a first stage, the method automatically identifies distinctive parts in the training set by applying a clustering algorithm to patterns selected by an interest operator.

We divide detection into visual selection and final classification, concentrating on the former: drastically reducing the number of candidate regions that require further, usually more intensive, processing, but with a minimum of computation and missed detections. Bottom-up processing is based on local groupings of edge fragments constrained by loose geometrical relationships. They have no a priori semantic or geometric interpretation. The role of training is to select special groupings that are moderately likely at certain places on the object but rare in the background. We show that the statistics in both populations are stable. The candidate regions are those that contain global arrangements of several local groupings. Whereas our model was not conceived to explain brain functions, it does cohere with evidence about the functions of neurons in V1 and V2, such as responses to coarse or incomplete patterns (e.g., illusory contours) and to scale and translation invariance in IT. Finally, the algorithm is applied to face and symbol detection."

B. Julesz (1981) introduced the term texton, analogous to a phoneme in speech recognition, but did not provide an operational definition for gray-level images. We re-invent textons as frequently co-occurring combinations of oriented linear filter outputs. These can be learned using a K-means approach. By mapping each pixel to its nearest texton, the image can be analyzed into texton channels, each of which is a point set where discrete techniques such as Voronoi diagrams become applicable. Local histograms of texton frequencies can be used with a /spl chi//sup 2/ test for significant differences to find texture boundaries. Natural images contain both textured and untextured regions, so we combine this cue with that of the presence of peaks of contour energy derived from outputs of odd- and even-symmetric oriented Gaussian derivative filters. Each of these cues has a domain of applicability, so to facilitate cue combination we introduce a gating operator based on a statistical test for isotropy of Delaunay neighbors. Having obtained a local measure of how likely two nearby pixels are to belong to the same region, we use the spectral graph theoretic framework of normalized cuts to find partitions of the image into regions of coherent texture and brightness. Experimental results on a wide range of images are shown."

The first is the Sowerby dataset, which contains one hundred colour photographs of country roads in England that have been interactively segmented and classified into six classes-edge, vegetation, air, road, building, and other. The second domain is a set of thirty five-images, taken in San Francisco, which have been interactively segmented into similar classes. In each domain we learn the joint probability distributions of filter responses, based on colour and texture, for each class. These distributions are then used for classification. We restrict ourselves to a limited number of filters in order to ensure that the learnt filter responses do not overfit the training data (our region classes are chosen so as to ensure that there is enough data to avoid over fitting). We do performance analysis on the two datasets by evaluating the false positive and false negative error rates for the classification. This shows that the learnt models achieve high accuracy in classifying individual pixels into those classes for which the filter responses are approximately spatially homogeneous (i.e. road, vegetation, and air but not edge and building). A more sensitive performance measure, the Chernoff information, is calculated in order to quantify how well the cues for edge and building are doing. This demonstrates that statistical knowledge of the domain is a powerful tool for segmentation."

The channels are characterized by a bank of Gabor filters that nearly uniformly covers the spatial-frequency domain. A systematic filter selection scheme based on reconstruction of the input image from the filtered images is proposed. Texture features are obtained by subjecting each (selected) filtered image to a nonlinear transformation and computing a measure of energy in a window around each pixel. An unsupervised square-error clustering algorithm is then used to integrate the feature images and produce a segmentation. A simple procedure to incorporate spatial adjacency information in the clustering process is proposed. Experiments on images with natural textures as well as artificial textures with identical second and third-order statistics are reported. The algorithm appears to perform as predicted by preattentive texture discrimination by a human.<<ETX>>"

The technique models the distribution of human face patterns by means of a few view-based \"face\" and \"nonface\" model clusters. At each image location, a difference feature vector is computed between the local image pattern and the distribution-based model. A trained classifier determines, based on the difference feature vector measurements, whether or not a human face exists at the current image location. We show empirically that the distance metric we adopt for computing difference feature vectors, and the \"nonface\" clusters we include in our distribution-based model, are both critical for the success of our system."

Examples of the content we use include color, texture, and shape of image objects and regions. Potential applications include medical (`Give me other images that contain a tumor with a texture like this one'), photo-journalism (`Give me images that have blue at the top and red at the bottom'), and many others in art, fashion, cataloging, retailing, and industry. Key issues include derivation and computation of attributes of images and objects that provide useful query functionality, retrieval methods based on similarity as opposed to exact match, query by image example or user drawn image, the user interfaces, query refinement and navigation, high dimensional database indexing, and automatic and semi-automatic database population. We currently have a prototype system written in X/Motif and C running on an RS/6000 that allows a variety of queries, and a test database of over 1000 images and 1000 objects populated from commercially available photo clip art images. In this paper we present the main algorithms for color texture, shape and sketch query that we use, show example query results, and discuss future directions."

The textured feature space is generated by filtering the given textured images using isotropic and anisotropic filters, and analyzing their responses as multi-component conditional probability density functions. The texture segmentation is obtained by unifying region and boundary based information as an improved Geodesic Active Contour Model. The defined objective function is minimized using a gradient-descent method where a level set approach is used to implement the obtained PDE. According to this PDE, the curve propagation towards the final solution is guided by boundary and region based segmentation forces, and is constrained by a regularity force. The level set implementation is performed using a fast front propagation algorithm where topological changes are naturally handled. The performance of our method is demonstrated on a variety of synthetic and real textured frames."

The representation is an organized collection of grouping hints obtained from a combination of constraints on color and texture and constraints on geometric properties such as the structure of individual parts and the relationships between parts. Body plans can be learned from image data, using established statistical learning techniques. The approach is illustrated with two examples of programs that successfully use body plans for recognition: one example involves determining whether a picture contains a scantily clad human, using a body plan built by hand; the other involves determining whether a picture contains a horse, using a body plan learned from image data. In both cases, the system demonstrates excellent performance on large, uncontrolled test sets and very large and diverse control sets."
