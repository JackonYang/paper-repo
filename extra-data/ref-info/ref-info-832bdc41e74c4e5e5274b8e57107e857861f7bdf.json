Prior work on information extraction from semi-structured websites has required learning an extraction model specific to a given template via either manually labeled or distantly supervised data from that template. In this work, we propose a solution for \u201czero-shot\u201d open-domain relation extraction from webpages with a previously unseen template, including from websites with little overlap with existing sources of knowledge for distant supervision and websites in entirely new subject verticals. Our model uses a graph neural network-based approach to build a rich representation of text fields on a webpage and the relationships between them, enabling generalization to new templates. Experiments show this approach provides a 31% F1 gain over a baseline for zero-shot extraction in a new subject vertical."

To efficiently extract structured data from enormous websites in various verticals (e.g., books, restaurants), much research effort has been attracted, but most existing approaches either require considerable human effort or rely on strong features that lack of flexibility. We consider an ambitious scenario -- can we build a system that (1) is general enough to handle any vertical without re-implementation and (2) requires only one labeled example site from each vertical for training to automatically deal with other sites in the same vertical? In this paper, we propose a unified solution to demonstrate the feasibility of this scenario. Specifically, we design a set of weak but general features to characterize vertical knowledge (including attribute-specific semantics and inter-attribute layout relationships). Such features can be adopted in various verticals without redesign; meanwhile, they are weak enough to avoid overfitting of the learnt knowledge to seed sites. Given a new unseen site, the learnt knowledge is first applied to identify page-level candidate attribute values, while inevitably involve false positives. To remove noise, site-level information of the new site is then exploited to boost up the true values. The site-level information is derived in an unsupervised manner, without harm to the applicability of the solution. Promising experimental performance on 80 websites in 8 distinct verticals demonstrated the feasibility and flexibility of the proposed solution."

Existing methods for extracting relations from the DOM trees of semi-structured webpages can achieve high precision and recall only when manual annotations for each website are available. Although there have been efforts to learn extractors from automatically-generated labels, these methods are not sufficiently robust to succeed in settings with complex schemas and information-rich websites. \nIn this paper we present a new method for automatic extraction from semi-structured websites based on distant supervision. We automatically generate training labels by aligning an existing knowledge base with a web page and leveraging the unique structural characteristics of semi-structured websites. We then train a classifier based on the potentially noisy and incomplete labels to predict new relation instances. Our method can compete with annotation-based techniques in the literature in terms of extraction quality. A large-scale experiment on over 400,000 pages from dozens of multi-lingual long-tail websites harvested 1.25 million facts at a precision of 90%."

Previous work on this problem has either required significant human effort for each target site or used brittle heuristics to identify semantic data types. Our method only requires annotation for a few pages from a few sites in the target domain. Thus, after a tiny investment of human effort, our method allows automatic extraction from potentially thousands of other sites within the same domain. Our approach extends previous methods for detecting data fields in semi-structured web pages by matching those fields to domain schema columns using robust models of data values and contexts. Annotating 2---5 pages for 4---6 web sites yields an extraction accuracy of 83.8% on job offer sites and 91.1% on vacation rental sites. These results significantly outperform a baseline approach."

To increase the scale even further, we need to explore automatic methods for constructing knowledge bases. Previous approaches have primarily focused on text-based extraction, which can be very noisy. Here we introduce Knowledge Vault, a Web-scale probabilistic knowledge base that combines extractions from Web content (obtained via analysis of text, tabular data, page structure, and human annotations) with prior knowledge derived from existing knowledge repositories. We employ supervised machine learning methods for fusing these distinct information sources. The Knowledge Vault is substantially bigger than any previously published structured knowledge repository, and features a probabilistic inference system that computes calibrated probabilities of fact correctness. We report the results of multiple studies that explore the relative utility of the different information sources and extraction methods."

                "text": "Deep neural models for relation extraction tend to be less reliable when perfectly labeled data is limited, despite their success in label-sufficient scenarios. Instead of seeking more instance-level labels from human annotators, here we propose to annotate frequent surface patterns to form labeling rules. These rules can be automatically mined from large text corpora and generalized via a soft rule matching mechanism. Prior works use labeling rules in an exact matching fashion, which inherently limits the coverage of sentence matching and results in the low-recall issue. In this paper, we present a neural approach to ground rules for RE, named Nero, which jointly learns a relation extraction module and a soft matching module. One can employ any neural relation extraction models as the instantiation for the RE module. The soft matching module learns to match rules with semantically similar sentences such that raw corpora can be automatically labeled and leveraged by the RE module (in a much better coverage) as augmented supervision, in addition to the exactly matched sentences. Extensive experiments and analysis on two public and widely-used datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed Nero framework, comparing with both rule-based and semi-supervised methods. Through user studies, we find that the time efficiency for a human to annotate rules and sentences are similar (0.30 vs. 0.35 min per label). In particular, Nero\u2019s performance using 270 rules is comparable to the models trained using 3,000 labeled sentences, yielding a 9.5x speedup. Moreover, Nero can predict for unseen relations at test time and provide interpretable predictions. We release our code1 to the community for future research."

                "text": "Recent studies show that an overwhelming majority of emails are machine-generated and sent by businesses to consumers. Many large email services are interested in extracting structured data from such emails to enable intelligent assistants. This allows experiences like being able to answer questions such as \u201cWhat is the address of my hotel in New York?\u201d or \u201cWhen does my flight leave?\u201d. A high-quality email classifier is a critical piece in such a system. In this paper, we argue that the rich formatting used in business-to-consumer emails contains valuable information that can be used to learn better representations. Most existing methods focus only on textual content and ignore the rich HTML structure of emails. We introduce RiSER (Richly Structured Email Representation) - an approach for incorporating both the structure and content of emails. RiSER projects the email into a vector representation by jointly encoding the HTML structure and the words in the email. We then use this representation to train a classifier. To our knowledge, this is the first description of a neural technique for combining formatting information along with the content to learn improved representations for richly formatted emails. Experimenting with a large corpus of emails received by users of Gmail, we show that RiSER outperforms strong attention-based LSTM baselines. We expect that these benefits will extend to other corpora with richly formatted documents. We also demonstrate with examples where leveraging HTML structure leads to better predictions."

However, despite significant resources required for training such models, the performance of a model trained on one domain typically degrades dramatically when applied to a different domain, yet extracting entities from new emerging domains such as social media can be of significant interest. In this paper, we empirically investigate effective methods for conveniently adapting an existing, well-trained neural NER model for a new domain. Unlike existing approaches, we propose lightweight yet effective methods for performing domain adaptation for neural models. Specifically, we introduce adaptation layers on top of existing neural architectures, where no re-training using the source domain data is required. We conduct extensive empirical studies and show that our approach significantly outperforms stateof-the-art methods."

In contrast to KBC from text or tabular data, KBC from richly formatted data aims to extract relations conveyed jointly via textual, structural, tabular, and visual expressions. We introduce Fonduer, a machine-learning-based KBC system for richly formatted data. Fonduer presents a new data model that accounts for three challenging characteristics of richly formatted data: (1) prevalent document-level relations, (2) multimodality, and (3) data variety. Fonduer uses a new deep-learning model to automatically capture the representation (i.e., features) needed to learn how to extract relations from richly formatted data. Finally, Fonduer provides a new programming model that enables users to convert domain expertise, based on multiple modalities of information, to meaningful signals of supervision for training a KBC system. Fonduer-based KBC systems are in production for a range of use cases, including at a major online retailer. We compare Fonduer against state-of-the-art KBC approaches in four different domains. We show that Fonduer achieves an average improvement of 41 F1 points on the quality of the output knowledge base---and in some cases produces up to 1.87x the number of correct entries---compared to expert-curated public knowledge bases. We also conduct a user study to assess the usability of Fonduer's new programming model. We show that after using Fonduer for only 30 minutes, non-domain experts are able to design KBC systems that achieve on average 23 F1 points higher quality than traditional machine-learning-based KBC approaches."

We analyze and make explicit the model properties needed for such regularities to emerge in word vectors. The result is a new global logbilinear regression model that combines the advantages of the two major model families in the literature: global matrix factorization and local context window methods. Our model efficiently leverages statistical information by training only on the nonzero elements in a word-word cooccurrence matrix, rather than on the entire sparse matrix or on individual context windows in a large corpus. The model produces a vector space with meaningful substructure, as evidenced by its performance of 75% on a recent word analogy task. It also outperforms related models on similarity tasks and named entity recognition."

The algorithm propagates information between connected nodes through graph convolutions, generating a richer representation that can be exploited to improve word-level predictions.

Unlike web search, QA over a knowledge base gives out accurate and concise results, provided that natural language questions can be understood and mapped precisely to structured queries over the knowledge base. The challenge, however, is that a human can ask one question in many different ways. Previous approaches have natural limits due to their representations: rule based approaches only understand a small set of \"canned\" questions, while keyword based or synonym based approaches cannot fully understand the questions. In this paper, we design a new kind of question representation: templates, over a billion scale knowledge base and a million scale QA corpora. For example, for questions about a city's population, we learn templates such as What's the population of $city?, How many people are there in $city?. We learned 27 million templates for 2782 intents. Based on these templates, our QA system KBQA effectively supports binary factoid questions, as well as complex questions which are composed of a series of binary factoid questions. Furthermore, we expand predicates in RDF knowledge base, which boosts the coverage of knowledge base by 57 times. Our QA system beats all other state-of-art works on both effectiveness and efficiency over QALD benchmarks."

Extracting data from websites that use HTML templates is difficult because available wrapper methods are not designed to deal with websites that change over time (the inclusion or removal of HTML elements). We are the first to perform large scale empirical analyses of the causes of shift and propose the concept of domain entropy to quantify it. We draw from this analysis to propose a new semi-supervised search approach called XTPath. XTPath combines the existing XPath with carefully designed annotation extraction and informed search strategies. XTPath is the first method to store contextual node information from the training DOM and utilize it in a supervised manner. We utilize this data with our proposed recursive tree matching method which locates nodes most similar in context. The search is based on a heuristic function that takes into account the similarity of a tree compared to the structure that was present in the training data. We systematically evaluate XTPath using 117,422 pages from 75 diverse websites in 8 vertical markets that covers vastly different topics. Our XTPath method consistently outperforms XPath and a current commercial system in terms of successful extractions in a blackbox test. We are the first supervised wrapper extraction method to make our code and datasets available (online here: this http URL)."

This has motivated several researchers to work on surveys that attempt to provide an overall picture of the many existing proposals. Unfortunately, none of these surveys provide a complete picture, because they do not take region extractors into account. These tools are kind of preprocessors, because they help information extractors focus on the regions of a web document that contain relevant information. With the increasing complexity of web documents, region extractors are becoming a must to extract information from many websites. Beyond information extraction, region extractors have also found their way into information retrieval, focused web crawling, topic distillation, adaptive content delivery, mashups, and metasearch engines. In this paper, we survey the existing proposals regarding region extractors and compare them side by side."

Our system is truly end-to-end, requiring no feature engineering or data pre-processing, thus making it applicable to a wide range of sequence labeling tasks. We evaluate our system on two data sets for two sequence labeling tasks --- Penn Treebank WSJ corpus for part-of-speech (POS) tagging and CoNLL 2003 corpus for named entity recognition (NER). We obtain state-of-the-art performance on both the two data --- 97.55\\% accuracy for POS tagging and 91.21\\% F1 for NER."

Conventionally, the prominent review aspects of a product type are determined manually. This costly approach cannot scale to large and cross-domain services such as Amazon.com, Taobao.com or Yelp.com where there are a large number of product types and new products emerge almost everyday. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, for extracting the most prominent aspects of a given product type from textual reviews. The proposed framework, ExtRA, extracts K most prominent aspect terms or phrases which do not overlap semantically automatically without supervision. Extensive experiments show that ExtRA is effective and achieves the state-of-the-art performance on a dataset consisting of different product types."

The extracted features are often derived from the output of pre-existing natural language processing (NLP) systems, which leads to the propagation of the errors in the existing tools and hinders the performance of these systems. In this paper, we exploit a convolutional deep neural network (DNN) to extract lexical and sentence level features. Our method takes all of the word tokens as input without complicated pre-processing. First, the word tokens are transformed to vectors by looking up word embeddings 1 . Then, lexical level features are extracted according to the given nouns. Meanwhile, sentence level features are learned using a convolutional approach. These two level features are concatenated to form the final extracted feature vector. Finally, the features are fed into a softmax classifier to predict the relationship between two marked nouns. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods."

Recent work on reading comprehension made headway in answering simple questions, but tackling complex questions is still an ongoing research challenge. Conversely, semantic parsers have been successful at handling compositionality, but only when the information resides in a target knowledge-base. In this paper, we present a novel framework for answering broad and complex questions, assuming answering simple questions is possible using a search engine and a reading comprehension model. We propose to decompose complex questions into a sequence of simple questions, and compute the final answer from the sequence of answers. To illustrate the viability of our approach, we create a new dataset of complex questions, ComplexWebQuestions, and present a model that decomposes questions and interacts with the web to compute an answer. We empirically demonstrate that question decomposition improves performance from 20.8 precision@1 to 27.5 precision@1 on this new dataset."

                "text": "Relational reasoning is a central component of generally intelligent behavior, but has proven difficult for neural networks to learn. In this paper we describe how to use Relation Networks (RNs) as a simple plug-and-play module to solve problems that fundamentally hinge on relational reasoning. We tested RN-augmented networks on three tasks: visual question answering using a challenging dataset called CLEVR, on which we achieve state-of-the-art, super-human performance; text-based question answering using the bAbI suite of tasks; and complex reasoning about dynamic physical systems. Then, using a curated dataset called Sort-of-CLEVR we show that powerful convolutional networks do not have a general capacity to solve relational questions, but can gain this capacity when augmented with RNs. Our work shows how a deep learning architecture equipped with an RN module can implicitly discover and learn to reason about entities and their relations."

This paper proposes new methods for learning and using embeddings of word pairs that implicitly represent background knowledge about such relationships. Our pairwise embeddings are computed as a compositional function of each word\u2019s representation, which is learned by maximizing the pointwise mutual information (PMI) with the contexts in which the the two words co-occur. We add these representations to the cross-sentence attention layer of existing inference models (e.g. BiDAF for QA, ESIM for NLI), instead of extending or replacing existing word embeddings. Experiments show a gain of 2.7% on the recently released SQuAD 2.0 and 1.3% on MultiNLI. Our representations also aid in better generalization with gains of around 6-7% on adversarial SQuAD datasets, and 8.8% on the adversarial entailment test set by Glockner et al. (2018)."

Therefore, the availability of robust, flexible information extraction (IE) systems that transform the Web pages into program-friendly structures such as a relational database will become a great necessity. Although many approaches for data extraction from Web pages have been developed, there has been limited effort to compare such tools. Unfortunately, in only a few cases can the results generated by distinct tools be directly compared since the addressed extraction tasks are different. This paper surveys the major Web data extraction approaches and compares them in three dimensions: the task domain, the automation degree, and the techniques used. The criteria of the first dimension explain why an IE system fails to handle some Web sites of particular structures. The criteria of the second dimension classify IE systems based on the techniques used. The criteria of the third dimension measure the degree of automation for IE systems. We believe these criteria provide qualitatively measures to evaluate various IE approaches"

Prior efforts mostly focus on incorporating side information to achieve better recommendation performance. However, these methods have some weaknesses: (1) prediction of neural network-based embedding methods are hard to explain and debug; (2) symbolic, graph-based approaches (e.g., meta path-based models) require manual efforts and domain knowledge to define patterns and rules, and ignore the item association types (e.g. substitutable and complementary). In this paper, we propose a novel joint learning framework to integrate induction of explainable rules from knowledge graph with construction of a rule-guided neural recommendation model. The framework encourages two modules to complement each other in generating effective and explainable recommendation: 1) inductive rules, mined from item-centric knowledge graphs, summarize common multi-hop relational patterns for inferring different item associations and provide human-readable explanation for model prediction; 2) recommendation module can be augmented by induced rules and thus have better generalization ability dealing with the cold-start issue. Extensive experiments1 show that our proposed method has achieved significant improvements in item recommendation over baselines on real-world datasets. Our model demonstrates robust performance over \u201cnoisy\u201d item knowledge graphs, generated by linking item names to related entities."

The objective is to segment these data records, extract data items/fields from them and put the data in a database table. This problem has been studied by several researchers. However, existing methods still have some serious limitations. The first class of methods is based on machine learning, which requires human labeling of many examples from each Web site that one is interested in extracting data from. The process is time consuming due to the large number of sites and pages on the Web. The second class of algorithms is based on automatic pattern discovery. These methods are either inaccurate or make many assumptions. This paper proposes a new method to perform the task automatically. It consists of two steps, (1) identifying individual data records in a page, and (2) aligning and extracting data items from the identified data records. For step 1, we propose a method based on visual information to segment data records, which is more accurate than existing methods. For step 2, we propose a novel partial alignment technique based on tree matching. Partial alignment means that we align only those data fields in a pair of data records that can be aligned (or matched) with certainty, and make no commitment on the rest of the data fields. This approach enables very accurate alignment of multiple data records. Experimental results using a large number of Web pages from diverse domains show that the proposed two-step technique is able to segment data records, align and extract data from them very accurately."

In this paper, we propose a textual inference framework for answering commonsense questions, which effectively utilizes external, structured commonsense knowledge graphs to perform explainable inferences. The framework first grounds a question-answer pair from the semantic space to the knowledge-based symbolic space as a schema graph, a related sub-graph of external knowledge graphs. It represents schema graphs with a novel knowledge-aware graph network module named KagNet, and finally scores answers with graph representations. Our model is based on graph convolutional networks and LSTMs, with a hierarchical path-based attention mechanism. The intermediate attention scores make it transparent and interpretable, which thus produce trustworthy inferences. Using ConceptNet as the only external resource for Bert-based models, we achieved state-of-the-art performance on the CommonsenseQA, a large-scale dataset for commonsense reasoning."

However, most business data are present in the form of unstructured. Data extraction is a process of extracting unstructured, semi-structured, and structured data from the user requirement upon the web pages on the internet, in any type of automation level. Web pages contain data region which is formally in a structured data format. Manipulating and analyzing data using tools always required massive computing server resources. This paper will review existing techniques on data extraction for heterogeneous data in the Big Data environment. This review is aimed to discuss different data extraction approaches together with the basic tools algorithm for extracting favored data from various web sources. The various types of approaches that will be examined are Information Extraction Approaches, Automatic Wrapper Generation, SemiAutomatic Wrapper Generation, Wrapper Induction, and Wrapper Maintenance. Although, many required techniques from web sources have been tested and developed, but the reviews on these techniques are still lacking. This paper reviews data extraction using wrapper approaches and compares each to identify the best approach to extract data from online sites."

In this paper, we consider knowledge graphs as the source of side information. We propose MKR, a Multi-task feature learning approach for Knowledge graph enhanced Recommendation. MKR is a deep end-to-end framework that utilizes knowledge graph embedding task to assist recommendation task. The two tasks are associated by crosscompress units, which automatically share latent features and learn high-order interactions between items in recommender systems and entities in the knowledge graph. We prove that crosscompress units have sufficient capability of polynomial approximation, and show that MKR is a generalized framework over several representative methods of recommender systems and multi-task learning. Through extensive experiments on real-world datasets, we demonstrate that MKR achieves substantial gains in movie, book, music, and news recommendation, over state-of-the-art baselines. MKR is also shown to be able to maintain satisfactory performance even if user-item interactions are sparse."

A recent survey [20] has provided a detailed comparison of various fusion methods on Deep Web data. In this paper, we study the applicability and limitations of different fusion techniques on a more challenging problem: knowledge fusion. Knowledge fusion identifies true subject-predicate-object triples extracted by multiple information extractors from multiple information sources. These extractors perform the tasks of entity linkage and schema alignment, thus introducing an additional source of noise that is quite different from that traditionally considered in the data fusion literature, which only focuses on factual errors in the original sources. We adapt state-of-the-art data fusion techniques and apply them to a knowledge base with 1.6B unique knowledge triples extracted by 12 extractors from over 1B Web pages, which is three orders of magnitude larger than the data sets used in previous data fusion papers. We show great promise of the data fusion approaches in solving the knowledge fusion problem, and suggest interesting research directions through a detailed error analysis of the methods."

Unlike recent language representation models (Peters et al., 2018a; Radford et al., 2018), BERT is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial task-specific architecture modifications. BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing tasks, including pushing the GLUE score to 80.5 (7.7 point absolute improvement), MultiNLI accuracy to 86.7% (4.6% absolute improvement), SQuAD v1.1 question answering Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute improvement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1 (5.1 point absolute improvement)."

In this paper, we consider the opposite task: separating a given web page into a data component and a layout program. This separation has various important applications: page encoding may be significantly more compact (reducing web traffic), data representation is normalized across web designs (facilitating wrapping, retrieval and extraction), and repetitions are diminished (expediting site updates and redesign). We present a framework for defining the separation task, and devise an algorithm for synthesizing layout code from a web page while distilling its data in a lossless manner. The main idea is to synthesize layout code hierarchically for parts of the page, and use a combined program-data representation cost to decide whether to align intermediate programs. When intermediate programs are aligned, they are transformed into a single program, possibly with loops and conditionals. At the same time, differences between the aligned programs are captured by the data component such that executing the layout code on the data results in the original page. We have implemented our approach and conducted a thorough experimental study of its effectiveness. Our experiments show that our approach features state of the art (and higher) performance in both size compression and record extraction."

Reasoning over time in such dynamic knowledge graphs is not yet well understood. To this end, we present Know-Evolve, a novel deep evolutionary knowledge network that learns non-linearly evolving entity representations over time. The occurrence of a fact (edge) is modeled as a multivariate point process whose intensity function is modulated by the score for that fact computed based on the learned entity embeddings. We demonstrate significantly improved performance over various relational learning approaches on two large scale real-world datasets. Further, our method effectively predicts occurrence or recurrence time of a fact which is novel compared to prior reasoning approaches in multi-relational setting."

Traditional extraction methods use string matching among pages to detect page template, which is time-consuming. A recent work published in VLDB exploits redundant entities among websites to detect web page coordinates of these entities. The experiment gives good results when these coordinates are used for extracting other entities of the target site. However, OSF websites have few redundant project entities. This paper proposes a modified version of that redundancy-based method tailored for OSF websites, which relies on a similar yet weaker presumption that entity attributes are redundant rather than whole entities. Like the previous work, we also construct a seed database to detect web page coordinates of the redundancies, but all at the attribute-level. In addition, we apply attribute name verification to reduce false positives during extraction. The experiment result indicates that our approach is competent in extracting OSF websites, in which scenario the previous method can not be applied."

To address these limitations, we propose (1) a novel task \u2013 forecasting over dynamic graphs, and (2) a novel deep learning, multi-task, node-aware attention model that focuses on forecasting social interactions, going beyond recently emerged approaches for learning dynamic graph embeddings. Our model relies on graph convolutions and recurrent layers to forecast social interactions in large samples of real-world dynamic graphs1 \u2013 Twitter, GitHub, and YouTube up to seven days in advance. Our model can successfully forecast (a) retweets and mentions of a specific news source on Twitter (focusing on deceptive and credible news sources), (b) user-repository interactions on GitHub (focusing on cryptocurrency ecosystems), (c) comments to a specific video on YouTube within the next day with mean absolute error less than 2% and R2 exceeding 0.78. We demonstrate that learning from connectivity information over time in combination with node embeddings yields better forecasting results than when we use a two-step approach with Node2Vec and DeepWalk. Moreover, by evaluating model generalizability across three social platforms with different types of interactions we provide novel insights on how the size of the training and forecasting windows, and graph topological properties influence forecasting performance."

We start by populating a seed database with records extracted from a few initial sites. We then identify values within the pages of each new site that match attribute values contained in the seed set of records. To filter out noisy attribute value matches, we exploit the fact that attribute values occur at fixed positions within template-based sites. We develop an efficient Apriori-style algorithm to systematically enumerate attribute position configurations with sufficient matching values across pages. Finally, we conduct an extensive experimental study with real-life web data to demonstrate the effectiveness of our extraction approach."
