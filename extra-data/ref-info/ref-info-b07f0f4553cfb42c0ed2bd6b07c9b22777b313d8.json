                "text": "This dissertation introduces a new theoretical model for text classification systems, including systems for document retrieval, automated indexing, electronic mail filtering, and similar tasks. The Concept Learning model emphasizes the role of manual and automated feature selection and classifier formation in text classification. It enables drawing on results from statistics and machine learning in explaining the effectiveness of alternate representations of text, and specifies desirable characteristics of text representations. \nThe use of syntactic parsing to produce indexing phrases has been widely investigated as a possible route to better text representations. Experiments with syntactic phrase indexing, however, have never yielded significant improvements in text retrieval performance. The Concept Learning model suggests that the poor statistical characteristics of a syntactic indexing phrase representation negate its desirable semantic characteristics. The application of term clustering to this representation to improve its statistical properties while retaining its desirable meaning properties is proposed. \nStandard term clustering strategies from information retrieval (IR), based on cooccurrence of indexing terms in documents or groups of documents, were tested on a syntactic indexing phrase representation. In experiments using a standard text retrieval test collection, small effectiveness improvements were obtained. \nAs a means of evaluating representation quality, a text retrieval test collection introduces a number of confounding factors. In contrast, the text categorization task allows much cleaner determination of text representation properties. In preparation for the use of text categorization to study text representation, a more effective and theoretically well-founded probabilistic text categorization algorithm was developed, building on work by Maron, Fuhr, and others. \nText categorization experiments supported a number of predictions of the Concept Learning model about properties of phrasal representations, including dimensionality properties not previously measured for text representations. However, in carefully controlled experiments using syntactic phrases produced by Church's stochastic bracketer, in conjunction with reciprocal nearest neighbor clustering, term clustering was found to produce essentially no improvement in the properties of the phrasal representation. New cluster analysis approaches are proposed to remedy the problems found in traditional term clustering methods."

Since the strengths of these methods are complementary, we have explored combining them to produce superior representations. In this paper we discuss our implementation of a syntactic phrase generator, as well as our preliminary experiments with producing phrase clusters. These experiments show small improvements in retrieval effectiveness resulting from the use of phrase clusters, but it is clear that corpora much larger than standard information retrieval test collections will be required to thoroughly evaluate the use of this technique."

                "text": "In order for an automatic information retrieval system to effectively retrieve documents related to a given subject area, the content of each document in the system''s database must be represented accurately. This study examines the hypothesis that better representations of document content can be constructed if the content analysis method takes into consideration the syntactic structure of document and query texts. Two methods of automatically generating phrases for use as content indicators have been implemented and tested experimentally. The non-syntactic (or statistical) method is based on simple text characteristics such as word frequency and the proximity of words in text. The syntactic method uses augmented phrase structure rules (production rules) to selectively extract phrases from parse trees generated by an automatic syntactic analyzer. Experimental results show that the effect of non-syntactic phrase indexing is inconsistent. For the five collections tested, increases in average precision ranged from 22.7% to 2.2% over simple, single term indexing. The syntactic phrase indexing method was tested on two collections. Precision figures averaged over all test queries indicate that non-syntactic phrase indexing performs significantly better than syntactic phrase indexing for one collection, but that the difference is insignificant for the other collection. More detailed analysis of individual queries, however, indicates that the performance of both methods is highly variable, and that there is evidence that syntax-based indexing has certain benefits not available with the non-syntactic approach. Possible improvements of both methods of phrase indexing are considered. It is concluded that the prospects for improving the syntax-based approach to document indexing are better than for the non-syntactic approach. The PLNLP system was used for syntactic analysis of document and query texts, and for implementing the syntax-based phrase construction rules. The SMART information retrieval system was used for retrieval experimentation."

Omission of important data from reports is common and methods of measuring effectiveness vary widely. This has made judging the relative merits of techniques for text categorization difficult and has disguised important research issues.In this paper I discuss a variety of ways of evaluating the effectiveness of text categorization systems, drawing both on reported categorization experiments and on methods used in evaluating query-driven retrieval. I also consider the extent to which the same evaluation methods may be used with systems for text extraction, a more complex task. In evaluating either kind of system, the purpose for which the output is to be used is crucial in choosing appropriate evaluation methods."

Despite the plausibility of this approach to query expansion, the retrieval effectiveness of the expanded queries is often no greater than, or even less than, the effectiveness of the unexpanded queries. This article demonstrates that the similar terms identified by cooccurrence data in a query expansion system tend to occur very frequently in the database that is being searched. Unfortunately, frequent terms tend to discriminate poorly between relevant and nonrelevant documents, and the general effect of query expansion is thus to add terms that do little or nothing to improve the discriminatory power of the original query."

The program uses pattern recognition techniques supplemented by heuristics. During the \u201ctraining\u201d phase, words from pre\u2010classified documents are selected, and the probability of occurrence of each word in each section of CA is computed and stored in a reference dictionary. The \u201cclassification\u201d phase matches each word of a document title against the dictionary and assigns a section number to the document using weights derived from the probabilities in the dictionary. Heuristic techniques are used to normalize word variants such as plurals, past tenses, and gerunds in both the training phase and the classification phase. The dictionary lookup technique is supplemented by the analysis of chemical nomenclature terms into their component word roots to influence the section to which the documents are assigned. Program performance and human consistency have been evaluated by comparing the program results against the published sections of CA and by conducting an experiment with people experienced in the assignment of documents to CA sections. The program assigned approximately 78% of the documents to the correct major section groupings of CA and 67% of the correct sections or cross\u2010references at a rate of 100 documents per second."

In this paper, we describe a study with the aim of evaluating how easily enhanced queries can be acquired from users and how effectively this additional knowledge can be used in retrieval.

These are based on the use of a statistically\u2010generated \u2018adhesion coefficient\u2019 which reflects the degree of association between the free\u2010indexing terms, the controlled subject headings, and the classifications. By the analysis of a large sample of manually\u2010indexed documents the system generates dictionaries of free\u2010language and controlled\u2010language terms together with their associated classifications and adhesion coefficients. Having learnt from the manually\u2010indexed documents the system uses these dictionaries in the subsequent automatic classification procedure. The accuracy and cost\u2010effectiveness of the automatically\u2010assigned subject headings and classifications has been compared with that of the manual system.

Its main concern is with the weighting of index terms as a device for increasing retrieval effectiveness. Previously index terms have been assumed to be independent for the good reason that then a very simple weighting scheme can be used. In reality index terms are most unlikely to be independent. This paper explores one way of removing the independence assumption. Instead the extent of the dependence between index terms is measured and used to construct a non\u2010linear weighting function. In a practical situation the values of some of the parameters of such a function must be estimated from small samples of documents. So a number of estimation rules are discussed and one in particular is recommended. Finally the feasibility of the computations required for a non\u2010linear weighting scheme is examined."

For this task, an indexing dictionary with rules for mapping terms from the text onto descriptors is required, which can be derived automatically from a set of manually indexed documents. Based on the Darmstadt Indexing Approach, the indexing task is divided into a description step and a decision step. First, terms (single words or phrases) are identiied in the document text. With term-descriptor rules from the dictionary, descriptor indications are formed. The set of all indications from a document leading to the same descriptor is called a relevance description. A probabilistic classiication procedure computes indexing weights for each relevance description. Since the whole system is rule-based, it can be adapted to diierent subject elds by appropriate modiications of the rule bases. A major application of AIR/X is the AIR/PHYS system developed for a large physics database. This application is described in more detail along with experimental results."

The texts to be indexed are abstracts written in English. The system of descriptors is prescribed. For the application of the AIR/PHYS system a large-scale dictionary containing more than 600 000 word-descriptor relations reap. phrase-descriptor relations has been developed. Most of these relations have been obtained by means of statistical and heuristical methods. In consequence, the relation system is rather imperfect. Therefore, the indexing system needs some fault- tolerating features. An appropriate indexing approach and the corresponding structure of the AIR/PHYS system are described. Finally, the conditions of the application as well as problems of further development are discussed."
