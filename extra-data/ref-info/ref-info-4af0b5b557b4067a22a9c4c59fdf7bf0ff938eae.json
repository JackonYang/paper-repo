Results were used to test the hypothesis that the two components of a complex grating may be detected independently. In an extensive experiment with f = 14 cycles/deg, the independence hypothesis was consistently rejected only when f/f\u2032=54 or 45, but rarely rejected when the value of f/f\u2032 lay outside this range. In other experiments, f was between 1.9 and 22.4 cycles/deg. All results are compatible with the assumption that the human visual system contains sensory channels, each selectively sensitive to different narrow ranges of spatial frequencies, whose outputs are detected independently."

The detection mechanisms for the composite stimuli were examined by measuring the probabilities for seeing these stimuli, the probabilites of \"recognition\" near their detection thresholds and by using the method of subthreshold summation. 3. The simplest composite stimulus consists of two lines spaced apart by 15 min; it was found that both the probability of seeing this stimulus and the probability of reporting either one or two lines may largely be explained by assuming independent detection of the two lines. For a 12 min spacing some antagonistic interaction was observed between the two lines, confirming the existence of an antagonistic surround in the line detector. 4. The probability of seeing a multiple line target (rectangular grating) of spacing 15 min is slightly greater than that predicted assuming independent detection of its component lines; this probability can be calculated from the probabilities of seeing a central line (near the fixation point) and pairs of lines spaced 15, 30, 45, 60, 75 and 90 min on either side of the fixation point. The observed threshold for the grating was about 0.05 log units less than the prediction. 5. The probability that a subject reports only one line from a rectangular grating was found to be consistent with independent detection of its component lines when the subject used a low (detection) threshold criterion but not for higher criteria. 6. The spatial frequencies involved in the detection of the rectangular grating were determined by subthreshold summation; the high spatial frequency selectivity was shown to be consistent with independent detection of the component lines. 7. The detection mechanism for a 4 c/deg sinusoidal grating was found to be similar to that for the 15 min rectangular grating. 8. Evidence is presented that the detection of finer and coarser gratings may be analysed in similar terms. 9. It is shown that lines are not detected by independent activation of sharply tuned grating detectors but that sub\u2010units may be involved which are slightly more narrowly tuned than the line detector. 10. These sub\u2010units contain both inhibitory and disinhibitory regions; the disinhibitory responses may be the basis of the deviations from probability summation noted in 4. 11. The properties of the proposed sub\u2010units are in reasonable accord with the results of adaptation experiments."

In the past there have been many theoretical studies of the potential resolving power of the optics based on consideration of diffraction and the chromatic and spherical aberrations of the eye. It is only recently that objective measurements of the quality of the optics of man in vivo have been obtained (Flamant, 1955; Westheimer & Campbell, 1962; Krauskopf 1962; R6hler, 1962). As will be demonstrated, it is not possible to use these findings to determine the relative weighting that should be given to the optics and the retina in determining a given threshold. This paper reports the results of experiments using an improved version of the well-known interference fringe technique (Le Grand, 1937; Byram 1944; Westheimer, 1960; Arnulf & Dupuy, 1960) which theoretically allows a sinusoidal pattern of very high contrast to be formed directly on the retina. The practical difficulty in using this technique is to obtain a light source of high intrinsic brightness and coherence with which to form high-luminance interference fringes on the retina; this has been solved by using a neon-helium gas laser. By decreasing the contrast (Fig. 1) of the interference fringes with another source of light it was possible to determine the contrasts on the retina at which the fringes are just detected. Thus a measure of the resolving power of the retina-brain is obtained without prior modification by the optics of the eye. Measurements have also been made of the visual resolution of external gratings whose intensity varied sinusoidally with distance across the gratings and which were imaged on to the retina by the optical components of the eye. By comparing the threshold contrasts of these external sinusoidal gratings with thresholds for sinusoidal fringes of the same spatial frequency formed through interference, the quality of the"

Under photopic conditions the fovea has the lowest light-difference threshold. From the fovea to 10 degrees eccentricity threshold gradually increases. It remains constant up to approximately 35 degrees eccentricity in the temporal visual field (nasal retina). Beyond the edge of this plateau of constant light-difference threshold, it again increases to the limit of the visual field. Under scotopic conditions the extent of the plateau of constant light-difference threshold remains the same as under photopic conditions. The fovea itself, however, and its immediate environment are less sensitive than the plateau area.Subjective brightness of a supra-threshold target is not dependent on its position in the visual field. A target with a given luminance will elicit the same brightness sensation at all retinal positions. As a consequence of this brightness constancy throughout the visual field, peripheral targets at threshold appear brighter than foveal targets at threshold because a peripheral target at threshold has more luminance than a foveal target at threshold.ZusammenfassungDie Inkrementalschwelle wurde in der Fovea und in der Peripherie des Gesichtsfeldes bei photopischen und skotopischen Adaptationsbedingungen gemessen. Bei photopischen Bedingungen ist die Schwelle in der Fovea am geringsten (gr\u00f6\u00dfte Sensitivit\u00e4t). Von der Fovea bis etwa 10 Grad in die Peripherie nimmt die Inkrementalschwelle allm\u00e4hlich zu. Die Schwelle bleibt dann konstant bis etwa 35 Grad im temporalen Gesichtsfeld (nasale Retina) und bis etwa 20 Grad im nasalen Gesichtsfeld (temporale Retina). Jenseits dieses Plateaus konstanter Sensitivit\u00e4t nimmt die Schwelle wieder zu, bis schlie\u00dflich das Ende des Gesichtsfeldes erreicht wird. Bei skotopischen Adaptationsbedingungen wurde dieselbe Ausdehnung des Plateaus konstanter Schwelle im temporalen und nasalen Gesichtsfeld beobachtet. Die Fovea und die unmittelbare Umgebung der Fovea haben bei skotopischen Bedingungen eine geringere Sensitivit\u00e4t.Die subjektive Helligkeit \u00fcberschwelliger Reize ist nicht abh\u00e4ngig von der Lage des Lichtreizes im Gesichtsfeld. Ein \u00fcberschwelliger Reiz mit gegebener Intensit\u00e4t hat \u00fcberall im Gesichtsfeld dieselbe subjektive Helligkeit. Als Konsequenz der Konstanz der Helligkeit im Gesichtsfeld erscheinen Schwellenreize in der Peripherie heller als Schwellenreize im Fovea-nahen Bereich, da die Lichtintensit\u00e4t f\u00fcr Schwellenreize in der Peripherie gr\u00f6\u00dfer ist als im Fovea-nahen Bereich."

The magnitude of its transfer function fits the flicker data quantitatively at all frequencies, over a wide range of adaptation levels. The corresponding small-signal impulse responses are also calculated: their latencies and leading edges (associated with receptor activity) are invariant with adaptation level; the remaining phases of these transient waveforms (associated with the graded potentials of secondary neurons) adapt strongly, in accord with current histology and micro-electrode findings."

We confirm Keesey's (1972) observation that, when a flickering line is viewed, there are distinct thresholds for detecting flicker (or movement) and for detecting a well localized line (pattern detection). Our measurements of the temporal sensitivity of these two mechanisms are similar to Keesey's. 2. The flicker and pattern detection mechanism have been analysed using subthreshold summation, i.e. by observing the effect of subthreshold flickering stimuli (lines and gratings) on the contrast threshold for a flickering test line. 3. The pattern detector shows linear spatial summation of contrast while the flicker detector is non\u2010linear in this respect. 4. The receptive field of the (most sensitive) flicker detector is about two to four times broader than that of the pattern detector. 5. The flicker detector has relatively weak surround inhibition and so, unlike the pattern detector, it is sensitive to a uniform flickering field. 6. The spatial arrangement of the pattern detector is the same at all temporal frequencies (including steady presentation); for flicker detection, the width of the receptive field increases with temporal frequency and the strength of lateral inhibition decreases at high frequencies. 7. Flicker detectors of various widths were demonstrated by using different test stimuli (for 12 Hz modulation); surround ingibition was relatively weak for the broadest detector. 8. There is a delay of surround inhibition of about 3 ms for both flicker and pattern detection. 9. By using a broad test stimulus modulated at a high frequency, a detector can be found with no significant surround inhibition. At threshold, this stimulus produces a sensation of flicker without the appearance of lateral motion observed for finer test lines at lower frequencies. 10. The characteristics of pattern and flicker (movement) detection are compared to electrophysiological studies on X (sustained) and Y (transient) neurones respectively, and correlations are described for studies of temporal frequency response, non\u2010linearity, width of receptive field, strength of the inhibitory surround and motion sensitivity."
