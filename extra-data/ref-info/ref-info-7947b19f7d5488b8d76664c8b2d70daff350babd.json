In fact, the action of various physical devices which \u201crecognize\u201d or respond identically to certain simple objects can be treated in terms of such transformations. Thus the essential part of physical \u201crecognizing\u201d instruments is usually a filter\u2014whether it be a mechanical sieve, an optical filter, or a tuned electrical circuit \u2014which \u201cpasses\u201d only quantities of the kind it is required to identify and rejects all others.

These cells were, in fact, performing \u201cfeature extraction,\u201d which at that time was coming to be recognized as a necessary first step in more complex pattern recognition. I remember Keffer Hartline telling me of these claims at about the time they appeared. Both of us had worked on retinal ganglion cells in the frog, and a t first I don\u2019t think either of us believed much of what Lettvin and his co-workers reported. Hartline had worked on movement sensitivity and was particularly surprised by \u201cunidirectional rate sensitivity\u201d-the claim that some ganglion cells responded to movement in one direction and not the other. At first I was also surprised by this, but uneasy memories came back of some observations I had made on on-of/ units a few years earlier. I had been reading Sperry\u2019s experiments on optic nerve regeneration in frogs whose eyes had been excised and rotated, and I was very impressed by the incidentally mentioned fact that, in the normal frog, the left eye only evokes optokinetic movements to the right, and vice versa. I was puzzled by the movement sensitivity of on-ojj units a t the time, and I looked to see i f this optokinetic behavior was of retinal origin: Did the ganglion cells of one eye only respond to movement in the appropriate direction? I looked long enough and hard enough to convince myself that my hypothesis was wrong, for the ganglion cells certainly responded to image movements that would have failed to evoke optokinetic movements in the intact animal. But when Lettvin jogged my memory, I recalled that 1 had sometimes obtained \u201cfunny\u201d results: Some ganglion cells did seem to show a preference for movements in a certain direction, but this direction had not usually corresponded to the direction required by my hypothesis. Beyond using these facts to throw out the hypothesis, I did not pay much attention to them, and I did not pursue the matter because it was so difficult to produce smooth movements in a variety of directions with the apparatus that was available. In retrospect, 1 think I only once or twice saw a degree of asymmetry of response that I would now accept as proof of directional selectivity, but I missed it then and only became fully convinced that retinal ganglion cells can be directionally selective when Hill and I observed this phenomenon in the rabbit (Barlow & Hill, 1963). Since then, I think we have found out something about the mechanism by which the nervous system abstracts patterns, and I shall return to"

Under the appropriate conditions, all cells observed showed a progressive response decrement during the stimulation period, regardless of cell classification, i.e., simple, complex, or hypercomplex. 3. The observed response decrement was shown to be largely cortical in origin and could be adequately described with an exponential function of the form R = Rf +(R1-Rf)e-t/T. Time constants derived from such calculations yielded values ranging from 1.92 to 12.45 s under conditions of optimal-stimulation. 4. Most cells showed poststimulation effects, usually a brief period of reduced responsiveness that recovered exponentially. Recovery was essentially complete in about 5-35 s. 5. The degree to which stimuli were effective at inducing response was shown to have significant effects on the magnitude of the response decrement. 6. Several cells showed neural patterns of response and recovery that suggested the operation of intracortical inhibitory mechanisms. 7. A simple two-process model that adequately describes the behavior of all the studied cells is presented. 8. Because the properties of the cells studied correlate well with human psychophysical measures of contour and movement adaptation and recovery, a causal relationship to similar neural mechanisms in humans is suggested."

Conversely, prolonged viewing of vertical contours raises the threshold for the identification of vertical lines above those for other orientations.

                "text": "The present report was designed to investigate neural coding of taste information in the cerebral cortical taste area of rats. The magnitude and/or type (excitatory, inhibitory, or no-response) of responses of 111 cortical neurons evoked by single concentrations of the four basic taste stimuli (sucrose, NaCl, HCl, and quinine HCl) were subjected to four types of analyses in the context of the four proposed hypotheses of taste-quality coding: across-neuron response-pattern, labeled-line, matrix-pattern, and across-region response-pattern notions (88 histologically located neurons). An across-neuron response-pattern notion assumes that taste quality is coded by differential magnitudes of response across many neurons. This theory utilizes across-neuron correlation coefficients as a metric for the evaluation of taste quality coding. Across-neuron correlations between magnitudes of responses to any pairs of the four basic taste stimuli across 111 cortical neurons were very high and were similar. However, calculations made with net responses (spontaneous rate subtracted) resulted in less positive correlations but still similar values among the various pairs of taste stimuli. This finding suggests that across-neuron response patterns of cortical neurons become less discriminating among taste qualities compared with those of the lower-order neurons. A labeled-line notion assumes that there are identifiable groups of neurons and that taste quality is coded by activity in these particular sets of neurons. Some investigators have classified taste-responsive neurons into best-stimulus categories, depending on their best sensitivity to any one of the four basic stimuli, such as sucrose-best, NaCl-best, HCl-best, and quinine-best neurons; they have suggested that taste can be classified along four qualitative dimensions that correspond to these four neuron types (i.e., four labeled lines). The present study shows that responsiveness of each of the four best-stimulus neurons had similar profiles between peripheral and cortical levels. That is, when the stimuli were arranged along the abscissa in the order of sucrose, NaCl, HCl, and quinine, there is a peak response in one place, and the responses decreased gradually from the peak. However, such response characteristics do not favor the labeled-line theory, since they can be explained in the context of the across-neuron pattern theory. A matrix-pattern notion assumes that taste quality is coded by a spatially arranged matrix pattern of activated neurons.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

These cells give brief responses at \u2018on\u2019 and \u2018off\u2019 to lights falling in their receptive fields and they give vigorous responses to moving spots, but only when these are moved in certain directions through their fields. Motion in the \u2018preferred\u2019 direction gives the maximum discharge, while motion in the opposite, \u2018null\u2019, direction, causes no response. The \u2018preferred\u2019 direction differs in different units: thus which of a set of cells are active conveys information as to the direction of motion of objects in the visual field. The frequency of the discharge depends greatly on speed and direction of motion, but is only slightly influenced by the intensity of the moving stimulus spot. Furthermore, the discharge occurs for the same direction of motion with a black spot as with a white spot. This behaviour is what one might expect in units of which the function is to abstract direction of motion from the pattern of light falling on the retina."

                "text": "We have examined the idea that the adaptation of cortical neurons to local contrast levels in a visual stimulus is functionally advantageous. Specifically, cortical cells may have large differential contrast sensitivity as a result of adjustments that center a limited response range around a mean level of contrast. To evaluate this notion, we measured contrast-response functions of cells in striate cortex while systematically adapting them to different contrast levels of stimulus gratings. For the majority of cortical neurons tested, the results of this basic experiment show that contrast-response functions shift laterally along a log-contrast axis so that response functions match mean contrast levels in the stimulus. This implies a contrast-dependent change in the gain of the cell's contrast-response relationship. We define this process as contrast gain control. The degree to which this contrast adjustment occurs varies considerably from cell to cell. There are no obvious differences regarding cell type (simple vs. complex) or laminar distribution. Contrast gain control is almost certainly a cortical function, since lateral geniculate cells and fibers exhibit only minimal effects. Tests presented in the accompanying paper (37) provide additional evidence on the cortical origin of the process. In another series of experiments, the effect of contrast adaptation on physiological estimates of contrast sensitivity was evaluated. Sustained adaptation to contrast levels as low as 3% was capable of nearly doubling the thresholds of most of the cells tested. Adaptation may therefore be an important factor in determinations of the contrast sensitivity of cortical neurons. We tested the spatial extent of the mechanisms responsible for these gain-control effects by attempting to adapt cells using both a large grating and a grating patch limited to that portion of a cell's receptive field from which excitatory discharges could be elicited directly (the central discharge region). Adaptation was found to be an exclusive property of the central region. This held even in the case of hypercomplex cells, which received strong influences from surrounding regions of the visual field. Finally, we measured the time course of contrast adaptation. We found the process to be rather slow, with a mean time constant of approximately 6 s. Once again, there was considerable variability in this value from cell to cell."

That red, sour and warm are distinct experiences, based on different processes, has been emphasized to the neglect of the fact that they all manifest adaptation and other phenomena in common. Holt and Yerkes (12) prepared in 1903 a laboratory manual of experiments on sensation in which the emphasis was laid upon phenomena common to the various modalities and qualities\u2014latency, after-image, adaptation, contrast, fusion, inhibition, and others\u2014and in general upon the similarities between the senses rather than the differences. But this lead has not been followed in experiments to any significant extent."
