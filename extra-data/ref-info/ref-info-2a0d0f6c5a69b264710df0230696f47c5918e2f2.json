The first part, content planning, smooths the output of computer vision-based detection and recognition algorithms with statistics mined from large pools of visually descriptive text to determine the best content words to use to describe an image. The second step, surface realization, chooses words to construct natural language sentences based on the predicted content and general statistics from natural language. We present multiple approaches for the surface realization step and evaluate each using automatic measures of similarity to human generated reference descriptions. We also collect forced choice human evaluations between descriptions from the proposed generation system and descriptions from competing approaches. The proposed system is very effective at producing relevant sentences for images. It also generates descriptions that are notably more true to the specific image content than previous work."

In turn, it can also help us in the quest to generate natural language that describes this world in a human manner. We present a simple yet effective approach to automatically compose image descriptions given computer vision based inputs and using web-scale n-grams. Unlike most previous work that summarizes or retrieves pre-existing text relevant to an image, our method composes sentences entirely from scratch. Experimental results indicate that it is viable to generate simple textual descriptions that are pertinent to the specific content of an image, while permitting creativity in the description -- making for more human-like annotations than previous approaches."

Inspired by recent work in summarization, we propose extractive and abstractive caption generation models. They both operate over the output of a probabilistic image annotation model that pre-processes the pictures and suggests keywords to describe their content.

One contribution is our technique for the automatic collection of this new dataset \u2013 performing a huge number of Flickr queries and then filtering the noisy results down to 1 million images with associated visually relevant captions. Such a collection allows us to approach the extremely challenging problem of description generation using relatively simple non-parametric methods and produces surprisingly effective results. We also develop methods incorporating many state of the art, but fairly noisy, estimates of image content to produce even more pleasing results. Finally we introduce a new objective performance measure for image captioning."

The input are initial noisy estimates of the objects and scenes detected in the image using state of the art trained detectors. As predicting actions from still images directly is unreliable, we use a language model trained from the English Gigaword corpus to obtain their estimates; together with probabilities of co-located nouns, scenes and prepositions. We use these estimates as parameters on a HMM that models the sentence generation process, with hidden nodes as sentence components and image detections as the emissions. Experimental results show that our strategy of combining vision and language produces readable and descriptive sentences compared to naive strategies that use vision alone."

We describe a system that can compute a score linking an image to a sentence. This score can be used to attach a descriptive sentence to a given image, or to obtain images that illustrate a given sentence. The score is obtained by comparing an estimate of meaning obtained from the image to one obtained from the sentence. Each estimate of meaning comes from a discriminative procedure that is learned us-ingdata. We evaluate on a novel dataset consisting of human-annotated images. While our underlying estimate of meaning is impoverished, it is sufficient to produce very good quantitative results, evaluated with a novel score that can account for synecdoche."

                "text": "In this paper, we present an image parsing to text description (I2T) framework that generates text descriptions of image and video content based on image understanding. The proposed I2T framework follows three steps: 1) input images (or video frames) are decomposed into their constituent visual patterns by an image parsing engine, in a spirit similar to parsing sentences in natural language; 2) the image parsing results are converted into semantic representation in the form of Web ontology language (OWL), which enables seamless integration with general knowledge bases; and 3) a text generation engine converts the results from previous steps into semantically meaningful, human readable, and query-able text reports. The centerpiece of the I2T framework is an and-or graph (AoG) visual knowledge representation, which provides a graphical representation serving as prior knowledge for representing diverse visual patterns and provides top-down hypotheses during the image parsing. The AoG embodies vocabularies of visual elements including primitives, parts, objects, scenes as well as a stochastic image grammar that specifies syntactic relations (i.e., compositional) and semantic relations (e.g., categorical, spatial, temporal, and functional) between these visual elements. Therefore, the AoG is a unified model of both categorical and symbolic representations of visual knowledge. The proposed I2T framework has two objectives. First, we use semiautomatic method to parse images from the Internet in order to build an AoG for visual knowledge representation. Our goal is to make the parsing process more and more automatic using the learned AoG model. Second, we use automatic methods to parse image/video in specific domains and generate text reports that are useful for real-world applications. In the case studies at the end of this paper, we demonstrate two automatic I2T systems: a maritime and urban scene video surveillance system and a real-time automatic driving scene understanding system."

In this paper we present a model that simultaneously optimizes selection and rendering preferences.

Selection preferences for individual phrases are learned discriminatively, while a quasi-synchronous grammar (Smith and Eisner, 2006) captures rendering preferences such as paraphrases and compressions. Based on an integer linear programming formulation, the model learns to generate summaries that satisfy both types of preferences, while ensuring that length, topic coverage and grammar constraints are met.

As a side effect, sentences that are too long but partly relevant are doomed to either not appear in the final summary, or prevent inclusion of other relevant sentences. Sentence compression is a recent framework that aims to select the shortest subsequence of words that yields an informative and grammatical sentence. This work proposes a one-step approach for document summarization that jointly performs sentence extraction and compression by solving an integer linear program. We report favorable experimental results on newswire data."

The aim of the present work is to provide a humanoid robot with cognitive, perceptual and motor skills fundamental for the acquisition of a rudimentary form of language. We present a novel probabilistic model, inspired by the findings in cognitive sciences, able to associate spoken words with their perceptually grounded meanings. The main focus is set on acquiring the meaning of various perceptual categories (e.g. red, blue, circle, above, etc.), rather than specific world entities (e.g. an apple, a toy, etc.). Our probabilistic model is based on a variant of multi-instance learning technique, and it enables a robotic platform to learn grounded meanings of adjective/noun terms. The systems could be used to understand and generate appropriate natural language descriptions of real objects in a scene, and it has been successfully tested on the NAO humanoid robotic platform."

Language abilities, in particular, require a learned mapping between the linguistic input and one's internal model of the real world. In order to demonstrate that connectionist methods excel at this task, we teach a deep, recurrent neural network--a variant of the long short-term memory (LSTM)--to ground language in a micro-world. The network integrates two inputs--a visual scene and an auditory sentence--to produce the meaning of the sentence in the context of the scene. Crucially, the network exhibits strong systematicity, recovering appropriate meanings even for novel objects and descriptions. With its ability to exploit systematic structure across modalities, this network fulfills an important prerequisite of general machine intelligence."

However, scene understanding research has been constrained by the limited scope of currently-used databases which do not capture the full variety of scene categories. Whereas standard databases for object categorization contain hundreds of different classes of objects, the largest available dataset of scene categories contains only 15 classes. In this paper we propose the extensive Scene UNderstanding (SUN) database that contains 899 categories and 130,519 images. We use 397 well-sampled categories to evaluate numerous state-of-the-art algorithms for scene recognition and establish new bounds of performance. We measure human scene classification performance on the SUN database and compare this with computational methods. Additionally, we study a finer-grained scene representation to detect scenes embedded inside of larger scenes."

Starting with a simple X-bar grammar, we learn a new grammar whose nonterminals are subsymbols of the original nonterminals. In contrast with previous work, we are able to split various terminals to different degrees, as appropriate to the actual complexity in the data. Our grammars automatically learn the kinds of linguistic distinctions exhibited in previous work on manual tree annotation. On the other hand, our grammars are much more compact and substantially more accurate than previous work on automatic annotation. Despite its simplicity, our best grammar achieves an F1 of 90.2% on the Penn Treebank, higher than fully lexicalized systems."

Such natural textures arise from spatial variation of two surface attributes: (1) reflectance and (2) surface normal. In this paper, we provide a unified model to address both these aspects of natural texture. The main idea is to construct a vocabulary of prototype tiny surface patches with associated local geometric and photometric properties. We call these 3D textons. Examples might be ridges, grooves, spots or stripes or combinations thereof Associated with each texton is an appearance vector, which characterizes the local irradiance distribution, represented as a set of linear Gaussian derivative filter outputs, under different lighting and viewing conditions. Given a large collection of images of different materials, a clustering approach is used to acquire a small (on the order of 100) 3D texton vocabulary. Given a few (1 to 4) images of any material, it can be characterized using these textons. We demonstrate the application of this representation for recognition of the material viewed under novel lighting and viewing conditions."

Our system is able to represent highly variable object classes and achieves state-of-the-art results in the PASCAL object detection challenges. While deformable part models have become quite popular, their value had not been demonstrated on difficult benchmarks such as the PASCAL data sets. Our system relies on new methods for discriminative training with partially labeled data. We combine a margin-sensitive approach for data-mining hard negative examples with a formalism we call latent SVM. A latent SVM is a reformulation of MI--SVM in terms of latent variables. A latent SVM is semiconvex, and the training problem becomes convex once latent information is specified for the positive examples. This leads to an iterative training algorithm that alternates between fixing latent values for positive examples and optimizing the latent SVM objective function."

We compare evaluation results for these systems by human domain experts, human non-experts, and several automatic evaluation metrics, including NI ST, B LEU, and ROUGE. We find that NI ST scores correlate best (>0.8) with human judgments, but that all automatic metrics we examined are biased in favour of generators that select on the basis of frequency alone. We conclude that automatic evaluation of NLG systems has considerable potential, in particular where high-quality reference texts and only a small number of human evaluators are available. However, in general it is probably best for automatic evaluations to be supported by human based evaluations, or at least by studies that demonstrate that a particular metric correlates well with human judgments in a given domain."

After reviewing existing edge and gradient based descriptors, we show experimentally that grids of histograms of oriented gradient (HOG) descriptors significantly outperform existing feature sets for human detection. We study the influence of each stage of the computation on performance, concluding that fine-scale gradients, fine orientation binning, relatively coarse spatial binning, and high-quality local contrast normalization in overlapping descriptor blocks are all important for good results. The new approach gives near-perfect separation on the original MIT pedestrian database, so we introduce a more challenging dataset containing over 1800 annotated human images with a large range of pose variations and backgrounds."
