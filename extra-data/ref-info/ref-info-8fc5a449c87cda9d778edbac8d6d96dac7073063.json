                "text": "MOTIVATION\nText-mining mutation information from the literature becomes a critical part of the bioinformatics approach for the analysis and interpretation of sequence variations in complex diseases in the post-genomic era. It has also been used for assisting the creation of disease-related mutation databases. Most of existing approaches are rule-based and focus on limited types of sequence variations, such as protein point mutations. Thus, extending their extraction scope requires significant manual efforts in examining new instances and developing corresponding rules. As such, new automatic approaches are greatly needed for extracting different kinds of mutations with high accuracy.\n\n\nRESULTS\nHere, we report tmVar, a text-mining approach based on conditional random field (CRF) for extracting a wide range of sequence variants described at protein, DNA and RNA levels according to a standard nomenclature developed by the Human Genome Variation Society. By doing so, we cover several important types of mutations that were not considered in past studies. Using a novel CRF label model and feature set, our method achieves higher performance than a state-of-the-art method on both our corpus (91.4 versus 78.1% in F-measure) and their own gold standard (93.9 versus 89.4% in F-measure). These results suggest that tmVar is a high-performance method for mutation extraction from biomedical literature.\n\n\nAVAILABILITY\ntmVar software and its corpus of 500 manually curated abstracts are available for download at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/CBBresearch/Lu/pub/tmVar"

Additionally, recent efforts related to the detection of disease-associated SNPs motivated both the manual annotation, as well as the automatic extraction, of naturally occurring sequence variations from the literature, especially for protein families that play a significant role in signaling processes such as kinases. Systematic integration and comparison of kinase mutation information from multiple sources, covering literature, manual annotation databases and large-scale experiments can result in a more comprehensive view of functional, structural and disease associated aspects of protein sequence variants. Previously published mutation extraction approaches did not sufficiently distinguish between two fundamentally different variation origin categories, namely natural occurring and induced mutations generated through in vitro experiments.ResultsWe present a literature mining pipeline for the automatic extraction and disambiguation of single-point mutation mentions from both abstracts as well as full text articles, followed by a sequence validation check to link mutations to their corresponding kinase protein sequences. Each mutation is scored according to whether it corresponds to an induced mutation or a natural sequence variant. We were able to provide direct literature links for a considerable fraction of previously annotated kinase mutations, enabling thus more efficient interpretation of their biological characterization and experimental context. In order to test the capabilities of the presented pipeline, the mutations in the protein kinase domain of the kinase family were analyzed. Using our literature extraction system, we were able to recover a total of 643 mutations-protein associations from PubMed abstracts and 6,970 from a large collection of full text articles. When compared to state-of-the-art annotation databases and high throughput genotyping studies, the mutation mentions extracted from the literature overlap to a good extent with the existing knowledgebases, whereas the remaining mentions suggest new mutation records that were not previously annotated in the databases.ConclusionUsing the proposed residue disambiguation and classification approach, we were able to differentiate between natural variant and mutagenesis types of mutations with an accuracy of 93.88. The resulting system is useful for constructing a Gold Standard set of mutations extracted from the literature by human experts with minimal manual curation effort, providing direct pointers to relevant evidence sentences. Our system is able to recover mutations from the literature that are not present in state-of-the-art databases. Human expert manual validation of a subset of the literature extracted mutations conducted on 100 mutations from PubMed abstracts highlights that almost three quarters (72%) of the extracted mutations turned out to be correct, and more than half of these had not been previously annotated in databases."

However, most of the disease-related mutational data are currently buried in the biomedical literature in textual form and lack the necessary structure to allow easy retrieval and visualization. We introduce a high-throughput computational method for the identification of relevant disease mutations in PubMed abstracts applied to prostate (PCa) and breast cancer (BCa) mutations.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWe developed the extractor of mutations (EMU) tool to identify mutations and their associated genes. We benchmarked EMU against MutationFinder--a tool to extract point mutations from text. Our results show that both methods achieve comparable performance on two manually curated datasets. We also benchmarked EMU's performance for extracting the complete mutational information and phenotype. Remarkably, we show that one of the steps in our approach, a filter based on sequence analysis, increases the precision for that task from 0.34 to 0.59 (PCa) and from 0.39 to 0.61 (BCa). We also show that this high-throughput approach can be extended to other diseases.\n\n\nDISCUSSION\nOur method improves the current status of disease-mutation databases by significantly increasing the number of annotated mutations. We found 51 and 128 mutations manually verified to be related to PCa and Bca, respectively, that are not currently annotated for these cancer types in the OMIM or Swiss-Prot databases. EMU's retrieval performance represents a 2-fold improvement in the number of annotated mutations for PCa and BCa. We further show that our method can benefit from full-text analysis once there is an increase in Open Access availability of full-text articles.\n\n\nAVAILABILITY\nFreely available at: http://bioinf.umbc.edu/EMU/ftp."

                "text": "BackgroundMutations as sources of evolution have long been the focus of attention in the biomedical literature. Accessing the mutational information and their impacts on protein properties facilitates research in various domains, such as enzymology and pharmacology. However, manually curating the rich and fast growing repository of biomedical literature is expensive and time-consuming. As a solution, text mining approaches have increasingly been deployed in the biomedical domain. While the detection of single-point mutations is well covered by existing systems, challenges still exist in grounding impacts to their respective mutations and recognizing the affected protein properties, in particular kinetic and stability properties together with physical quantities.ResultsWe present an ontology model for mutation impacts, together with a comprehensive text mining system for extracting and analysing mutation impact information from full-text articles. Organisms, as sources of proteins, are extracted to help disambiguation of genes and proteins. Our system then detects mutation series to correctly ground detected impacts using novel heuristics. It also extracts the affected protein properties, in particular kinetic and stability properties, as well as the magnitude of the effects and validates these relations against the domain ontology. The output of our system can be provided in various formats, in particular by populating an OWL-DL ontology, which can then be queried to provide structured information. The performance of the system is evaluated on our manually annotated corpora. In the impact detection task, our system achieves a precision of 70.4%-71.1%, a recall of 71.3%-71.5%, and grounds the detected impacts with an accuracy of 76.5%-77%. The developed system, including resources, evaluation data and end-user and developer documentation is freely available under an open source license at http://www.semanticsoftware.info/open-mutation-miner.ConclusionWe present Open Mutation Miner (OMM), the first comprehensive, fully open-source approach to automatically extract impacts and related relevant information from the biomedical literature. We assessed the performance of our work on manually annotated corpora and the results show the reliability of our approach. The representation of the extracted information into a structured format facilitates knowledge management and aids in database curation and correction. Furthermore, access to the analysis results is provided through multiple interfaces, including web services for automated data integration and desktop-based solutions for end user interactions."

The schema was inspired by the needs of the database curators of the International Society for Gastrointestinal Hereditary Tumours (InSiGHT) database, but is intended to have application to genetic variation information in a range of diseases. The schema has been applied to a small corpus of full text journal publications on the subject of inherited colorectal cancer. We show that the inter-annotator agreement on annotation of this corpus ranges from 0.78 to 0.95 F-score across different entity types when exact matching is measured, and improves to a minimum F-score of 0.87 when boundary matching is relaxed. Relations show more variability in agreement, but several are reliable, with the highest, cohort-has-size, reaching 0.90 F-score. We also explore the relevance of the schema to the InSiGHT database curation process. The schema and the corpus represent an important new resource for the development of text mining solutions that address relationships among patient cohorts, disease and genetic variation, and therefore, we also discuss the role text mining might play in the curation of information related to the human variome. The corpus is available at http://opennicta.com/home/health/variome."

The mutation state of cancer tissues is e.g. being determined experimentally in order to find the most likely response to a drug treatment. Results of such experiments are typically published in scientific literature. We have developed a workflow of several text-mining algorithms, in order to harvest this wealth of information relevant to developing novel therapeutic approaches in cancer. Our workflow has successfully scanned over 150,000 abstracts related to cancer and genetic mutations. New information on mutated genes in cancer could be extracted with a precision and recall of 86.8% and 30.3%, respectively. By applying the workflow, novel associations of mutations in specific cancer tissues could be extracted for 264 genes."

Pharmacogenomics (or pharmacogenetics) is the field that studies how human genetic variation impacts drug response. Therefore, publications span the intersection of research in genotypes, phenotypes and pharmacology, a topic that has increasingly become a focus of active research in recent years. This survey covers efforts dealing with the automatic recognition of relevant named entities (e.g. genes, gene variants and proteins, diseases and other pathological phenomena, drugs and other chemicals relevant for medical treatment), as well as various forms of relations between them. A wide range of text genres is considered, such as scientific publications (abstracts, as well as full texts), patent texts and clinical narratives. We also discuss infrastructure and resources needed for advanced text analytics, e.g. document corpora annotated with corresponding semantic metadata (gold standards and training data), biomedical terminologies and ontologies providing domain-specific background knowledge at different levels of formality and specificity, software architectures for building complex and scalable text analytics pipelines and Web services grounded to them, as well as comprehensive ways to disseminate and interact with the typically huge amounts of semiformal knowledge structures extracted by text mining tools. Finally, we consider some of the novel applications that have already been developed in the field of pharmacogenomic text mining and point out perspectives for future research."

However, few studies have evaluated how these systems might work in practice. In this article we focus on the problem of annotating mutations in Protein Data Bank (PDB) entries, and evaluate the relationship between performance of two automated techniques, a text-mining-based approach (MutationFinder) and an alignment-based approach, in intrinsic versus extrinsic evaluations. We find that high performance on gold standard data (an intrinsic evaluation) does not necessarily translate to high performance for database annotation (an extrinsic evaluation). We show that this is in part a result of lack of access to the full text of journal articles, which appears to be critical for comprehensive database annotation by text mining. Additionally, we evaluate the accuracy and completeness of manually annotated mutation data in the PDB, and find that it is far from perfect. We conclude that currently the most cost-effective and reliable approach for database annotation might incorporate manual and automatic annotation methods."

To populate this resource, data has currently been extracted from reports in the scientific literature for somatic mutations in four genes, BRAF, HRAS, KRAS2 and NRAS. At present, the database holds information on 66\u2009634 samples and reports a total of 10\u2009647 mutations. Through the web pages, these data can be queried, displayed as figures or tables and exported in a number of formats.

We provide strong evidence for the need for text mining techniques that address residue-level protein function annotation through an analysis of two corpora in terms of their coverage of curated data sources. We also explore the viability of building a text-based classifier for identifying protein functional sites, identifying the low coverage of curated data sources and the potential ambiguity of information about protein functional sites as challenges that must be addressed. Nevertheless we produce a simple classifier that achieves a reasonable \u223c69% F-score on our full text silver corpus on the first attempt to address this classification task. The work has application in computational prediction of the functional significance of protein sites as well as in curation workflows for databases that capture this information."

Context specific information relating to a particular protein or protein family is, however, not easily integrated and must be uploaded from databases or provided through manual curation of input files. Protein Engineers spend considerable time iteratively reviewing both literature and protein structure visualizations manually annotated with mutated residues. Meanwhile, text mining tools are increasingly used to extract specific units of raw text from scientific literature and have demonstrated the potential to support the activities of Protein Engineers.The transfer of mutation specific raw-text annotations to protein structures requires integrated data processing pipelines that can co-ordinate information retrieval, information extraction, protein sequence retrieval, sequence alignment and mutant residue mapping. We describe the Mutation Miner pipeline designed for this purpose and present case study evaluations of the key steps in the process. Starting with literature about mutations made to protein families; haloalkane dehalogenase, bi-phenyl dioxygenase, and xylanase we enumerate relevant documents available for text mining analysis, the available electronic formats, and the number of mutations made to a given protein family. We review the efficiency of NLP driven protein sequence retrieval from databases and report on the effectiveness of Mutation Miner in mapping annotations to protein structure visualizations. We highlight the feasibility and practicability of the approach."

                "text": "MOTIVATION\nGenome-wide high density SNP association studies are expected to identify various SNP alleles associated with different complex disorders. Understanding the biological significance of these SNP alleles in the context of existing literature is a major challenge since existing search engines are not designed to search literature for SNPs or other genetic markers. The literature mining of gene and protein functions has received significant attention and effort while similar work on genetic markers and their related diseases is still in its infancy. Our goal is to develop a web-based tool that facilitates the mining of Medline literature related to genetic studies and gene/protein function studies. Our solution consists of four main function modules for (1) identification of different types of genetic markers or genetic variations in Medline records (2) distinguishing positive versus negative linkage or association between genetic markers and diseases (3) integrating marker genomic location data from different databases to enable the retrieval of Medline records related to markers in the same linkage disequilibrium region (4) and a web interface called MarkerInfoFinder to search, display, sort and download Medline citation results. Tests using published data suggest MarkerInfoFinder can significantly increase the efficiency of finding genetic disorders and their underlying molecular mechanisms. The functions we developed will also be used to build a knowledge base for genetic markers and diseases.\n\n\nAVAILABILITY\nThe MarkerInfoFinder is publicly available at: http://brainarray.mbni.med.umich.edu/brainarray/datamining/MarkerInfoFinder."

                "text": "BackgroundA protein annotation database, such as the Universal Protein Resource knowledge base (UniProtKb), is a valuable resource for the validation and interpretation of predicted 3D structure patterns in proteins. Existing studies have focussed on point mutation extraction methods from biomedical literature which can be used to support the time consuming work of manual database curation. However, these methods were limited to point mutation extraction and do not extract features for the annotation of proteins at the residue level.ResultsThis work introduces a system that identifies protein residues in MEDLINE abstracts and annotates them with features extracted from the context written in the surrounding text. MEDLINE abstract texts have been processed to identify protein mentions in combination with taxonomic species and protein residues (F1-measure 0.52). The identified protein-species-residue triplets have been validated and benchmarked against reference data resources (UniProtKb, average F1-measure of 0.54). Then, contextual features were extracted through shallow and deep parsing and the features have been classified into predefined categories (F1-measure ranges from 0.15 to 0.67). Furthermore, the feature sets have been aligned with annotation types in UniProtKb to assess the relevance of the annotations for ongoing curation projects. Altogether, the annotations have been assessed automatically and manually against reference data resources.ConclusionThis work proposes a solution for the automatic extraction of functional annotation for protein residues from biomedical articles. The presented approach is an extension to other existing systems in that a wider range of residue entities are considered and that features of residues are extracted as annotations."

Unfortunately, the exploration of the consequences on the phenotypes of each individual mutation remains a considerable challenge.ResultsThe wKinMut web-server offers direct prediction of the potential pathogenicity of the mutations from a number of methods, including our recently developed prediction method based on the combination of information from a range of diverse sources, including physicochemical properties and functional annotations from FireDB and Swissprot and kinase-specific characteristics such as the membership to specific kinase groups, the annotation with disease-associated GO terms or the occurrence of the mutation in PFAM domains, and the relevance of the residues in determining kinase subfamily specificity from S3Det. This predictor yields interesting results that compare favourably with other methods in the field when applied to protein kinases.Together with the predictions, wKinMut offers a number of integrated services for the analysis of mutations. These include: the classification of the kinase, information about associations of the kinase with other proteins extracted from iHop, the mapping of the mutations onto PDB structures, pathogenicity records from a number of databases and the classification of mutations in large-scale cancer studies. Importantly, wKinMut is connected with the SNP2L system that extracts mentions of mutations directly from the literature, and therefore increases the possibilities of finding interesting functional information associated to the studied mutations.ConclusionswKinMut facilitates the exploration of the information available about individual mutations by integrating prediction approaches with the automatic extraction of information from the literature (text mining) and several state-of-the-art databases.wKinMut has been used during the last year for the analysis of the consequences of mutations in the context of a number of cancer genome projects, including the recent analysis of Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia cases and is publicly available at http://wkinmut.bioinfo.cnio.es."

                "text": "Molecular biology has become heavily dependent on biological knowledge encoded in expert curated biological databases. As the volume of biological literature increases, biocurators need help in keeping up with the literature; (semi-) automated aids for biocuration would seem to be an ideal application for natural language processing and text mining. However, to date, there have been few documented successes for improving biocuration throughput using text mining. Our initial investigations took place for the workshop on \u2018Text Mining for the BioCuration Workflow\u2019 at the third International Biocuration Conference (Berlin, 2009). We interviewed biocurators to obtain workflows from eight biological databases. This initial study revealed high-level commonalities, including (i) selection of documents for curation; (ii) indexing of documents with biologically relevant entities (e.g. genes); and (iii) detailed curation of specific relations (e.g. interactions); however, the detailed workflows also showed many variabilities. Following the workshop, we conducted a survey of biocurators. The survey identified biocurator priorities, including the handling of full text indexed with biological entities and support for the identification and prioritization of documents for curation. It also indicated that two-thirds of the biocuration teams had experimented with text mining and almost half were using text mining at that time. Analysis of our interviews and survey provide a set of requirements for the integration of text mining into the biocuration workflow. These can guide the identification of common needs across curated databases and encourage joint experimentation involving biocurators, text mining developers and the larger biomedical research community."

In addition, more and more experts in the mutations and diseases of particular genes are curating published and unpublished mutations in locus-specific databases (LSDB). These databases contain such extensive information that they have become known as knowledge bases. We analyzed these databases and their content between June 21, 2001, and July 18, 2001. We were able to access 94 independent websites devoted to the documentation of mutation containing 262 LSDBs for study. We analyzed one LSDB from each of these websites (i.e., 94 LSDBs) for the presence or absence of 80 content criteria, as generally each gene in a multigene website documented the same criteria. No criterion studied gave unanimous agreement in every database. Twenty-two genes were represented by more than one LSDB. The number of mutations recorded, excluding p53, was 23,822 with 1518 polymorphisms. Fifty-four percent of the LSDBs studied were easy to use and 11% hard to follow; 73% of the databases were displayed through HTML. Three databases were found that were given a high score for ease of use and wealth of content. Thus, the study provided a strong case for uniformity of data to make the content maximally useful. In this direction, a hypothetical content for an ideal LSDB was derived. We also derived a community structure that would enhance the chances of mutation capture rather than being left unpublished in a patient's report. We hope the interested community and granting bodies will assist in achieving the vision of a public system that collects and displays all variants discovered."

Our analytical approach is to map single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and pathogenic deviations (PDs) to protein structural data held within the Protein Data Bank. By mapping mutations onto protein structures, we can hypothesize whether the mutant residues will have any local structural effect that may \u201cexplain\u201d a deleterious phenotype. Our prior work used a similar approach to analyze mutations within a single protein. An analysis of the contents of SAAPdb indicates that there are clear differences in the sequence and structural characteristics of SNPs and PDs, and that PDs are more often explained by our structural analysis.

The latest version contains 582 different mutations for 1,790 cases in 1,322 families. KinMutBase entries are described on the DNA, mRNA, and protein level. Numbers for affected patients and families are also provided. KinMutBase has extensive amount of links and cross\u2010references to literature, other databases, and information sources. There are numerous interactive pages about sequences, structures, mutation statistics, and diseases. Detailed statistical study was done on frequencies of different types of mutations both on the DNA and protein level in serine/threonine kinase (PSK) and tyrosine kinase (PTK). Three\u2010dimensional structures indicate clustering of disease\u2010related mutations mainly to conserved subdomains, and substrate and coligand binding amino acids, although mutations appear throughout the sequences. CpG containing codons, especially for arginine, constitute the majority of mutational hotspots. There are certain clear differences in mutation patterns and types between PSKs and PTKs.

                "text": "BackgroundWe propose a method for automatic extraction of protein-specific residue mentions from the biomedical literature. The method searches text for mentions of amino acids at specific sequence positions and attempts to correctly associate each mention with a protein also named in the text. The methods presented in this work will enable improved protein functional site extraction from articles, ultimately supporting protein function prediction. Our method made use of linguistic patterns for identifying the amino acid residue mentions in text. Further, we applied an automated graph-based method to learn syntactic patterns corresponding to protein-residue pairs mentioned in the text. We finally present an approach to automated construction of relevant training and test data using the distant supervision model.ResultsThe performance of the method was assessed by extracting protein-residue relations from a new automatically generated test set of sentences containing high confidence examples found using distant supervision. It achieved a F-measure of 0.84 on automatically created silver corpus and 0.79 on a manually annotated gold data set for this task, outperforming previous methods.ConclusionsThe primary contributions of this work are to (1) demonstrate the effectiveness of distant supervision for automatic creation of training data for protein-residue relation extraction, substantially reducing the effort and time involved in manual annotation of a data set and (2) show that the graph-based relation extraction approach we used generalizes well to the problem of protein-residue association extraction. This work paves the way towards effective extraction of protein functional residues from the literature."

                "text": "BackgroundAn increase in work on the full text of journal articles and the growth of PubMedCentral have the opportunity to create a major paradigm shift in how biomedical text mining is done. However, until now there has been no comprehensive characterization of how the bodies of full text journal articles differ from the abstracts that until now have been the subject of most biomedical text mining research.ResultsWe examined the structural and linguistic aspects of abstracts and bodies of full text articles, the performance of text mining tools on both, and the distribution of a variety of semantic classes of named entities between them. We found marked structural differences, with longer sentences in the article bodies and much heavier use of parenthesized material in the bodies than in the abstracts. We found content differences with respect to linguistic features. Three out of four of the linguistic features that we examined were statistically significantly differently distributed between the two genres. We also found content differences with respect to the distribution of semantic features. There were significantly different densities per thousand words for three out of four semantic classes, and clear differences in the extent to which they appeared in the two genres. With respect to the performance of text mining tools, we found that a mutation finder performed equally well in both genres, but that a wide variety of gene mention systems performed much worse on article bodies than they did on abstracts. POS tagging was also more accurate in abstracts than in article bodies.ConclusionsAspects of structure and content differ markedly between article abstracts and article bodies. A number of these differences may pose problems as the text mining field moves more into the area of processing full-text articles. However, these differences also present a number of opportunities for the extraction of data types, particularly that found in parenthesized text, that is present in article bodies but not in article abstracts."

The Swiss\u2010Prot protein knowledgebase records information on such mutations in various sections of a protein entry, namely in the \u201cfeature,\u201d \u201ccomment,\u201d and \u201creference\u201d fields. To facilitate users in obtaining the most relevant information about each human SAP recorded in the knowledgebase, the Swiss\u2010Prot Variant web pages were created to provide a summary of available sequence information, as well as additional structural information on each variant. In particular, the ModSNP database was set up to store information related to SAPs and to manage the modeling of SAPs onto protein structures via an automatic homology modeling pipeline. Currently, among the 16,566 human SAPs recorded in the Swiss\u2010Prot knowledgebase (release 42.5, 21 November 2003), more than 25% have corresponding 3D\u2010models. Of these variants, 47% are related to disease, 26% are polymorphisms, and 27% are not yet clearly classified. The ModSNP database is updated and the subsequent model construction pipeline is launched with each weekly Swiss\u2010Prot release. Thus, the ModSNP database represents a valuable resource for the structural analysis of protein variation. The Swiss\u2010Prot variant pages are accessible from the NiceProt view of a Swiss\u2010Prot entry on the ExPASy server (www.expasy.org/), via a hyperlink created for the stable and unique identifier FTId of each human SAP.

We investigated the added value of full text over abstracts in terms of information content and occurrences of gene symbol--gene name combinations that can resolve gene-symbol ambiguity.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWe analyzed a set of 3902 biomedical full-text articles. Different keyword measures indicate that information density is highest in abstracts, but that the information coverage in full texts is much greater than in abstracts. Analysis of five different standard sections of articles shows that the highest information coverage is located in the results section. Still, 30-40% of the information mentioned in each section is unique to that section. Only 30% of the gene symbols in the abstract are accompanied by their corresponding names, and a further 8% of the gene names are found in the full text. In the full text, only 18% of the gene symbols are accompanied by their gene names."

                "text": "BackgroundRecent years have seen an increased amount of natural language processing (NLP) work on full text biomedical journal publications. Much of this work is done with Open Access journal articles. Such work assumes that Open Access articles are representative of biomedical publications in general and that methods developed for analysis of Open Access full text publications will generalize to the biomedical literature as a whole. If this assumption is wrong, the cost to the community will be large, including not just wasted resources, but also flawed science. This paper examines that assumption.ResultsWe collected two sets of documents, one consisting only of Open Access publications and the other consisting only of traditional journal publications. We examined them for differences in surface linguistic structures that have obvious consequences for the ease or difficulty of natural language processing and for differences in semantic content as reflected in lexical items. Regarding surface linguistic structures, we examined the incidence of conjunctions, negation, passives, and pronominal anaphora, and found that the two collections did not differ. We also examined the distribution of sentence lengths and found that both collections were characterized by the same mode. Regarding lexical items, we found that the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the two collections was low, and was lower than the divergence between either collection and a reference corpus. Where small differences did exist, log likelihood analysis showed that they were primarily in the area of formatting and in specific named entities.ConclusionWe did not find structural or semantic differences between the Open Access and traditional journal collections."

Each case belongs to a family with clinical needs that require genetic counseling, DNA testing for mismatch repair genes (most frequently MLH1 or MSH2) and screening for CRC. Colonoscopy is mandated, given CRC's proximal occurrence (70\u201380% proximal to the splenic flexure). Due to its early age of onset (average 45 years of age), colonoscopy needs to start by age 25, and because of its accelerated carcinogenesis, it should be repeated every 1 to 2 years through age 40 and then annually thereafter. Should CRC occur, subtotal colectomy may be necessary, given the marked frequency of synchronous and metachronous CRC. Because 40\u201360% of female patients will manifest endometrial cancer, tailored management is essential. Additional extracolonic cancers include ovary, stomach, small bowel, pancreas, hepatobiliary tract, upper uroepithelial tract, brain (Turcot variant) and sebaceous adenomas/carcinomas (Muir\u2010Torre variant). LS explains only 10\u201325% of familial CRC."

MAb IgG or F(ab')2 fragments were injected in parallel and at day 1, 2, 3 and 6 or 7, mice were either scanned with a gamma camera or dissected for determination of isotope biodistribution. In HNX-HN bearing mice, E48 IgG as well as F(ab')2 showed highly specific localisation in tumour tissue. The mean tumour uptake (n = 4) expressed as the percentage of the injected dose per gram of tumour tissue (percentage ID/g) of IgG was 11.9% at day 1 and increased to 14.6% at day 6 whereas percentage ID/g of F(ab')2 was 7.2% at day 1 and decreased during subsequent days. Tumour to blood ratios (T/B) at day I were 1.2 for IgG and 13.6 for F(ab')2 and reached a maximum at day 6 with values of 6.4 and 54.2 respectively. In VX-A431 bearing mice, only E48 F(ab')2 showed preferential localisation in tumour tissue. At day 1, Percentage ID/g of IgG was 3.7 and T/B was 0.3, while percentage ID/g of F(ab')2 was 2.4 and T/B was 3.2. Percentage ID/g decreased after day I while T/B increased. In these experiments no preferential localisation of either isotype matched '251I-labelled control IgG or F(ab')2 was observed. In F(ab')2 injected HNX-HN bearing mice as well as VX-A431 bearing mice, tumours could be visualised at day 1 and 2 without any appreciable background activity. With MAb IgG this was also possible in HNX-HN bearing mice (but not in VX-A431 bearing mice) but only at day 3 and 6. These findings suggest that the superior tumour to non-tumour ratios render the E48 F(ab')2 fragment more qualified for specific targeting of radioisotopes to tumour xenografts in this experimental setting. Of all human neoplasms, squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is one of the most common tumour types and represents the major histological type of neoplasm arising from head and neck, cervix, skin, and lung. The relative sensitivity of head and neck SCC for radiation therapy has led us to investigate \u2026"
