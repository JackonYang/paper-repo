It is now clear that the retina and visual pathways do not simply transmit a mosaic of Iight and dark to some central sensorium. Rather, even at the retinal level, specific features of visual stimuli are detected and their presence communicated to the next level. In cats and monkeys, the geniculostriate visual system consists of a series of converging and diverging connections such that at each successive tier of processing mechanism, single neurons respond to increasingly more specific visual stimuli falling on an increasingly wider area of the retina (19-Z). How far does this analytical-synthetic process continue whereby individual cells have more and more specific trigger features? Are there regions of the brain beyond striate and prestriatel cortex where this processing of visual information is carrie,d further? If so, how far and in what way? Are there cells that are concerned with the storage of visual information as well as its analysis? There are several lines of evidence suggesting that a possible site for further processing of visual information and perhaps even for storage of such information might, in the monkey, be inferotemporal cortexthe cortex on the inferior convexity of the temporal lobe. First, this area receives afferents from prestriate cortex which itself processes visual information received from"

MT is a small, elliptically shaped area on the posterior bank of the superior temporal sulcus which can be identified by its direct inputs from striate cortex and by its distinctive pattern of heavy myelination. Its average surface area is 33 mm2, which is less than 3% of the size of striate cortex. It contains a complete, topographically organized representation of the contralateral visual hemifield. There are substantial irregularities in the detailed pattern of topographic organization, however, and the representation is significantly more complex than that found for MT in other primates. Much of MT is devoted to the representation of central visual fields, with the emphasis on central vision being similar to that found in striate cortex."

                "text": "1. The topographic organization of prestriate visual cortex in the rhesus monkey has been studied both anatomically, by determining the pattern of termination of fibres passing through the corpus callosum, and physiologically, in the same animals, by plotting receptive field positions for different recording sites. Results are displayed on two\u2010dimensional, \"unfolded\" maps of the cortex in the dorsal half of the occipital lobe. 2. Transcallosal fibres terminate in a narrow strip of cortex along the boundary between striate and prestriate areas and in a separate, broader, zone occupying much of the anterior bank of the lunate sulcus, the annectant gyrus, and the parietooccipital sulcus. The detailed pattern of inputs is highly complicated but shows considerable similarities from one animal to the next. 3. Physiological recordings confirmed earlier reports that regions where transcallosal fibres terminate correspond to representations of the vertical meridian in the visual field. This relationship is most precise along the striate\u2010prestriate boundary and along the boundary of area V3 farthest from V1; it is less precise within area V4, where the pattern of transcallosal inputs is more complex. 4. A distinct, topographically organized visual area, named V3A, was found in the region between areas V3 and V4 in the lunate and parieto\u2010occipital sulci. Area V3A differs from V2 and V3 in that both superior and inferior visual quadrants are represented in a single region of the dorsal occipital lobe. 5. The contralateral visual field is represented in a suprisingly complex fashion in areas V3A and V4. Within each area there are multiple representations of some, but perhaps not all, parts of the visual hemifield. It is unclear whether V3A and V4 should be more appropriately considered as sets of distinct sub\u2010areas, each representing only a portion of the hemifield, or as larger areas with complicated internal topographies. 6. Most cells in areas V2, V3 and V3A are orientation selective but not selective for stimulus colour or direction of movement. In contrast, area V4 contains a higher incidence of colour selective cells and a lower incidence of orientation selectivity. These results support the notion of a functional division of labour within the prestriate cortex."

Lorente de No (29) also described neuron chains of varying complexity within each column. Some chains were simple two-neuron arcs, with the afferent fiber synapsing directly onto an output cell. Other chains involved various numbers of interneurons between input and output. Implicit in this concept of multiple neuron chains is the notion that any given column has multiple functions and multiple outputs. Hubel and Wiesel (24, 26) have postulated a single neuron chain in visual cortex, involving afferent axons, simple cells, complex cells, and (more recently) hypercomplex cells. In cat visual cortex most of the cells (233/303 or 77yo) had simple properties (24), whereas in monkeys most of the cells (1771272 or 65y0) were complex (26). Xn the course of experiments dealing primarily with co,lor properties of neurons in monkey visual cortex (13), it became evident that complex cells did not constitute a single homogeneous group, but included several subclasses. When the recording sites were determined histologically, the physiologically defined subclasses of complex cells turned out to have different laminar distributions. The physiologic properties used to define the new cell classes are presented in this paper, and the laminar distributions are shown. Some important differences be-"

It would be astonishing if such a structure did not profoundly modify the response patterns of fibres coming into it. In the cat's visual cortex, the receptive field arrangements of single cells suggest that there is indeed a degree of complexity far exceeding anything yet seen at lower levels in the visual system. In a previous paper we described receptive fields of single cortical cells, observing responses to spots of light shone on one or both retinas (Hubel & Wiesel, 1959). In the present work this method is used to examine receptive fields of a more complex type (Part I) and to make additional observations on binocular interaction (Part II). This approach is necessary in order to understand the behaviour of individual cells, but it fails to deal with the problem of the relationship of one cell to its neighbours. In the past, the technique of recording evoked slow waves has been used with great success in studies of functional anatomy. It was employed by Talbot & Marshall (1941) and by Thompson, Woolsey & Talbot (1950) for mapping out the visual cortex in the rabbit, cat, and monkey. Daniel & Whitteiidge (1959) have recently extended this work in the primate. Most of our present knowledge of retinotopic projections, binocular overlap, and the second visual area is based on these investigations. Yet the method of evoked potentials is valuable mainly for detecting behaviour common to large populations of neighbouring cells; it cannot differentiate functionally between areas of cortex smaller than about 1 mm2. To overcome this difficulty a method has in recent years been developed for studying cells separately or in small groups during long micro-electrode penetrations through nervous tissue. Responses are correlated with cell location by reconstructing the electrode tracks from histological material. These techniques have been applied to"

In this paper, evidence from clinical reports and from lesion and behavioral-electrophysiological experiments using monkeys is reviewed and discussed in relation to the overall functional organization of posterior parietal association cortex, and particularly with respect to a proposed posterior parietal mechanism concerned with the initiation and control of certain classes of eye and limb movements. Preliminary data from studies of the effects of posterior parietal lesions on oculomotor control in monkeys are reported. The behavioral effects of lesions of posterior parietal cortex in monkeys have been found to be similar to those which follow analogous damage of the minor hemisphere in humans, while behavioral-electrophysiological experiments have disclosed classes of neurons in this area which have functional properties closely related to the behavioral acts that are disrupted by lesions of the area. On the basis of current data from these areas of study, it is proposed that the sensory association model of posterior parietal function is inadequate to account for the complexities of the present evidence. Instead, it now appears that many diverse neural mechanisms are located in part in parietal cortex, that some of these mechanisms are involved in sensory processing and perceptual functions, but that others participate in motor control, and that still others are involved in attentional, motivational, or emotional processes. It is further proposed that the elementary units of these various neural mechanisms are distributed within posterior parietal cortex according to the columnar hypothesis of Mountcastle."

The cells were studied for their binocularity, as well as for their orientational, motion and colour preferences. In all, 1500 cells were studied, 250 cells for each of the areas V2, V3, V3A and the motion area of the posterior bank of the superior temporal sulcus, and 500 cells for V4. All the cells referred to in this study can be placed in one prestriate area or another unambiguously. 2. The great majority of cells in all areas were binocularly driven, without monocular preferences. Within each area, there were cells that either preferred binocular stimulation markedly, or were responsive to binocular stimulation only. The ocular interaction histograms for all areas are remarkably similar when tested at a fixed disparity. 3. Over 70% of the cells in areas V2, V3 and V3A were selective for orientation. The receptive fields of cells were larger in V3 and V3A than in V2. By contrast, less than 50% of the cells in V4 and the motion area of the superior temporal sulcus were orientation selective. 4. Directionally selective cells were found in all areas. But they were present in small numbers (less than 15%) in areas V2, V3, V3A and V4. By contrast, 90% of the cells in the motion area of the superior temporal sulcus were directionally selective. 5. 8% of the cells in V2 had opponent colour properties. Cells with such properties were not found in V3, V3A or in the motion area of the superior temporal sulcus. By contrast, 54% of the cells in the V4 complex had opponent colour properties. 6. It is argued that despite its uniformity in cytoarchitectural appearance and in ocular interaction patterns, there is a functional division of labour within the prestriate cortex. Evidence for this is seen not only in the different concentrations of functional cell types in distinct areas of the prestriate cortex, but also in the differential anatomical and callosal connexions of each area."

Injections of the enzyme were made through a recording micropipette, making it possible to localize the injection site by physiological criteria. We found that layer VI cells projected to the lateral geniculate nucleus, while a distinct population of cells in layer V projected to the superior colliculus. Cells in layers II and III were the major sources of ipsilateral cortico\u2010cortical connections. This pattern of projection was consistent from one visual area to another. Pyramidal cells appeared to be the source of cortico\u2010geniculate, cortico\u2010collicular and cortico\u2010cortical projections. The proportion of cells within a layer that terminated in a given site varied from layer to layer: apparently all of the large pyramids in layer V had terminals in the superior colliculus, about half of the pyramids in layer VI had terminals in the lateral geniculate nucleus, while only a small proportion of the pyramids in layers II and III had terminals in any single cortical area. The results indicated a remarkable specificity in the projections of the cortical layers."

It deals with the visual mechanisms of diverse vertebrate species from salamanders and toads to primates and humans and presents a stimulating interaction of the disciplines of anatomy, physiology, and behavioral science. Throughout, visual mechanisms are investigated from the point of view of the brain functioning at the organismic level, as opposed to the now more prevalent focus on the molecular and cellular levels. This approach allows researchers to deal with the patterns of visually guided behavior of animals in real-life situations.The twenty-six contributions in the book are divided among three sections: \"Indentification and Localization Processes in Nonmammalian Vertebrates,\" introduced by David J. Ingle; \"Visual Guidance of Motor Patterns: The Role of Visual Cortex and the Superior Colliculus,\" introduced by Melvyn A. Goodale; and \"Recognition and Transfer Processes,\" introduced by Richard J. W. Mansfield.The editors are all university researchers in psychology: David J. Ingle at Brandeis, Melvyn A. Goodale at the University of Western Ontario, and Richard J. W. Mansfield at Harvard."

                "text": "1. Recordings were made from single units in the middle temporal visual area (MT) of anesthetized, paralyzed macaque monkeys. A computer-driven stimulator was used to make quantitative tests of selectivity for stimulus direction, speed, and orientation. The data were taken from 168 units that were histologically identified as being in MT. 2. The results confirm previous reports of a high degree of direction selectivity in MT. The response above background to stimuli moving in a unit's preferred direction was, an average, 10.9 times that to stimuli moving in the opposite direction. There was a marked tendency for nearby units to have similar preferred directions. 3. Most units were also sharply tuned for the speed of stimulus motion. For some cells the response fell to less than half-maximal at speeds only a factor of two from the optimum; on average, responses were greater than half-maximal only over a 7.7-fold range of speed. The distribution of preferred speeds for different units was unimodal, with a peak near 32 degrees/s; the total range of preferred speeds extended from 2 to 256 degrees/s. Nearby units generally responded best to similar speeds of motion. 4. Most units in MT showed selectivity for stimulus orientation when tested with stationary, flashed bars. However, stationary stimuli generally elicited only brief responses; when averaged over the duration of the stimulus, the responses were much less than those to moving stimuli. The preferred orientation was usually, but not always, perpendicular to the preferred direction of movement. 5. A comparison of the results of the present study with a previous quantitative investigation in the owl monkey shows a striking similarity in response properties in MT of the two species. 6. The presence of both direction and speed selectivity in MT of the macaque suggests that this area is more specialized for the analysis of visual motion than has been previously recognized."

The ordinal, or serial, position of different types of striate neurons was assessed from their latencies to electrical stimulation of the optic radiations in paralyzed cats anesthetized with N,O/O, (70/30%). 2.

These peaks become sharper if the stimulating site is moved from a low point (OR,) to a high point (OR,) in the optic radiations. It is argued that each peak represents a population of cells lying at a different ordinal, or serial, position within the cortical pathway, i.e., receiving a mono-, di-, or polysynaptic excitatory input from the thalamus. 3. The duration separating the peaks, of the order of 1.0 ms, is then taken as the transmission time for conduction of the nervous impulse from one cortical cell to the next. Confirmatory evidence for this value of the cell-to-cell transmission time comes from the measurement of interspike intervals in cortical cells that responded with multiple spikes to electrical stimulation. 4. From the peaks in the distribution of OR, latencies, boundaries have been established to arrive at an ordinal position for 131 cells classified as S, Sh, C, B, or cells with nonoriented or concentric receptive field (N-O and cone), following the terminology of Henry (14). Four ordinal groups were distinguished: group M comprised cells receiving an exclusive monosynaptic input from the thalamus, group C1+,i consisted of cells exhibiting a convergence of excitatory inputs, one of which was monosynaptic; group D was composed of cells in which the lowest order input was disynaptic. Cells were placed in group P if they were driven from the thalamus through three or more synapses. Examination of the distribution of different cell types for these various ordinal groups revealed that no particular cell type was exclusively associated with a single ordinal position. In particular, a large proportion of S-, Sh-, C-, and N-O and cone cells showed a monosynaptic input from the thalamus (groups M and Cl+,)). 5. For the three classes of cell, S, Sh, and C, with sufficient numbers in groups MY cl+n~ and D, a search was made for differences in response properties associated with the various ordinal groups. The properties examined included ocular dominance, direction selectivity, orientation specificity, and receptive-field size. With the exception of the C-cell, which showed a difference of direction selectivity in groups M and Cl+,), we observed no systematic changes in the response properties with differences in ordinal position. 6. For most cell types in cat striate cortex there are examples of neurons receiving a monosynaptic input. It is difficult to reconcile these findings with a hierarchical model for the processing of visual information. It is proposed that these cells are first-order elements of different streams running in parallel within the cortex and that this multiplicity of streams may be associated with the diversity of outputs leaving the striate cortex."

                "text": "1. Electrophysiological recordings were made in the middle temporal visual area (MT) of five macaque monkeys. Binocularity and selectivity for disparity were examined using a computer-driven stimulator to activate each eye independently. Results were obtained from 91 single units in MT. 2. Most units in MT receive approximately balanced inputs from the two eyes, and very few could be driven through only one eye. 3. In one type of test for disparity selectivity, units were examined with stimuli that had different but fixed horizontal disparities, thereby simulating frontoparallel movements at different distances from the animal. About two-thirds of ;the units tested for fixed disparity selectivity (52/76) showed pronounced sensitivity to horizontal disparity. Most of these units could be grouped into the same four classes of disparity-tuned units that have previously been described in V1 and V2 of the macaque: near, far, tuned excitatory, and tuned inhibitory. 4. Twenty units were tested for sensitivity to vertical stimulus disparity, which does not normally contribute to stereopsis. Most were as sensitive to vertical disparities as to horizontal. 5. Units were also tested for selectivity for stimuli that moved with changing disparity, simulating trajectories with components of motion toward or away from the animal (motion in depth). No units were found to be truly selective for motion in depth. Units tuned for fixed disparity could appear to prefer motion in depth if tested only with trajectories whose common center point was far from the unit's optimal fixed disparity. However, we do not consider this to represent genuine selectivity for motion in depth, since 1) the responses ara adequately and more easily explained in terms of selectivity for fixed disparity and 2) the best overall response of these units is to frontoparallel motion at the optimal fixed disparity. This observation bears importantly on the interpretation of motion in depth selectivity in previous investigations. 6. The presence of a substantial degree of selectivity for fixed disparity in MT, together with previously demonstrated selectivities for direction and speed, indicates that MT is well suited for the analysis of motion in three-dimensional space."

The area explored was located on the lateral gyrus between the Horsley-Clarke coordinates A1 to 4 and L3 to 4. The receptive-field properties of area 18 cells and their responses to electrical stimulation of afferent and efferent pathways were measured with the same methods as described previously in area 17. Mutual correlations among these items were calculated and compared with the respective data from area 17. The results of this correlative analysis revealed numerous similarities between the two areas with regard to their afferent and efferent connections and their intrinsic organization. Consequently, the structure of the receptive fields and their numerical distribution resembled those in area 17. The same was true for the correlations between receptive-field parameters and afferent and efferent connectivity. The main differences were that area 18 cells had larger receptive fields and responded to considerably higher stimulus velocities. It is suggest-d that these differences are caused by the fact that area 18 receives subcortical afferents of the Y-type, whereas the dominant input to area 17 comes from the X-system. It is concluded that the area investigated in this study is organized in parallel to area 17 and deals with other aspects of visual information than area 17."

                "text": "The distribution of interhemispheric connections was studied in extrastriate visual cortex of the macaque monkey. Callosal fiber terminations were identified by staining for anterograde degeneration following transection of the splenium of the corpus callosum. Retrogradely labeled cell bodies of callosal projection neurons were identified histochemically following application of horseradish peroxidase to the cut surface of the callosum. Results were displayed on unfolded, two-dimensional representations of the cortex, which permitted spatial and topological relationships between callosal recipient and callosal free cortical regions to be discerned readily. The overall pattern of callosal inputs to visual cortex can be subdivided into nine callosal recipient zones which surround seven callosal free regions in the occipital, temporal, and parietal lobes. This pattern provides reliable and useful landmarks for identifying the borders of at least five topographically organized extrastriate visual areas. There is a pronounced dorsoventral asymmetry in callosal projections, not recognized in previous studies, which reflects an asymmetry in the organization of visual areas in dorsal versus ventral halves of the occipital lobe. The pattern of callosal fiber terminations is mirrored by a very similar distribution of callosal projection neurons. There are significant regional differences in the laminar distribution of callosal projection cells, and these differences may reflect functionally distinct cortical subdivisions. A considerable degree of individual variability was found in the relationship of callosal connections to gyral and sulcal landmarks as well as in the fine structure of individual callosal recipient strips, suggesting that each animal has a unique \u201ccallosal fingerprint.\u201d These findings emphasize the usefulness of the callosal pathway in elucidating the functional organization of extrastriate visual cortex."

Recordings were made from neurons located within the central-field representation of the V4 area of extrastriate visual cortex using a semichronic, nitrous-oxide preparation; the properties of 174 cells were examined in sufficient detail to permit their classification. Cyto- and myeloarchitectural studies confirmed the identification of the area. 2. Color-selective cells with either color-biased or color-opponent properties represented about 20% of the examined population. Their incidence was not significantly different from that of similar cells encountered in penetrations into the central-field representation of area V2. 3. Most color-selective cells had color-biased properties, responding best to wave-lengths shorter than 460 nm, or longer than 580 n, or both. No examples of \"green-biased\" cells were found. Some color-biased cells responded to photopically matched white light, while others did not. Very few cells showed overt color-opponent responses. The spectral sensitivity of color-selective cells was not unusually narrow. 4. Cells lacking color selectivity and responding equally well to chromatic and achromatic lights of equal photopic luminosity, were the most commonly encountered cell type in penetrations of different parts of the V4 area (56%). Other than color, these cells showed stimulus preferences like those of color-selective cells. 5. One-fourth of V4 cells could not be systematically driven with the various stimuli used. This finding is consistent with recent results of recordings from the prelunate gyrus of the behaving monkey suggesting that some V4 cells receive extraretinal signals. 6. Our results do not support recent claims that V4 is specialized in the detailed analysis of color information."

                "text": "1. The cortical projections of the foveal and extrafoveal parts of the striate cortex have been compared, using conventional degeneration techniques, as well as combinations of anatomical methods. While both foveal and extrafoveal striate cortex share a common pattern of projections (to areas V2, V3 and the visual area in the medial part of the posterior bank of the superior temporal sulcus), foveal striate cortex was found to have an additional projection (to part of the cortex of the fourth visual areas, V4). The latter projection includes the posterior lip of the inferior occipital sulcus which, on anatomical grounds, is regarded as the ventral extension of V4. 2. Anatomical studies using double tracers were employed to clarify the nature of the projections from the striate cortex and from V2 to V4. In one such experiment, tritiated proline was injected into extra\u2010foveal striate cortex and a small lesion was made in that part of V2 receiving a direct projection from the region of the striate cortex into which the radioactive tracer was injected. Only degenerating fibres (due to the lesion), and no radioactive label, was found in V4. Such an experiment showed that, unlike foveal striate cortex, the projections from extrafoveal striate cortex to V4 are not direct, but through V2. 3. In another type of anatomical experiment using double tracers, the corpus callosum was sectioned and tritiated proline was injected into foveal striate cortex. Such an experiment allowed a more accurate determination of the extent of V4, as judged from its callosal connexions, to which foveal striate cortex projects. 4. Considering the projections of V1 to areas V2, V3 and the visual area in the medial part of the posterior bank of the superior temporal sulcus, and considering the differences in the projections of foveal and extrafoveal striate cortex, it is suggested that, among other functions, the striate cortex acts as a distribution centre for the information coming over the retino\u2010geniculo\u2010cortical pathways, parcelling this information out to different visual areas of the prestriate cortex for further analysis."

The representation of the visual field in the striate projection zone in the posterior portion of the superior temporal sulcus of the macaque (MT) was mapped with multiunit electrodes. The animals were immobilized and anesthetized and in each animal 25-35 electrode penetrations were typically made over several recording sessions. 2. MT contains a representation of virtually the entire contralateral visual field. The representation of the vertical meridian forms its ventrolateral border and lies near the bottom of the lower bank of the superior temporal sulcus (STS). The representation of the horizontal meridian runs across the floor of STS. The upper field is located ventral and anterior and the lower field dorsal and posterior. The medial border lies at the junction of the floor of STS and its upper bank. 3. MT is similar to striate cortex in being a first-order transformation of the visual field. In both areas, receptive-field size and cortical magnification increase with eccentricity. MT is much smaller than striate cortex and has much larger receptive fields at a given eccentricity and a cruder topography. 4. The results further support the suggestion that MT in the macaque is homologous to visual area MT in New World primates."

The author has analyzed the computations performed in the course of visual motion analysis. Workable schemes able to perform certain tasks performed by the visual system have been constructed and used as vehicles for investigating the problems faced by the visual system and its methods for solving them.Two major problems are treated: first, the correspondence problem, which concerns the identification of image elements that represent the same object at different times, thereby maintaining the perceptual identity of the object in motion or in change. The second problem is the three-dimensional interpretation of the changing image once a correspondence has been established.The author's computational approach to visual theory makes the work unique, and it should be of interest to psychologists working in visual perception and readers interested in cognitive studies in general, as well as computer scientists interested in machine vision, theoretical neurophysiologists, and philosophers of science."

The technique is based on information contained in outlines of histological sections, and it allows an entire hemisphere to be represented on a single cortical map. Maps for different hemispheres from individuals of the same species are similar in size, shape, and organization, and their configuration is largely independent of the plane of sectioning used for reconstruction. Many types of information pertaining to the location and organization of different functional subdivisions can be displayed on cortical maps; representative applications of the technique to mapping cerebral cortex in the macaque and the cat are shown. Areal measurements on cortical maps correspond closely (generally within 20%) to actual surface areas in the intact hemisphere. Therefore, the maps can also be used to provide accurate determinations of the absolute and relative extent of various anatomical and functional subdivisions of the cortex."

Two major rostral\u2010to\u2010caudal connectional sequences exist. One begins in the dorsal postcentral gyrus (area 2) and proceeds, through architectnic divisions of the superior parietal lobule (areas PE and PEc), to a cortical region on the medial surface of the parietal lobe (area PGm). This area has architectonic features similar to those of the caudal inferior parietal lobule (area PG). The second sequence begins in the ventral post/ central gyrus (area 2) and passes through the rostral inferior parietal lobule (areas PF and PFG) to reach the caudal inferior parietal lobule (area PG). Both the superior parietal lobule and the rostral inferior parietal lobule also send projections to various other zones located in the parietal opercular region, the intraparietal sulcus, and the caudalmost portion of the cingulate sulcus. Areas PGm and PG, on the other hand, project to each other, to the cingulate region, to the caudalmost portion of the superior temporal gyrus, and to the upper bank of the superior temporal sulcus. Finally, a reciprocal sequence of connections, directed from caudal to rostral, links together many of the above\u2010mentioned parietal zones. With regard to the laminar pattern of termination, the rostral\u2010to\u2010caudal connections are primarily distributed in the form of cortical \u201ccolumns\u201d while the caudal\u2010to\u2010rostral connections are found mainly over the first cortical cell layer."

Cells were classified according to their sensitivity to the orientation and direction of motion of rectangular stimuli. Nonoriented cells were most common (39/75, 52%); the next largest class consisted of cells sensitive to stationary stimulus orientation (25/75, 33%); the third class consisted of directionally selective cells (11/75, 15%). No cells in V3 showed color-opponent responses. comparison of the orientation-sensitive population in V3 and V2 showed V3 cells more broadly tuned for orientation than V2 cells.

The moving of cells studied were not selective for bar width or for the spatial frequency of square-wave gratings. 3. Most cells responded selectively to the spatial frequency of the sine-wave gratings. 4. The spatial frequency of the sine-wave grating eliciting the optimal response could not be predicted from the organization of the receptive field of each cell as determined by stationary or moving stimuli. 5. The sharpness of spatial-frequency selectivity is only slightly more pronounced in S-type cells than in CX-type cells. 6. S-type and CX-type cells differ significantly in the temporal modulation of their discharges to gratings. S-type cells discharge in sharp bursts to each cycle which traverses the receptive field. CX-type cells discharge in a rather continuous fashion. This measure can be used reliably to classify cells as S or CS type."

The responses of parietal LS neurons to visual stimuli are facilitated during the state of attentive fixation of a target light as compared to their responses to physically and retinotopically identical test stimuli delivered during the eye pauses of alert wakefulness. Seventy percent of the neurons tested (n = 55) showed significant increments in responses in the state of attentive fixation; the median value of the increments was 3.5 times. Only 4 of the 55 cells examined completely showed the reverse relation. Three sets of control experiments were done. The facilitation occurred when the responses evoked during the trials of a reaction task with attentive fixation of a target were compared with those evoked by identical stimuli delivered to the same retinotopic locations at the end of each intertrial interval: the facilitation of attentive fixation is not due to a shift in the general level of arousal. The facilitation occurred when the animal maintained attentive fixation of a spot of the tangent screen without a target light or when an additional light mimicking the target light was presented along with testing stimuli in the state of alert wakefulness without attentive fixation: the facilitation is not produced by a sensory-sensory interaction between target and testing lights. Finally, the facilitation was observed whether or not the test stimuli were behaviorally relevant. We conclude that the act of attentive fixation exerts a specific and powerful effect upon the excitability of the neural systems linking the retinae and the inferior parietal lobule and that the facilitation plays an important role in visually guided behavior."

These motor neurons innervate the longitudinal muscles in dorsal or ventral sectors of the segmental body wall. Their duty cycles are phase-locked in a manner such that the dorsal and ventral body wall sectors of any given segment undergo an antiphasic contractile rhythm and that the contractile rhythms of different segments form a rostrocaudal phase progression. This activity rhythm is imposed on the motor neurons by a central swim oscillator, of which four bilaterally symmetric pairs of interneurons present in each segmental ganglion appear to constitute the major component. These interneurons are linked intra- and intersegmentally via inhibitory connections to form a segmentally iterated and inter-segmentally concatenated cyclic neuronal network. The network appears to owe its oscillatory activity pattern to the mechanism of recurrent cyclic inhibition."
