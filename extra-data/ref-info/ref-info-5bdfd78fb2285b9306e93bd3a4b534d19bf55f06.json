Deep nets trained by simple back-propagation perform better than more shallow ones. Learning is surprisingly rapid. NORB is completely trained within five epochs.

ConvNets are biologically-inspired multi-stage architectures that automatically learn hierarchies of invariant features. While many popular vision approaches use hand-crafted features such as HOG or SIFT, ConvNets learn features at every level from data that are tuned to the task at hand. The traditional ConvNet architecture was modified by feeding 1st stage features in addition to 2nd stage features to the classifier. The system yielded the 2nd-best accuracy of 98.97% during phase I of the competition (the best entry obtained 98.98%), above the human performance of 98.81%, using 32\u00d732 color input images. Experiments conducted after phase 1 produced a new record of 99.17% by increasing the network capacity, and by using greyscale images instead of color. Interestingly, random features still yielded competitive results (97.33%)."

Automatic recognition of traffic signs is required in advanced driver assistance systems and constitutes a challenging real-world computer vision and pattern recognition problem. A comprehensive, lifelike dataset of more than 50,000 traffic sign images has been collected. It reflects the strong variations in visual appearance of signs due to distance, illumination, weather conditions, partial occlusions, and rotations. The images are complemented by several precomputed feature sets to allow for applying machine learning algorithms without background knowledge in image processing. The dataset comprises 43 classes with unbalanced class frequencies. Participants have to classify two test sets of more than 12,500 images each. Here, the results on the first of these sets, which was used in the first evaluation stage of the two-fold challenge, are reported. The methods employed by the participants who achieved the best results are briefly described and compared to human traffic sign recognition performance and baseline results."

However, the differences between those models makes a comparison of the properties of different aggregation functions hard. Our aim is to gain insight into different functions by directly comparing them on a fixed architecture for several common object recognition tasks. Empirical results show that a maximum pooling operation significantly outperforms subsampling operations. Despite their shift-invariant properties, overlapping pooling windows are no significant improvement over nonoverlapping pooling windows. By applying this knowledge, we achieve state-of-the-art error rates of 4.57% on the NORB normalized-uniform dataset and 5.6% on the NORB jittered-cluttered dataset."

Given an appropriate network architecture, gradient-based learning algorithms can be used to synthesize a complex decision surface that can classify high-dimensional patterns, such as handwritten characters, with minimal preprocessing. This paper reviews various methods applied to handwritten character recognition and compares them on a standard handwritten digit recognition task. Convolutional neural networks, which are specifically designed to deal with the variability of 2D shapes, are shown to outperform all other techniques. Real-life document recognition systems are composed of multiple modules including field extraction, segmentation recognition, and language modeling. A new learning paradigm, called graph transformer networks (GTN), allows such multimodule systems to be trained globally using gradient-based methods so as to minimize an overall performance measure. Two systems for online handwriting recognition are described. Experiments demonstrate the advantage of global training, and the flexibility of graph transformer networks. A graph transformer network for reading a bank cheque is also described. It uses convolutional neural network character recognizers combined with global training techniques to provide record accuracy on business and personal cheques. It is deployed commercially and reads several million cheques per day."

This paper describes a set of concrete bestpractices that document analysis researchers can use toget good results with neural networks. The mostimportant practice is getting a training set as large aspossible: we expand the training set by adding a newform of distorted data. The next most important practiceis that convolutional neural networks are better suited forvisual document tasks than fully connected networks. Wepropose that a simple \"do-it-yourself\" implementation ofconvolution with a flexible architecture is suitable formany visual document problems. This simpleconvolutional neural network does not require complexmethods, such as momentum, weight decay, structure-dependentlearning rates, averaging layers, tangent prop,or even finely-tuning the architecture. The end result is avery simple yet general architecture which can yieldstate-of-the-art performance for document analysis. Weillustrate our claims on the MNIST set of English digitimages."

In total, we received 25 systems submitted by eight groups. On the test datasets, the best results (correct rates) are 92.18% for offline character recognition, 95.77% for online character recognition, 77.26% for offline text recognition, and 94.33% for online text recognition, respectively.

As in the model of Serre, Wolf, and Poggio, we first apply Gabor filters at all positions and scales; feature complexity and position/scale invariance are then built up by alternating template matching and max pooling operations. We refine the approach in several biologically plausible ways. Sparsity is increased by constraining the number of feature inputs, lateral inhibition, and feature selection. We also demonstrate the value of retaining some position and scale information above the intermediate feature level. Our final model is competitive with current computer vision algorithms on several standard datasets, including the Caltech 101 object categories and the UIUC car localization task. The results further the case for biologically-motivated approaches to object classification."

In our approach, several neural networks are first selected based on which works best for each class in terms of minimizing classification errors. Then, they are linearly combined to form an ideal classifier that exploits the strengths of the individual classifiers. In this approach, the minimum classification error criterion is utilized to estimate the optimal linear weights. In this formulation, because the classification decision rule is incorporated into the cost function, a more suitable better combination of weights for the classification objective could be obtained. Experimental results using artificial and real data sets show that the proposed method can construct a better combined classifier that outperforms the best single classifier in terms of overall classification errors for test data."

This article considers the effects of including chromatic and stereo information. The inclusion of colour leads to features divided into separate red/green, blue/yellow, and bright/dark channels. Stereo image data, on the other hand, leads to binocular receptive fields which are tuned to various disparities. The similarities between these results and the observed properties of simple cells in the primary visual cortex are further evidence for the hypothesis that visual cortical neurons perform some type of redundancy reduction, which was one of the original motivations for ICA in the first place. In addition, ICA provides a principled method for feature extraction from colour and stereo images; such features could be used in image processing operations such as denoising and compression, as well as in pattern recognition."

Several fixed combining rules are used that depend on the output values of the base classifiers only. They are almost always suboptimal. Usually, however, training sets are available. They may be used to calibrate the base classifier outputs, as well as to build a trained combining classifier using these outputs as inputs. It depends on various circumstances whether this is useful, in particular whether the training set is used for the base classifiers as well and whether they are overtrained. We present an intuitive discussion on the use of trained combiners, relating the question of the choice of the combining classifier to a similar choice in the area of dissimilarity based pattern recognition. Some simple examples are used to illustrate the discussion."

                "text": "From the Book: \nThe idea for this book emerged as the two of us were organizing the 1996 Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS) workshop on recurrent networks. Many of the telephone calls between us turned to students and research. We both bemoaned the fact that we were handing large stacks of journal papers to our potential graduate students, in some cases, scaring them off to other advisors. Since we both were dealing with terminal masters students whom we would be lucky if they stuck around for a whole year, we needed introductory material that was self-contained, accessible, and devoid of distractions\u0097a book that a first-year graduate student, or upper-division undergrad, could read and become productive in a short period of time. Unfortunately, there were no such books available at that time. Hertz, Krogh, and Palmer\u0092s textbook serves well in getting students up to speed on back propagation, Hopfield networks, and Boltzmann machines. However, it did little justice to our research area, dynam-ical recurrent networks. Sometime before the workshop, we decided to fill this void. \nFrom the conception of this project, we both agreed that this book was not going to be yet another edited collection of papers. We wanted a coherent presentation of the field. One difficulty for students has been the arbitrary nomenclature and mathematical notation used to describe recurrent networks. Though not insurmountable, it does act as a speed bump, reducing the valuable time that they could be spending elsewhere. \nLike any other young field, we have several researchers with competing viewpoints. One problem with edited volumes is that the author of a chapter will have a biased view of the world. We decided to reduce this bias by assigning multiple authors to chapters. The goal of the assignments was to ensure a balanced presentation of the material, one that would be coming directly from the experts in that field. We also encouraged the authors to tie their chapters with other chapters in the book. Though difficult at times, it transforms the text from a collection of papers into a coherent book. \nThe book is organized into five sections. The first section presents the range of dynamical recurrent network (DRN) architectures that will be used in the book. With these architectures in hand, we turn to examine their capabilities as computational devices. The third section presents several training algorithms for solving the network loading problem. Next, we look back and temper our enthusiasm by acknowledging the limitations of DRNs. The final section deals with applications of recurrent networks. \nThe material in this book assumes a basic understanding of neural networks. The reader, we assume, has read an introductory textbook covering multilayered perceptrons and back-propagation. As such, this book would be ideal for a second course in neural networks."

The network is self-organized by \u201clearning without a teacher\u201d, and acquires an ability to recognize stimulus patterns based on the geometrical similarity (Gestalt) of their shapes without affected by their positions. This network is given a nickname \u201cneocognitron\u201d. After completion of self-organization, the network has a structure similar to the hierarchy model of the visual nervous system proposed by Hubel and Wiesel. The network consits of an input layer (photoreceptor array) followed by a cascade connection of a number of modular structures, each of which is composed of two layers of cells connected in a cascade. The first layer of each module consists of \u201cS-cells\u201d, which show characteristics similar to simple cells or lower order hypercomplex cells, and the second layer consists of \u201cC-cells\u201d similar to complex cells or higher order hypercomplex cells. The afferent synapses to each S-cell have plasticity and are modifiable. The network has an ability of unsupervised learning: We do not need any \u201cteacher\u201d during the process of self-organization, and it is only needed to present a set of stimulus patterns repeatedly to the input layer of the network. The network has been simulated on a digital computer. After repetitive presentation of a set of stimulus patterns, each stimulus pattern has become to elicit an output only from one of the C-cell of the last layer, and conversely, this C-cell has become selectively responsive only to that stimulus pattern. That is, none of the C-cells of the last layer responds to more than one stimulus pattern. The response of the C-cells of the last layer is not affected by the pattern's position at all. Neither is it affected by a small change in shape nor in size of the stimulus pattern."

Typically, only one of the trained networks is selected as \"best\" and the rest are discarded. The authors propose using optimal linear combinations (OLC's) of the corresponding outputs on a set of NN's as an alternative to using a single network. Modeling accuracy is measured by mean squared error (MSE) with respect to the distribution of random inputs. Optimality is defined by minimizing the MSE, with the resultant combination referred to as MSE-OLC. The authors formulate the MSE-OLC problem for trained NN's and derive two closed-form expressions for the optimal combination-weights. An example that illustrates significant improvement in model accuracy as a result of using MSE-OLC's of the trained networks is included."

We describe a new hierarchical model consistent with physiological data from inferotemporal cortex that accounts for this complex visual task and makes testable predictions.

It would be astonishing if such a structure did not profoundly modify the response patterns of fibres coming into it. In the cat's visual cortex, the receptive field arrangements of single cells suggest that there is indeed a degree of complexity far exceeding anything yet seen at lower levels in the visual system. In a previous paper we described receptive fields of single cortical cells, observing responses to spots of light shone on one or both retinas (Hubel & Wiesel, 1959). In the present work this method is used to examine receptive fields of a more complex type (Part I) and to make additional observations on binocular interaction (Part II). This approach is necessary in order to understand the behaviour of individual cells, but it fails to deal with the problem of the relationship of one cell to its neighbours. In the past, the technique of recording evoked slow waves has been used with great success in studies of functional anatomy. It was employed by Talbot & Marshall (1941) and by Thompson, Woolsey & Talbot (1950) for mapping out the visual cortex in the rabbit, cat, and monkey. Daniel & Whitteiidge (1959) have recently extended this work in the primate. Most of our present knowledge of retinotopic projections, binocular overlap, and the second visual area is based on these investigations. Yet the method of evoked potentials is valuable mainly for detecting behaviour common to large populations of neighbouring cells; it cannot differentiate functionally between areas of cortex smaller than about 1 mm2. To overcome this difficulty a method has in recent years been developed for studying cells separately or in small groups during long micro-electrode penetrations through nervous tissue. Responses are correlated with cell location by reconstructing the electrode tracks from histological material. These techniques have been applied to"

                "text": "In the central nervous system the visual pathway from retina to striate cortex provides an opportunity to observe and compare single unit responses at several distinct levels. Patterns of light stimuli most effective in influencing units at one level may no longer be the most effective at the next. From differences in responses at successive stages in the pathway one may hope to gain some understanding of the part each stage plays in visual perception. By shining small spots of light on the light-adapted cat retina Kuffler (1953) showed that ganglion cells have concentric receptive fields, with an 'on' centre and an 'off ' periphery, or vice versa. The 'on' and 'off' areas within a receptive field were found to be mutually antagonistic, and a spot restricted to the centre of the field was more effective than one covering the whole receptive field (Barlow, FitzHugh & Kuffler, 1957). In the freely moving lightadapted cat it was found that the great majority of cortical cells studied gave little or no response to light stimuli covering most of the animal's visual field, whereas small spots shone in a restricted retinal region often evoked brisk responses (Hubel, 1959). A moving spot of light often produced stronger responses than a stationary one, and sometimes a moving spot gave more activation for one direction than for the opposite. The present investigation, made in acute preparations, includes a study of receptive fields of cells in the cat's striate cortex. Receptive fields of the cells considered in this paper were divided into separate excitatory and inhibitory ('on' and 'off') areas. In this respect they resembled retinal ganglion-cell receptive fields. However, the shape and arrangement of excitatory and inhibitory areas differed strikingly from the concentric pattern found in retinal ganglion cells. An attempt was made to correlate responses to moving stimuli"

                "text": "the selection of symmetric factorial designs, that is, a design where all factors have the same number of levels. Chapter 3 focuses on selection of two-level factorial designs and discusses complementary design theory and related topics in the selection of designs. Chapter 4 covers the selection of three level designs followed by the general case of s-levels. Chapter 5 discusses estimation capacity, presenting the connections with complementary designs followed by the estimation capacity for two-level and s-level designs. Chapter 6 discusses and presents results for the construction of mixed-level designs. Giving many examples of the use of mixed two and four-level designs. The final unit of the book discusses designs where there are two-different groups of factors. Chapters 7 and 8 discuss factorial designs with restricted randomization. Focusing first on blocked designs for full factorials as well as blocked fractional factorial designs. Chapter 8 focuses on split-plot designs. The booked is concluded with a chapter on robust parameter designs. This book covers a broad range of topics for regular factorial designs and presents all of the material in very mathematical fashion. However, the authors do a wonderful job of keeping the statistical methodology at the forefront of the book and the mathematical detail is presented as the necessary tool to study these designs. The book will serve as a great text for an advanced graduate level course in design theory for students with the necessary mathematical background. The book will surely become an invaluable resource for researchers and graduate students doing research in the design of factorial experiments. In addition, practitioners will also find the book useful for the comprehensive collection of optimal designs presented at the end of many chapters. Overall, this is a very well written book and a necessary addition to the existing literature on the design of factorial experiments."

This year, 10 groups submitted 27 systems for five tasks: classification on extracted features, online/offline isolated character recognition, online/offline handwritten text recognition. The best results (correct rates) are 93.89% for classification on extracted features, 94.77% for offline character recognition, 97.39% for online character recognition, 88.76% for offline text recognition, and 95.03% for online text recognition, respectively.
