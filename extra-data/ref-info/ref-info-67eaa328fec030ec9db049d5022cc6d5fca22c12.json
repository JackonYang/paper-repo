The features we propose are acoustic detectors for discriminatively determined multi-phone units. The multi-phone units are found by computing the mutual information between the phonetic subsequences that occur in the training lexicon, and the word labels. This quantity is a function of an error model governing our ability to detect phone sequences accurately (an otherwise informative sequence which cannot be reliably detected is not so useful). We show how to compute this mutual information quantity under a class of error models efficiently, in one pass over the data, for all phonetic sub-sequences in the training data. After this computation, detectors are created for a subset of highly informative units. We then define two novel classes of features based on these units: associative and transductive. Incorporating these features in a maximum entropy based direct model for Voice-Search outperforms the baseline by 24% in sentence error rate."

The flat model allows us to model arbitrary attributes and dependences of the output. This is different from the HMMs typically used for speech recognition. This conventional modeling approach is based on sequential data and makes rigid assumptions on the dependences. HMMs have proven to be convenient and appropriate for large vocabulary continuous speech recognition. Our task under consideration, however, is the Windows Live Search for Mobile (WLS4M) task [1]. This is a cellphone application that allows users to interact with web-based information portals. In particular, the set of valid outputs can be considered discrete and finite (although probably large, i.e., unseen events are an issue). Hence, a flat direct model lends itself to this task, making the adding of different knowledge sources and dependences straightforward and cheap. Using e.g. HMM posterior, m-gram, and spotter features, significant improvements over the conventional HMM system were observed."

Typified by Maximum Mutual Information training, these methods assume a fixed statistical modeling structure, and then optimize only the associated numerical parameters (such as means, variances, and transition matrices). In this paper, we explore the significantly different methodology of discriminative structure learning. Here, the fundamental dependency relationships between random variables in a probabilistic model are learned in a discriminative fashion, and are learned separately from the numerical parameters. Tn order to apply the principles of structural discriminability, we adopt the framework of graphical models, which allows an arbitrary set of variables with arbitrary conditional independence relationships to be modeled at each time frame. We present results using a new graphical modeling toolkit (described in a companion paper) from the recent 2001 Johns Hopkins Summer Workshop. These results indicate that significant gains result from discriminative structural analysis of both conventional MFCC and novel AM-FM features on the Aurora continuous digits task."

Hidden state sequences are critical for modeling the non-stationarity of speech signals. We show that HCRFs can easily be trained using the simple direct optimization technique of stochastic gradient descent. We present the results on the TIMIT phone classification task and show that HCRFs outperforms comparable ML and CML/MMI trained HMMs. In fact, HCRF results on this task are the best single classifier results known to us. We note that the HCRF framework is easily extensible to recognition since it is a state and label sequence modeling technique. We also note that HCRFs have the ability to handle complex features without any change in training procedure."

Intuitively, a semi-CRF on an input sequence x outputs a \"segmentation\" of x, in which labels are assigned to segments (i.e., subsequences) of x rather than to individual elements xi of x. Importantly, features for semi-CRFs can measure properties of segments, and transitions within a segment can be non-Markovian. In spite of this additional power, exact learning and inference algorithms for semi-CRFs are polynomial-time\u2014often only a small constant factor slower than conventional CRFs. In experiments on five named entity recognition problems, semi-CRFs generally outperform conventional CRFs."

Conditional random fields offer several advantages over hidden Markov models and stochastic grammars for such tasks, including the ability to relax strong independence assumptions made in those models. Conditional random fields also avoid a fundamental limitation of maximum entropy Markov models (MEMMs) and other discriminative Markov models based on directed graphical models, which can be biased towards states with few successor states. We present iterative parameter estimation algorithms for conditional random fields and compare the performance of the resulting models to HMMs and MEMMs on synthetic and natural-language data."
