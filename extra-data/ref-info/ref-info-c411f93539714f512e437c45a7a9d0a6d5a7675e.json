We systematically studied the features of: histograms in the Ohta color space; multiresolution, simultaneous autoregressive model parameters; and coefficients of a shift-invariant DCT. We demonstrate that performance is improved by computing features on subblocks, classifying these subblocks, and then combining these results in a way reminiscent of stacking. State of the art single-feature methods are shown to result in about 75-86% performance, while the new method results in 90.3% correct classification, when evaluated on a diverse database of over 1300 consumer images provided by Kodak."

The results of this measure are compared with humans analyzing seven \"teaser\" images to test its effectiveness for finding perceptually dominant orientations. The use of low-level orientation is then applied to a \"quick search\" problem important in image database applications. Since both pigeons and humans are able to perform coarse classification of certain kinds of scenes, e.g., city from country, without taking time or brain-power to solve the image understanding problem, the authors conjecture that the collective behavior of low-level textural features such as orientation may be doing most of the work. The authors demonstrate a simple test of global multiscale orientation for quickly searching a database of vacation photos for likely \"city/suburb\" shots. The orientation features achieve agreement with human classification in 91 out of 98 of the scenes."

Users prefer to ask for pictures using notions of content that are strongly oriented to the presence of abstractly defined objects. Computer programs that implement these queries automatically are desirable, but are hard to build because conventional object recognition techniques from computer vision cannot recognize very general objects in very general contexts. This paper describes our approach to object recognition, which is structured around a sequence of increasingly specialized grouping activities that assemble coherent regions of image that can be shown to satisfy increasingly stringent constraints. The constraints that are satisfied provide a form of object classification in quite general contexts. This view of recognition is distinguished by: far richer involvement of early visual primitives, including color and texture; hierarchical grouping and learning strategies in the classification process; the ability to deal with rather general objects in uncontrolled configurations and contexts. We illustrate these properties with four case-studies: one demonstrating the use of color and texture descriptors; one showing how trees can be described by fusing texture and geometric properties; one learning scenery concepts using grouped features; and one showing how this view of recognition yields a program that can tell, quite accurately, whether a picture contains naked people or not."

However, color histograms lack spatial information, so images with very different appearances can have similar histograms. For example, a picture of fall foliage might contain a large number of scattered red pixels; this could have a similar color histogram to a picture with a single large red object. We describe a histogram-based method for comparing images that incorporates spatial information. We classify each pixel in a given color bucket as either coherent or incoherent, based on whether or not it is part of a large similarly-colored region. A color coherence vector (CCV) stores the number of coherent versus incoherent pixels with each color. By separating coherent pixels from incoherent pixels, CCV\u2019s provide finer distinctions than color histograms. CCV\u2019s can be computed at over 5 images per second on a standard workstation. A database with 15,000 images can be queried for the images with the most similar CCV\u2019s in under 2 seconds. We show that CCV\u2019s can give superior results to color his\u2217To whom correspondence should be addressed tograms for image retrieval."

We present here an implementation of NeTra, a prototype image retrieval system that uses color, texture, shape and spatial location information in segmented image regions to search and retrieve similar regions from the database. A distinguishing aspect of this system is its incorporation of a robust automated image segmentation algorithm that allows object- or region-based search. Image segmentation significantly improves the quality of image retrieval when images contain multiple complex objects. Images are segmented into homogeneous regions at the time of ingest into the database, and image attributes that represent each of these regions are computed. In addition to image segmentation, other important components of the system include an efficient color representation, and indexing of color, texture, and shape features for fast search and retrieval. This representation allows the user to compose interesting queries such as \u201cretrieve all images that contain regions that have the color of object A, texture of object B, shape of object C, and lie in the upper of the image\u201d, where the individual objects could be regions belonging to different images. A Java-based web implementation of NeTra is available at http://vivaldi.ece.ucsb.edu/Netra."

We propose a new image database retrieval method based on shape information. This system achieves both the desired efficiency and accuracy using a two-stage hierarchy: in the first stage, simple and easily computable statistical shape features are used to quickly browse through the database to generate a moderate number of plausible retrievals; in the second stage, the outputs from the first stage are screened using a deformable template matching process to discard spurious matches. We have tested the algorithm using hand drawn queries on a trademark database containing 1,100 images. Each retrieval takes a reasonable amount of computation time. The top most retrieved image from the system agrees with that obtained by human subjects, but there are significant differences between the top 10 retrieved images by our system and that provided by human subjects. This demonstrates the need for developing shape features that are better able to capture human perceptual similarity of shapes."

This paper presents our initial work in developing an efficient indexing scheme using artificial neural network, which focuses on eliminating unlikely candidates rather than pin-pointing the targets directly.

Recent works in video parsing provide a foundation for building interactive and content based video browsing systems. In this paper, a generalized top-down hierarchial clustering process, which adopts partition clustering recursively at each level of the hierarchy, is studied and used to build hierarchical views of video shots. With the clustering processes, when a list of video programs or clips is provided, a browsing system can use either key-frame and/or shot features to cluster shots into classes, each of which consists of shots of similar content. After such clustering, each class of shots can be represented by an icon, which can then be displayed at the high levels of a hierarchical browser. As a result, users can know roughly the content of video shots even without moving down to a lower level of the hierarchy."

The uniqueness and effectiveness of this solution lies in its use of video content information provided by a parsing process driven by visual feature analysis. More specifically, parsing will temporally segment and abstract a video source, based on low-level image analyses; then retrieval and browsing of video will be based on key-frames selected during abstraction and spatial-temporal variations of visual features, as well as some shot-level semantics derived from camera operation and motion analysis. These processes, as well as video retrieval and browsing tools, are presented in detail as functions of an integrated system. Also, experimental results on automatic key-frame detection are given."

To address the challenges in building an effective multimedia database system, we have built the Multimedia Analysis and Retrieval System (MARS) prototype. This paper summarises the retrieval subsystem of MARS and its support for content-based queries over image features. Content-based retrieval techniques have been extensively studied for textual documents in the area of automatic information retrieval. Our objective in MARS is to exploit these existing techniques for content-based retrieval over images and multimedia databases."

A fundamental theorem is established to relate such moment invariants to the well-known algebraic invariants. Complete systems of moment invariants under translation, similitude and orthogonal transformations are derived. Some moment invariants under general two-dimensional linear transformations are also included. Both theoretical formulation and practical models of visual pattern recognition based upon these moment invariants are discussed. A simple simulation program together with its performance are also presented. It is shown that recognition of geometrical patterns and alphabetical characters independently of position, size and orientation can be accomplished. It is also indicated that generalization is possible to include invariance with parallel projection."

This places new demands on the indexing and retrieval tools required. The Virage Video Engine (VVE) with the default set of primitives provide the necessary frame work and basic tools for video content based retrieval. The video engine is a flexible platform independent architecture which provides support for processing multiple synchronized data streams like image sequences, audio and closed captions. The architecture allows for multi-modal indexing and retrieval of video through the use of media specific primitives. This paper presents the use of the VVE framework for content based video retrieval."
