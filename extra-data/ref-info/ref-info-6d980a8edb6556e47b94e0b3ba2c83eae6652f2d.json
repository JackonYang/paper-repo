The discussed recognition process differs significantly from existing approaches as it realizes a bottom-up clustering of given word segments, whereas conventional table structure recognizers all rely on the detection of some separators such as delineation or significant white space to analyze a page from the top-down. The following analysis of the recognized layout elements is based on the construction of a tile structure and detects row- and/or column spanning cells as well as sparse tables with a high degree of confidence. \n \nThe overall system is completely domain independent, optionally neglects textual contents and can thus be applied to arbitrary mixed-mode documents (with or without tables) of any language and even operates on low quality OCR documents (e.g. facsimiles)."

Shih 2009-03-23 In the development of digital multimedia, the importance and impact of image processing and mathematical morphology are well documented in areas ranging from automated vision detection and inspection to object recognition, image analysis and pattern recognition. Those working in these ever-evolving fields require a solid grasp of basic fundamentals, theory, and related applications\u2014and few books can provide the unique tools for learning contained in this text. Image Processing and Mathematical Morphology: Fundamentals and Applications is a comprehensive, wide-ranging overview of morphological mechanisms and techniques and their relation to image processing. More than merely a tutorial on vital technical information, the book places this knowledge into a theoretical framework. This helps readers analyze key principles and architectures and then use the author\u2019s novel ideas on implementation of advanced algorithms to formulate a practical and detailed plan to develop and foster their own ideas. The book: Presents the history and state-of-the-art techniques related to image morphological processing, with numerous practical examples Gives readers a clear tutorial on complex technology and other tools that rely on their intuition for a clear understanding of the subject Includes an updated bibliography and useful graphs and illustrations Examines several new algorithms in great detail so that readers can adapt them to derive their own solution approaches This invaluable reference helps readers assess and simplify problems and their essential requirements and complexities, giving them all the necessary data and methodology to master current theoretical developments and applications, as well as create new ones."

The paper presents a method called Box Driven Reasoning (BDR) to robustly analyze the structure of table form documents which include touching characters and broken lines. Most previous methods employ a line oriented approach. Real documents are copied repeatedly and overlaid with printed data, resulting in characters which touch cells and lines which are broken. BDR deals with regions directly, in contrast with other previous methods. Experimental tests show that BDR reliably recognizes cells and strings in document images with touching characters and broken lines."

While techniques for evaluating the performance of lower-level document analysis tasks such as optical character recognition have gained acceptance in the literature, attempts to formalize the problem for higher-level algorithms, while receiving a fair amount of attention in terms of theory, have generally been less successful in practice, perhaps owing to their complexity. In this paper, we introduce intuitive, easy-to-implement evaluation schemes for the related problems of table detection and table structure recognition. We also present the results of several small experiments, demonstrating how well the methodologies work and the useful sorts of feedback they provide. We first consider the table detection problem. Here algorithms can yield various classes of errors, including non-table regions improperly labeled as tables (insertion errors), tables missed completely (deletion errors), larger tables broken into a number of smaller ones (splitting errors), and groups of smaller tables combined to form larger ones (merging errors). This leads naturally to the use of an edit distance approach for assessing the results of table detection. Next we address the problem of evaluating table structure recognition. Our model is based on a directed acyclic attribute graph, or table DAG. We describe a new paradigm, \u201cgraph probing,\u201d for comparing the results returned by the recognition system and the representation created during ground-truthing. Probing is in fact a general concept that could be applied to other document recognition tasks as well."

                "text": "In this paper, we describe experimental methods of recognizing the document structures of various types of documents in the framework of document understanding. Namely, we interpret document structures with individually characterized document knowledge. The document understanding process is divided into three procedures: the first is the recognition of document structures from a two-dimensional point of view; the second is the recognition of item relationships from a one-dimensional point of view; and the third is the recognition of characters from a zero-dimensional point of view. The procedure for recognizing structures plays the most important role in document understanding. This procedure extracts and classifies the logical item blocks from paper-based documents distinctly.We discuss the structure recognition methods for three classes of documents: 1) table-form documents, filled-in forms, cataloging lists, etc. \u2014 each item block is surrounded by horizontal and vertical line segments; 2) library cataloging cards, name cards, letters, etc. \u2014 each item block is separated by spaces; 3) newspapers, pamphlets, etc. \u2014 each item block is constructed hierarchically and by combining under roughly specified layouts. The structure recognition procedure is characterized by individual recognition methods: in class 1 documents, binary trees indicating the connective relationships among neighboring item blocks, which are surrounded by line segments; in class 2 documents, binary trees defining the spatial and geometric relationships among neighboring item blocks, which are separated by spaces; and in class 3 documents, composition rules specifying the constructive relationships among neighboring item blocks, which are represented by adjacent relationship graphs. The methods are effective under the knowledge-based frame-work and are integrated complementarily from the top-down (model-driven) and bottom-up (data-driven) approaches. Of course, the integration means vary according to document classes."

An optimal threshold is selected by the discriminant criterion, namely, so as to maximize the separability of the resultant classes in gray levels. The procedure is very simple, utilizing only the zerothand the first-order cumulative moments of the gray-level histogram. It is straightforward to extend the method to multithreshold problems. Several experimental results are also presented to support the validity of the method."

We therefore propose a new generic document recognition method, called DMOS (Description and MOdification of Segmentation), that is made up of a new grammatical formalism, called EPF (Enhanced Position Formalism) and an associated parser which is able to introduce context in segmentation. We implement this method to obtain a generator of document recognition systems. This generator can automatically produce new recognition systems. It is only necessary to describe the document with an EPF grammar, which is then simply compiled. In this way, we have developed various recognition systems: one on musical scores, one on mathematical formulae and one on recursive table structures. We have also defined a specific application to damaged military forms of the 19th Century. We have been able to test the generated system on 5,000 of these military forms. This has permitted us to validate the DMOS method on a real-world application."
