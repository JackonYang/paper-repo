The potential benefit from this source is made more significant due to the enormous amount of language data easily available today. We present a system to automatically generate natural language descriptions from images that exploits both statistics gleaned from parsing large quantities of text data and recognition algorithms from computer vision. The system is very effective at producing relevant sentences for images. It also generates descriptions that are notably more true to the specific image content than previous work."

Doing so allows us not only to name familiar objects, but also: to report unusual aspects of a familiar object (\u201cspotty dog\u201d, not just \u201cdog\u201d); to say something about unfamiliar objects (\u201chairy and four-legged\u201d, not just \u201cunknown\u201d); and to learn how to recognize new objects with few or no visual examples. Rather than focusing on identity assignment, we make inferring attributes the core problem of recognition. These attributes can be semantic (\u201cspotty\u201d) or discriminative (\u201cdogs have it but sheep do not\u201d). Learning attributes presents a major new challenge: generalization across object categories, not just across instances within a category. In this paper, we also introduce a novel feature selection method for learning attributes that generalize well across categories. We support our claims by thorough evaluation that provides insights into the limitations of the standard recognition paradigm of naming and demonstrates the new abilities provided by our attribute-based framework."

                "text": "In this paper, we present an image parsing to text description (I2T) framework that generates text descriptions of image and video content based on image understanding. The proposed I2T framework follows three steps: 1) input images (or video frames) are decomposed into their constituent visual patterns by an image parsing engine, in a spirit similar to parsing sentences in natural language; 2) the image parsing results are converted into semantic representation in the form of Web ontology language (OWL), which enables seamless integration with general knowledge bases; and 3) a text generation engine converts the results from previous steps into semantically meaningful, human readable, and query-able text reports. The centerpiece of the I2T framework is an and-or graph (AoG) visual knowledge representation, which provides a graphical representation serving as prior knowledge for representing diverse visual patterns and provides top-down hypotheses during the image parsing. The AoG embodies vocabularies of visual elements including primitives, parts, objects, scenes as well as a stochastic image grammar that specifies syntactic relations (i.e., compositional) and semantic relations (e.g., categorical, spatial, temporal, and functional) between these visual elements. Therefore, the AoG is a unified model of both categorical and symbolic representations of visual knowledge. The proposed I2T framework has two objectives. First, we use semiautomatic method to parse images from the Internet in order to build an AoG for visual knowledge representation. Our goal is to make the parsing process more and more automatic using the learned AoG model. Second, we use automatic methods to parse image/video in specific domains and generate text reports that are useful for real-world applications. In the case studies at the end of this paper, we demonstrate two automatic I2T systems: a maritime and urban scene video surveillance system and a real-time automatic driving scene understanding system."

The model that we employ does not presuppose prior recognition or tracking of 3D object pose, shape, or identity. We describe our general framework for using maximum-likelihood techniques for visual event classification, the details of the generative model that we use to characterise observations as instances of event types, and the implemented computational techniques used to support training and classification for this generative model. We conclude by illustrating the operation of our implementation on a small example."

We formulate the problem in a multiple instance learning (MIL) framework, based on multiple feature channels.

Our experiments over the large YouTube dataset show that scene and object information can be used to complement person features for human action recognition."

These concepts are manipulated routinely in almost every waking hour of most people's lives. They are largely acquired in infancy and they are intersubjectively shared among members of the speech community. It is hard to imagine such elaborate and variable representation systems not having a substantial role to play in ordinary cognition, and yet the language-and-thought question continues to be a contested one across the various disciplines and sub-disciplines of cognitive science. This article provides an overview from the vantage point of linguistic semantics.

This challenging but important subject has mostly been ignored in the past due to several problems one of which is the lack of realistic and annotated video datasets. Our first contribution is to address this limitation and to investigate the use of movie scripts for automatic annotation of human actions in videos. We evaluate alternative methods for action retrieval from scripts and show benefits of a text-based classifier. Using the retrieved action samples for visual learning, we next turn to the problem of action classification in video. We present a new method for video classification that builds upon and extends several recent ideas including local space-time features, space-time pyramids and multi-channel non-linear SVMs. The method is shown to improve state-of-the-art results on the standard KTH action dataset by achieving 91.8% accuracy. Given the inherent problem of noisy labels in automatic annotation, we particularly investigate and show high tolerance of our method to annotation errors in the training set. We finally apply the method to learning and classifying challenging action classes in movies and show promising results."

Such unconstrained videos are abundant in personal collections as well as on the Web. Recognizing action from such videos has not been addressed extensively, primarily due to the tremendous variations that result from camera motion, background clutter, changes in object appearance, and scale, etc. The main challenge is how to extract reliable and informative features from the unconstrained videos. We extract both motion and static features from the videos. Since the raw features of both types are dense yet noisy, we propose strategies to prune these features. We use motion statistics to acquire stable motion features and clean static features. Furthermore, PageRank is used to mine the most informative static features. In order to further construct compact yet discriminative visual vocabularies, a divisive information-theoretic algorithm is employed to group semantically related features. Finally, AdaBoost is chosen to integrate all the heterogeneous yet complementary features for recognition. We have tested the framework on the KTH dataset and our own dataset consisting of 11 categories of actions collected from YouTube and personal videos, and have obtained impressive results for action recognition and action localization."

We present a new motion representation scheme in which motion in a video is represented by the responses of frames to a set of motion filters. Each of these filters is designed to be most responsive to a type of dominant motion. Then we employ hidden Markov models (HMMs) to characterize the motion patterns based on these features and thus classify basketball video into 16 events. The evaluation by human satisfaction rate to classification result is 75%, demonstrating effectiveness of the proposed approach to recognizing semantic events in video."

                "text": "Imagine a video taken on a sunny beach, can a computer automatically tell what is happening in the scene? Can it identify different human activities in the video, such as water surfing, people walking and lying on the beach? To automatically classify or localize different actions in video sequences is very useful for a variety of tasks, such as video surveillance, objectlevel video summarization, video indexing, digital library organization, etc. However, it remains a challenging task for computers to achieve robust action recognition due to cluttered background, camera motion, occlusion, and geometric and photometric variances of objects. For example, in a live video of a skating competition, the skater moves rapidly across the rink, and the camera also moves to follow the skater. With moving camera, non-stationary background, and moving target, few vision algorithms could identify, categorize and localize such motions well. In addition, the challenge is even greater when there are multiple activities in a complex video sequence (Figure 1). We present a video demo for our novel unsupervised learning method for human action categories [1]. A video sequence is represented as a collection of spatial-temporal words by extracting space-time interest points. The algorithm learns the probability distributions of the spatial-temporal words and intermediate topics corresponding to human action categories automatically using a probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (pLSA) model [4]. The learned model is then used for human action categorization and localization in a novel video, by maximizing the posterior of action category (topic) distributions. The contributions of this work are as follows: \u2022 Unsupervised learning of actions using \u2018video words\u2019 representation. We deploy a pLSA model with \u2018bag of video words\u2019 representation for video analysis; \u2022 Multiple action localization and categorization. Our approach is not only able to classify different actions, but also to localize different actions simultaneously in a novel and complex video sequence."

Video sequences are represented by a novel \"bag-of-words\" representation, where each frame corresponds to a \"word\". Our models differ from previous latent topic models for visual recognition in two major aspects: first of all, the latent topics in our models directly correspond to class labels; second, some of the latent variables in previous topic models become observed in our case. Our models have several advantages over other latent topic models used in visual recognition. First of all, the training is much easier due to the decoupling of the model parameters. Second, it alleviates the issue of how to choose the appropriate number of latent topics. Third, it achieves much better performance by utilizing the information provided by the class labels in the training set. We present action classification results on five different data sets. Our results are either comparable to, or significantly better than previously published results on these data sets."

In this paper, we demonstrate how such features can be used for recognizing complex motion patterns. We construct video representations in terms of local space-time features and integrate such representations with SVM classification schemes for recognition. For the purpose of evaluation we introduce a new video database containing 2391 sequences of six human actions performed by 25 people in four different scenarios. The presented results of action recognition justify the proposed method and demonstrate its advantage compared to other relative approaches for action recognition."

A video sequence is represented as a collection of spatial-temporal words by extracting space-time interest points. The algorithm automatically learns the probability distributions of the spatial-temporal words and the intermediate topics corresponding to human action categories. This is achieved by using latent topic models such as the probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (pLSA) model and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). Our approach can handle noisy feature points arisen from dynamic background and moving cameras due to the application of the probabilistic models. Given a novel video sequence, the algorithm can categorize and localize the human action(s) contained in the video. We test our algorithm on three challenging datasets: the KTH human motion dataset, the Weizmann human action dataset, and a recent dataset of figure skating actions. Our results reflect the promise of such a simple approach. In addition, our algorithm can recognize and localize multiple actions in long and complex video sequences containing multiple motions."

                "text": "Video semantic analysis is essential in video indexing and structuring. However, due to the lack of robust and generic algorithms, most of the existing works on semantic analysis are limited to specific domains. In this paper, we present a novel hidden Markove model (HMM)-based framework as a general solution to video semantic analysis. In the proposed framework, semantics in different granularities are mapped to a hierarchical model space, which is composed of detectors and connectors. In this manner, our model decomposes a complex analysis problem into simpler subproblems during the training process and automatically integrates those subproblems for recognition. The proposed framework is not only suitable for a broad range of applications, but also capable of modeling semantics in different semantic granularities. Additionally, we also present a new motion representation scheme, which is robust to different motion vector sources. The applications of the proposed framework in basketball event detection, soccer shot classification, and volleyball sequence analysis have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed framework on video semantic analysis."

We regard human actions as three-dimensional shapes induced by the silhouettes in the space-time volume. We adopt a recent approach by Gorelick et al. (2004) for analyzing 2D shapes and generalize it to deal with volumetric space-time action shapes. Our method utilizes properties of the solution to the Poisson equation to extract space-time features such as local space-time saliency, action dynamics, shape structure and orientation. We show that these features are useful for action recognition, detection and clustering. The method is fast, does not require video alignment and is applicable in (but not limited to) many scenarios where the background is known. Moreover, we demonstrate the robustness of our method to partial occlusions, non-rigid deformations, significant changes in scale and viewpoint, high irregularities in the performance of an action and low quality video"

Recognition in this framework is the succession of very general low level grouping mechanisms to increased specific and learned model based grouping techniques at higher levels. Hard decision thresholds are delayed and resolved by higher level statistical models and temporal context. Low-level primitives are areas of coherent motion found by EM clustering, mid-level categories are simple movements represented by dynamical systems, and high-level complex gestures are represented by Hidden Markov Models as successive phases of ample movements. We show how such a representation can be learned from training data, and apply It to the example of human gait recognition."

We focus primarily on the case of star-structured models and show how a simple algorithm based on partial hypothesis pruning can speed up object detection by more than one order of magnitude without sacrificing detection accuracy. In our algorithm, partial hypotheses are pruned with a sequence of thresholds. In analogy to probably approximately correct (PAC) learning, we introduce the notion of probably approximately admissible (PAA) thresholds. Such thresholds provide theoretical guarantees on the performance of the cascade method and can be computed from a small sample of positive examples. Finally, we outline a cascade detection algorithm for a general class of models defined by a grammar formalism. This class includes not only tree-structured pictorial structures but also richer models that can represent each part recursively as a mixture of other parts."

Our system is able to represent highly variable object classes and achieves state-of-the-art results in the PASCAL object detection challenges. While deformable part models have become quite popular, their value had not been demonstrated on difficult benchmarks such as the PASCAL data sets. Our system relies on new methods for discriminative training with partially labeled data. We combine a margin-sensitive approach for data-mining hard negative examples with a formalism we call latent SVM. A latent SVM is a reformulation of MI--SVM in terms of latent variables. A latent SVM is semiconvex, and the training problem becomes convex once latent information is specified for the positive examples. This leads to an iterative training algorithm that alternates between fixing latent values for positive examples and optimizing the latent SVM objective function."

People detectors have been shown to be able to locate pedestrians even in complex street scenes, but false positives have remained frequent. The identification of particular individuals has remained challenging as well. Tracking methods are able to find a particular individual in image sequences, but are severely challenged by real-world scenarios such as crowded street scenes. In this paper, we combine the advantages of both detection and tracking in a single framework. The approximate articulation of each person is detected in every frame based on local features that model the appearance of individual body parts. Prior knowledge on possible articulations and temporal coherency within a walking cycle are modeled using a hierarchical Gaussian process latent variable model (hGPLVM). We show how the combination of these results improves hypotheses for position and articulation of each person in several subsequent frames. We present experimental results that demonstrate how this allows to detect and track multiple people in cluttered scenes with reoccurring occlusions."

Our approach is based on a maximum average correlation height (MACH) filter. A common limitation of template-based methods is their inability to generate a single template using a collection of examples. MACH is capable of capturing intra-class variability by synthesizing a single Action MACH filter for a given action class. We generalize the traditional MACH filter to video (3D spatiotemporal volume), and vector valued data. By analyzing the response of the filter in the frequency domain, we avoid the high computational cost commonly incurred in template-based approaches. Vector valued data is analyzed using the Clifford Fourier transform, a generalization of the Fourier transform intended for both scalar and vector-valued data. Finally, we perform an extensive set of experiments and compare our method with some of the most recent approaches in the field by using publicly available datasets, and two new annotated human action datasets which include actions performed in classic feature films and sports broadcast television."

We describe a general, flexible mixture model for capturing contextual co-occurrence relations between parts, augmenting standard spring models that encode spatial relations. We show that such relations can capture notions of local rigidity. When co-occurrence and spatial relations are tree-structured, our model can be efficiently optimized with dynamic programming. We present experimental results on standard benchmarks for pose estimation that indicate our approach is the state-of-the-art system for pose estimation, outperforming past work by 50% while being orders of magnitude faster."

                "text": "As Grice\u2019s enthusiasm for ordinary language philosophy became increasingly qualified during the 1950s, his interest was growing in the rather different styles of philosophy of language then current in America. Recent improvements in communications had made possible an exchange of ideas across the Atlantic that would have been unthinkable before the war. W. V. O. Quine had made a considerable impression at Oxford during his time as Eastman Professor. Grice was interested in Quine\u2019s logical approach to language, although he differed from him over certain specific questions, such as the viability of the distinction between analytic and synthetic statements. Quine, who was visiting England for a whole year, and who brought with him clothes, books and even provisions in the knowledge that rationing was still in force, travelled by ship.1 However, during the same decade the rapid proliferation of passenger air travel enabled movement of academics between Britain and America for even short stays and lecture tours. Grice himself made a number of such visits, and was impressed by the formal and theory-driven philosophy he encountered. Most of all he was impressed by the work of Noam Chomsky."

Although tracking itself is by and large a solved problem, selecting features that can be tracked well and correspond to physical points in the world is still hard. We propose a feature selection criterion that is optimal by construction because it is based on how the tracker works, and a feature monitoring method that can detect occlusions, disocclusions, and features that do not correspond to points in the world. These methods are based on a new tracking algorithm that extends previous Newton-Raphson style search methods to work under affine image transformations. We test performance with several simulations and experiments.<<ETX>>"

                "text": "While research on articulated human motion and pose estimation has progressed rapidly in the last few years, there has been no systematic quantitative evaluation of competing methods to establish the current state of the art. We present data obtained using a hardware system that is able to capture synchronized video and ground-truth 3D motion. The resulting HumanEva datasets contain multiple subjects performing a set of predefined actions with a number of repetitions. On the order of 40,000 frames of synchronized motion capture and multi-view video (resulting in over one quarter million image frames in total) were collected at 60\u00a0Hz with an additional 37,000 time instants of pure motion capture data. A standard set of error measures is defined for evaluating both 2D and 3D pose estimation and tracking algorithms. We also describe a baseline algorithm for 3D articulated tracking that uses a relatively standard Bayesian framework with optimization in the form of Sequential Importance Resampling and Annealed Particle Filtering. In the context of this baseline algorithm we explore a variety of likelihood functions, prior models of human motion and the effects of algorithm parameters. Our experiments suggest that image observation models and motion priors play important roles in performance, and that in a multi-view laboratory environment, where initialization is available, Bayesian filtering tends to perform well. The datasets and the software are made available to the research community. This infrastructure will support the development of new articulated motion and pose estimation algorithms, will provide a baseline for the evaluation and comparison of new methods, and will help establish the current state of the art in human pose estimation and tracking."

The rst component takes real image sequences acquired from multiple views and recovers the 3-D body pose at each time instant. The pose-recovery problem is formulated as a search problem and entails nding the pose parameters of a graphical human model for which its synthesized appearance is most similar to the actual appearance of the real human in the multi-view images. Currently, we use a best-rst search technique and chamfer matching as a fast similarity measure between synthesized and real edge images. The second component of our system deals with the representation and recognition of human movement patterns. The recognition of human movement patterns is considered as a classiication problem involving the matching of a test sequence with several reference sequences representing prototypical activities. A variation of dynamic time-warping is used to match movement patterns using 3-D joint angles as features. We illustrate our approach on real data acquired simultaneously from three views and data derived from stereo Moving Light Displays with diierent types of hand-gestures."

The powerful tool of generating function analysis is demonstrated to yield for arbitrary codes both the distance properties and upper bounds on the bit error probability for communication over any memoryless channel. Previous results on code ensemble average error probabilities are also derived and extended by these techniques. Finally, practical considerations concerning finite decoding memory, metric representation, and synchronization are discussed."
