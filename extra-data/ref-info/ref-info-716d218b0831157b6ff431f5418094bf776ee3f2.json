For such objects we can define landmark points on each example which imply a correspondence between different examples. We can then build statistical models of the shape by considering the relative positions of landmarks, and can model the pattern of intensities across the object by warping them into a common reference frame. Such combined models of shape and appearance have been found to be powerful tools for image interpretation. They are generative models, capable of synthesizing new examples similar to those in the training set. The formulation of such models is described, and their application to face location and recognition investigated. Particular attention is paid to methods of matching such models to new images in a multi-stage process."

Jojic and Frey [8] provide a generative probabilistic model framework for this task, but their algorithm is slow as it needs to search over discretized transformations (e.g. translations, or affines) for each layer simultaneously. Exact computation with this model scales exponentially with the number of objects, so Jojic and Frey used an approximate variational algorithm to speed up inference. Williams and Titsias [16] proposed an alternative sequential algorithm for the extraction of objects one at a time using a robust statistical method, thus avoiding the combinatorial explosion."
