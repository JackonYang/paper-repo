A comparison of 29 methods for solution of this problem has been made. Each of the methods is discussed and the results of extensive testing for their properties and appropriate values of their parameters is given. Both local and global methods are considered. Comparisons of timing, storage, accuracy, visual pleasantness of the surface, and ease of implementation are made. A large number (over 200) of pages of perspective plots of surfaces are given. Suggestions for improvement of some methods are made, and methods which have poor approximation properties are identified."

Because the desire to fit this type of data is encountered frequently in many areas of scientific applications, an investigation of the available methods for solving this problem was undertaken. Several aspects, such as computational efficiency, fitting characteristics and ease of implementation, were analyzed and compared. Within the context of a general purpose method for large sets of data, two of these methods emerged as being generally superior to the others. It is the purpose of this paper to describe these two methods and present examples illustrating their use and application. FORTRAN programs which implement these methods are available upon request.

The technique is applicable to modeling of arbitrary surfaces; it is shown to be especially well suited for modeling of fine-structure topographic surfaces. The macroscopic features of the method are as follows. (1) Given a set of discrete coordinate measurements, an average least squares mathematical model for the surface geometry is determined. (2) The model consists of an arbitrarily large family of locally valid surface functions that join smoothly; nth-order continuity is satisfied everywhere. (3) Each locally valid surface function can typically be reduced to a low-degree polynomial of two variables; thus an efficient and consistent mathematical model for local surface calculations is provided. (4) The method sequentially operates on a moderate to small subset of the measured data; it is therefore applicable to an arbitrarily large set of observed data. These features and associated computational devices are discussed in the light of numerical results obtained by using actual geodetic data sets. These results demonstrate that the method is a versatile, accurate, and efficient means for obtaining general-purpose mathematical models of irregular surfaces."

                "text": "Surface display techniques, including contour mapping, usually use an interpolant when data values are on a rectangular grid; but when values are irregularly located some form of assumed or estimated distance-weighting function is often used to estimate the \"influence\" of data points at other locations. If moving average (or some other) techniques are then applied, slopes may be zero at data points; extrema may fall at data points exclusively; or surfaces may not pass through data points.An alternative method is proposed whereby a map area is automatically divided into suitable triangular domains with a data point at each vertex. Surface estimation and contour plotting are then performed independently for each triangle using a measured or best-fit plane associated with each data point. The approach requires the utilization of three non-original aspects: 1) the derivation of a local homogeneous \"area\" coordinate system for any arbitrary triangle; 2) the construction of a data-structure linking each triangular domain with its three neighbouring triangles and three associated data points, and 3) the use of a \"conforming\" triangular finite-element interpolating function.Use of the first two of these concepts permits the economic generation and optimization of a triangular mesh from a set of data points. Optimization criteria used to define the \"best\" triangular partition are described in some detail, along with computer timing for this step. Use of the first and third concepts permits the interpolation of a smooth surface over the whole map area even though each triangular element is estimated and plotted independently. The requirements for a suitable interpolating function are discussed, and an interpolant is suggested that preserves elevation and slope at each data point as well as elevation and slope continuity between domains. Extrema need not be located at data points but are constrained by their associated planes. Contour line segments are produced by division of each triangle into N2 sub-triangles, elevation estimation at each resulting node, and linear interpolation and plotting withing each sub-triangle. Resolution is then a function of N and local data point density. Extension of the method to higher dimensions is briefly discussed."

In order to display these data in some type of contour map or perspective view, to compare them with data for the same region based on other data points, or to analyze them for extremes, gradients, or other purposes, it is extremely useful, if not essential, to define a continuous function fitting the given values exactly.

The theory of regionalized variables allows formulation of a superior contouring algorithm. The theory of regionalized variables has been developed by G. Matheron to allow the drawing of statistical inferences, not only sample values but also implicit relationships in the geometry of the sample space being considered. Universal kriging is an estimation procedure within the context of the regionalized variable theory; it is presented and used here as an alternative method for grid generation in automatic contouring procedures, where spatial relationships must be considered. Universal kriging is more general and reliable than empirical contouring methods and is unbiased if the assumptions of the regionalized variable theory are met. In addition, kriged values have minimum estimation variance. Universal kriging is an exact interpolation procedure and, probably the most important feature, yields a measure for the estimation error at every point in the sample space."

Generally, these restrict the set of points to be one-to-one defined over a planar rectangular grid (X, Y-plane). Then a set of functions Z = F(X, Y) is determined, each of which represents a surface segment of the composite smooth surface. In this paper, these ideas are generalized to include a much broader class of permissible point array distributions: namely (1) the point arrangement (ordering) is topologically equivalent to a planar rectangular grid, (2) the resulting solution is a smooth composite of parametric surface segments, i.e. each surface piece is represented by a vector (point)-valued function. The solution here presented is readily applicable to a variety of problems, such as closed surface body definitions and pressure envelope surface definitions. The technique has been used successfully in these areas and others, such as numerical control milling, Newtonian impact and boundary layer."

Similarities and dissimilarities of the multiquadric and covariance methods are discussed. Multiquadric kernels are based on geometric and physical considerations rather than stochastic processes as is the case of covariance kernels. Thus the procedure of determining and fitting empirical covariances to select an analytical covariance function is unnecessary in multiquadric analysis. Comparative test results involving topographic features in Hawaii are given. A similar type test involving gravity anomalies in Iowa is also discussed. In general multiquadric kernels were found to be superior to covariance kernels in accuracy and computational efficiency for these applications. Topography, gravity anomalies, and other phenomena are not stationary in the sense of stationary random functions, which is at the heart of the justification for least squares prediction with covariance functions. This is probably true of many of the phenomena of interest in photogrammetry and remote sension. Least squares prediction with multiquadric functions is applied in a demonstration of its capability with respect to image processing and analysis."

Each local approximation is valid over a hypercube in n space, constructed so that adjacent approximations join with mth order continuity satisfied throughout the model. This technique is based on a unique set of polynomial weighting functions; analytic formulas for the weighting functions for n-dimensional mth order continuous modeling are derived and presented."

The MQ harmonic kernel is used to develop a formula for estimating the best depth of point mass anomalies as a function of their number and areal extent on a sphere. Functional relationships between geoidal surface parameters are developed which provide linear equation analogs for the solution of Stokes and Vening Meinesz Integral Formulas as well as for the inversion of these classic problems.

In the nonstationary case, universal kriging procedures give the best possible estimator of a trend (drift) and may be applied to contouring problems.

The proper abstract setting is a Hilbert function space whose reproducing kernel involves no functions more complicated than logarithms and is easily coded. Convenient representation formulas are given, as also a practical multivariate extension of the Peano kernel theorem. Owing to the numerical stability of Cholesky factorization of positive definite symmetric matrices, the whole construction process of a surface spline can be described as a recursive algorithm, the data relative to the various interpolation points being exploited in sequence.R\u00e9sum\u00e9La m\u00e9thode concr\u00e8te d'interpolation par surfaces-spline est \u00e9troitement li\u00e9e au probl\u00e8me classique de la minimisation d'une semi-norme de Soboleff sous des contraintes d'interpolation; la structure intrins\u00e8que des surfaces-spline est d\u00e8s lors celle d'une extension multivari\u00e9e des fonctions-spline naturelles. Le cadre abstrait ad\u00e9quat est un espace fonctionnel hilbertien dont le noyau reproduisant ne fait pas intervenir de fonctions plus compliqu\u00e9es que des logarithmes et est ais\u00e9 \u00e0 programmer.
