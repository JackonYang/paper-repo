Range images, which directly measure 3-D surface coordinates of a scene, are well suited for this task. In this paper we report a procedure to detect connected planar, convex, and concave surfaces of 3-D objects. This is accomplished in three stages. The first stage segments the range image into ``surface patches'' by a square error criterion clustering algorithm using surface points and associated surface normals. The second stage classifies these patches as planar, convex, or concave based on a non-parametric statistical test for trend, curvature values, and eigenvalue analysis. In the final stage, boundaries between adjacent surface patches are classified as crease or noncrease edges, and this information is used to merge compatible patches to produce reasonable faces of the object(s). This procedure has been successfully applied to a large number of real and synthetic images, four of which we present in this paper."

The range image of 3-D objects is divided into surface primitives which are homogeneous in their intrinsic differential geometric properties and do not contain discontinuities in either depth of surface orientation. The method is based on the computation of partial derivatives, obtained by a selective local biquadratic surface fit. Then, by computing the Gaussian and mean curvatures, an initial region-gased segmentation is obtained in the form of a curvature sign map. Two additional initial edge-based segmentations are also computed from the partial derivatives and depth values, namely, jump and roof-edge maps. The three image maps are then combined to produce the final segmentation. Experimental results obtained for both synthetic and real range data of polyhedral and curved objects are given. >"

The proposed approach involves two phases in which the region and edge information detected using a set of orthogonal Zernike moment-based operators are combined to provide robust segmentation of range images. In the first phase, each range image point is characterized by the surface normal vector and the depth value at that point. A surface feature-based clustering of range image points yields its initial region-based segmentation. This initial segmentation phase often produces oversegmented images. In the second phase of the proposed technique, the oversegmented image is resegmented by appropriately merging adjacent regions using the edge information to produce final segmentation. One attractive characteristic of the proposed technique is that the same set of three moment-based operators is used to extract both surface and edge features. Thus only three convolution operations are needed at an image point to compute all the desired surface and edge features associated with that point. The performances of the proposed Zernike moment-based operators in surface and edge feature detection are theoretically analyzed. >"

                "text": "Computer vision researchers have been frustrated in their attempts to automatically derive depth information from conventional two-dimensional intensity images. Research on \"shape from texture\", \"shape from shading\", and \"shape from focus\" is still in a laboratory stage and had not seen much use in commercial machine vision systems. A range image or a depth map contains explicit information about the distance from the sensor to the object surfaces within the field of view in the scene. Information about \"surface geometry\" which is important for, say, three-dimensional object recognition is more easily extracted from \"2 1/2 D\" range images than from \"2D\" intensity images. As a result, both active sensors such as laser range finders and passive techniques such as multi-camera stereo vision are being increasingly utilized by vision researchers to solve a variety of problems. This book contains chapters written by distinguished computer vision researchers covering the following areas: Overview of 3D Vision Range Sensing Geometric Processing Object Recognition Navigation Inspection Multisensor Fusion A workshop report, written by the editors, also appears in the book. It summarizes the state of the art and proposes future research directions in range image sensing, processing, interpretation, and applications. The book also contains an extensive, up-to-date bibliography on the above topics. This book provides a unique perspective on the problem of three-dimensional sensing and processing; it is the only comprehensive collection of papers devoted to range images. Both academic researchers interested in research issues in 3D vision and industrial engineers in search of solutions to particular problems will find this a useful reference book."

We present a robust estimation method with high breakdown point which can tolerate more than 80% of outliers. The method randomly samples appropriate range image points in the current processing region and solves equations determined by these points for parameters of selected primitive type. From K samples, we choose one set of sample points that determines a best-fit equation for the largest homogeneous surface patch in the region. This choice is made by measuring a residual consensus (RESC), using a compressed histogram method which is effective at various noise levels. After we get the best-fit surface parameters, the surface patch can be segmented from the region and the process is repeated until no pixel left. The method segments the range image into planar and quadratic surfaces. The RESC method is a substantial improvement over the least median squares method by using histogram approach to inferring residual consensus. A genetic algorithm is also incorporated to accelerate the random search. >"

Surface curvature sign labeling provides an initial coarse image segmentation, which is refined by an iterative region-growing method based on variable-order surface fitting.

Conventional approaches to range image understanding have treated these stages in isolation with a largely bottom-up flow of control and data through these various stages. Strictly bottom-up approaches have proved to be fragile in the face of errors in segmentation due to noise and limitations on sensor resolution and accuracy. Synergetic interaction of these various stages is essential for an image understanding system to exhibit robust behavior. This paper describes the design and implementation of INTEGRA, a range image understanding system that attempts to exploit the synergy between the various stages in the image understanding process. The salient features of INTEGRA are: (i) A synergetic combination of edge- and surface-based segmentation processes that results in more accurate segmentation than would have been possible with either of them alone and (ii) the ability to correct errors made during segmentation in the matching and localization stages. INTEGRA at this time, is limited to recognition and localization of polyhedral objects and is in the process of being enhanced to handle objects with curved surfaces of quadratic order such as spherical, ellipsoidal, cylindrical, and conical surfaces. Experimental results on real range images containing single and multiple polyhedral objects are presented. Future enhancements to INTEGRA are discussed."

The technique is based on the detection of edges in the image. The edges can be classified as belonging to one of the three categories: fold edges, semistep edges (defined here), and secondary edges. The 3-D image is sliced to create equidepth contours (EDCs). Three types of critical points are extracted from the EDCs. A subset of the edge pixels is extracted first using these critical points. The edges are grown from these pixels through the application of some masks proposed in this correspondence. The constraints of the masks can be adjusted depending on the noise present in the image. The total computational effort is small since the masks are applied only over a small neighborhood of critical points (edge regions). Furthermore, the algorithm can be implemented in parallel, as edge growing from different regions can be carried out independently of each other. >"

                "text": "Abstract Model-based 3D object recognition systems using range imagery typically employ entirely data-driven procedures for segmentation and surface classification. However, some recognition environments may contain only objects whose surface types and parameters are known a priori and can therefore be exploited by the early-processing steps used in the recognition system. We propose a new suite of model-driven techniques for identification of quadric surfaces (cones, cylinders, and spheres) in segmented range imagery. The methods employ surface positions and surface normal estimates in combination with the known parameters of surfaces in a database of object models. Second-derivative quantities (i.e., surface curvatures) are not used. The free parameters of cylinders and spheres are accumulated using a Hough transform, and free parameters of cones are estimated using a regression procedure. Experiments are presented for numerous scenes of both real and synthetic objects including part jumbles, objects in many poses, objects containing concave and convex surfaces, and noiseless and noisy synthetic range images of objects. Our experimental results show that the proposed surface classification methods can accurately recover surface parameters from both synthetic and real images, making them viable for environments with partial knowledge of surface type and parameters."

In this paper we show that the necessary computational burden to compute range values by means of these techniques can be reduced drastically by introducing weak geometrical constraints for the projector camera configurations. Furthermore, we suggest the concept of a virtual measurement coordinate system reducing the triangulation to simple one-dimensional LUT operations. Thus, the range acquisition technique can be implemented very fast in a low cost PC based image processing environment. We show how to calibrate the system and give some experimental results."

The Gaussian and mean curvatures are chosen because they are invariant under rotation and translation. In the Gaussian and mean curvature image, the points of maximum and minimum curvature are extracted and used for matching. The stability of the position of those points in the presence of noise and with resampling is investigated. The input for this algorithm consists of 3-D digital terrain data. Curvature values are calculated from the data by fitting a quadratic surface over a square window and calculating directional derivatives of this surface. A method of surface fitting which is invariant to coordinate system transformation is suggested and implemented. The algorithm is tested with and without the presence of noise, and its performance is described. >"

At the core of this approach is the Robust Sequential Estimator, a robust extension to the method of sequential least squares. Unlike most existing surface characterization techniques, the authors' method generates complete surface hypotheses in parameter space. Given a noisy depth map of an unknown 3-D scene, the algorithm first selects appropriate seed points representing possible surfaces. For each nonredundant seed it chooses the best approximating model from a given set of competing models using a modified Akaike Information Criterion. With this best model, each surface is expanded from its seed over the entire image, and this step is repeated for all seeds. Those points which appear to be outliers with respect to the model in growth are not included in the (possibly disconnected) surface. Point regions are deleted from each newly grown surface in the prune stage. Noise, outliers, or coincidental surface alignment may cause some points to appear to belong to more than one surface. These ambiguities are resolved by a weighted voting scheme within a 5/spl times/5 decision window centered around the ambiguous point. The isolated point regions left after the resolve stage are removed and any missing points in the data are filled by the surface having a majority consensus in an 8-neighborhood. >"

A key initial stage in this abstraction process is signal-level perceptual organization (SLPO) involving the processes of partitioning and identification. A parallel SLPO algorithm that follows the global hypothesis testing paradigm, but breaks the iterative structure of conventional region growing through the use of alpha -partitioning and region filtering is presented. These two techniques segment an image such that the gray-level variation within each region can be described by a regression model. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this algorithm. >"

                "text": "How does an animal see? How might a computer do it? A study of stereo vision guides research on both these questions. Brain science suggests computer programs; the computer suggests what to look for in the brain. T he development of computers of increasing power and sophistication often stimulates comparisons between them and the human brain, and these comparisons are becoming more earnest as computers are applied more and more to tasks formerly associated with essentially human activities and capabilities. Indeed, it is widely expected that a coming generation of computers and robots will have sensory, motor and even \"intellec-tual\" skills closely resembling our own. How might such machines be designed? Can our rapidly growing knowledge of the human brain be a guide? And at the same time can our advances in \"artificial intelligence\" help us to understand the brain? At the level of their hardware (the brain's or a computer's) the differences are great. The neurons, or nerve cells, in a brain are small, delicate structures bound by a complex membrane and closely packed in a medium of supporting cells that control a complexand probably quite variable chemical environment. They are very unlike the wires and etched crystals of semiconducting materials on which computers are based. In the organization of the hardware the differences also are great. The connections between neurons are very numerous (anyone neuron may receive many thousands of inputs) and are distributed in three dimensions. In a computer the wires linking circuit components are limited by present-day solid-state technology to a relatively small number arranged more or less two-dimensionally. In the transmission of signals the differences again are great. The binary (on-off) electric pulses of the computer are mirrored to some extent in the all-or-nothing signal conducted along nerve fibers, but in addition the brain employs graded electrical signals, chemical messenger substances and the transport of ions. In temporal organization the differences are immense. Computers process infonna-tion serially (one step at a time) but at a very fast rate. The time course of their operation is governed by a computer-wide clock. What is known of the brain suggests that it functions much slower but that it analyzes information along millions of channels concurrently without need of clock-driven operation. How, then, are brains and computers alike? Clearly there must be a level at which any two mechanisms can be compared. One can compare the tasks they do. \u2026"
