Two of their main applications are subband coders for speech processing and transmultiplexers for telecommunications. Below, we derive a theoretical framework for the analysis, synthesis, and computational complexity of multirate filter banks. The use of matrix notation leads to basic results derived from properties of linear algebra. Using rank and determinant of filter matrices, it is shown how to obtain aliasing/ crosstalk-free reconstruction, and when perfect reconstruction is possible. The synthesis of filters for filter banks is also explored, three design methods are presented, and finally, the computational complexity is considered."

This relationship is reviewed and explored. Novel theorems for the subsampling of sequences are derived by direct use of the digital-filter-bank framework. These results are related to the theory of perfect reconstruction in maximally decimated digital-filter-bank systems. One of the theorems pertains to the subsampling of a sequence and its first few differences and its subsequent stable reconstruction at finite cost with no error. The reconstruction filters turn out to be multiplierless and of the FIR (finite impulse response) type. These ideas are extended to the case of two-dimensional signals by use of a Kronecker formalism. The subsampling of bandlimited sequences is also considered.

We first discuss a theoretical model for such systems (based on the sampling theorem) and then show how various structures can be derived to provide efficient implementations of these systems. Design techniques for the linear-time-invariant components of these systems (the digital filter) are discussed, and finally the ideas behind multistage implementations for increased efficiency are presented."

In this paper the theory of operation of the Polyphase Quadrature Filter is presented and techniques for its efficient implementation are described. Then, examples of filter banks using this approach are shown and compared with other designs, and a simulation of a 16 Kbits/s coder using these filters is presented."

A more substantial gain can be obtained in the direct realization of a uniform bank of recursive filters through combination of the polyphase network with a discrete Fourier transform (DFT) computer; savings in hardware also result from the low sensitivity of the structure to coefficient word lengths."

For a real input sequence, the real part of the output sequence corresponds to the output of one of the transfer functions G(z) (for example, lowpass), whereas the imaginary part of the output sequence corresponds to its \"complementary\" filter H(z) (for example, highpass). The resulting implementation is structurally lossless, and hence the implementations of G(z) and H(z) have very low passband sensitivity. Numerical design examples are included, and a typical numerical example shows that the new implementation with 4 bits per multiplier is considerably better than a direct form implementation with 9 bits per multiplier.

It is Shown that the underlying analysis-synthesis systems can be designed such that there is no interband aliasing distortion in the coded speech and such that the analysis-synthesis transfer function has no frequency distortion or no phase distortion, but not both. The experimental study showed that subband coders based on a mixture of infinite impulse response (IIR) and finite-duration impulse response (FIR) filters resulted in higher quality coding systems using fewer multiplies than for systems based on FIR filters alone. It was also found that a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) gain of about 4 dB could be obtained using optimum quantizers for forward adapting ADPCM coders over linear quantizers in backward adapting APCM codes, but no perceptual quality gain was observed."

A frequency dmnain interpretation of the interpolation process, through which it is clear that interpolation is fundamentally a linear filtering process, is presented, An examination of the relative merits of finite duration impulse response (FIR) and infinite duration impulse response (IIR) digital filters as interpolation filters indicates that FIR filters are generally to be preferred for interpolation. It is shown that linear interpolation and classical polynomial interpolation correspond to the use of the FIR interpolation filter. The use of classical interpolation methods in signal processing applications is illustrated by a discussion of FIR interpolation filters derived from the Lagrange interpolation formula. The limitations of these filters lead us to a consideration of optimum FIR filters for interpolation that can be designed using linear programming techniques. Examples are presented to illustrate the significant improvements that are obtained using the optimum filters."

The resulting structure is therefore more general than previous schemes. In addition, the method offers a direct means of controlling the overall reconstruction distortion T(z) by appropriate design of a low-pass prototype filter P(z). Extension of these results to multiband band-limited signals and to the case of nonconsecutive nonuniform subsampling are also summarized, along with generalizations to the multidimensional case.

The synthesis of such QMF banks centers around the generation of a lossless M*M finite-impulse response (FIR) transfer matrix E(z). Recent results for such generation have been somewhat ad hoc, i.e. not sufficiently general. A general procedure is outlined for the generation of such transfer matrices. The procedure is based on a cascaded-lattice structure, derived from a state-space viewpoint. The structure is such that it generates only M*M lossless FIR transfer matrices (regardless of parameter values), and conversely, any M*M lossless FIR transfer matrix can be obtained by a suitable choice of parameters. These parameters turn out to be angles theta /sub k/, and the structure is such that the number of angles is minimal. A design example is presented to demonstrate the main results. >"

In such systems, it is imperative that the individual channel signals be decimated in such a way that the number of samples coded and transmitted do not exceed the number of samples in the original speech signal. Under this constraint, the systems presented in the past have sought to remove the aliasing distortion while minimizing the overall analysis/reconstruction distortion. In this paper, it is shown that it is possible to design tree-structured analysis/reconstruction systems which meet the sampling rate condition and which result in exact reconstruction of the input signal. The conditions for exact reconstruction are developed and presented. Furthermore, it is shown that these conditions are not overly restrictive and high-quality frequency division may be performed in the analysis section. A filter design procedure is presented which allows high-quality filters to be easily designed."

Based on similar concepts, we develop a new theory for low-sensitivity discrete-time filter structures. The mathematical setup for the development is the bounded-real property of transfer functions and matrices. Starting from this property, we derive procedures for the synthesis of any stable digital filter transfer function by means of a low-sensitivity structure. Most of the structures generated by this approach are interconnections of a basic building block called digital \"two-pair,\" and each two-pair is characterized by a lossless bounded-real (LBR) transfer matrix. The theory and synthesis procedures also cover special cases such as wave digital filters, which are derived from continuous-time networks, and digital lattice structures, which are closely related to unit elements of distributed network theory."

The QMF equations, i.e., equations that need to be satisfied for exact reconstruction of the input signal, are derived. The concept of decimated filters is introduced, and structures for both analysis and synthesis banks are derived using this concept. The QMF equations, as well as closed-form expressions for the synthesis filters needed for exact reconstruction of the input signal x(n) , are also derived using this concept. In general, the reconstructed. signal \\hat{x}(n) suffers from three errors: aliasing, amplitude distortion, and phase distortion. Conditions for exact reconstruction (i.e., all three distortions are zero, and \\hat{x}(n) is equal to a delayed version of x(n)) of the input signal are derived in terms of the decimated filters. Aliasing distortion can always be completely canceled. Once aliasing is canceled, it is possible to completely eliminate amplitude distortion (if suitable IIR filters are employed) and completely eliminate phase distortion (if suitable FIR filters are employed). However, complete elimination of all three errors is possible only with some simple, pathalogical stable filter transfer functions. In general, once aliasing is canceled, the other distortions can be minimized rather than completely eliminated. Algorithms for this are presented. The properties of FIR filter banks are then investigated. Several aspects of IIR filter banks are also studied using the same framework."

To this end, the individual transmultiplexer approaches are classified into four categories according to the underlying algorithm: Bandpass filter bank, low-pass filter bank, Weaver structure method, and multistage modulation method. Finally, the overall performance of the various transmultiplexer approaches are compared with each other by means of different criteria [1], such as stability under looped conditions, absolute value of the group delay, computational and control complexity, modularity, potential of intelligible crosstalk, absence of an additional analog frequency conversion, and the impact of out-of-band signaling For a more profound understanding of the individual digital trsnsmultiplexer approaches, the main chapter is preceded by an introductory discussion on analog and digital generation of single-sideband signals. In this context, the associated problems of sample rate alteration and multi-rate filtering arising from digital signal processing are dealt with."

The technique is developed in terms of a weighted overlap-add method of analysis/synthesis and allows overlap between adjacent time windows. This implies that time domain aliasing is introduced in the analysis; however, this aliasing is cancelled in the synthesis process, and the system can provide perfect reconstruction. Achieving perfect reconstruction places constraints on the time domain window shape which are equivalent to those placed on the frequency domain shape of analysis/synthesis channels used in recently proposed critically sampled systems based on frequency domain aliasing cancellation [7], [8]. In fact, a duality exists between the new technique and the frequency domain techniques of [7] and [8], The proposed technique is more efficient than frequency domain designs for a given number of analysis/synthesis channels, and can provide reasonably band-limited channel responses. The technique could be particularly useful in applications where critically sampled analysis/synthesis is desirable, e.g., coding."

[1] The filter in the high sampling rate side is decomposed into its polyphase filters which can be moved to the lower sampling rate side without changing their functions. For FIR filters the computational complexity is reduced by a factor equal to the sampling rate ratio. A rational (L/M) sampling rate conversion system realized with a 1-to-L interpolator followed by an M-to-1 decimator has three sampling rates F, LF and (L/M)F involved. By using the polyphase filter array a filter operating at the sampling rate of LF can be implemented in either the input side or the output side with lower sampling rates. The polyphase filter matrix structure will operate at the sampling rate of F/M, which does not show in the above model and is lower than any one of those three rates. For FIR filters the computational complexity is reduced by a factor of LM compared to the direct realization of the integral filter or by a factor of M (or L) compared to the polyphase filter array realization while the system input-output relation is maintained."

A class of M-channel FIR (finite-impulse response) perfect-reconstruction filter banks is introduced that includes the recently developed lossless filter banks. With the proposed filter banks, the synthesis filters are of the same complexity as the analysis filters. In addition, the synthesis filter bank is easily obtained from the analysis filter bank by inverting a set of M*M constant coefficient matrices. A statistical method for the design of such filter banks is presented. These can be used as building blocks in large tree-structured filter banks where the overall number of channels is any composite integer. An analysis of the computational and storage complexity of such tree structures is given. The results of the analysis are simple formulas for required storage and computation, which helps in the selection of efficient tree structures.<<ETX>>"

It is shown that the data rate of a hand-limited 2D signal can be reduced directly by sub-sampling methods. This means that the algorithm for compression is extremely simple, though the recovery of the original signal becomes complex. The procedure for reconstruction is derived by using linear filtering operations and 2D sampling rate alterations. The whole sub-sampling/reconstruction system is formulated in the form of a 2D multirate filter bank. Not every sub-sampling method allows for the perfect reconstruction of the original signal. A sufficient condition on the sub-sampling scheme is derived which would make reconstruction feasible. In theory, the reconstruction of the missing samples requires the use of piece-wise constant filters, but in practice their ideal responses can be approximated by FIR filters."

This restriction is not really a limiting factor for speech subband waveform coding since high adjacent channel attenuation is a necessity for the confinement of quantization noise. A key feature of our filter structure is that the number of multiplies, adds, and stored coefficients required for implementation is significantly less than those needed for the conventional QMF structure, given the same number of channels.

The proposed method allows time-limited impulse responses with optimum specified energy distribution in the frequency domain to be generated. Additional constraints to guarantee zero intersymbol interference are easily taken into account. Nyquist-type pulses which have the maximum possible amount of their total energy concentrated below some given frequency are one particularly important application. An example of such an impulse response with only 6 percent excess bandwidth is presented which shows that 99.96 percent of the energy can be concentrated in the desired bandwidth with a pulse 16 baud intervals long that can be generated using a read-only memory (ROM) with only 256 bits of storage. This new class of signals can be used advantageously for waveform generation and processing in digital data systems."

They are especially valuable when used to decimate or interpolate by a factor of 2 [1], where their characteristics well match the filtering requirements. Computational savings can also be achieved by extending the concept of half-band filters to Nth-band filters for use in decimation or interpolation by a factor of N. In this paper, it is shown that for certain filter requirements, common to decimation and interpolation, an Nth-band filter exists with passband and stopband ripples only slightly larger than those of the optimal FIR filter. It is demonstrated that optimal half-band filters can be designed by using the computer program of McClellan, Parks, and Rabiner [2]. It is also shown that useful Nth-band filters can be designed by using this program, which is perhaps the most widely available filter design program."

This paper presents a simple yet efficient extension of this concept to the source coding of images. We specify the constraints for a set of two-dimensional quadrature mirror filters (QMF's) for a particular frequency-domain partition, and show that these constraints are satisfied by a separable combination of one-dimensional QMF's. Bits are then optimally allocated among the subbands to minimize the mean-squared error for DPCM coding of the subbands. Also, an adaptive technique is developed to allocate the bits within each subband by means of a local variance mask. Optimum quantization is employed with quantizers matched to the Laplacian distribution. Subband coded images are presented along with their signal-to-noise ratios (SNR's). The SNR performance of the subband coder is compared to that of the adaptive discrete cosine transform (DCT), vector quantization, and differential vector quantization for bit rates of 0.67, 1.0, and 2.0 bits per pixel for 256 \u00d7 256 monochrome images. The adaptive subband coder has the best SNR performance."

The method is based on the computation of an eigenvector of an appropriate real, symmetric, and positive-definite matrix. The proposed design procedure is general enough to incorporate both time- and frequency-domain constraints. For example, Nyquist filters can be easily designed using this approach. The design time for the new method is comparable to that of Remez exchange techniques. The passband and stopband errors in the frequency domain can be made equiripple by an iterative process, which involves feeding back the approximation error at each iteration. Several numerical design examples and comparisons to existing methods are presented, which demonstrate the usefulness of the present approach."

The analysis is performed by a tree structure based on a set of non-linear phase FIR filters that split the signal into N equally spaced sub-band signals sub-sampled by 1/N. The synthesis makes use of a set of non-linear phase filters that are linear phase complementary to the analysis filters. This new scheme replaces the shifted sampling technique used in an earlier approach, by a synchronous sampling technique, in such a way that the perfect reconstruction property is retained, with a reduced computational complexity."

If the filters are independent in a sense to be defined, then It Is shown that the common input x(t) may be reconstructed from samples of the outputs (Z_k) , each output being sampled at m \\Pi samples per second or (1/m) th the rate associated with the Input signal. A rigorous derivation of this result Is given which proceeds from a minimum error energy criterion and leads to a system of linear algebraic equations for the optimal reconstruction filters. The system of equations derived here, which differs from the system given recently by Papoulis [1], has the advantage of depending on only one parameter \\omega rather than on the two parameters \\omega and t ; it also puts into evidence the fact that the spectra of the optimal reconstruction filters can be pieced together directly, without additional computation, from the elements of the system's inverse matrix. Lastly, the solutions of the system obtained in the Papoulis formulation are shown to be time-varying linear combinations of the simpler one-parameter solutions."

The first section generates a sparse set of impulse response samples and the other section generates the remaining samples by using interpolation. The method can be used to implement most practical FIR filters with significant savings in the number of arithmetic operations. Typically 1/2 to 1/8 of the number of multipliers and adders of conventional FIR filters are required in the implementation. The saving is achieved both in the linear phase and the non-linear phase cases. In addition, the new implementation gives smaller coefficient sensitivities and better roundoff noise properties than conventional implementations."

These filters have a finite impulse response (FIR) and can be thought of as attempting to approximate a desired frequency response at given points on the unit circle. The filters operate in real time with no batch processing of signals as is the case when using the discrete Fourier transform. They result in a marked reduction in dimension of the time-domain problem of fitting an Nth order FIR transversal filter to a collection of length 2 transversal filters and further to a collection of N scalar filters.

A complementary filter can be obtained by subtracting the output of the (M + 1) -band filter from a suitably delayed version of the input. The complementary filter is an (M + 1) -band filter whose passbands and stopbands are the stopbands and passbands, respectively, of the original (M + 1) -band filter.

Specifically, bit rates in the range of 7.2 to 16 kb/s are emphasized. Design guidelines, based on results of extensive computer simulations and subjective comparisons, are presented for selection of sub-band coder parameters. Practical considerations for selecting sub-bands under integer-band sampling and multiplexing constraints are also discussed, and a method for synchronous multiplexing of the sub-band data, without buffering, is proposed. Several examples of sub-band coders for transmission rates of 7.2, 9.6, and 16 kb/s are presented, and the quality of these coders is compared against that of adpcm and adm coders."

In particular, it is possible to obtain computational gain when operating on a large image by an FIR filter whose impulse response size is much smaller than the region of support of the input image. (The region of support is the set of values on which the image is defined.) To achieve this, a technique known as sectioning may be used, whereby the image is broken up into overlapping sections of size of the same order as the impulse response of the filter, and the filtering operation performed on the sections in turn. Breaking the image into blocks in this manner facilitates the implementation of the algorithm on a parallel processor. There are two sectioning procedures, known as the \u201cselect-save\u201d and \u201coverlap-add\u201d methods,(1\u20133) that may be used to eliminate any wrap-around error caused by the circular convolution inherent in the use of FFT algorithms."

Two structures for the implementation of rational lossless systems are presented. The first structure represents a characterization of single-input, multioutput lossless systems in terms of complex planar rotations, whereas the second structure offers a representation of M-input, M-output lossless systems in terms of unit-norm vectors. This property makes the second structure desirable in applications that involve optimization of the parameters. Modifications of the second structure for implementing single-input, multioutput, and lossless bounded real (LBR) systems are also included. The main importance of the structures is that they are completely general, i.e. they span the entire set of M*1 and M*M lossless systems. This is demonstrated by showing that any such system can be synthesized using these structures. The structures are also minimal in the sense that they use the smallest number of scalar delays and parameters to implement a lossless system of given degree and dimensions. A design example to demonstrate the main results is included. >"

The short-time Fourier transform and the time-varying frequency response are reviewed as representations for signals and linear time-varying systems. The problems of representing a signal by its short-time Fourier transform and synthesizing a signal from its transform are considered. A new synthesis equation is introduced that is sufficiently general to describe apparently different synthesis methods reported in the literature. It is shown that a class of linear-filtering problems can be represented as the product of the time-varying frequency response of the filter multiplied by the short-time Fourier transform of the input signal. The representation of a signal by samples of its short-time Fourier transform is applied to the linear filtering problem. This representation is of practical significance because there exists a computationally efficient algorithm for implementing such systems. Finally, the methods of fast convolution age considered as special cases of this representation."

In this method, the spectrum of the input image signal is decomposed nonuniformly into seven bands. In the coding process the lowest band is DPCM (differential pulse-code modulation)-coded while the higher bands are PCM-coded. The PCM quantizer is designed such that it reduces the subjective effect of quantization noise, and it also helps in an efficient transmission of higher band signals at low transmission rates. For encoding color images, the red (R), green (G), and blue (B) components of color images are first transferred to luminance (Y) and two chrominance components (I.Q). Each component is then decomposed separately into seven narrowbands. The higher-band signals corresponding to the luminance component are retained and coded separately, while the higher bands associated with I and Q components are discarded. The computer simulation results are presented in terms of average b/pixel and the quality of the reconstructured pictures. These results indicate that good quality reproduction can be achieved at high compression rates. >"

The AVPS has been implemented in a real-time hardware prototype designed for evaluation in telephone environments and works with any modular telephone and standard 120V ac electrical power. The unit contains two circuit boards \u2014 one for analog and one for digital processing \u2014 that each use four digital signal processors.

The reconstruction error in the first stage of the process is itself quantized and first-stage reconstruction is refined by removing from it the most objectionable components of quantized reconstruction error. The reconstruction error is coded on the basis of a bit allocation algorithm that utilizes the fact that perceptually significant error samples tend to occur in clusters in high-entropy parts of the input image frame. Application of this technique to a 512*512 monochrome image results in good communications quality at a rate of 0.5 bit per pixel for the simplest case of a two-band partition in horizontal and vertical frequencies, for a total of four subbands. By increasing the number of subbands to 16, significantly higher image quality can be realized at the same bit rate.<<ETX>>"

Straightforward extension of the QMF analysis/synthesis system, however, increases the region of support of the output image, an undesirable result for data reduction applications. Circular convolution has been used as a way to limit the region of support. A new system is introduced, the symmetric extension method, which also limits the region of support. This paper shows that the symmetric extension method outperforms the circular convolution method in the presence of coding noise."

The formulation, carried out in the time domain, is shown to result in an optimization problem requiring minimization of a quartic multinomial. An iterative solution is suggested which involves (computation of) the eigenvector of a matrix with a dimensionality equal to one half the number of filter taps. Our experiments show that convergence to the optimum tap weights is stable, and the accuracy of the final solution is limited only by the accuracy of the eigenvalue-eigenvector routine. As in an earlier technique, the user can specify the stop: band frequency the relative weights of the passband ripple energy and the stopband residual energy, and, of course, the number of filter taps."

These filters provide a significant improvement over conventional optimal equiripple and window designs when used in QMF banks. The performance criterion for these filters differ from those usually used for filter design in a way which makes the usual filter design techniques difficult to apply. Two filters are actually designed simultaneously, with constraints on the stop band rejection, transition band width, and pass and transition band performance of the QMF filter structure made from those filters. Unlike most filter design problems, the behavior of the transition band is constrained, which places unusual requirements on the design algorithm. The requirement that the overall passband behavior of the QMF bank be constrained (which is a function of the passband and stop band behavior of the filter) also places very unusual requirements on the filter design. The filters were designed using a Hooke and Jeaves optimization routine with a Hanning window prototype. Theoretical results suggest that exactly flat frequency designs cannot be created for filter lengths greater than 2, however, using the discussed procedure, one can obtain QMF banks with as little as \u00b1.0015dB ripple in their frequency response. Due to the nature of QMF filter applications, a small set of filters can be derived which will fit most applications."

It is shown that a quasioptimal LOT can be computed with an algorithm based on the discrete cosine transform (DCT), with only 30% more computation than the DCT. Unlike earlier approaches to the reduction of blocking effects, there is no penalty in coding gain for the LOT, which actually increases the coding gain by 0.25 dB for a first-order Markov process with rho =0.95.<<ETX>>"

In this review paper we will attempt to present the various contributions made for the sampling theorems with the necessary mathematical details to make it self-contained. We will begin by a clear statement of Shannon's sampling theorem followed by its applied interpretation for time-invariant systems. Then we will review its origin as Whittaker's interpolation series. The extensions will include sampling for functions of more than one variable, random processes, nonuniform sampling, nonband-limited functions, implicit sampling, generalized functions (distributions), sampling with the function and its derivatives as suggested by Shannon in his original paper, and sampling for general integral transforms. Also the conditions on the functions to be sampled will be summarized. The error analysis of the various sampling expansions, including specific error bounds for the truncation, aliasing, jitter and parts of various other errors will be discussed and summarized. This paper will be concluded by searching the different recent applications of the sampling theorems in other fields, besides communications theory. These include optics, crystallography, time-varying systems, boundary value problems, spline approximation, special functions, and the Fourier and other discrete transforms."

A time-varying image, which is a function of three independent variables, must be sampled in at least two dimensions for transmission over a one-dimensional analog communication channel, and in three dimensions for digital processing and transmission. At the receiver, the sampled image must be interpolated to reconstruct a continuous function of space and time. In imagery destined for human viewing, the visual system forms an integral part of the reconstruction process. This paper presents an overview of the theory of sampling and reconstruction of multidimensional signals. The concept of sampling structures based on lattices is introduced. The important problem of conversion between different sampling structures is also treated. This theory is then applied to the sampling of time-varying imagery, including the role of the camera and display apertures, and the human visual system. Finally, a class of nonlinear interpolation algorithms which adapt to the motion in the scene is presented."

The goal of such a system is data compression: to reduce the bit rate so as to minimize communication channel capacity or digital storage memory requirements while maintaining the necessary fidelity of the data. The mapping for each vector may or may not have memory in the sense of depending on past actions of the coder, just as in well established scalar techniques such as PCM, which has no memory, and predictive quantization, which does. Even though information theory implies that one can always obtain better performance by coding vectors instead of scalars, scalar quantizers have remained by far the most common data compression system because of their simplicity and good performance when the communication rate is sufficiently large. In addition, relatively few design techniques have existed for vector quantizers. During the past few years several design algorithms have been developed for a variety of vector quantizers and the performance of these codes has been studied for speech waveforms, speech linear predictive parameter vectors, images, and several simulated random processes. It is the purpose of this article to survey some of these design techniques and their applications."

Another form of periodic sampling, hexagonal sampling, offers substantial savings in machine storage and arithmetic computations for many signal processing operations. In this paper, methods for the processing of two-dimensional signals which have been sampled as two-dimensional hexagonal arrays are presented. Included are methods for signal representation, linear system implementation, frequency response calculation, DFT calculation, filter design, and filter implementation. These algorithms bear strong resemblances to the corresponding results for rectangular arrays; however, there are also many important differences. Some comparisons between the two methods for representing planar data will also be presented."

Explicit relations between the properties of the block processor and the properties of the implemented filter are derived, including an explicit expression for the matrix transfer function of the block processor in terms of the single-input, single-output filter transfer function. These properties and relations are independent of the form of realization of the block processor. It is shown that all irreducible state-space realizations of the block processor can be derived by a simple procedure from a simple realization of the required filter transfer function."

Getting Started \u0088 You may want to download Irfanview image viewing software. It handles pretty much any image type, lets you convert, and provides batch processing. \u0088 Download the sample images from the class website. The following question operates on the city.jpg image. (a) Perform image smoothing using a 7\u00d77 averaging filter and a Gaussian filter with \u03c3 = 0.5 and 3. Compare the outputs. (b) Perform edge enhancement using the Sobel operator (Matlab's default parameters). Repeat using the Laplacian and Laplacian of Guassian operators. Compare the outputs 2. Frequency Domain Filtering The following question operates on the city.jpg image. (a) Find the Fourier transform of the image. Be sure to center the frequencies. (b) Perform image smoothing in the frequency domain using the filters defined in the previous problem. Compare the output images from the two methods (spatial and frequency) and the time for operation. (c) Perform edge enhancement using the filters defined in the previous problem. (d) Define a lowpass filter in the frequency domain with radius of 1/4 the height. Show the result. Repeat with a similar sized Guassian and compare the results. Give the \u03c3 parameter you used and show the output transform image. (e) Repeat with a rectangular filter with the same dimension as the ideal lowpass. Compare the results between the ideal filter and the rectangular approximation. 3. Canny Edge Detection (a) Give the convolution kernels for determining the gradient. You may examine the function gradient.m to help with the explanation. (It may be easiest to apply the gradient to an impulse and inspect the results. (b) Implement the simplified version of the Canny edge detector (single scale). The syntax of the function should be where E contains the detected edges, M the smoothed gradient magnitude, A contains the gradient angle, I is the input image, sig is the \u03c3 parameter for the smoothing filter, and tau= [\u03c4 h , \u03c4 l ] is the two element vector containing the hysteresis thresholds. See Algorithm 6.4 for non-maximal suppression and Algorithm 6.5 for hysteresis thresh-olding. (It may be more efficient to implement the hysteresis as edge tracking)"

You are familiar with such operations from Calculus, namely, taking derivatives and you are also familiar with this from optics namely blurring a signal. We will be looking at sampled signals only. Let's start with a few basic examples. Local difference Suppose we have a 1D image and we take the local difference of intensities, DI(x) = 1 2 (I(x + 1) \u2212 I(x \u2212 1)) which give a discrete approximation to a partial derivative. (We compute this for each x in the image.) What is the effect of such a transformation? One key idea is that such a derivative would be useful for marking positions where the intensity changes. Such a change is called an edge. It is important to detect edges in images because they often mark locations at which object properties change. These can include changes in illumination along a surface due to a shadow boundary, or a material (pigment) change, or a change in depth as when one object ends and another begins. The computational problem of finding intensity edges in images is called edge detection. We could look for positions at which DI(x) has a large negative or positive value. Large positive values indicate an edge that goes from low to high intensity, and large negative values indicate an edge that goes from high to low intensity. Example Suppose the image consists of a single (slightly sloped) edge:"

When confined to the real field, G(s) with real coefficient can be factorized as a minimal product of a sequence of real rational matrices with McMillan degree 1 or 2, where the McMillan degrees of the factors add up to n. The results obtained thus settle a long-standing conjecture over the factorization of rational matrices. The proofs of these fundamental factorization theorems are constructive. Therefore, by following the suggested numerical procedures, all the factors over the real or the complex fields can be easily obtained. It is noted that the results obtained can be applied in the design of multiport or multichannel filters which can be realized in a VLSI implementation.<<ETX>>"

The original system of interest is stable if and only if each all-pass two-pair is stable (and hence \"lossless bounded real\"). As a result of this interpretation, a number of related issues, such as enumeration of unstable poles, prematured terminations, and singularity situations can all be approached in a unified manner, based only on \"two-pair extraction formulas.\" In addition, the network interpretation also leads to direct test procedures for testing relative stability, and the stability of multi-input, multi-output systems."

That is to say, the condition (1) with ( p > 1) implies that there is a continuous function F ( x ) such that"
