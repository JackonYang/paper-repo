Text location is the first step for recognizing the textual information. This paper proposes a neural network-based text location method for news video indexing. Text can be characterized by texture, location, alignment, and font size. The proposed method classifies text pixels and non-text pixels using a network that operates as a set of texture discrimination filters. We find and locate text regions using histogram analysis after removing errors in the classification results. Experimental results show that the proposed method is effective at locating texts."

The underlying assumption made by this approach is that the two regions can be viewed as different textures. We do not use any a priori knowledge of the document format. A convolution-based method is used to generate the texture feature im- ages. The coefficients of the convolution masks are obtained using a single-layer artificial neural network that generates eigenvectors of the correlation matrix of the input data. The coefficients of these masks have been ''learned'' from examples of the document images and have a po- tential of being considerably more powerful than masks with preset co- efficients.

Unlike personal or business letters which have high degree of global spatial structure among a limited number of entities, mail pieces of magazines usually have an address block printed on a white label which can be pasted in an arbitrary position. Graphics and other printed text on magazine covers also make the address block location problem complicated. In this paper, we present a simple method for automatically locating the address block on color magazine covers based on both color and texture analysis. First, we use a simple color thresholding technique to extract white regions which may contain an address block. Then, a texture segmentation method based on Gabor filters is used to find text regions (including the address) inside the white regions. These text regions are candidates for the address block. Simple heuristics are used to identify the correct address block among these candidates. This method is invariant to rotation and scale of the magazine cover. Experimental results on low resolution (50 dpi) images of several magazine covers are provided to demonstrate the applicability of our method."

Color information is combined with texture and corresponding segmentation and classification algorithms are developed. Emphasis is given to the segmentation part of the proposed system whose function is to detect and measure changes (loss/gain) that occur in a given environment over a period of time. The xyY color space is used. The two chromaticity coordinates are combined into one, thus, providing the chrominance (spectral) part of the image, while Y describes the luminance (intensity) image information. The proposed color texture segmentation system processes luminance and chrominance separately. Luminance is processed in four stages: filtering/smoothing, similarities computation, and boundary detection. Chrominance processing is performed in two stages: histogram multithresholding and region growing. Two or more images may be combined at the end in order to detect possible changes, where the exclusive-OR (XOR) operator is utilized. Results in both the xyY and HIS color spaces are presented."

The algorithms we propose make use of typical characteristics of text in videos in order to enhance segmentation and, consequently, recognition performance. As a result, we get segmented characters from video pictures. These can be parsed by any OCR software. The recognition results of multiple instances of the same character throughout subsequent frames are combined to enhance recognition result and to compute the final output. We have tested our segmentation algorithms in a series of experiments with video clips recorded from television and achieved good segmentation results."

We solve the problem of finding an optimal set of masks by designing a neural network which is trained to maximize a relevant function. Two algorithms, the centroid algorithm and the gradient descent algorithm, are used to train the network. Experimental results on segmenting two natural textures and extracting barcodes in an image are reported, and the error rates compared for both the algorithms with different network configurations. The centroid algorithm gives better results in small parameter spaces, whereas the gradient descent algorithm works better with more parameters. Our method of automatically generating texture discrimination masks not only results in a good segmentation performance, but also reduces the dimensionality of the feature space compared to previously published multichannel filtering methods.<<ETX>>"

Neural networks are used as filters for analysing small windows of an image and deciding whether each window contains a license plate. A post-processor combines these filtered images and gives the final location of the license plates. The method offers robustness when dealing with noisy images. Tests with car images travelling on the road and at the entrance of a car park showed extraction rates of 99 and 97.5%, respectively. These results suggest that the proposed method works well with real-world situations."

The features are computed as the local energy of the filter responses. The effect of the filtering is highlighted, keeping the local energy function and the classification algorithm identical for most approaches. For reference, comparisons with two classical nonfiltering approaches, co-occurrence (statistical) and autoregressive (model based) features, are given.

                "text": "Object and pattern detection is a classical computer vision problem with many potential applications, ranging from automatic target recognition to image-based industrial inspection tasks in assembly lines. While there have been some successful object and pattern detection systems in the past, most such systems handle only specific rigid objects or patterns that can be accurately described by fixed geometric models or pictorial templates. \nThis thesis presents a learning based approach for detecting classes of objects and patterns with variable image appearance but highly predictable image boundaries. Some examples of such object and pattern classes include human faces, aerial views of structured terrain features like volcanoes, localized material defect signatures in industrial parts, certain tissue anomalies in medical images, and instances of a given digit or character, which may be written or printed in many different styles. \nThe thesis consists of two parts. In part one, we introduce our object and pattern detection approach using a concrete human face detection example. The approach first builds a distribution-based model of the target pattern class in an appropriate feature space to describe the target's variable image appearance. It then learns from examples a similarity measure for matching new patterns against the distribution-based target model. We also discuss some pertinent learning issues, including ideas on virtual example generation and example selection. The approach makes few assumptions about the target pattern class and should therefore be fairly general, as long as the target class has predictable image boundaries. We show that this is indeed the case by demonstrating the technique on two other pattern detection/recognition problems. \nBecause our object and pattern detection approach is very much learning-based, how well a system eventually performs depends heavily on the quality of training examples it receives. The second part of this thesis looks at how one can select high quality examples for function approximation learning tasks. Active learning is an area of research that investigates how a learner can intelligently select future training examples to get better approximation results with less data. We propose an active learning formulation for function approximation, and show for three specific approximation function classes, that the active example selection strategy learns its target with fewer data samples than random sampling. Finally, we simplify the original active learning formulation, and show how it leads to a tractable example selection paradigm, suitable for use in many object and pattern detection problems.
