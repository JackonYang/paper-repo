Fitted from a training corpus of text documents by a generalization of the Expectation Maximization algorithm, the utilized model is able to deal with domain{speci c synonymy as well as with polysemous words. In contrast to standard Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) by Singular Value Decomposition, the probabilistic variant has a solid statistical foundation and de nes a proper generative data model. Retrieval experiments on a number of test collections indicate substantial performance gains over direct term matching methods as well as over LSI. In particular, the combination of models with di erent dimensionalities has proven to be advantageous."

Our techniques allow us to integrate Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), a word-similarity algorithm based on word co-occurrence information, with N-gram models. While LSA is good at predicting content words which are coherent with the rest of a text, it is a bad predictor of frequent words, has a low dynamic range, and is inaccurate when combined linearly with N-grams. We show that modifying the dynamic range, applying a per-word con \ufb01 dence metric, and using geometric rather than linear combinations with N-grams produces a more robust language model which has a lower perplexity on a Wall Street Journal test-set than a baseline N-gram model."

The approach is to take advantage of implicit higher-order structure in the association of terms with documents (\u201csemantic structure\u201d) in order to improve the detection of relevant documents on the basis of terms found in queries. The particular technique used is singular-value decomposition, in which a large term by document matrix is decomposed into a set of ca. 100 orthogonal factors from which the original matrix can be approximated by linear combination. Documents are represented by ca. 100 item vectors of factor weights. Queries are represented as pseudo-document vectors formed from weighted combinations of terms, and documents with supra-threshold cosine values are returned. initial tests find this completely automatic method for retrieval to be promising."

This includes event co-occurrences, histogram data, and single stimulus preference data as special cases. Dyadic data arises naturally in many applications ranging from computational linguistics and information retrieval to preference analysis and computer vision. In this paper, we present a systematic, domain-independent framework for unsupervised learning from dyadic data by statistical mixture models. Our approach covers diier-ent models with at and hierarchical latent class structures and uniies probabilistic modeling and structure discovery. Mixture models provide both, a parsimonious yet exible parameterization of probability distributions with good generalization performance on sparse data, as well as structural information about data-inherent grouping structure. We propose an annealed version of the standard Expectation Maximization algorithm for model tting which is empirically evaluated on a variety of data sets from diierent domains."

The problem takes many forms; learning vocabulary from text is an especially dramatic and convenient case for research. A new general theory of acquired similarity and knowledge representation, latent semantic analysis (LSA), is presented and used to successfully simulate such learning and several other psycholinguistic phenomena. By inducing global knowledge indirectly from local co-occurrence data in a large body of representative text, LSA acquired knowledge about the full vocabulary of English at a comparable rate to schoolchildren. LSA uses no prior linguistic or perceptual similarity knowledge; it is based solely on a general mathematical learning method that achieves powerful inductive effects by extracting the right number of dimensions (e.g., 300) to represent objects and contexts. Relations to other theories, phenomena, and problems are sketched."

Aggregate Markov models are classbased bigram models in which the mapping from words to classes is probabilistic. Mixed-order Markov models combine bigram models whose predictions are conditioned on different words. Both types of models are trained by ExpectationMaximization (EM) algorithms for maximum likelihood estimation. We examine smoothing procedures in which these models are interposed between different order n-grams. This is found to significantly reduce the perplexity of unseen word combinations."

Words are represented by the relative frequency distributions of contexts in which they appear, and relative entropy between those distributions is used as the similarity measure for clustering. Clusters are represented by average context distributions derived from the given words according to their probabilities of cluster membership. In many cases, the clusters can be thought of as encoding coarse sense distinctions. Deterministic annealing is used to find lowest distortion sets of clusters: as the annealing parameter increases, existing clusters become unstable and subdivide, yielding a hierarchical \"soft\" clustering of the data. Clusters are used as the basis for class models of word coocurrence, and the models evaluated with respect to held-out test data."
