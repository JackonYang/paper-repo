White (Univ. of California at San Diego, Dept. of Economics Discussion Paper, June 1988; to appear in Neural Networks) showed that multilayer feedforward networks with as few as one hidden layer, no squashing at the output layer, and arbitrary sigmoid activation function at the hidden layer are universal approximators: they are capable of arbitrarily accurate approximation to arbitrary mappings, provided sufficiently many hidden units are available. The present authors obtain identical conclusions but do not require the hidden-unit activation to be sigmoid. Instead, it can be a rather general nonlinear function. Thus, multilayer feedforward networks possess universal approximation capabilities by virtue of the presence of intermediate layers with sufficiently many parallel processors; the properties of the intermediate-layer activation function are not so crucial. In particular, sigmoid activation functions are not necessary for universal approximation.<<ETX>>"

We illustrate the method by selecting two common topics in signal processing, prediction and system modelling, and show that nonlinear applications can be handled extremely well by using neural networks. The formalism is a natural, nonlinear extension of the linear Least Mean Squares algorithm commonly used in adaptive signal processing. Simulations are presented that document the additional performance achieved by using nonlinear neural networks. First, we demonstrate that the formalism may be used to predict points in a highly chaotic time series with orders of magnitude increase in accuracy over conventional methods including the Linear Predictive Method and the Gabor-Volterra-Weiner Polynomial Method. Deterministic chaos is thought to be involved in many physical situations including the onset of turbulence in fluids, chemical reactions and plasma physics. Secondly, we demonstrate the use of the formalism in nonlinear system modelling by providing a graphic example in which it is clear that the neural network has accurately modelled the nonlinear transfer function. It is interesting to note that the formalism provides explicit, analytic, global, approximations to the nonlinear maps underlying the various time series. Furthermore, the neural net more\u00a0\u00bb seems to be extremely parsimonious in its requirements for data points from the time series. We show that the neural net is able to perform well because it globally approximates the relevant maps by performing a kind of generalized mode decomposition of the maps. 24 refs., 13 figs. \u00ab\u00a0less"

                "text": "i Preface This book is an outgrowth of a course which we have given almost periodically over the last eight years. It is addressed to beginning graduate students of mathematics, engineering, and the physical sciences. Thus, we have attempted to present it while presupposing a minimal background: the reader is assumed to have some prior acquaintance with the concepts of \" linear \" and \" continuous \" and also to believe L 2 is complete. An undergraduate mathematics training through Lebesgue integration is an ideal background but we dare not assume it without turning away many of our best students. The formal prerequisite consists of a good advanced calculus course and a motivation to study partial differential equations. A problem is called well-posed if for each set of data there exists exactly one solution and this dependence of the solution on the data is continuous. To make this precise we must indicate the space from which the solution is obtained, the space from which the data may come, and the corresponding notion of continuity. Our goal in this book is to show that various types of problems are well-posed. These include boundary value problems for (stationary) elliptic partial differential equations and initial-boundary value problems for (time-dependent) equations of parabolic, hyperbolic, and pseudo-parabolic types. Also, we consider some nonlinear elliptic boundary value problems, variational or unilateral problems, and some methods of numerical approximation of solutions. We briefly describe the contents of the various chapters. Chapter I presents all the elementary Hilbert space theory that is needed for the book. The first half of Chapter I is presented in a rather brief fashion and is intended both as a review for some readers and as a study guide for others. Non-standard items to note here are the spaces C m (\u00af G), V * , and V. The first consists of restrictions to the closure of G of functions on R n and the last two consist of conjugate-linear functionals. Chapter II is an introduction to distributions and Sobolev spaces. The latter are the Hilbert spaces in which we shall show various problems are well-posed. We use a primitive (and non-standard) notion of distribution which is adequate for our purposes. Our distributions are conjugate-linear and have the pedagogical advantage of being independent of any discussion of topological vector space theory. Chapter III is an exposition of the theory of linear elliptic boundary \u2026"

As the work of White [30], Guilkey, Lovell, and Sickles [19], and others has shown, ordinary flexible functional forms such as the translog cannot achieve this objective. We find that if one is prepared to assume that elasticities of substitution cannot oscillate wildly over the region of interest then consistent estimation is possible using the Fourier flexible form provided the number of fitted parameters increases as the number of observations increases. This result obtains with any of the commonly used statistical methods as, for example, multivariate least squares, maximum likelihood, and three-stage least squares. It obtains if the number of fitted parameters is chosen adaptively by observing the data or chosen deterministically according to some fixed rule. We approach the problem along the classical lines of estimability considerations as used in the study of less than full rank linear statistical models and thereby discover that the problem has a fascinating structure which we explore in detail."
