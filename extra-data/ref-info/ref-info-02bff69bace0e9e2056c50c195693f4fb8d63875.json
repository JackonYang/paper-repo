We do not cover the whole range of methods and steps used in graphics recognition, but rather concentrate on those which we deem the most crucial and time consuming, in terms of development time, in the design of a graphics recognition system. They include: binarization, text-graphics segmentation, thin-thick separation, vectorisation and arc recognition, and tiling."

Rather than visiting all the points along the wire's black area, SPV sparsely visits selected medial axis points. The result is a crude polyline, which is refined through polygonal approximation by removing redundant points. Due to the sparseness of pixel examination and the use of a specialized data structure, SPV is both time efficient and accurate, as evaluated by our proposed performance evaluation criteria."

Conventionally, two raster-to-vector conversion methods have generally been used. One is a thinning method. The other is a medial line extraction method based on parallel pairs of contours. The thinning method tends to distort extructed lines, especially of intersections and corners. On the other hand, the medial line extraction method has poor capabilities as regards capturing correct lines at intersections. In contrast, the method proposed can extract precise lines from both contours and skeletons. Contours are able to hold edge shapes well, while skeletons preserve topological features; thus, a combination of these features effectively leads to the best fitting line. In the proposed method, the line which best fits the original image is selected from among various candidate lines. The candidates are created from several merged short skeleton fragments located between pairs of short contour fragments. The method is also extended to circular arc fitting. Experimental results show that the method is effective.<<ETX>>"

Since a typical drawing contains both text strings and graphics, an algorithm has been developed to locate and separate text strings of various font sizes, styles, and orientations. This is accomplished by applying the Hough transform to the centroids of connected components in the image. The graphics in the segmented image are processed to represent thin entities by their core-lines and thick objects by their boundaries. The core-lines and boundaries are segmented into straight line segments and curved lines. The line segments and their interconnections are analyzed to locate minimum redundancy loops which are adequate to generate a succinct description of the graphics. Such a description includes the location and attributes of simple polygonal shapes, circles, and interconnecting lines, and a description of the spatial relationships and occlusions among them. Hatching and filling patterns are also identified. The performance of the system is evaluated using several test images, and the results are presented. The superiority of these algorithms in generating meaningful interpretations of graphics, compared to conventional data compression schemes, is clear from these results. >"

It is intended for use in an automated system for document analysis. The principal parts of the algorithm are the generation of connected components and the application of the Hough transform in order to group components into logical character strings that can then be separated from the graphics. The algorithm outputs two images, one containing text strings and the other graphics. These images can then be processed by suitable character recognition and graphics recognition systems. The performance of the algorithm, both in terms of its effectiveness and computational efficiency, was evaluated using several test images and showed superior performance compared to other techniques. >"

Most published approaches for automated interpretation of raster-scanned maps assume that the map is composed of various graphic entities, and that the vast majority of pixel positions on the map each belong to only one type of graphic entity and can therefore be geometrically segmented. However, complex color topographic maps contain several layers of information that overlap substantially (often within a single color plane), making it impossible to geometrically segment the map data into distinct regions containing a single class of graphic object. Here we describe a verification-based approach that uses various knowledge bases to detect, extract, and attribute map features without requiring the presegmentation of graphical entities. This approach builds on SRI International's (SRI's) verification-based computer vision and character recognition methodologies. The approach can also be applied to other types of documents containing a mix of text and graphics, such as engineering drawings, electrical schematics, and technical illustrations."

The method was motivated by the need for quick and reliable detection of horizontal lines in an interactive drawing conversion system for telephone company drawings. At the core of the algorithm are the processes of filtering run lengths, assembling filtered run lengths, generating top silhouette, and thresholding the gradient of the top silhouette to extract one horizontal line at a time. The method is robust in the presence of distortion; it can tolerate significant skew and warping, both local and global, and can bridge significant breaks in lines without too many false positive lines."

This is accomplished by using the information carried by the contour of the ribbons to detect the presence of regions where two ribbons merge or cross, since the distortions mainly affect the lines in correspondence of these regions. Once such a region is detected, the grassfire propagation model used to compute the spine is abandoned and shape preserving criteria are adopted to compute the line within the region. Experimental results show that the lines provided by the algorithm are not affected by the distortions typically present in the lines provided by thinning algorithms. They also show that the algorithm provides a line representation of the figures that can be immediately used to obtain the decomposition of the figure into pieces, each one corresponding to one of the ribbon making up the figure, which is highly desirable in many applications dealing with ribbon like figures."

That being the case for the localisation and label recognition, some symbols revert to treating the recognition problem. However, on analysing certain diagrams, it turns out that the recognition is made difficult by the presence of other entities in superimposition or the connection to the symbol. The object of this study is to set up a sound methodology allowing the extraction of particular symbols on telephone cable maps embodying the central lines."

The approach is based on a special image representation, that the authors call graph representation. The graph representation is especially convenient for line-like images, since it decomposes the line structure into 'edges' and 'nodes', that formalise the intuitive notions of 'line' and 'crossing point between lines'. In this way, well-known algorithms from graph theory can be used. The graph is searched for characteristic sub-graphs, revealing the presence of symbols or noisy objects overlapping lines. Each symbol candidate is accurately processed, in order to make the area of its connection to lines as regular as possible. Actually, two different algorithms have been designed to perform this task: one for symbols crossing lines and the other for symbols only touching lines. Both of them are rotation invariant.<<ETX>>"

                "text": "This paper describes a computational approach to edge detection. The success of the approach depends on the definition of a comprehensive set of goals for the computation of edge points. These goals must be precise enough to delimit the desired behavior of the detector while making minimal assumptions about the form of the solution. We define detection and localization criteria for a class of edges, and present mathematical forms for these criteria as functionals on the operator impulse response. A third criterion is then added to ensure that the detector has only one response to a single edge. We use the criteria in numerical optimization to derive detectors for several common image features, including step edges. On specializing the analysis to step edges, we find that there is a natural uncertainty principle between detection and localization performance, which are the two main goals. With this principle we derive a single operator shape which is optimal at any scale. The optimal detector has a simple approximate implementation in which edges are marked at maxima in gradient magnitude of a Gaussian-smoothed image. We extend this simple detector using operators of several widths to cope with different signal-to-noise ratios in the image. We present a general method, called feature synthesis, for the fine-to-coarse integration of information from operators at different scales. Finally we show that step edge detector performance improves considerably as the operator point spread function is extended along the edge."

When the elevations of the contours are available, this is an easy problem to solve. However, the authors do not have these elevations and can use only sparsely distributed elevation values noted on the map. This is a difficult problem even for humans to solve. They have developed a method for reconstructing three dimensional surfaces using only contours without matching elevations and these sparsely noted elevation values on the map as input. Numerals and symbols are recognized by the multitangled parallelism (MAP) matching method, while small dots and lines are extracted by the MAP operation method. These results are then used to used to determine the value, position, and attributes of the elevations marked on the topographic maps. The authors define an energy function for reconstruction of the surface. The function integrates three kinds of constraints: smoothness, fitness, and contour. The energy function can be minimized by solving a large linear system of simultaneous equations. The experimental result is a surface reconstructed from a 25,000:1 scale topographic map of the Tsukuba area.<<ETX>>"

These drawings are composed primarily of horizontal and vertical lines. By selecting the intersections as primitives, routines are developed to establish spatial relations of the primitives which are used to describe the structures. Another aspect that as presented is the benefit of using run length encoding to reduce the amount of memory and the processing time needed to process the large files resulting from scanning the forementioned drawings. Examples of the interpretation of telephone company distributing frame and front equipment drawings are presented."

An overview of the iterative thinning process and the pixel-deletion criteria needed to preserve the connectivity of the image pattern is given first. Thinning algorithms are then considered in terms of these criteria and their modes of operation. Nonpixel-based methods that usually produce a center line of the pattern directly in one pass without examining all the individual pixels are discussed. The algorithms are considered in great detail and scope, and the relationships among them are explored. >"

Using the information about the lines, the tabular structures are extracted by finding biconnected components on the graph formed by the lines and their intersections. A methodology has also been developed for the representation of end access to the entries inside the tables."

The procedure is to identify in a floor plan the building elements, stored in a library of patterns, and their spatial relationships. The vectorized input document and the patterns to recognize are represented by attributed graphs. To recognize the patterns as such, we apply a structural approach based on subgraph isomorphism techniques. In spite of their value, graph matching techniques do not recognize adequately those building elements characterized by hatching patterns, i.e. walls. Here we focus on the recognition of hatching patterns and develop a straight line Hough transform based method in order to detect the regions filled in with parallel straight fines. This allows not only to recognize filling patterns, but it actually reduces the computational load associated with the subgraph isomorphism computation. The result is that the document can be redrawn by editing all the patterns recognized."

To reduce computational costs, a global segmentation is used when possible, but an applicable top-down segmentation strategy is chosen when errors in the global segmentation are detected. The interpretation system has been tested on utility maps and the experiments show that when a top-down resegmentation strategy is used to correct errors in the global segmentation, the recognition performance is improved significantly."

In conventional methods, the quality of vectorization has been regarded as the same thing as digitizing accuracy, which is evaluated in terms of the error between the original line-drawing and the resultant vector sequence. However, this accuracy does not always correspond to perceptual quality. Based on the discussion about possible distortions in a vectorization process which strongly affects perceptual quality, we introduce a generic model of an object. The generic properties are described in the object model, for example, \u201cThe object is a polygon whose corners all have a right angle\u201d or \u201cThe object is composed of several pairs of almost parallel lines\u201d. The method consists of three processes: pre-vectorization, object recognition and shape modification based on an object model. The approximation line-figure which is first defined in the pre-vectorization process, is modified so as to meet the properties described in the object model. A cost function is derived from the model so that shape modification can be formalized as an optimization problem. A relaxation method is employed to save on computation time. Object recognition is needed for object model selection. The method was applied to geographic maps for urban planning to extract building polygons. Subjective evaluation on the extracted building shapes showed that 93.6% of the buildings were vectorized with high quality and that the number of buildings with insufficient quality was reduced to one twelfth."

The vectorized file consists of lines, arcs, and circles and generates a description of paper-based engineering drawings. The scanned engineering drawing is initially vectorized by a system called RENDER using line-tracking and curve-fitting techniques. However, the results obtained after the initial vectorization are not adequate. This paper discusses a post-processing system called P-RENDER which has been developed to further refine the vectorized line drawings and to recreate the drawing with the exact numbers of lines and arcs. Dashed entities are also detected and recreated. For large C- or D-size engineering drawings the refinement algorithm also leads to a considerable reduction in the size of the CAD database."

The recognition is based on the Hausdorff distance and neural networks, where our main contribution is to make the recognition efficient and robust for handling very large maps and many symbols of different scales and orientations. The system allows for efficient and coherent management of maps, recognition processes and recognition results."

Celesstin integrates several modules in a blackboard-based interpretation system. Once a drawing has been digitized, a first processing step separates the text and the dimensioning lines from the pure graphics part. Celesstin vectorizes the graphics part and assembles the resulting lines into blocks, the basic elements for the technical entities that it creates. The result is transferred to the CAD system. Celesstin tries to match the extracted entities with the corresponding models from the CAD library. It puts the remaining blocks and lines into different layers of the CAD description. The system is based on the assumption that even when the vectorized drawing is distorted, it can be correctly interpreted by using knowledge about the representation rules used in technical drawings and about the manufacturing technology associated with the represented objects.<<ETX>>"

A plan is represented by an attributed graph whose nodes represent characteristic points and whose edges represent segments. Symbols and textures can be seen as a set of regions, i.e. closed loops in the graph, with a particular arrangement. The search for a symbol involves a graph matching between the regions of a model graph and the regions of the graph representing the document. Discriminating a texture means a clustering of neighbouring regions of this graph. Both procedures involve a similarity measure between graph regions. A string codification is used to represent the sequence of outlining edges of a region. Thus, the similarity between two regions is defined in terms of the string edit distance between their boundary strings. The use of string matching allows the recognition method to work also under presence of distortion."

A robust method based on finding regions where are only the staff lines, linking between them the staff lines pieces in these regions is used. After staff lines elimination, symbols are isolated and a representation called attributed graph is constructed for each symbol. Thinning, polygonalization, spurious segments cleaning, and segment fusion are performed. A first classification, separating all notes with black heads from others, is performed. To recognize notes with black heads (beamed group or quarter notes), a straightforward structural approach using this representation is sufficient and efficient in most cases. In the ambiguous cases (chord or black head linked to two stems), an ellipse matching method is used. To recognize half notes and bar lines, a structural method using the graph is used.<<ETX>>"

The approach first makes a tracing of a signature similar to the way a human normally does, using hierarchical decision-making for stroke identification and ordering based on a set of heuristic rules. The dynamic information from the tracing sequence is then incorporated into the representation of the signature. A multiresolution critical-point segmentation method is used to extract local feature points, at varying degrees of scale and coarseness, for subsequent representation of the signature. Experimental results are discussed.<<ETX>>"

Essentially, in topographic maps, there are two kinds of geometric features: linear features, such as roads and railways that have an arbitrary length, and symbols, which indicate a type of building or area of land usage or even numerical information. These two types of features are extracted and recognized by using methods based on multiangled parallelism (MAP). The MAP operation method performs parallel calculation on directional feature planes. The linear features are extracted using erosion-dilation operations on the directional feature planes, and the symbols are extracted using a reformalized and parallel version of the generalized Hough transformation on the same directional planes, which is called the MAP matching method. The methods have been applied to a 1/25000 scale map. >"

The method is an implementation of a 2D dynamic grassfire that relies on a distance surface on which elastic contours minimize an energy function. The method is based on an active contour model. Numerous implementation aspects of the shape description method were optimized. A Euclidean metric was used for optimal accuracy, and the active contour model permits bypassing some of the discretization limitations inherent in using a digital grid. Noise filtering was performed on the basis of both contour feature measures and region measures, that is, curvature extremum significance and ridge support, respectively, to obtain robust shape descriptors. Other improvements and variations of the algorithmic implementation are proposed. >"

The results of this mixed analysis reveal the appearance of noninterpretable objects on the cadaster, due to the presence of semantic uncoherence. Thanks to the return cycles between the high and low level processing, an analytical strategy is proposed to independently cure the incoherence, thus to attain the most reliable interpretation of the cadastral map."

The system converts paper-based documents into digital form for integration into an existing database. Processing a map begins with its digitization by a scanning device. A key step in the system is the conversion from raster format to graph representation, a special binary image format suitable for processing line structures. Subsequent steps include vectorization of the line structures and recognition of the symbols interspersed in the drawing. The system requires operator interaction only to resolve ambiguities and correct errors in the automatic processes. The final result is a set of descriptors for all detected map entities, which is then stored in a database. It is shown that the image representation, vectorization techniques, and optical character recognition subsystem are quite general and that the methodology implemented in the system can be generalized to the acquisition of other classes of line drawings.<<ETX>>"

The main problems in interpreting hand-sketched drawings are positional ambiguity and shape distortion. In the proposed method, positional ambiguity is able to be corrected in a nearest grid-location manner because floor-plan elements are normally drawn on/along grid lines that correspond to the modular proportions. Shape distortion is able to be corrected by template-matching of closed regions because architectural elements mostly consist of one or more closed regions of basic figures: triangles, squares, circles, and so on. The system was tested using 150 floor-plan drawings hand-sketched by three subjects without the use of rulers or templates. The results showed that sufficient recognition performance for practical use was able to be obtained."

By recognizing the logo, one obtains semantic information about the document, which may be useful in deciding whether or not to analyze the textual components. A multi-level stages approach to logo recognition which uses global invariants to prune the database and local affine invariants to obtain a more refined match is presented. An invariant signature which can be used for matching under a variety of transformations is obtained. The authors provide a method of computing Euclidean invariants and show how to extend them to capture similarity, affine, and projective invariants when necessary. They implement feature detection, feature extraction, and local invariant algorithms and successfully demonstrate the approach on a small database.<<ETX>>"

The output of the system, a netlist identifying the symbol types and interconnections, may be used for design verification or as a compact portable representation of the drawing. The automatic recognition task is done in two stages: (1) domain-independent rules segment symbols from connection lines in the preprocessed drawing image and (2) an understanding subsystem makes use of a set of domain-specific matchers to classify symbols and correct errors automatically. A graphical user interface is provided to correct residual errors interactively. The system has been tested on a large database of printed images drawn from four different domains."

The pattern can be quite faithfully reconstructed by applying the reverse distance transformation to the skeleton, since this includes almost all the centers of the maximal discs of the pattern. The shape characterizing the discs is rounded, due the use of a quasi-Euclidean distance function, so that skeleton stability under pattern rotation is greatly favored. A pruning step, which makes it possible to simplify the structure of the skeleton without losing significant information, and a beautifying step, which is aimed at reducing the jaggedness possibly affecting some skeleton branches, are added to the process to improve the well-shapedness of the resulting skeleton."

Binarization of scanned gray scale images is the first step in most document image analysis systems. Selection of an appropriate binarization method for an input image domain is a difficult problem. Typically, a human expert evaluates the binarized images according to his/her visual criteria. However, to conduct an objective evaluation, one needs to investigate how well the subsequent image analysis steps will perform on the binarized image. We call this approach goal-directed evaluation, and it can be used to evaluate other low-level image processing methods as well. Our evaluation of binarization methods is in the context of digit recognition, so we define the performance of the character recognition module as the objective measure. Eleven different locally adaptive binarization methods were evaluated, and Niblack's method gave the best performance."

After a brief survey of the different levels of knowledge representation used by today's interpretation systems, same basic assumptions about the nature of drawing interpretation and the representation of knowledge are discussed. Based on these widely valid assumptions, the advantages of an explicit declaration of the objects' taxonomy and partonomy (part-of relations) are presented. In addition to the obvious results of a better readability and maintainability of the represented knowledge, it is shown how a complete and correct interpretation strategy can be automatically derived from only a handful of declarations. By this declarative approach the paper might shed some light on the special role of drawing interpretation as a mediator between the graphical and the applicational world. Taking into account this duality the paper introduces two different schemes of taxonomy and tries to establish rules for reasoning on dual taxonomies."
