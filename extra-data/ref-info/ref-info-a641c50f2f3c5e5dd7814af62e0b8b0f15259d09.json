The central visual processor is viewed as an optimum recognizer of stochastic patterns supplied by the periphery. The processor makes an optimum estimate of the spectral parameters of the stimulus, given the wavelength filter characteristics of the periphery, the stochastic nature of the information and an internal template to which the external stimulus is matched. The estimate is constrained in ways inferred from empirical phenomena. Subjective brightness of monochromatic stimuli and related constant brightness manifolds in the colour space constitute the constraint for brightness estimation. Results analogous and in accord with those of earlier line element theories are obtained. The Bezold-Br\u00fccke hue shift constitutes the basic constraint for hue estimation. The hue estimate involves interrelation between the fields in the experiment. Similarities and differences both in basic conceptions and results introduced by the template matching notions are discussed."

The usual methods of measurement do not, however, permit independent control of the chromatic and achromatic variables. On the basis of an opponent-colors theory of vision, a method is described for measuring directly and separately the spectral distributions of the chromatic components. A series of experiments is reported in which this method was used to obtain measures of the paired chromatic responses associated with the four primary spectral hues. Results are reported for two observers, 1\u00b0 foveal test field, for an equal brightness spectrum (10 mL), and a neutral state of adaptation (10 mL). The measured chromatic responses, together with achromatic (luminosity) functions measured earlier for the same observers, are used to predict the form of the spectral saturation discrimination function."

The same observers scaled the hue of the stimuli using the terms red, green, yellow, and blue. The results showed that the hue scaling was accurately predicted from the cancellation functions using the model of Hurvich and Jameson. Theoretical curves were generated to fit the chromatic response functions with a linear combination of three cone photopigments. The theoretical photopigments were based on an idopsin nomogram with lambdamax at a = 435, beta = 530, and lambda = 562 nm. An estimate of the density of each observer's preretinal optic media was obtained in order to relate the photopigment absorption spectra to the psychophysical data. Good linear fits were obtained for each observer's red-green curve, but not for the yellow-blue curves. A nonlinear model with an expansive exponent was used to fit the yellow-blue response functions with the three theoretical photopigments."

Visual sensation is described by a vector expressed in terms of Hering-like elements for color and brightness which underlie in their spatial-temporal variations the perceptions of form and change. The photic stimulus of vision is recognized to act first and only through photoabsorption producing a Helmholtz-like vector of quantum absorptions. The physiological transformation of the Helmholtz photochemical excitations into the Hering sensation responses is represented as a vector of general operators. The result is a mathematical framework encompassing traditional psychophysical and sensory scaling experiments. The theory is utilized to demonstrate that for many traditional (Class A) psychophysical observations, the physiological operator reduces to a linear (matrix) transformation. For static, uniform, focal stimulation, this reduction is seen to be the basis for earlier specific linear models of color vision. We also illustrate that static intensity-level effects (Bezold-Br\u00fccke hue shifts, unique hue invariance) can be modeled from the theory by power, but not logarithmic, intensity-level dependence for the sensation elements."

The treatment is a logical deduction from optimum statistical detection theory and its application to biological sensory systems. The evolution of color vision and of the application of statistical communications theory to sensory systems and the issues common to both that merge them into a unified research thrust in vision are briefly reviewed. The basic problems of retinal topography and available data are surveyed in detail to provide the constraints for the model. The model performance is confronted with actual visual performance data, particularly threshold and discrimination data. It is concluded that the theory of statistical communications and associated techniques of signal detectability, combined with the existing empirical findings provide a most powerful means to investigate sensory communication. As argued in earlier researches of sensory communications based on the same approach, a different new concept is defined for the sensory system and the various issues raised in the problem formulation."

The theory is a logical deduction from statistical estimation theory of the visual estimate of the spectral parameters of the stimulus. In place of geometrical concepts associated with colour-space geometry, stimulus discriminability is determined by optimum decision rules given by likelihood ratio tests on statistics that are postulated for the trichromatic responses. The classical line element theory and its formulations are deduced to be discriminability measures between signals. The different mathematical forms of classical theory are shown to correspond to different statistical constraints."

One class (colour\u2010opponent) had sustained colour\u2010opponent responses and concentrically organized receptive fields, in which usually one cone mechanism mediated the centre response and one or two different cone mechanisms mediated the antagonistic surround. A few cells of this class had non\u2010concentric (co\u2010extensive) receptive field organization. 3. A second class (broad\u2010band) had transient responses and concentrically organized receptive fields, in which usually two cone mechanisms mediated the centre response. In most cells, the surround had the same spectral sensitivity as the centre and the cells had non\u2010colour opponent responses. In other cells, the surround had a spectral sensitivity different to that of the centre and the cells had colour\u2010opponent responses. 4. The third class (non\u2010concentric) did not have concentrically organized receptive fields. One group of cells had extremely phasic on\u2010, off\u2010 or on\u2010off responses and no spontaneous activity, another group had characteristically regular spontaneous activity and was responsive only to moving stimuli. 5. Cells of the colour\u2010opponent class with concentric receptive fields had the smallest centre\u2010sizes, which did not vary markedly from cell to cell (mean 15 mum); cells of the non\u2010concentric class with phasic responses had the largest centre\u2010sizes, which varied from cell to cell. 6. Colour\u2010opponent cells comprised the highest proportion of cells near the foveola; broad\u2010band cells comprised the highest proportion in the more peripheral areas of the retina; non\u2010concentric cells were equally represented in all areas."

Four of the bipolar cells had a +R-G-and three a +Y-B-type chromatic center. Six of the bipolar cells showed hyperpolarizing non-color-opponent surrounds, while one +R-G-type cell had a +Y-RB-type surround. This cell showed the greatest complexity of all bipolar cells identified so far, and its spectral property strongly suggests the existence of an intimate relation between it and +Y-RB-type horizontal cells. Examination and classification of the 50 amacrine cells revealed that 17 belonged to the +R-G, 16 to the -R+G, 6 to the +Y-B, and 11 to the -Y + B type. Most of these cells showed non-color-opponent surrounds. Yet, the similarity of the chromatic arrangement of their centers with that of the ganglion cells shows that the four basic types of color channels are already in existence in the amacrine cells where they seem to originate."

                "text": "The main factors limiting the performance of the peripheral parts of the visual system can be specified, and doing this clarifies the nature of the interpretive tasks that must be performed by the central parts of the system. It is argued that the critical factor that hinders development of better resolving power is the difficulty of confining light within the waveguide-like outer segment, and that for sensitivity this critical factor is the thermal decomposition of photosensitive pigments. Knowledge of these limits makes many surprising details of the eye intelligible. Understanding the difficulties posed by the narrow dynamic range of nerve fibres may give similar insight into the coding of the retinal image for transmission to the brain. Our level of understanding changes when we come to the visual cortex, for although we do not lack good anatomical and neurophysiological data, these do not make the principles of operation self-evident in the way that the structure of the eye immediately suggests that it is an image-forming device. The cortex converts the representation of the visual field that it receives into reliable knowledge of the world around us, and the trouble may be that we lack good models of how this can be done. A system that can respond to single quanta and resolve almost to the diffraction limit is unlikely to employ grossly inefficient methods for those higher functions upon which its whole utility depends, and so it is worth seeking out the limiting factors. The quality of human performance at certain higher perceptual tasks is high compared with the limit of reliable statistical inference; hence much of the sample of information available in a visual image must be effectively utilized. But there are strong limitations on the connectivity in the cortex, so that one is forced to consider how the relevant information can be collected together. Three stages of dealing with the visual image are proposed: the improvement of the cortical map in primary visual cortex by processes analogous to spatial and temporal interpolation ; the detection of linking features in this map; and the concentration of this information by non-topographical mapping in adjacent visual areas."

                "text": "Interneurons exhibiting centre-surround antagonism within their receptive fields are commonly found in peripheral visual pathways. We propose that this organization enables the visual system to encode spatial detail in a manner that minimizes the deleterious effects of intrinsic noise, by exploiting the spatial correlation that exists within natural scenes. The antagonistic surround takes a weighted mean of the signals in neighbouring receptors to generate a statistical prediction of the signal at the centre. The predicted value is subtracted from the actual centre signal, thus minimizing the range of outputs transmitted by the centre. In this way the entire dynamic range of the interneuron can be devoted to encoding a small range of intensities, thus rendering fine detail detectable against intrinsic noise injected at later stages in processing. This predictive encoding scheme also reduces spatial redundancy, thereby enabling the array of interneurons to transmit a larger number of distinguishable images, taking into account the expected structure of the visual world. The profile of the required inhibitory field is derived from statistical estimation theory. This profile depends strongly upon the signal: noise ratio and weakly upon the extent of lateral spatial correlation. The receptive fields that are quantitatively predicted by the theory resemble those of X-type retinal ganglion cells and show that the inhibitory surround should become weaker and more diffuse at low intensities. The latter property is unequivocally demonstrated in the first-order interneurons of the fly\u2019s compound eye. The theory is extended to the time domain to account for the phasic responses of fly interneurons. These comparisons suggest that, in the early stages of processing, the visual system is concerned primarily with coding the visual image to protect against subsequent intrinsic noise, rather than with reconstructing the scene or extracting specific features from it. The treatment emphasizes that a neuron\u2019s dynamic range should be matched to both its receptive field and the statistical properties of the visual pattern expected within this field. Finally, the analysis is synthetic because it is an extension of the background suppression hypothesis (Barlow & Levick 1976), satisfies the redundancy reduction hypothesis (Barlow 1961 a, b) and is equivalent to deblurring under certain conditions (Ratliff 1965)."

The Helmholtz expression, (\u03b4x/(a + x))2 + (\u03b4y/(b + y))2 + (\u03b4z/(c + z))2 = const. = \u03b4s2 is the most readily interpretable in terms of the trichromatic theory, but to explain the observed variation of the hue limen through the spectrum it demands double-peak fundamental response curves which are at variance with other evidence. It also leads to a step-by-step visibility curve of wrong shape. The difficulties mentioned are removed by introducing different constant factors in the three terms. Such a modification is indicated independently by recent measurements of the liminal brightness increment, from which appropriate values of the factors have been derived. The factor in each term is simply related to the limiting Fechner fraction of the corresponding trichromatic mechanism, i.e., the Fechner fraction \u0394B/B which would be observed at sufficiently high brightnesses B if visual discrimination depended on that mechanism only. The modified expression for \u03b4s2 is applied to the calculation of hue limens, the step-by-step visibility curve, the Fechner fraction curves, and the general colour limen at different points of the colour triangle. Certain main features of the experimental results are correctly reproduced, but discrepancies with Wright and MacAdam's measurements of general colour limens may indicate that the modified element ignores some factor which is operative in their experiments."

It is argued that the critical factor that hinders development of better resolving power is the difficulty of confining light within the waveguide-like outer segment, and that for sensitivity this critical factor is the thermal decomposition of photosensitive pigments. Knowledge of these limits makes many surprising details of the eye intelligible. Understanding the difficulties posed by the narrow dynamic range of nerve fibres may give similar insight into the coding of the retinal image for transmission to the brain. Our level of understanding changes when we come to the visual cortex, for although we do not lack good anatomical and neurophysiological data, these do not make the principles of operation self-evident in the way that the structure of the eye immediately suggests that it is an image-forming device. The cortex converts the representation of the visual field that it receives into reliable knowledge of the world around us, and the trouble may be that we lack good models of how this can be done. A system that can respond to single quanta and resolve almost to the diffraction limit is unlikely to employ grossly inefficient methods for those higher functions upon which its whole utility depends, and so it is worth seeking out the limiting factors. The quality of human performance at certain higher perceptual tasks is high compared with the limit of reliable statistical inference; hence mnuch of the sample of information available in a visual image must be effectively utilized. But there are strong limitations on the connectivity in the cortex, so that one is forced to consider how the relevant information can be collected together. Three stages of dealing with the visual image are proposed: the improvement of the cortical map in primary visual cortex by processes analogous to spatial and temporal interpolation; the detection of linking features in this map; and the concentration of this information by non-topographical mapping in adjacent visual areas."

The hypothesis is then formulated quantitatively, and shown to be able to account for the above experiment, and also the disagreement in the literature between those who believe that the absorption of two quanta can cause a sensation, and those who believe that 5 or more are required. The formulation of the hypothesis is used to calculate the maximum allowable noise (expressed as a number x of random, independent events confusable with the absorption of a quantum of light) in the optic pathway for the absorption of various fractions of the total number of quanta incident at the cornea."

When the balance of red versus green cone excitation from the background is unequal, the contribution of one cone type to flicker photometric spectral sensitivity may be depressed in relation to that of the other by at least 1 order of magnitude more than Weber's law predicts. The resultant spectral sensitivity is determined predominantly by only one class of cone.

When two fields with wave\u2010lengths in the neighbourhood of its primary mode (mu1, mu2 less than or equal to 500 nm) are combined, pi1 is field\u2010additive, consistent with the hypothesis that this portion of the pi1 action spectrum is that of the short\u2010wave\u2010length\u2010sensitive photoreceptors. 4. When a short\u2010wave\u2010length adaptation field (mu1 less than or equal to 500 nm) is mixed with a longer wave\u2010length field (mu2 greater than or equal 550 nm) i1 is strongly non\u2010additive. This result proves that the long\u2010wave\u2010length portion of the pi1 field spectrum is generated at least in part by a signal originating in the long\u2010 or middle\u2010wave\u2010length sensitive cones. 5. Analysis of the additivity failures supports a model of pi1 in which the signal to be detected is generated in the short\u2010wave\u2010length cones, and must pass serially through two gain stages: the gain in the first stage is controlled by the short\u2010wave\u2010length cones alone; the gain in the second stage is controlled by a signal originating in the middle, or long\u2010wave\u2010length cones, or both."

This \u2018transient tritanopia\u2019 occurs for a large range of adapting intensities, but is abolished if the adapting field is very bright (experiment 2). The loss of sensitivity is primarily confined to the blue-sensitive cone mechanism (experiments 2 a , 3 and 4 ; and Appendix) and can be produced by small attenuations of the adapting field (experiment 5). It occurs in both foveal and parafoveal vision (experiment 6) but is absent when adapting and test stimuli are presented to opposite eyes (experiment 7). It was found in a protanope (experiment 9 a ) and, in a modified form, in a deuteranope (experiment 9 b ). No differences in sensitivity were found for blue flashes presented in the light and dark phases of a field flickering at a rate above the fusion frequency (Appendix). The sensitivity of the blue-sensitive mechanism of the eye appears to be controlled not only by quanta absorbed by the blue receptors but also by a mechanism with a different spectral sensitivity"

The goal was to understand how these cells contribute to the processing of visual information. Data were analyzed from a representative sample of 147 cells, whose responses to equal-energy spectra (presented as diffuse flashes of monochromatic light) were recorded at three radiance levels. On the basis of their responses, the cells were divided into two general classes: (a) spectrally nonopponent cells which respond to all wavelengths with either an increase or decrease in firing rate, (b) spectrally opponent cells (about two-thirds of the sample) which respond with an increase in firing rate to some parts of the spectrum and a decrease to other parts. Four types of opponent cells were found: (i) red excitatory and green inhibitory (+R\u2212G), (ii) green excitatory and red inhibitory (+G\u2212R), (iii) yellow excitatory and blue inhibitory (+Y\u2212B), (iv) blue excitatory and yellow inhibitory (+B\u2212Y). Comparisons with psychophysical data indicated that nonopponent cells transmit brightness information; opponent cells, however, carry information about color, the hue of a light being determined by the relative responses of the four types. The saturation of spectral lights appears to be related to the differences in responses of opponent and non-opponent cells."

Physiol.25, 819\u2013 840 ( 1942)], using an Ar+ laser operated at 514.5 nm as the source of light. In certain blocks of trials, our subjects were encouraged to report as seen those trials in which the stimulus might have been present. It was determined that sensitivity and reliability were traded against each other over a broad range: for our four subjects, the detection of 147 photons at the cornea with 60% frequency of seeing entailed, on the average, a 1% false-positive rate (FPR), whereas the detection of 34 photons at the cornea with 60% frequency of seeing was accompanied by a 33% FPR. A new neural-counting model has been developed in the framework of signal-detection theory. It combines Poisson stimulus fluctuations with additive and multiplicative neural noise, both of which are known to be present in the visual system at threshold. The resulting probability-of-detection curves, derived from the Neyman Type-A counting distribution, are in good accord with our experimental frequency-of-seeing data for sensible values of the model parameters. We deduce that, on the average, our four subjects are able to detect a single photon at the retina with 60% frequency of seeing, at the expense of a 55% FPR. In Part 2 of this set of papers [ PrucnalP. R.TeichM. C., Biol. Cybern.43, 87\u2013 96 ( 1982)], we use the normalizing transform, together with probit analysis, to provide improved estimates of threshold parameters, whereas in Part 3 [ TeichM. C.PrucnalP. R.VannucciG.BretonM. E.McGillW. J., submitted to Biol. Cybern.], we consider the effects of non-Poisson quantum fluctuations."

In these systems, a quantized and coded version of a spatial unitary transform of an image is transmitted over a channel, rather than an image itself. In this paper the transform-coding concept has been applied to the coding of color images represented by three primary color planes of data. The principles of spatial transform coding are reviewed and the merits of various methods of color-image representation are discussed. A performance analysis is presented for the color-image transform-coding system. Results of a computer simulation of the coding system are also given. It is shown that, by transform coding, the chrominance content of a color image can be coded with an average of 1.0 bits per element or less without serious degradation. If luminance coding is also employed, the average rate reduces to about 2.0 bits per element or less."

This is a matter of foveal topography, not size of field, for in fields of this size elsewhere in the fovea or in the parafovea, blue-sensitive cones are well represented. The blue-cone system falls in sensitivity from the border of the photopic zone\u2014the functionally all-cone area\u2014to a minimum, usually to extinction, at its center. Other features of foveal topography oppose this trend: the density of cones rises and the macular pigmentation thins out toward the center of the fovea. Also the red- and green-cone systems display the opposite gradient; their sensitivities decline regularly from the center toward the borders of the fovea and beyond.Tritanopia, though the rarest form of congenital color-blindness, is thus a regular feature of the center of the normal fovea. The existence of two neutral points in this condition, in the yellow and violet, has its basis in the observation that the luminosity curves of the red- and green-sensitive cones, drawn so as to cross in the yellow, cross again or fuse in the violet region. It is suggested that the blue-blindness of the fixation area is a final step in the general withdrawal of image vision from the short wavelengths of the spectrum, for which the chromatic aberration of the eye is greatest. The blue-blindness of the fixation area, taken together with the red-green blindness of more-or-less concentric zones of the near periphery, and the total colorblindness of the far periphery, raises the possibility that various zones of the normal retina display all the major forms of colorblindness. Trichromic vision is normal only in the broad, central annulus of the retina, which alone is ordinarily tested. Some instances of defective color vision may be similarly localized. The problems of both normal and defective color vision involve not only the presence or absence of certain visual pigments and types of cone, but their spatial distributions on the retinal surface, and their neural connections."

                "text": "xThe ideas of information theory are at present stimulating many different areas of psychological inquiry. In providing techniques for quantifying situations which have hitherto been difficult or impossible to quantify, they suggest new and more precise ways of conceptualizing these situations (see Miller [12] for a general discussion and bibliography). Events ordered in time are particularly amenable to informational analysis; thus language sequences are being extensively studied, and other sequences, such as those of music, plainly invite research. In this paper I shall indicate some of the ways in which the concepts and techniques of information theory may clarify our understanding of visual perception. When we begin to consider perception as an information-handling process, it quickly becomes clear that much of the information received by any higher organism is redundant. Sensory events are highly interdependent in both space and time: if we know at a given moment the states of a limited number of receptors (i.e., whether they are firing or not firing), we can make better-than-chance inferences with respect to the prior and subsequent states of these receptors, and also with respect to the present, prior, and subsequent states of other receptors. The preceding statement, taken in its broadest im1 The experimental work for this study was performed as part of the United States Air Force Human Resources Research and Development Program.

In the present discussion, however, we shall restrict our attention to special types of lawfulness which may exist in space at a fixed time, and which seem particularly relevant to processes of visual perception."

The chromaticity coordinates (x,y) computed from these distributions have been compared with direct visual determinations of chromaticity coordinates of daylight by Nayatani and Wyszecki, and by Chamberlin, Lawrence, and Belbin. It was found that the chromaticities indicated by the spectral distributions and by direct visual colorimetry cluster about the curve: y = 2.870x\u22123.000x2\u22120.275. This curve of typical daylight chromaticities falls slightly on the green side of the Planckian locus. From the mean and the first two characteristic vectors of the composite data, spectral distribution curves have been reconstituted by choice of scalar multiples of the vectors such that the chromaticity points fall on the curve of typical daylight chromaticities at places corresponding to correlated color temperatures of 4800\u00b0, 5500\u00b0, 6500\u00b0, 7500\u00b0, and 10 000\u00b0K. The representative character of these reconstituted spectral-distribution curves has been established by comparison with the measured curves from each subgroup yielding the closest approximation to the same chromaticities. The agreement so found suggests that this family of curves is more representative of the various phases of daylight between correlated color temperatures 4800\u00b0 and 10 000\u00b0K than any previously derived distributions."

                "text": "first meeting, and Douglas Anderson is the moderator of the second meeting, consisting of 7 cases of angle closure glaucoma. The panels consist of eminent researchers into glaucoma and are different in each symposium (except for Robert Shaffer, who was present in both, and whose comments are always to the point, profound yet essentially practical). The case presentations are halted at certain points for discussions and generalisations, and much ground is covered. The bias of the symposium is towards the solution of specific everyday problems, and, not unexpectedly, the level of discussion varies widely between traditional views and controversial and stimulating statements. It is clearly impossible to discuss the 19 chapters individually, but perhaps a few statements and opinions may be singled out for their interest. Assessment of the diurnal variations in pressure is best carried out by sporadic checks at the clinic at different hours, or by home tonometry; inpatient hospital phasing is not so reliable, as it involves a profound change in the patient's routine. Almost all the panelists commonly used the water drinking test, but tonography is no longer a routine investigation, being reserved for special cases. A recent spate of litigation cases in the US concerning juvenile glaucoma prompts several panelists to perform tonometry on every co-operative subject regardless of age. However, Shaffer would limit this to cases with suspicious-looking discs and to those persons in whom it can be carried out in a reasonably short time. Epinephrine almost certainly improves outflow facility fairly rapidly and not, as was thought, after a long latent period. The peak of its dose-response curve appears to be at the 1 % concentration of active drug in the short term, though it may be as high as 2% in the long term (Bernard Becker). Stability of adrenaline solution is greater with the bitartrate and the hydrochloride (Epifrin, Glaucon) than with the borate (Epinal, Eppy), but the borate compounds are more comfortable to use. Although little statistical evidence has been adduced, there is an impression that the disc cup changes more readily if it is already large (John Hetherington). In ocular hypertension the pressure responses to, and patient tolerance of, treatment are important factors in deciding when and how much to treat. In drainage operations vitreous aspiration is increasingly recommended to prevent sealing up of the drainage aperture by vitreous. Provocative tests in angle closure glaucoma remain essentially unreliable. The least unsatisfactory tests are the dark room test and the prone test. Mydriatic tests give many false positives. Neither the patient's advanced age nor a considerable degree of widening of the angle with pilocarpine should weaken our resolve to operate on every case of acute angle closure glaucoma (Pollack). However, tonography has a place in evaluating the chances of success of peripheral iridectomy after an acute attack: if C < 0 1, we can expect over 75% of failures (Shaffer). The volume is beautifully presented and contains several illustrations and clear tables. JOHN ROMANO"

The object of the present dissertation is not so much to propose any opinions which are absolutely new, as to refer some theories, which have been already advanced, to their original inventors, to support them by additional evidence, and to apply them to a great number of diversified facts, which have hitherto been buried in obscurity. Nor is it absolutely necessary in this instance to produce a single new experiment; for of experiments there is already an ample store, which are so much the more unexceptionable, as they must have been conducted with out the least partiality for the system by which they will be explained; yet some facts, hitherto unobserved, will be brought forwards, in order to show the perfect agreement of that system with the multifarious phenomena of nature."

Both of these responses, together with the nervous activity, have played a superb role as tools to the understanding of many psychophysical phenomena in terms of what is actually taking place in the retina. In this paper, however, emphasis is placed on the effort of investigators during the last decade toward the attainment of more basic knowledge concerning these tools themselves. The progress may not have been completely satisfactory, but the question of how the individual cellular units contribute to these responses will doubtless continue to be of interest to investigators."

Given such a description, one can compare the parameter estimation, discrimination, or detection performance of a human observer (as measured behaviorally) with the computed limiting performance of an ideal observer operating on the same neural input. Such a comparison is carried out in detail for the discrimination in frequency of an auditory sinusoidal tone burst. The results suggest that the human listener behaves as if he ignored (at least for this class of sounds) the periodicity information in the auditory nerve pattern (resulting from the phase-locking of the firings to the stimulus), but made full effective use of the place information (resulting primarily, although not entirely, from the mechanical tuning of the inner ear). On the other hand, it is known that the auditory system can discriminate certain more complicated stimuli on the basis of periodicity information if that is the only cue available. A modification of the structure of an optimum sinusoidal frequency discrimination system is conjectured that seems to be, at least qualitatively, consistent with the available evidence."

Because this paper is perhaps the first review on this topic, some background is given in the areas of colorimetry, visual perception of color and color television systems. We assume that the reader has some familiarity with luminance encoding techniques. Coding techniques themselves are divided into two broad groups: component coding methods in which each component (usually three) is coded separately, and composite coding methods in which the composite television signal with its \"color\" modulated subcarrier is processed as a single entity. Both approaches are covered in detail. The field is still growing, pushed primarily by the desire in the television area to find digital coding standards accepted by both broadcasters and carriers and suitable for use with NTSC, PAL and SECAM television systems. We discuss this aspect by comparing composite and component coding methods."

The results obtained in the present study are similar to those obtained previously, particularly when the limiting frequency of the spectral reflectance functions is set at \u03c9 = 1/50. Such a limiting frequency leads to spectral reflectance curves of typically four oscillations within the visible spectrum, making them resemble practical spectral reflectance curves."

The conference, concerning the same subject, given by Svaetichin (October 26, 1960) at Washington, stimulated his old friend and colleague Robert Galambos to write a paper concerning \u201ca glia-neural theory of brain function\u201d [Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. 47, 129 \u2013136 (1961)]. This exciting article is a much better introduction to our work than anything we could have written ourselves, since it emphasizes the problem faced by the conventional \u201cmillisecond\u201d neurophysiology and the neuron theory when trying to explain complex functions of our nervous system, as for instance sleep, alertness, learning, memory, inborn instinctive behavior, etc., and also gives a historical review of earlier thought, suggesting an important role for the glia in brain function. Anatomical and biochemical studies (Nansen, Holmgren, KornmUller, Hyden, Sjostrand, DE Robertis, G. Villegas and others) suggest the existence of interactions between the neuron and the glia; however, our studies directly demonstrate that the glial cells exert a metabolic excitability control on the neurons. Actually, all investigations on the S-potentials which have been carried out since 1953 are studies on the functional mechanisms of the glial cells, although this had not been realized before we definitely localized the recording site of the micro-electrode to individual Muller fibers and (glial) horizontal cells of the Teleost retina."

It is shown that mirror symmetry can be detected in displays of otherwise random dots with an efficiency of up to 50%; thus the statistical mechanisms are not crude and insensitive, and this aspect of sensory physiology and psychology may deserve more attention."

With the number of applications of adaptive array sensor systems growing each year, this look at the principles and fundamental techniques that are critical to these systems is more important than ever before. Introduction to Adaptive Arrays, 2nd Edition is organized as a tutorial, taking the reader by the hand and leading them through the maze of jargon that often surrounds this highly technical subject. It is easy to read and easy to follow, as fundamental concepts are introduced with examples before more current developments and techniques are introduced. Problems at the end of each chapter serve both instructors and professional readers by illustrating and extending the material presented in the text. Both students and practicing engineers will easily gain familiarity with the modern contribution that adaptive arrays have to offer practical signal reception systems."
