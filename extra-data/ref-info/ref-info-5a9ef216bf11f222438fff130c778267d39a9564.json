In this framework the overall aims are to find models that are well-matched to the data, and to use these models to make optimal predictions. Neural network learning is interpreted as an inference of the most probable parameters for the model, given the training data. The search in model space (i.e., the space of architectures, noise models, preprocessings, regularizers and weight decay constants) can then also be treated as an inference problem, in which we infer the relative probability of alternative models, given the data. This review describes practical techniques based on Gaussian approximations for implementation of these powerful methods for controlling, comparing and using adaptive networks."

A third approach, called ensemble learning, was introduced by Hinton and van Camp (1993). It aims to approximate the posterior distribution by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the true posterior and a parametric approximating distribution. The original derivation of a deterministic algorithm relied on the use of a Gaussian approximating distribution with a diagonal covariance matrix and hence was unable to capture the posterior correlations between parameters. In this chapter we show how the ensemble learning approach can be extended to full-covariance Gaussian distributions while remaining computationally tractable. We also extend the framework to deal with hyperparameters, leading to a simple re-estimation procedure. One of the benefits of our approach is that it yields a strict lower bound on the marginal likelihood, in contrast to other approximate procedures."

Simple versions of this approach include penalizing the sum of the squares of the weights or penalizing the number of nonzero weights. We propose a more complicated penalty term in which the distribution of weight values is modeled as a mixture of multiple gaussians. A set of weights is simple if the weights have high probability density under the mixture model. This can be achieved by clustering the weights into subsets with the weights in each cluster having very similar values. Since we do not know the appropriate means or variances of the clusters in advance, we allow the parameters of the mixture model to adapt at the same time as the network learns. Simulations on two different problems demonstrate that this complexity term is more effective than previous complexity terms."

So during learning, it is important to keep the weights simple by penalizing the amount of information they contain. The amount of information in a weight can be controlled by adding Gaussian noise and the noise level can be adapted during learning to optimize the trade-o between the expected squared error of the network and the amount of information in the weights. We describe a method of computing the derivatives of the expected squared error and of the amount of information in the noisy weights in a network that contains a layer of non-linear hidden units. Provided the output units are linear, the exact derivatives can be computed e ciently without time-consuming Monte Carlo simulations. The idea of minimizing the amount of information that is required to communicate the weights of a neural network leads to a number of interesting schemes for encoding the weights."

The bits-back coding allows interpreting the cost function used in the variational Bayesian method called ensemble learning as a code length in addition to the Bayesian view of misfit of the posterior approximation and a lower bound of model evidence. Combining these two viewpoints provides interesting insights to the learning process and the functions of different parts of the model. In this paper, the problem of variational Bayesian learning of hierarchical latent variable models is used to demonstrate the benefits of the two views. The code-length interpretation provides new views to many parts of the problem such as model comparison and pruning and helps explain many phenomena occurring in learning."

We introduce and analyze various methods of injecting synaptic noise into dynamically driven recurrent nets during training. Theoretical results show that applying a controlled amount of noise during training may improve convergence and generalization performance. We analyze the effects of various noise parameters and predict that best overall performance can be achieved by injecting additive noise at each time step. Noise contributes a second-order gradient term to the error function which can be viewed as an anticipatory agent to aid convergence. This term appears to find promising regions of weight space in the beginning stages of training when the training error is large and should improve convergence on error surfaces with local minima. The first-order term is a regularization term that can improve generalization. Specifically, it can encourage internal representations where the state nodes operate in the saturated regions of the sigmoid discriminant function. While this effect can improve performance on automata inference problems with binary inputs and target outputs, it is unclear what effect it will have on other types of problems. To substantiate these predictions, we present simulations on learning the dual parity grammar from temporal strings for all noise models, and present simulations on learning a randomly generated six-state grammar using the predicted best noise model."

This paper describes further research on the learning procedure. We start by describing the units, the way they are connected, the learning procedure, and the extension to iterative nets. We then give an example in which a network learns a set of filters that enable it to discriminate formant-like patterns in the presence of noise. The speed of learning is strongly dependent on the shape of the surface formed by the error measure in weight space . We give examples of the shape of the error surface for a typical task and illustrate how an acceleration method speeds up descent in weight space. The main drawback of the learning procedure is the way it scales as the size of the task and the network increases. We give some preliminary results on scaling and show how the magnitude of the optimal weight changes depends on the fan-in of the units. Additional results illustrate the effects on learning speed of the amount of interaction between the weights. A variation of the learning procedure that back-propagates desired state information rather than error gradients is developed and compared with the standard procedure. Finally, we discuss the relationship between our iterative networks and the analog networks described by Hopefield and Tank (Hopfield 85). The learning procedure can discover appropriate weights in their kind of network, as well as determine an optimal schedule for varying the nonlinearity of the units during a search."

However, the first-layer Gaussian-Bernoulli Restricted Boltzmann Machine (GRBM) has an important limitation, shared with mixtures of diagonal-covariance Gaussians: GRBMs treat different components of the acoustic input vector as conditionally independent given the hidden state. The mean-covariance restricted Boltzmann machine (mcRBM), first introduced for modeling natural images, is a much more representationally efficient and powerful way of modeling the covariance structure of speech data. Every configuration of the precision units of the mcRBM specifies a different precision matrix for the conditional distribution over the acoustic space. In this work, we use the mcRBM to learn features of speech data that serve as input into a standard DBN. The mcRBM features combined with DBNs allow us to achieve a phone error rate of 20.5%, which is superior to all published results on speaker-independent TIMIT to date."

In speech recognition, for example, an acoustic signal is transcribed into words or sub-word units. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are powerful sequence learners that would seem well suited to such tasks. However, because they require pre-segmented training data, and post-processing to transform their outputs into label sequences, their applicability has so far been limited. This paper presents a novel method for training RNNs to label unsegmented sequences directly, thereby solving both problems. An experiment on the TIMIT speech corpus demonstrates its advantages over both a baseline HMM and a hybrid HMM-RNN."

We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O. 1. Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms."

There may have been times when developments in neuroscience, artificial intelligence, or cognitive psychology seduced researchers into believing that their discipline was on the verge of discovering the secret of intelligence. But a humbling history of hopes disappointed has produced the realization that understanding the mind will challenge the power of all these methodologies combined. The work reported in this chapter rests on the conviction that a methodology that has a crucial role to play in the development of cognitive science is mathematical analysis. The success of cognitive science, like that of many other sciences, will, I believe, depend upon the construction of a solid body of theoretical results: results that express in a mathematical language the conceptual insights of the field; results that squeeze all possible implications out of those insights by exploiting powerful mathematical techniques. This body of results, which I will call the theory of information processing, exists because information is a concept that lends itself to mathematical formalization. One part of the theory of information processing is already well-developed. The classical theory of computation provides powerful and elegant results about the notion of effective procedure, including languages for precisely expressing them and theoretical machines for realizing them."

Before this paper, most people believed that the only way to make the error probability of transmission as small as desired is to reduce the data rate (such as a long repetition scheme). However, surprisingly this paper revealed that it does not need to reduce the data rate for achieving that much of small errors. It proved that we can get some positive data rate that has the same small error probability and also there is an upper bound of the data rate, which means we cannot achieve the data rate with any encoding scheme that has small enough error probability over the upper bound."
