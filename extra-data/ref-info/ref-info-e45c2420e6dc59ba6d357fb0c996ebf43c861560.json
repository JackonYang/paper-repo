In all cases, the models derived capture the important statistical characteristics of the family and can be used for a number of tasks, including multiple alignments, motif detection, and classification.

The quality of simulated annealing alignments is evaluated on structural alignments of ten different protein families, and compared to the performance of other HMM training methods and the ClustalW program. Simulated annealing is better able to find near-global optima in the multiple alignment probability landscape than the other tested HMM training methods. Neither ClustalW nor simulated annealing produce consistently better alignments compared to each other.

                "text": "Feedforward neural networks such as multilayer perceptrons are popular tools for nonlinear regression and classification problems. From a Bayesian perspective, a choice of a neural network model can be viewed as defining a prior probability distribution over non-linear functions, and the neural network's learning process can be interpreted in terms of the posterior probability distribution over the unknown function. (Some learning algorithms search for the function with maximum posterior probability and other Monte Carlo methods draw samples from this posterior probability). In the limit of large but otherwise standard networks, Neal (1996) has shown that the prior distribution over non-linear functions implied by the Bayesian neural network falls in a class of probability distributions known as Gaussian processes. The hyperparameters of the neural network model determine the characteristic length scales of the Gaussian process. Neal's observation motivates the idea of discarding parameterized networks and working directly with Gaussian processes. Computations in which the parameters of the network are optimized are then replaced by simple matrix operations using the covariance matrix of the Gaussian process. In this chapter I will review work on this idea by Williams and Rasmussen (1996), Neal (1997), Barber and Williams (1997) and Gibbs and MacKay (1997), and will assess whether, for supervised regression and classification tasks, the feedforward network has been superceded."

                "text": "Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are applied to the problems of statistical modeling, database searching and multiple sequence alignment of protein families and protein domains. These methods are demonstrated on the globin family, the protein kinase catalytic domain, and the EF-hand calcium binding motif. In each case the parameters of an HMM are estimated from a training set of unaligned sequences. After the HMM is built, it is used to obtain a multiple alignment of all the training sequences. It is also used to search the SWISS-PROT 22 database for other sequences that are members of the given protein family, or contain the given domain. The HMM produces multiple alignments of good quality that agree closely with the alignments produced by programs that incorporate three-dimensional structural information. When employed in discrimination tests (by examining how closely the sequences in a database fit the globin, kinase and EF-hand HMMs), the HMM is able to distinguish members of these families from non-members with a high degree of accuracy. Both the HMM and PROFILESEARCH (a technique used to search for relationships between a protein sequence and multiply aligned sequences) perform better in these tests than PROSITE (a dictionary of sites and patterns in proteins). The HMM appears to have a slight advantage over PROFILESEARCH in terms of lower rates of false negatives and false positives, even though the HMM is trained using only unaligned sequences, whereas PROFILESEARCH requires aligned training sequences. Our results suggest the presence of an EF-hand calcium binding motif in a highly conserved and evolutionary preserved putative intracellular region of 155 residues in the alpha-1 subunit of L-type calcium channels which play an important role in excitation-contraction coupling. This region has been suggested to contain the functional domains that are typical or essential for all L-type calcium channels regardless of whether they couple to ryanodine receptors, conduct ions or both."

Hidden Markov models were built for a representative set of just over 1,000 structures from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). Each CASP2 target sequence was scored against this library of HMMs. In addition, an HMM was built for each of the target sequences and all of the sequences in PDB were scored against that target model, with a good score on both methods indicating a high probability that the target sequence is homologous to the structure. The method worked well in comparison to other methods used at CASP2 for targets of moderate difficulty, where the closest structure in PDB could be aligned to the target with at least 15% residue identity.

For example, hidden Markov models are used for analyzing biological sequences, linguistic-grammar-based probabilistic models for identifying RNA secondary structure, and probabilistic evolutionary models for inferring phylogenies of sequences from different organisms. This book gives a unified, up-to-date and self-contained account, with a Bayesian slant, of such methods, and more generally to probabilistic methods of sequence analysis. Written by an interdisciplinary team of authors, it is accessible to molecular biologists, computer scientists, and mathematicians with no formal knowledge of the other fields, and at the same time presents the state of the art in this new and important field."

The classification is on hierarchical levels: the first two levels, family and superfamily, describe near and distant evolutionary relationships; the third, fold, describes geometrical relationships. The distinction between evolutionary relationships and those that arise from the physics and chemistry of proteins is a feature that is unique to this database so far. The sequences of proteins in SCOP provide the basis of the ASTRAL sequence libraries that can be used as a source of data to calibrate sequence search algorithms and for the generation of statistics on, or selections of, protein structures. Links can be made from SCOP to PDB-ISL: a library containing sequences homologous to proteins of known structure. Sequences of proteins of unknown structure can be matched to distantly related proteins of known structure by using pairwise sequence comparison methods to find homologues in PDB-ISL. The database and its associated files are freely accessible from a number of WWW sites mirrored from URL http://scop.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/scop/"
