In this paper, we apply this approach to the problem of representing three-dimensional shapes for the purpose of recognition. 1. Three criteria, accessibility, scope and uniqueness, and stability and sensitivity, are presented for judging the usefulness of a representation for shape recognition. 2. Three aspects of a representation\u2019s design are considered, (i) the representation\u2019s coordinate system, (ii) its primitives, which are the primary units of shape information used in the representation, and (iii) the organization the representation imposes on the information in its descriptions. 3. In terms of these design issues and the criteria presented, a shape representation for recognition should: (i) use an object-centred coordinate system, (ii) include volumetric primitives of varied sizes, and (iii) have a modular organization. A representation based on a shape\u2019s natural axes (for example the axes identified by a stick figure) follows directly from these choices. 4. The basic process for deriving a shape description in this representation must involve: (i) a means for identifying the natural axes of a shape in its image and (ii) a mechanism for transforming viewer-centred axis specifications to specifications in an object-centred coordinate system. 5. Shape recognition involves: (i) a collection of stored shape descriptions, and (ii) various indexes into the collection that allow a newly derived description to be associated with an appropriate stored description. The most important of these indexes allows shape recognition to proceed conservatively from the general to the specific based on the specificity of the information available from the image. 6. New constraints supplied by a conservative recognition process can be used to extract more information from the image. A relaxation process for carrying out this constraint analysis is described."

The outlines of a theory meeting these conditions are put forward. The model has three parts : (1) A processor that extracts local features from the input picture preserving information about the spatial relationships between the features. (2) A mechanism that induces an abstract description of the output from the processor. (3) A store in which such descriptions are held. Some suggestions are made about the language in which descriptions are framed : it must contain hierarchical elements to allow for the possibility of segmenting a picture in different ways. It is shown how the properties of such a language could account for the facts listed above. In recognizing a picture the output from the store is matched to a stored descriptive rule. What we see is the descriptive rule selected to describe an input picture\u2014we cannot respond to details of the picture not represented in the rule. Since, however, many different rules describe the same input picture, animals and man respond to different aspects of the same picture on different occasions of presentation."

The author has analyzed the computations performed in the course of visual motion analysis. Workable schemes able to perform certain tasks performed by the visual system have been constructed and used as vehicles for investigating the problems faced by the visual system and its methods for solving them.Two major problems are treated: first, the correspondence problem, which concerns the identification of image elements that represent the same object at different times, thereby maintaining the perceptual identity of the object in motion or in change. The second problem is the three-dimensional interpretation of the changing image once a correspondence has been established.The author's computational approach to visual theory makes the work unique, and it should be of interest to psychologists working in visual perception and readers interested in cognitive studies in general, as well as computer scientists interested in machine vision, theoretical neurophysiologists, and philosophers of science."

What you see when you look around depends not only on what is there to be seen but also on how your visual system organizes and interprets the images that fall on your retinas. An intriguing demonstration of this aspect of perception is presented by the apparent surface that is formed by rotating a cosine wave around a vertical axis viewed obliquely [see illustration on this page]. When you first look at the figure, it appears to be organized into a set of raised concentric rings, with the boundaries between the rings delineated approximately by the colored circular contours. If you turn the page upside down, however, the organization changes: now each colored contour, instead of lying in a trough between two rings, appears to trace the crest of a ring. (Try it.) Evidently the visual system does more than passively transmit signals to the brain. It . actively takes part in organizing and interpreting them. This finding raises three questions. First, why does the visual system need to organize and interpret the images formed on the retinas? Second, how does it remain true to the real world in the process? Third, what rules of inference does it follow? The answers to these questions call for a closer examination of such figures."

                "text": "Almost nothing can be deduced about a general three-dimensional surface given only its occluding contours in an image, yet contour information is easily and effectively used by us to infer the shape of a surface. Therefore, implicit in the perceptual analysis of occluding contour must lie various assumptions about the viewed surfaces. The assumptions that seem most natural are (a) that the distinction between convex and concave segments reflects real properties of the viewed surface; and (b) that contiguous portions of contour arise from contiguous parts of the viewed surface \u2013 i. e. there are no invisible obscuring edges. It is proved that, for smooth surfaces, these assumptions are essentially equivalent to assuming that the viewed surface is a generalized cone. Methods are defined for finding the axis of such a cone, and for segmenting a surface constructed of several cones into its components, whose axes can then be found separately. These methods provide one link between an uninterpreted figure extracted from an image, and the 3-D representation theory of Marr & Nishihara (1977)."

The algorithms effect a conversion from surface representations (outlines or surface points) to a volume representation (spheres). The spherical representation can be useful for graphical display, and perhaps as an intermediate representation for conversions to representations with other primitives. The spherical decomposition also permits the computation of points on the symmetric surface of an object, the three-dimensional analog of Blum's symmetric axis. The algorithms work in real coordinates rather than in a discrete space, and so avoid error introduced by the quantization of the space."

It is a priori clear that such invariants play an important part in the perception of solid shape by means of chiaroscuro. We have found several such invariants. The topological structure of the field of isophotes is determined by the collection of nested, closed parabolic curves on the surface. An important class of stationary points of the field clings to these parabolic lines. The isophotes cut the parabolic lines at a constant angle, irrespective of the location of the light sources. For certain canonical surface undulations the field of isophotes is explicitly given."

In order to solve these problems we must be able to relate natural surfaces to their images; this requires a good model of natural surface shapes. Fractal functions are good a choice for modeling natural surfaces because (1) many physical processes produce a fractal surface shape, (2) fractals are widely used as a graphics tool for generating natural-looking shapes, and (3) a survey of natural imagery has shown that the 3-D fractal surface model, transformed by the image formation process, furnishes an accurate description of both textured and shaded image regions. This characterization of image regions has been shown to be stable over transformations of scale and linear transforms of intensity. \n \nMuch work has been accomplished that is relevant to computing 3-D information from the image data, and the computation of a 3-D fractal-based representation from actual image data has been demonstrated using an image of a mountain. This example shows the potential of a fractal-based representation for efficiently computing good 3-D representations of natural shapes, including such seemingly-difficult cases as mountains, clumps of leaves and clouds."

There is a clear thread run ning through its four chapters: counterf actual conditionals (which in recent years have given such headaches to several ana lytic philosophers) speak about possible non-actual 2 events. But Goodman cannot accept talk about possible events or entities in good philosophical conscience; according to his \"actualist\" onto logy, as we might call it, there are no possibilities, just as for a nominalist there are no classes and other abstract entities. To put it in the formal mode of speech: he wants to find a way of trans lating all modal talk into a non-modal language. Guided by this motivation, he proceeds to examine the distinction between \"law like\" and \"accidental\" statements and, after an impressive display of analytical acumen, comes to the conclusion that the solution of this problem of explication is one with the solution of the problem of induction: what is the criterion of reasonableness of an inductive inference? How are warranted predictions to be dis tinguished from unwarranted ones? There seem to me, however, to be serious flaws in Goodman's intricate chain of argument, which I wish to examine in some detail."
