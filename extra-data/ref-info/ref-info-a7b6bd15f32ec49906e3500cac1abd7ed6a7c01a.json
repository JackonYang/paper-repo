Unlike other related state of the art techniques which focus on either segmentation or pose estimation individually, our approach tackles these two tasks together. Normally, when optimizing for pose, it is traditional to use some fixed set of features, e.g. edges or chamfer maps. In contrast, our novel approach consists of optimizing a cost function based on a Markov Random Field (MRF). This has the advantage that we can use all the information in the image: edges, background and foreground appearances, as well as the prior information on the shape and pose of the subject and combine them in a Bayesian framework. Previously, optimizing such a cost function would have been computationally infeasible. However, our recent research in dynamic graph cuts allows this to be done much more efficiently than before. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on challenging motion sequences. Note that although we target the human pose inference problem in the paper, our method is completely generic and can be used to segment and infer the pose of any specified rigid, deformable or articulated object."

These approaches admit efficient inference algorithms while capturing the important kinematic constraints of the human body as a graphical model. These methods often fail however when multiple body parts fit the same image region resulting in global pose estimates that poorly explain the overall image evidence. Attempts to solve this problem have focused on the use of strong prior models that are limited to learned activities such as walking. We argue that the problem actually lies with the image observations and not with the prior. In particular, image evidence for each body part is estimated independently of other parts without regard to self-occlusion. To address this we introduce occlusion-sensitive local likelihoods that approximate the global image likelihood using per-pixel hidden binary variables that encode the occlusion relationships between parts. This occlusion reasoning introduces interactions between non-adjacent body parts creating loops in the underlying graphical model. We deal with this using an extension of an approximate belief propagation algorithm (PAMPAS). The algorithm recovers the real-valued 2D pose of the body in the presence of occlusions, does not require strong priors over body pose and does a quantitatively better job of explaining image evidence than previous methods."

Our approach requires neither an explicit body model nor prior labelling of body pans in the image. Instead, it recovers pose by direct nonlinear regression against shape descriptor vectors extracted automatically from image silhouettes. For robustness against local silhouette segmentation errors, silhouette shape is encoded by histogram-of-shape-contexts descriptors. For the main regression, we evaluate both regularized least squares and relevance vector machine (RVM) regressors over both linear and kernel bases. The RVM's provide much sparser regressors without compromising performance, and kernel bases give a small but worthwhile improvement in performance. For realism and good generalization with respect to viewpoints, we train the regressors on images resynthesized from real human motion capture data, and test it both quantitatively on similar independent test data, and qualitatively on a real image sequence.

We regard human actions as three-dimensional shapes induced by the silhouettes in the space-time volume. We adopt a recent approach by Gorelick et al. (2004) for analyzing 2D shapes and generalize it to deal with volumetric space-time action shapes. Our method utilizes properties of the solution to the Poisson equation to extract space-time features such as local space-time saliency, action dynamics, shape structure and orientation. We show that these features are useful for action recognition, detection and clustering. The method is fast, does not require video alignment and is applicable in (but not limited to) many scenarios where the background is known. Moreover, we demonstrate the robustness of our method to partial occlusions, non-rigid deformations, significant changes in scale and viewpoint, high irregularities in the performance of an action and low quality video"

No additional information is provided to the system, save a very rough initialization in the first frame of the training sequence. It can be used to detect the target object in each video frame independently. \n \nOur approach relies on a Randomized Tree-based approach to wide-baseline feature matching. Unlike previous classification-based appro- aches to 3\u2013D pose estimation, we do not require an a priori 3\u2013D model. Instead, our algorithm learns both geometry and appearance. In the process, it collects, or harvests, a list of features that can be reliably recognized even when large motions and aspect changes cause complex variations of feature appearances. This is made possible by the great flexibility of Randomized Trees, which lets us add and remove feature points to our list as needed with a minimum amount of extra computation."

This problem is hard because of the large number of degrees of freedom to be estimated. Following a established line of research, pose estimation is framed as inference in a probabilistic model. In our experience however, the success of many approaches often lie in the power of the features. Our primary contribution is a novel casting of visual inference as an iterative parsing process, where one sequentially learns better and better features tuned to a particular image. We show quantitative results for human pose estimation on a database of over 300 images that suggest our algorithm is competitive with or surpasses the state-of-the-art. Since our procedure is quite general (it does not rely on face or skin detection), we also use it to estimate the poses of horses in the Weizmann database."

Given regions of interest provided by users, the approach iteratively estimates segmentation via a generalized EM algorithm. Specifically, it encodes both spatial and color information in a nonparametric kernel density estimator, and incorporates local MRF constraints and global pose inferences to propagate beliefs over image space iteratively to determine a coherent segmentation. This ensures the segmented humans resemble the shapes of human poses. Additionally, a layered occlusion model and a probabilistic occlusion reasoning method are proposed to handle segmentation of multiple humans in occlusion. The approach is tested on a wide variety of images containing single or multiple occluded humans, and the segmentation performance is evaluated quantitatively."

Our method is applicable to any video containing piecewise parametric motion. The learnt model is a composition of layers, which consist of one or more segments. The shape of each segment is represented using a binary matte and its appearance is given by the rgb value for each point belonging to the matte. Included in the model are the effects of image projection, lighting, and motion blur. Furthermore, spatial continuity is explicitly modeled resulting in contiguous segments. Unlike previous approaches, our method does not use reference frame(s) for initialization. The two main contributions of our method are: (i)\u00a0A novel algorithm for obtaining the initial estimate of the model by dividing the scene into rigidly moving components using efficient loopy belief propagation; and (ii)\u00a0Refining the initial estimate using \u03b1\u03b2-swap and \u03b1-expansion algorithms, which guarantee a strong local minima. Results are presented on several classes of objects with different types of camera motion, e.g. videos of a human walking shot with static or translating cameras. We compare our method with the state of the art and demonstrate significant improvements.\n"

Our basic assumption is that people tend to take on certain canonical poses, even when performing unusual activities like throwing a baseball or figure skating. We build a person detector that quite accurately detects and localizes limbs of people in lateral walking poses. We use the estimated limbs from a detection to build a discriminative appearance model; we assume the features that discriminate a figure in one frame will discriminate the figure in other frames. We then use the models as limb detectors in a pictorial structure framework, detecting figures in unrestricted poses in both previous and successive frames. We have run our tracker on hundreds of thousands of frames, and present and apply a methodology for evaluating tracking on such a large scale. We test our tracker on real sequences including a feature-length film, an hour of footage from a public park, and various sports sequences. We find that we can quite accurately automatically find and track multiple people interacting with each other while performing fast and unusual motions."

We describe progress in harnessing these multiple exemplars in order to retrieve humans automatically in videos, given a query face in a shot. There are three areas of interest: (i) the matching of sets of exemplars provided by \u201ctubes\u201d of the spatial-temporal volume; (ii) the description of the face using a spatial orientation field; and, (iii) the structuring of the problem so that retrieval is immediate at run time. \n \nThe result is a person retrieval system, able to retrieve a ranked list of shots containing a particular person in the manner of Google.

Monocular 3D body tracking is challenging: besides the difficulty of matching an imperfect, highly flexible, self-occluding model to cluttered image features, realistic body models have at least 30 joint parameters subject to highly nonlinear physical constraints, and at least a third of these degrees of freedom are nearly unobservable in any given monocular image. For image matching we use a carefully designed robust cost metric combining robust optical flow, edge energy, and motion boundaries. The nonlinearities and matching ambiguities make the parameter-space cost surface multimodal, ill-conditioned and highly nonlinear, so searching it is difficult. We discuss the limitations of CONDENSATION-like samplers, and describe a novel hybrid search algorithm that combines inflated-covariance-scaled sampling and robust continuous optimization subject to physical constraints and model priors. Our experiments on challenging monocular sequences show that robust cost modeling, joint and self-intersection constraints, and informed sampling are all essential for reliable monocular 3D motion estimation."

The approach that we take is to use segmentation to guide our recognition algorithm to salient bits of the image. We use this segmentation approach to build limb and torso detectors, the outputs of which are assembled into human figures. We present quantitative results on torso localization, in addition to shortlisted full body configurations."

We propose a hierarchical model that can be characterized as a constellation of bags-of-features and that is able to combine both spatial and spatial-temporal features. Given a novel video sequence, the model is able to categorize human actions in a frame-by-frame basis. We test the model on a publicly available human action dataset [2] and show that our new method performs well on the classification task. We also conducted control experiments to show that the use of the proposed mixture of hierarchical models improves the classification performance over bag of feature models. An additional experiment shows that using both dynamic and static features provides a richer representation of human actions when compared to the use of a single feature type, as demonstrated by our evaluation in the classification task."

In this method, each human pose in an action sequence is represented by oriented rectangular patches extracted over the whole body. Then, spatial oriented histograms are formed to represent the distribution of these rectangular patches. In order to carry the information from the spatial domain described by the bag-of-rectangles descriptor to temporal domain for recognition of the actions, four different methods are proposed. These are namely, (i) frame by frame voting, which recognizes the actions by matching the descriptors of each frame, (ii) global histogramming, which extends the idea of Motion Energy Image proposed by Bobick and Davis by rectangular patches, (iii) a classifier based approach using SVMs, and (iv) adaptation of Dynamic Time Warping on the temporal representation of the descriptor. The detailed experiments are carried out on the action dataset of Blank et. al. High success rates (100%) prove that with a very simple and compact representation, we can achieve robust recognition of human actions, compared to complex representations."

                "text": "Recently, the generative modeling approach to video segmentation has been gaining popularity in the computer vision community. For example, the flexible sprites framework has been studied in, among other references, [11,13,14,24]. In general, detailed generative models are vulnerable to intractability of inference and local minima problems when approximations are made (see, e.g., [25]). Recent approaches to dealing with these problems focused on inference techniques for increasingly more expressive models. Simpler models, on the other hand, while less precise, are often not just faster, but less prone to local minima. In addition, while many different models may be based on similar hidden variables, some models may be more amenable to inference of some of the shared variables, while other models lead to efficient and accurate inference of other components of the hierarchical data description. In this paper, we empirically illustrate that forcing multiple models to share the posterior distribution leads to inference less prone to local minima. We define a set of key hidden variables that describe aspects of the data that we care about. The relationships among these key variables are defined through multiple conditional distribution models on the same pairs of variables, controlled by switch variables. The posterior distribution over the key hidden variables is shared, and inference of the switch variables serves as a mechanism for combinatorial model selection. The key observation here is that while the most expressive model often ends up a winner by the end of the iterative learning of model parameters, early iterations are dominated by simpler model components, and upon convergence, the free energy is lower than the ones reached by switching on all the most complex components from the beginning of the learning. We illustrate the performance of this approach on the unsupervised video segmentation task."

The tracker recovers the affine transformation of the region and therefore yields reliable point correspondences between frames. Both edges and texture information are exploited in an integrated way, while not requiring the complete region's contour. The tracker withstands zoom, out-of-plane rotations, discontinuous motion and changes in illumination conditions while achieving real-time performance for a region. Multiple tracked regions are grouped into disjoint coplanarity classes. We first define a coplanarity score between each pair of regions, based on motion and texture cues. The scores are then analyzed by a clique-partitioning algorithm yielding the coplanarity classes that best fit the data. The method works in the presence of perspective distortions, discontinuous planar surfaces and considerable amounts of measurement noise."

It will be seen that this is related in turn to methods for learning sprite based representations of an image. The method we describe involves a new generative model for performing segmentation on a set of images. Included in this model are the effects of motion blur and occlusion. An initial estimate of the parameters of the model is obtained by dividing the scene into rigidly moving components. The estimate of the matte of each part is refined using a variation of the \u03b1-expansion graph cut algorithm. This method has the advantage of achieving a strong local minimum over labels. Results are demonstrated on animals for which an articulated LPS representation is naturally suited."

Our method is based on automatically clustering the body pose space into connected regions exhibiting similar dynamical characteristics, modelling the dynamics in each region as a Gaussian autoregressive process. Activities that would require large numbers of exemplars in example based methods are covered by comparatively few motion models. Different regions correspond roughly to different action-fragments and our class inference scheme allows for smooth transitions between these, thus making it useful for activity recognition tasks. The method is used to track activities including walking, running, etc., using a planar 2D body model. Its effectiveness is demonstrated by its success in tracking complicated motions like turns, without any key frames or 3D information."

What is correlated across images (or across video sequences) is the internal layout of local self-similarities (up to some distortions), even though the patterns generating those local self-similarities are quite different in each of the images/videos. These internal self-similarities are efficiently captured by a compact local \"self-similarity descriptor\"', measured densely throughout the image/video, at multiple scales, while accounting for local and global geometric distortions. This gives rise to matching capabilities of complex visual data, including detection of objects in real cluttered images using only rough hand-sketches, handling textured objects with no clear boundaries, and detecting complex actions in cluttered video data with no prior learning. We compare our measure to commonly used image-based and video-based similarity measures, and demonstrate its applicability to object detection, retrieval, and action detection."

Our work is motivated by the pictorial structure models introduced by Fischler and Elschlager. The basic idea is to represent an object by a collection of parts arranged in a deformable configuration. The appearance of each part is modeled separately, and the deformable configuration is represented by spring-like connections between pairs of parts. These models allow for qualitative descriptions of visual appearance, and are suitable for generic recognition problems. We address the problem of using pictorial structure models to find instances of an object in an image as well as the problem of learning an object model from training examples, presenting efficient algorithms in both cases. We demonstrate the techniques by learning models that represent faces and human bodies and using the resulting models to locate the corresponding objects in novel images."

Classical image segmentation tools use either texture (colour) information, e.g. Magic Wand, or edge (contrast) information, e.g. Intelligent Scissors. Recently, an approach based on optimization by graph-cut has been developed which successfully combines both types of information. In this paper we extend the graph-cut approach in three respects. First, we have developed a more powerful, iterative version of the optimisation. Secondly, the power of the iterative algorithm is used to simplify substantially the user interaction needed for a given quality of result. Thirdly, a robust algorithm for \"border matting\" has been developed to estimate simultaneously the alpha-matte around an object boundary and the colours of foreground pixels. We show that for moderately difficult examples the proposed method outperforms competitive tools."

We study the influence of each stage of the computation on performance, concluding that fine-scale gradients, fine orientation binning, relatively coarse spatial binning, and high-quality local contrast normalization in overlapping descriptor blocks are all important for good results. The new approach gives near-perfect separation on the original MIT pedestrian database, so we introduce a more challenging dataset containing over 1800 annotated human images with a large range of pose variations and backgrounds."

The benefit of the single histograms is that they are much more efficient both in terms of memory and computational resources; and (ii) we show that bag of visual words histograms can provide an accurate pixel-wise segmentation of an image into object class regions. In this manner the compact models of visual object classes give simultaneous segmentation and recognition of image regions. \n \nThe approach is evaluated on the MSRC database [5] and it is shown that performance equals or is superior to previous publications on this database."
