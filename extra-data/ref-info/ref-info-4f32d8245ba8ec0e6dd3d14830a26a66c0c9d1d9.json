The technique is based on active contours evolving in time according to intrinsic geometric measures of the image. The evolving contours naturally split and merge, allowing the simultaneous detection of several objects and both interior and exterior boundaries. The proposed approach is based on the relation between active contours and the computation of geodesics or minimal distance curves. The minimal distance curve lays in a Riemannian space whose metric is defined by the image content. This geodesic approach for object segmentation allows to connect classical \u201csnakes\u201d based on energy minimization and geometric active contours based on the theory of curve evolution. Previous models of geometric active contours are improved, allowing stable boundary detection when their gradients suffer from large variations, including gaps. Formal results concerning existence, uniqueness, stability, and correctness of the evolution are presented as well. The scheme was implemented using an efficient algorithm for curve evolution. Experimental results of applying the scheme to real images including objects with holes and medical data imagery demonstrate its power. The results may be extended to 3D object segmentation as well."

The major restriction is that the energy function's smoothness term must only involve pairs of pixels. We propose two algorithms that use graph cuts to compute a local minimum even when very large moves are allowed. The first move we consider is an /spl alpha/-/spl beta/-swap: for a pair of labels /spl alpha/,/spl beta/, this move exchanges the labels between an arbitrary set of pixels labeled a and another arbitrary set labeled /spl beta/. Our first algorithm generates a labeling such that there is no swap move that decreases the energy. The second move we consider is an /spl alpha/-expansion: for a label a, this move assigns an arbitrary set of pixels the label /spl alpha/. Our second algorithm, which requires the smoothness term to be a metric, generates a labeling such that there is no expansion move that decreases the energy. Moreover, this solution is within a known factor of the global minimum. We experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on image restoration, stereo and motion."

We then make use of a new efficient numerical method to find this shortest path.It is shown that the proposed energy, though based only on a potential integrated along the curve, imposes a regularization effect like snakes. We explore the relation between the maximum curvature along the resulting contour and the potential generated from the image.The method is capable to close contours, given only one point on the objects' boundary by using a topology-based saddle search routine.We show examples of our method applied to real aerial and medical images."

The scheme is based on geometric deformable surfaces moving towards the objects to be detected. We show that this model is related to the computation of surfaces of minimal area (local minimal surfaces). The space where these surfaces are computed is induced from the three dimensional image in which the objects are to be detected. The general approach also shows the relation between classical deformable surfaces obtained via energy minimization and geometric ones derived from curvature flows in the surface evolution framework. The scheme is stable, robust, and automatically handles changes in the surface topology during the deformation. Results related to existence, uniqueness, stability, and correctness of the solution to this geometric deformable model are presented as well. Based on an efficient numerical algorithm for surface evolution, we present a number of examples of object detection in real and synthetic images.\n"

This framework integrates boundary- and region-based frame partition modules under a curve-based objective function, which aims at finding a set of minimal length curves that preserve three main properties: (i) they are regular and smooth, (ii) they are attracted by the boundary points (boundary-based information), (iii) and they create a partition that is optimal according to the expected region properties of the different hypotheses (region-based information). The defined objective function is minimized using a gradient descent method. According to the obtained motion equations, the set of initial curves is propagated toward the best partition under the influence of boundary- and region-based forces, and is constrained by a regularity force. The changes of topology are naturally handled thanks to the level set implementation. Furthermore, a coupled multiphase propagation that imposes the idea of mutually exclusive propagating curves and increases the robustness as well as the convergence rate is proposed. The proposed framework has been validated using three important applications in computer vision, the tasks of image and supervised texture segmentation in low-level vision and the task of motion estimation and tracking in motion analysis."

The data to be clustered are represented by an undirected adjacency graph G with arc capacities assigned to reflect the similarity between the linked vertices. Clustering is achieved by removing arcs of G to form mutually exclusive subgraphs such that the largest inter-subgraph maximum flow is minimized. For graphs of moderate size ( approximately 2000 vertices), the optimal solution is obtained through partitioning a flow and cut equivalent tree of G, which can be efficiently constructed using the Gomory-Hu algorithm (1961). However for larger graphs this approach is impractical. New theorems for subgraph condensation are derived and are then used to develop a fast algorithm which hierarchically constructs and partitions a partially equivalent tree of much reduced size. This algorithm results in an optimal solution equivalent to that obtained by partitioning the complete equivalent tree and is able to handle very large graphs with several hundred thousand vertices. The new clustering algorithm is applied to the image segmentation problem. The segmentation is achieved by effectively searching for closed contours of edge elements (equivalent to minimum cuts in G), which consist mostly of strong edges, while rejecting contours containing isolated strong edges. This method is able to accurately locate region boundaries and at the same time guarantees the formation of closed edge contours. >"

Multi-camera scene reconstruction is a natural generalization of the stereo matching problem. However, it is much more difficult than stereo, primarily due to the difficulty of reasoning about visibility. In this paper, we take an approach that has yielded excellent results for stereo, namely energy minimization via graph cuts. We first give an energy minimization formulation of the multi-camera scene reconstruction problem. The energy that we minimize treats the input images symmetrically, handles visibility properly, and imposes spatial smoothness while preserving discontinuities. As the energy function is NP-hard to minimize exactly, we give a graph cut algorithm that computes a local minimum in a strong sense. We handle all camera configurations where voxel coloring can be used, which is a large and natural class. Experimental data demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach."

Our main tool is separation of each pixel p from a special point outside the image by a cut of a minimum cost. Such a cut creates a group of pixels C/sub p/ around each pixel. We show that these groups C/sub p/ are either disjoint or nested in each other and so they give a natural segmentation of the image. In addition this property allows an efficient implementation of the algorithms because for most pixels p the computation of C/sub p/ is not performed on the whole graph. We inspect all C/sub p/ and discard those which are not interesting, for example if they are too small. This procedure automatically groups small components together or merges them into nearby large clusters. Effectively, our segmentation is performed by extracting significant non-intersecting closed contours. We present interesting segmentation results on real and artificial images."

We analyze and propose enhancement techniques that selectively smooth images while preserving either the multi-channel edges or the orientation-dependent texture features in them. Images are treated as manifolds in a feature-space. This geometrical interpretation lead to a general way for grey level, color, movies, volumetric medical data, and color-texture image enhancement.We first review our framework in which the Polyakov action from high-energy physics is used to develop a minimization procedure through a geometric flow for images. Here we show that the geometric flow, based on manifold volume minimization, yields a novel enhancement procedure for color images. We apply the geometric framework and the general Beltrami flow to feature-preserving denoising of images in various spaces.Next, we introduce a new method for color and texture enhancement. Motivated by Gabor's geometric image sharpening method (Gabor, Laboratory Investigation, 14(6):801\u2013807, 1965), we present a geometric sharpening procedure for color images with texture. It is based on inverse diffusion across the multi-channel edge, and diffusion along the edge."

The user marks certain pixels as \"object\" or \"background\" to provide hard constraints for segmentation. Additional soft constraints incorporate both boundary and region information. Graph cuts are used to find the globally optimal segmentation of the N-dimensional image. The obtained solution gives the best balance of boundary and region properties among all segmentations satisfying the constraints. The topology of our segmentation is unrestricted and both \"object\" and \"background\" segments may consist of several isolated parts. Some experimental results are presented in the context of photo/video editing and medical image segmentation. We also demonstrate an interesting Gestalt example.

The combinatorial optimization literature provides many min-cut/max-flow algorithms with different polynomial time complexity. Their practical efficiency, however, has to date been studied mainly outside the scope of computer vision. The goal of this paper is to provide an experimental comparison of the efficiency of min-cut/max flow algorithms for applications in vision. We compare the running times of several standard algorithms, as well as a new algorithm that we have recently developed. The algorithms we study include both Goldberg-Tarjan style \"push -relabel\" methods and algorithms based on Ford-Fulkerson style \"augmenting paths.\" We benchmark these algorithms on a number of typical graphs in the contexts of image restoration, stereo, and segmentation. In many cases, our new algorithm works several times faster than any of the other methods, making near real-time performance possible. An implementation of our max-flow/min-cut algorithm is available upon request for research purposes."

The book contains a wealth of results, from different mathematical disciplines, which are presented here in a unified and comprehensive manner. Geometric representations and methods turn out to be the linking theme. This book will provide a unique and invaluable source for researchers and graduate students. From the Reviews: \"This book is definitely a milestone in the literature of integer programming and combinatorial optimization. It draws from the interdisciplinarity of these fields as it gathers methods and results from polytope theory, geometry of numbers, probability theory, design and graph theory around two objects, cuts and metrics. [ ] The book is very nicely written [ ] The book is also very well structured. With knowledge about the relevant terms, one can enjoy special subsections without being entirely familiar with the rest of the chapter. This makes it not only an interesting research book but even a dictionary. [ ] In my opinion, the book is a beautiful piece of work. The longer one works with it, the more beautiful it becomes.\" Robert Weismantel, Optima 56 (1997) \" In short, this is a very interesting book which is nice to have.\" Alexander I. Barvinok, MR 1460488 (98g:52001) \" This is a large and fascinating book. As befits a book which contains material relevant to so many areas of mathematics (and related disciplines such as statistics, physics, computing science, and economics), it is self-contained and written in a readable style. Moreover, the index, bibliography, and table of contents are all that they should be in such a work; it is easy to find as much or as little introductory material as needed.\" R.Dawson, Zentralblatt MATH Database 0885.52001"

This transformation effectively removes explicit use of epipolar geometry, thus allowing direct use of multiple cameras with arbitrary geometries. The maximum-flow, solved both efficiently and globally, yields a minimum-cut that corresponds to a disparity surface for the whole image at once. This global and efficient approach to stereo analysis allows the reconstruction to proceed in an arbitrary volume of space and provides a more accurate and coherent depth map than the traditional stereo algorithms. In particular, smoothness is applied uniformly instead of only along epipolar lines, while the global optimality of the depth surface is guaranteed. Results show improved depth estimation as well as better handling of depth discontinuities. While the worst case running time is O(n1.5 d1.5 log(nd)), the observed average running time is O(n1.2 d1.3) for an image size of n pixels and depth resolution d."

In our approach, patch regions from a sample image or video are transformed and copied to the output and then stitched together along optimal seams to generate a new (and typically larger) output. In contrast to other techniques, the size of the patch is not chosen a-priori, but instead a graph cut technique is used to determine the optimal patch region for any given offset between the input and output texture. Unlike dynamic programming, our graph cut technique for seam optimization is applicable in any dimension. We specifically explore it in 2D and 3D to perform video texture synthesis in addition to regular image synthesis. We present approximative offset search techniques that work well in conjunction with the presented patch size optimization. We show results for synthesizing regular, random, and natural images and videos. We also demonstrate how this method can be used to interactively merge different images to generate new scenes."

(1987) proposed an approach to detect the contour regions of complex shapes, assuming a user selected initial contour not very far from the desired solution. We propose to further explore the information provided by the user's selected points and apply an optimal method to detect contours which allows a segmentation of the image. The method is based on dynamic programming (DP), and applies to a wide variety of shapes. It is exact and not iterative. We also consider a multiscale approach capable of speeding up the algorithm by a factor of 20, although at the expense of losing the guaranteed optimality characteristic. The problem of tracking and matching these contours is addressed. For tracking, the final contour obtained at one frame is sampled and used as initial points for the next frame. Then, the same DP process is applied. For matching, a novel strategy is proposed where the solution is a smooth displacement field in which unmatched regions are allowed while cross vectors are not. The algorithm is again based on DP and the optimal solution is guaranteed. We have demonstrated the algorithms on natural objects in a large spectrum of applications, including interactive segmentation and automatic tracking of the regions of interest in medical images. >"

The book begins with a description of implicit surfaces and their basic properties, then devises the level set geometry and calculus toolbox, including the construction of signed distance functions. Part II adds dynamics to this static calculus. Topics include the level set equation itself, Hamilton-Jacobi equations, motion of a surface normal to itself, re-initialization to a signed distance function, extrapolation in the normal direction, the particle level set method and the motion of co-dimension two (and higher) objects. Part III is concerned with topics taken from the fields of Image Processing and Computer Vision. These include the restoration of images degraded by noise and blur, image segmentation with active contours (snakes), and reconstruction of surfaces from unorganized data points. Part IV is dedicated to Computational Physics. It begins with one phase compressible fluid dynamics, then two-phase compressible flow involving possibly different equations of state, detonation and deflagration waves, and solid/fluid structure interaction. Next it discusses incompressible fluid dynamics, including a computer graphics simulation of smoke, free surface flows, including a computer graphics simulation of water, and fully two-phase incompressible flow. Additional related topics include incompressible flames with applications to computer graphics and coupling a compressible and incompressible fluid. Finally, heat flow and Stefan problems are discussed. A student or researcher working in mathematics, computer graphics, science, or engineering interested in any dynamic moving front, which might change its topology or develop singularities, will find this book interesting and useful."

Rather than focusing on local features and their consistencies in the image data, our approach aims at extracting the global impression of an image. We treat image segmentation as a graph partitioning problem and propose a novel global criterion, the normalized cut, for segmenting the graph. The normalized cut criterion measures both the total dissimilarity between the different groups as well as the total similarity within the groups. We show that an efficient computational technique based on a generalized eigenvalue problem can be used to optimize this criterion. We have applied this approach to segmenting static images and found results very encouraging."

Some of this work is motivated by practical considerations: Large data sets (coming e.g. from computational molecular biology, brain research or data mining) can be viewed as large metric spaces that should be analyzed (e.g. correctly clustered).On the other hand, these investigations connect to some classical areas of geometry - the asymptotic theory of finite-dimensional normed spaces and differential geometry. Finally, the metric theory of finite graphs has proved very useful in the study of graphs per se and the design of approximation algorithms for hard computational problems. In this talk I will try to explain some of the results and review some of the emerging new connections and the many fascinating open problems in this area."

Snakes provide a unified account of a number of visual problems, including detection of edges, lines, and subjective contours; motion tracking; and stereo matching. We have used snakes successfully for interactive interpretation, in which user-imposed constraint forces guide the snake near features of interest."
