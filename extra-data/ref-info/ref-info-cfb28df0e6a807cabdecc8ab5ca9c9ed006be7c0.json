The application is hand-printed character recognition. Two versions of the system are described. One uses a backpropagation network that scans exhaustively over a field of characters and is trained to recognize whether it is centered over a single character or between characters. When it is centered over a character, the net classifies the character. The approach is tested on a dataset of hand-printed digits. Very low error rates are reported. The second version, COISR-SACCADE, avoids the need for exhaustive scans. The net is trained as before, but also is trained to compute ballistic 'eye' movements that enable the input window to jump from one character to the next."

However, their recognition accuracy has been limited by the accuracy of the underlying segmentation algorithm. Conventional, rule-based segmentation algorithms encounter difficulty if the characters are touching, broken, or noisy. The problem in these situations is that often one cannot properly segment a character until it is recognized yet one cannot properly recognize a character until it is segmented. We present here a neural network algorithm that simultaneously segments and recognizes in an integrated system. This algorithm has several novel features: it uses a supervised learning algorithm (backpropagation), but is able to take position-independent information as targets and self-organize the activities of the units in a competitive fashion to infer the positional information. We demonstrate this ability with overlapping handprinted numerals."

Integrated segmentation and recognition is necessary when characters overlap or touch, or when an individual character is broken up. The first approach exhaustively scans a field of characters, effectively creating a possible segmentation at each scan point. A neural net is trained to both identify when its input window is centered over a character, and if it is, to classify the character. This approach is similar to most recently advanced approaches to integrating segmentation and recognition, and has the common flaw of generating too many possible segmentations to be truly efficient. The second approach overcomes this weakness without reducing accuracy by training a neural network to mimic the ballistic and corrective saccades (eye movements) of human vision. A single neural net learns to jump from character to character, making corrective jumps when necessary, and to classify the centered character when properly fixated. The significant aspect of this system is that the neural net learns to both control what is in its input window as well as to recognize what is in the window. High accuracy results are reported for a standard database of handprinted digits for both approaches."

We report on results of training nets with samples of hand-printed digits scanned off of bank checks and hand-printed letters interactively entered into a computer through a stylus digitizer. Given a large training set, and a net with sufficient capacity to achieve high performance on the training set, nets typically achieved error rates of 4-5% at a 0% reject rate and 1-2% at a 10% reject rate. The topology and capacity of the system, as measured by the number of connections in the net, have surprisingly little effect on generalization. For those developing practical pattern recognition systems, these results suggest that a large and representative training sample may be the single, most important factor in achieving high recognition accuracy. From a scientific standpoint, these results raise doubts about the relevance to backpropagation of learning models that estimate the likelihood of high generalization from estimates of capacity. Reducing capacity does have other benefits however, especially when the reduction is accomplished by using local receptive fields with shared weights. In this latter case, we find the net evolves feature detectors resembling those in visual cortex and Linsker's orientation-selective nodes."

Exploiting the hidden structure of these small phonemic subcategory networks, they propose several technique that make it possible to grow larger nets in an incremental and modular fashion without loss in recognition performance and without the need for excessive training time or additional data. The techniques include class discriminatory learning, connectionist glue, selective/partial learning, and all-net fine tuning. A set of experiments shows that stop consonant networks (BDGPTK) constructed from subcomponent BDG- and PTK-nets achieved up to 98.6% correct recognition compared to 98.3 and 98.7% correct for the BDG- and PTK-nets. Similarly, an incrementally trained network aimed at all consonants achieved recognition scores of about 96% correct. These results are comparable to the performance of the subcomponent networks and significantly better than that of several alternative speech recognition methods. >"

However, this approach is highly labor intensive since each entry and rule must be hand-crafted.

The distributed internal representations of the phonological regularities discovered by the network are damage resistant."
