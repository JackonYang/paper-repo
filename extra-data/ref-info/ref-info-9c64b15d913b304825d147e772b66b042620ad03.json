We present an approach that integrates a relational database retrieval system with a color analysis technique. The Chabot project was initiated at our university to study storage and retrieval of a vast collection of digitized images. These images are from the State of California Department of Water Resources. The goal was to integrate a relational database retrieval system with content analysis techniques that would give our querying system a better method for handling images. Our simple color analysis method, if used in conjunction with other search criteria, improves our ability to retrieve images efficiently. The best result is obtained when text-based search criteria are combined with content-based criteria and when a coarse granularity is used for content analysis. >"

The broad objective of this work has been to achieve retrieval of images from large unconstrained databases using image content. The problem is typified by the need to locate a target image within a database where no numerical indexing terms exist. Here, retrieval is based on important features within in an image and uses sample images or user sketches to specify a query. A typical query might be framed as \"Find all images similar to this one\", for example. The aim of this work has been to show how neural networks can provide a practical, flexible and robust solution to this problem. A neural network is basically an adaptive information filter which can be used to extract the salient characteristics of a data set during a training phase. The transformation learnt by the network can map the images into compact indices which support very rapid fuzzy matching of images across the database. This learning process optimises the performance of the code with respect to the contents of the database. We assess the applicability of several neural network architectures and learning rules for a practical coding scheme and investigate how the system parameters affect the performance of the system. We introduce a novel learning law which has a number of advantages over existing paradigms. In-depth mathematical . analysis and extensive empirical tests are used to corroborate the arguments presented throughout. This thesis aims to show the nature of the image retrieval problem, how current research trends attempt to tackle it and how neural networks can offer us a real alternative to conventional approaches."

Potential applications include medical (`Give me other images that contain a tumor with a texture like this one'), photo-journalism (`Give me images that have blue at the top and red at the bottom'), and many others in art, fashion, cataloging, retailing, and industry. Key issues include derivation and computation of attributes of images and objects that provide useful query functionality, retrieval methods based on similarity as opposed to exact match, query by image example or user drawn image, the user interfaces, query refinement and navigation, high dimensional database indexing, and automatic and semi-automatic database population. We currently have a prototype system written in X/Motif and C running on an RS/6000 that allows a variety of queries, and a test database of over 1000 images and 1000 objects populated from commercially available photo clip art images.

In its simplest form, the similar-shape retrieval problem can be stated as, \"retrieve or select all shapes or images that are visually similar to the query shape or the query image's shape\". We focus on databases of 2D shapes-or equivalently, databases of images of flat or almost flat objects. (We use the terms \"object\" and \"shape\" interchangeably). Two common types of 2D objects are rigid objects, which have a single rigid component called a link, and articulated objects, which have two or more rigid components joined by movable (rotating or sliding) joints. An ideal similar-shape retrieval technique must be general enough to handle images of articulated as well as rigid objects. It must be flexible enough to handle simple query images, which have isolated shapes, and complex query images, which have partially visible, overlapping or touching objects. We discuss the central issues in similar-shape retrieval and explain how these issues are resolved in a shape retrieval scheme called FIBSSR (Feature Index-Based Similar-Shape Retrieval). This new similar-shape retrieval system effectively models real-world applications. >"

In the index we store the cumulative color histograms. The L1-, L2-, L(infinity )-distance between two cumulative color histograms can be used to define a similarity measure of these two color distributions. We show that this method produces slightly better results than color histogram methods, but it is significantly more robust with respect to the quantization parameter of the histograms. The second technique is an example of a new approach to color indexing. Instead of storing the complete color distributions, the index contains only their dominant features. We implement this approach by storing the first three moments of each color channel of an image in the index, i.e., for a HSV image we store only 9 floating point numbers per image. The similarity function which is used for the retrieval is a weighted sum of the absolute differences between corresponding moments. Our tests clearly demonstrate that a retrieval based on this technique produces better results and runs faster than the histogram-based methods."

In this paper we determine the limits of these color indexing techniques. We propose two functions to measure the discrimination power of indexing techniques: the capacity (how many distinguishable histograms can be stored) and the maximal match number (the maximal number of retrieved images). We derive bounds for these functions. These bounds have two practical aspects. First, they help a user to decide whether color histograms effectively index database images from a given domain. Second, they facilitate the choice of a good threshold for the distance below which histograms are considered similar. Our arguments are based on an analysis of the metrical properties of the histogram space and results from coding theory. The results show that over a large range of reasonable parameters the capacity is very large. Thus, the set of parameters for which color indexing works well can be described as the set of parameters for which the maximal match number is below an application-dependent maximum."

The algorithm is based on the steerable filters of Freeman and Adelson (IEEE Trans. PAMI 13, 891-906, 1991), orientation-selective filters derived from derivatives of Gaussians. The filters are applied over multiple scales and their outputs non-linearly contrast-normalized. The data for humans were collected from forty subjects who were asked to identify 'the minimum number of dominant orientations' they perceived, and the 'strength' with which they perceived each orientation. Test data consisted of 111 grey-level images of natural textures taken from the Brodatz album, a standard collection used in computer vision and image processing. Results show that the computer and humans chose at least one of the same dominant orientations on 95 of the natural textures. Of these textures, 74 were also in 100% agreement on the location of all the dominant orientations chosen by both humans and computer. Disagreements are analyzed and possible causes are discussed. Some apparent limitations in the current filter shapes and sizes are illustrated, as well as some (surprisingly small) effects believed to be caused by semantic recognition and gestalt grouping."

In the decade since it was begun, however, attitudes toward the use of terminology to describe visual images and museum objects have changed, impelling AAT constructors to develop policies that would make the thesaurus flexible enough to meet the needs of a new generation of database producers. This article describes the processes and policies that were developed to construct a language that would represent knowledge in the field of art and architecture as well as be surrogates for the images and objects being described.

We approximated in computational form six basic textural features, namely, coarseness, contrast, directionality, line-likeness, regularity, and roughness. In comparison with psychological measurements for human subjects, the computational measures gave good correspondences in rank correlation of 16 typical texture patterns. Similarity measurements using these features were attempted. The discrepancies between human vision and computerized techniques that we encountered in this study indicate fundamental problems in digital analysis of textures. Some of them could be overcome by analyzing their causes and using more sophisticated techniques."

Single-trial learning tasks were employed throughout, with memory performance assessed by forced-choice recognition, recall measures or choice reaction-time tasks. The main experimental findings were: (I) memory capacity, as a function of the amount of material presented, follows a general power law with a characteristic exponent for each task; (2) pictorial material obeys this power law and shows an overall superiority to verbal material. The capacity of recognition memory for pictures is almost limitless, when measured under appropriate conditions; (3) when the recognition task is made harder by using more alternatives, memory capacity stays constant and the superiority of pictures is maintained; (4) picture memory also exceeds verbal memory in terms of verbal recall; comparable recognition/recall ratios are obtained for pictures, words and nonsense syllables; ( 5 ) verbal memory shows a higher retrieval speed than picture memory, as inferred from reaction-time measures. Both types of material obey a power law, when reaction-time is measured for various sizes of learning set, and both show very rapid rates of memory search. From a consideration of the experimental results and other data it is concluded that the superiority of the pictorial mode in recognition and free recall learning tasks is well established and cannot be attributed to methodological artifact."

Each of these reviews concludes by examining the directions for future experiments; the subsequent article then often describes that research. The series of four articles permits the reader to get a sense of the length of time, the number of researchers, and the huge effort necessary to make significant advances. The book is written at a level which can be understood by anyone with some background in biology. It assumes very little, and most articles are self-explanatory. As Friedberg is careful to point out, this book is not meant to cover all of cancer biology rigorously or comprehensively, but instead to convey several important concepts. As such, it is an excellent, easily read volume for anyone, especially students, wishing to learn about cancer biology; it would be very useful as a fast overview of the field which will make subsequent reading of more detailed articles much easier. So well written and easy to read that it is both enjoyable and informative, this book is highly recommended to anyone interested in learning about cancer biology."
