Our main purpose is to show that advances in computer technology and computer science compel renewed interest. N-tuple features are useful for printed character classification because they indicate the presence or absence of a given rigid configuration of n black and white pixels in a pattern. Desirable n-tuples fit each pattern of a specified (positive) training set of characters in at least p different shift positions, and fail to fit each pattern of a specified (negative) training set by at least n-q pixels in each shift position. We prove that the problem of finding a distinguishing n-tuple is NP-complete, by examining a natural subproblem with binary strings called the missing configuration problem. The NP-completeness result notwithstanding, distinguishing n-tuples are found automatically in a few seconds on contemporary workstations. We exhibit a practical search algorithm for generating, from a small training set, a collection of n-tuples with low class-conditional correlation and with specified design parameters n, p, and q. The generator, which is available on the Internet, is empirically shown to be effective through a comparison with a benchmark generator. We show experimentally that the design parameters provide a useful tradeoff between distinguishing power and generation time, and also between the conditional probabilities for the positive and negative classes. We explore the feature probabilities obtainable for various dichotomies, and show that the design parameters control the feature probabilities."

Polygonal approximations have the disadvantage that they introduce significant ambiguities. In particular, vertices may correspond either to real corners or to approximations of smooth arcs. We propose a method that relies on topographic features and, in particular, ridge lines. The information about ridge line directions obtained from the underlying surface of the gray tone is used to discriminate between arcs and straight lines. Normally, ridge lines are centered within character strokes, forming skeleton-like ribbons with generally no more than three pixels in width. For each ridge pixel, the tangent direction of the ridge line at the pixel is calculated. These computed tangent directions are then used in the detection of sharp corners and junctions, in the line tracking process, and in the feature decomposition process. Decomposition is achieved using curvature primitives and singular points. The result of the method is a relational feature graph which gives a compact and flexible description of the shapes of the objects in the input image. By not using a conventional thinning algorithm and performing arc and straight line decomposition without a usual polygonal approximation step, our method is able to reduce some artifacts of conventional thinning and to eliminate completely the ambiguities resulting from polygonal approximations."

This paper extends the approach, as well as an initial work on mutual invariants recognizers, to the recognition of objects too complicated to be represented by a single polynomial. Hence, an object to be recognized is partitioned into patches, each patch is represented by a single implicit polynomial, mutual invariants are computed for pairs of polynomials for pairs of patches, and the object recognition is via a Bayesian recognition of vectors of self and mutual invariants. We discuss why the complete object geometry can be captured by the geometry of pairs of patches, how to design mutual invariants, and how to match patches in the data with those in the database at a low computational cost. The approach is a low computational cost recognition of partially occluded articulated objects in an arbitrary position and in noise by recognizing the self or joint geometry of one or more patches."

Curves and surfaces can be defined either parametrically or implicitly, with the latter representation used here. A planar curve is the set of zeros of a smooth function of two variables x-y, a surface is the set of zeros of a smooth function of three variables x-y-z, and a space curve is the intersection of two surfaces, which are the set of zeros of two linearly independent smooth functions of three variables x-y-z For example, the surface of a complex object in 3-D can be represented as a subset of a single implicit surface, with similar results for planar and space curves. It is shown how this unified representation can be used for object recognition, object position estimation, and segmentation of objects into meaningful subobjects, that is, the detection of 'interest regions' that are more complex than high curvature regions and, hence, more useful as features for object recognition. >"
