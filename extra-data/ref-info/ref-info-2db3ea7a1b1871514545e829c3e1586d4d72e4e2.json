A thesaurus is a large collection of words, each of which is assigned to one or more semantic groups. The importance of thesauri for applications in library information storage and retrieval is evident from the number of centres interested in them. (No less than 24 centres are listed in the index of Current Research in Scientific Documentation No. 13, and thesuri in 10 disciplines are mentioned specifically.) \n The present paper describes aspects of an attempt to generate groups of words by purely mechanical means, which seem to have strong semantic connections within groups and which, therefore, are of potential value as thesauri. The lexicographer plays no part at all, and therefore no semantic processes can be used. However, the machine can make very many more binary decisions than a lexicographer, and there is the possibility that a machine generated \u201cthesaurus\u201d is at least as valuable for document processing as a man-made one."

The key to this ability lies in the application of a statistical formula by which the computer calculates the degree of association between pairs of index terms. With proper manipulation of these associations (entirely within the machine) a vocabulary of synonyms, near synonyms and other words closely related to any given term or group of terms is derived. Such a vocabulary related to a group of request terms is believed to be a much more powerful tool for selecting documents from a collection than has been available heretofore. By noting the number of matching terms between this extended list of request terms and the terms used to index a document, and with due regard for their degree of association, documents are selected by the computer and arranged in the order of their relevance to the request. Like all other documentalists who are operating large coordinate indexes, we are searching for better ways to exploit this type of information system. In our library we have already eliminated the time-consuming job of posting document numbers manually by enlisting the aid of a 705 computer. (The computer periodically prepares revised posting cards to replace the outdated ones.) Now we are searching for better solutions to our retrieval problems. One obvious retrieval problem in any large system is the time required to \"coordinate\" heavily posted terms. We are convinced we must mechanize if we are to allow our collection to grow indefinitely. A second problem is the retrieval of so many documents related to a single request that the customer finds it difficult to decide which to examine first. Since he has no precise means of determining which document is most closely related to a request, we have been forced into assisting him to use somewhat arbitrary or subjective means. The date of the document is sometimes used as a relevance criterion with the hope that the most recent document will be the most pertinent, or the name of the author is used with the hope that a known author will answer the request better than an unknown one. The pitfalls of such criteria are apparent. The third, and \u2026"

The total text consisted of approximately 50,000 words of which nearly 6,800 were unique words. The computer program arranged these words in order of frequency of occurrence. From the list of words which occurred 20 or more times, excluding syntactical terms, such as, and, but, of, etc., the investigator selected 90 words for use as index terms. These were arranged in a data matrix with the terms on the horizontal and the document number on the vertical axis. The cells contained the number of times the term was used in the document. Based on these data, a correlation matrix, 90x90 in size, was computed which showed the relationship of each term to every other term. The matrix was factor analyzed and the first 10 eigenvectors were selected as factors. These were rotated for meaning and interpreted as major categories in a classification system. These factors were compared with, and shown to be compatible but not identical to, the classification system used by the American Psychological Association. The results demonstrate the feasibility of an empirically derived classification system and establish the value of factor analysis as a technique in language data processing."

To design a classification system, one must specify the number of classes to be established and the principle to be used in determining class membership. A number of mathematical procedures have been suggested for devising classification schedules. These include factor analysis, clump theory, and latent class analysis. It also has been suggested that these or similar techniques can be used to automatically classify documents into correct categories and speed up the processing of incoming material. The initial results appear promising. Further research is being undertaken to determine the retrieval effectiveness of automated indexing and classification systems. (Author)"

                "text": "The application of digital computers to the tasks of document classification, storage and retrieval holds considerable promise for solving the so-called \u201clibrary problem.\u201d Due to the high-speed and data handling characteristics of digital computers, a number of different approaches to the \u201clibrary problem\u201d have been placed in operation [4]. Although existing systems are rather rudimentary when compared with the ultimate goal of an automated library, progress towards that goal has been made in several areas: the organization of a mass of documents through automatic indexing schemes; the retrieval from a mass of documents of only those documents related to an information request made by a user of the library. A high proportion of existing document retrieval systems is based upon the author's background and skill rather than upon a mathematical model. Although allowing considerable success in the initial stages of development, the heuristic approach has a limited potential unless an underlying mathematical rationale can be found. Therefore, the present paper proposes an information retrieval based upon Lazarsfeld's latent class analysis [11], which has mathematical foundations. Although latent class analysis was developed by Lazarsfeld [11] to analyze questionnaires, the similarity of this task and document classification suggests that the mathematical rationale for the former could also provide a useful theoretical basis for the latter.\n Because the number of words contained in even a moderately sized report can exceed the capacity of most computers, some form of data reduction is a necessity. The reduction usually results in one of three levels of abstraction: abstracts of documents, key or topical words which convey the meaning of the document or abstract, and indices or tags based upon key words which are then assigned to the document. In general, indexing systems either assign key words to the document or use several key words to assign tags or indices to the documents. The key words or tags then serve as basic information for a retrieval system. Until a radical change in the data handling characteristics of computers is made, it would appear likely that key words or tags will continue to serve as the raw data for information retrieval systems. Although considerable uniformity exists in basic data introduced into an automated library, many different approaches exist as to the subsequent processing of the data. Several papers are reviewed below, which illustrate some of the considerations that enter into the development of an information retrieval system.\nMaron and Kuhns [8] have developed the \u201cprobabilistic indexing\u201d scheme, which reduces the number of documents searched yet increases the retrieval of appropriate documents. In this approach, a large mass of source documents was read by human reviewers and key words were selected. The key words were then pooled into a few well-defined categories. However, any given key word could appear in more than one category. The resulting categories were then assigned meaningful labels or tags which constituted an index term list. The source documents were then re-inspected and the appropriate tag or tags assigned to the document.\n Document retrieval using the probabilistic indexing scheme is accomplished by presenting the computer with a series of tags and a value of a relevance number below which documents are not of sufficient importance to be retrieved. The tags locate the document, and the value of the corresponding relevance number compared to the lower bound value determines if the document should be retrieved.\nThe high degree of dependence of the probabilistic indexing scheme upon human reviewers greatly reduces the efficiency of the method. If the number of documents, key words and tags were large, a human reviewer would not be able to maintain a consistent frame of reference when assigning tags and relevance numbers. The unique contribution of the probabilistic indexing scheme, however, is the use of relevance numbers in conjunction with the indices. The number provides a basis for determining the relevance of the stored documents to the indexed terms used by the requester of information.\nStiles [10] had also reported the use of an association factor to accompany the index terms assigned to a document. The factor used expressed the discrepancy of the observed joint occurrence from the expected joint occurrence of an index pair, assuming independence. The association factor employed was the &khgr;2 value obtained from a two-fold contingency table involving the pair of index terms. A correlation coefficient, such as tetracortic r which expresses the correlation within the two-fold table, rather than a chi-square value expressing lack of independence would have been more appropriate in the present context. Stiles [10], however, reports that the use of the association factor was found to improve document retrieval.\n A more intensive study of the inter-relationships among words within a document was performed by Doyle [2]. The joint occurrences of word pairs in a body of 600 documents served as the basic data of the study. Two types of word correlations were found to exist within word pairs: adjacent correlations, resulting from words which appeared in pairs due to the nature of our language; and proximal correlation, due to words which are logically related but appear at non-adjacent positions within a document. The statistical effects of these two correlations were denoted by language redundancy and reality redundancy. In addition, a third type of redundancy, documentation redundancy resulted when more than one document could be classified by a given set of key words. The effect of language redundancy can be reduced by pooling adjacent key words and treating the pair as a single key word, thus eliminating the redundancy. Documentation redundancy would be reduced by pooling similar documents and assigning a single label to the batch, thus eliminating unnecessary duplication of effort. Reality redundancy, however, is the result of the author's cognitive processes, and the degree to which the literature researcher can duplicate this redundancy determines how successfully the original document can be retrieved. This study indicates that an important function in an information retrieval system is machinery for reducing the effects of language and documentation redundancy so that important relationships are not obscured.\nThe results of the three studies reviewed above indicated document retrieval can be improved if the documents are surveyed for document redundancy and if the relationships among the key words are filtered to remove language redundancy. In addition, the use of a relevance number relating the document and key words appears to increase the efficiency of document retrieval."

The effect of word frequency and other parameters on the association process is investigated through examination of related pairs and through retrieval experiments. Associated pairs of words usually reflect localized word meanings, and true synonyms cannot readily be found from first or second order relationships in our document collections. There is little overlap between word relationships found through associations and those used in thesaurus construction, and the effects of word associations and a thesaurus in retrieval are independent. The use of associations in retrieval experiments improves not only recall, by permitting new matches between requests and documents, but also precision, by reinforcing existing matches. In our experiments, the precision effect is responsible for most of the improvement possible with associations. A properly constructed thesaurus, however, offers better performance than statistical association methods."

Some barriers besides cost are treated briefly in the opening section, including types of intellectual resistance to the idea of doing classification by content-word similarity. The second section explains the basic processes of document grouping by similarity, and discusses the advantages of the reported method over methods commonly experimented with. The operation of an iterative procedure using word profiles to progressively improve the grouping of content-word lists is described. Then some possible applications aside from document classification are enumerated. The final section begins by presenting theoretical underpinnings that explain the form taken by the components of the method. An account of the struggle to make the method work is sketched, followed by a cycle-by-cycle description of a feasibility demonstration. The conclusion states that mere cheapness is not enough and analyzes what researchers and developers might have to do before user acceptance of automatic classification can be assured."

This suggests the possibility of establishing an information exchange system utilizing to a greater extent the channels of communication among scientific workers."

Fuel pins forming a hexagonal array are spaced apart from each other and held-down at their lower end, securely attached at two places along their length to one of a plurality of vertically disposed parallel plates arranged in horizontally spaced rows. These plates are in turn spaced apart from each other and held together by a combination of spacing and fastening means. The arrangement of this invention provides a strong vibration free hold-down mechanism while avoiding a large pressure drop to the flow of coolant fluid. This apparatus is particularly useful in connection with liquid cooled reactors such as liquid metal cooled fast breeder reactors."

A thesaurus is a large collection of words, each of which is assigned to one or more semantic groups. The importance of thesauri for applications in library information storage and retrieval is evident from the number of centres interested in them. (No less than 24 centres are listed in the index of Current Research in Scientific Documentation No. 13, and thesuri in 10 disciplines are mentioned specifically.) The present paper describes aspects of an attempt to generate groups of words by purely mechanical means, which seem to have strong semantic connections within groups and which, therefore, are of potential value as thesauri. The lexicographer plays no part at all, and therefore no semantic processes can be used. However, the machine can make very many more binary decisions than a lexicographer, and there is the possibility that a machine generated \u201cthesaurus\u201d is at least as valuable for document processing as a man-made one."
