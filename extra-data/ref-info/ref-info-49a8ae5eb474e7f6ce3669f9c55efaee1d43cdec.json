Yet NLIs are only usable if they map natural language questions to SQL queries correctly. As Schneiderman and Norman have argued, people are unwilling to trade reliable and predictable user interfaces for intelligent but unreliable ones. In this paper, we introduce a theoretical framework for reliable NLIs, which is the foundation for the fully implemented Precise NLI. We prove that, for a broad class of semantically tractable natural language questions, Precise is guaranteed to map each question to the corresponding SQL query. We report on experiments testing Precise on several hundred questions drawn from user studies over three benchmark databases. We find that over 80% of the questions are semantically tractable questions, which Precise answers correctly. Precise automatically recognizes the 20% of questions that it cannot handle, and requests a paraphrase. Finally, we show that Precise compares favorably with Mooney's learning NLI and with Microsoft's English Query product"

Some advantages and disadvantages of NLIDBS are then discussed, comparing NLIDBS to formal query languages, form-based interfaces, and graphical interfaces. An introduction to some of the linguistic problems NLIDBS have to confront follows, for the benefit of readers less familiar with computational linguistics. The discussion then moves on to NLIDB architectures, portability issues, restricted natural language input systems (including menu-based NLIDBS), and NLIDBS with reasoning capabilities. Some less explored areas of NLIDB research are then presented, namely database updates, meta-knowledge questions, temporal questions, and multi-modal NLIDBS. The paper ends with reflections on the current state of the art."

Robust parsing is applied only after a full analysis has failed, and it involves the two stages of (1) parsing a set of phrases and clauses, and (2) gluing them together to obtain a single semantic frame encoding the full meaning of the sentence. In a recent evaluation, less than two-thirds of the sentences analyzed yielded a full parse, but the overwhelming majority of the remaining sentences were analyzed correctly by the robust parsing scheme. When text input was replaced by recognizer outputs, even though the recognizer produced greater than 50% sentence error rate, the drop in score (%correct-%incorrect) was only 10 percentage points. This indicates that most of the recognizer errors are harmless in terms of meaning analysis, as long as a robust mechanism for accounting for the parsable phrases is in place.<<ETX>>"

It is difficult for such systems to achieve good coverage of the lexicon and grammar that subjects might use because spontaneous speech often contains disfluencies and ungrammatical constructions. Our goal is to respond appropriately to input, even though coverage is not complete. The natural language component of our system is oriented toward the extraction of information relevant to a task, and seeks to directly optimize the correctness of the extracted information (and therefore the system response). We use a flexible frame-based parser, which parses as much of the input as possible. This approach leads both to high accuracy and robustness. We have implemented a version of this system for the Air Travel Information Service (ATIS) task, which is being used by several ARPA-funded sites to develop and evaluate speech understanding systems. Users are asked to perform a task that requires getting information from an Air Travel database. In this paper, we describe recent improvements in our system resulting from our efforts to improve the coverage given a limited amount of training data. These improvements address a number of problems including generating an adequate lexicon and grammar for the recognizer, generating and generalizing an appropriate grammar for the parser, and dealing with ambiguous parses."

It consists of three major components, a speech recognizer, a semantic parser, and a dialog act decoder. A novel feature of the system is that the understanding components are trained directly from data without using explicit semantic grammar rules or fully-annotated corpus data. Despite this, the system is nevertheless able to capture hierarchical structure in user utterances and handle long range dependencies. Experiments have been conducted on the ATIS corpus and 16.1% and 12.6% utterance understanding error rates were obtained for spoken input using the ATIS-3 1993 and 1994 test sets. These results show that our system is comparable to existing SLU systems which rely on either handcrafted semantic grammar rules or statistical models trained on fully-annotated training corpora, but it has greatly reduced build cost."

Furthermore, there are some successful natural language processing systemswhich have explicitly or implicitly utilized sublanguage restrictions. However, two big problems are still unsolved to utilize the sublanguage notion: 1) automatic definition and dynamic identification of a text to sublanguage, and 2) automatic linguistic knowledge acquisition for sublanguage. There are now new opportunities to address these problems owing to the appearance of large machine-readable corpora. Although there have been several experiments to try to solve the second problem listed above, the first problem has not received so much attention. In the previous sublanguage N. L. P. systems, the domain the system is dealing with was defined by a human. This is actually one method to define the sublanguage of a text, and, in a sense, it seems to work well. However, it is not always possible and sometimes it may be wrong. In order to maximize the benefit of the sublanguage notion, we need automatic definition and dynamic sublanguage identification. We will report preliminary experiments on sublanguage definition and identification based on lexical appearance. The results of the experiments show that the methods proposed can be useful in processing a new text. In particular, the fact that the first two sentences can reliably identify a text's sublanguage encourages us in further investigation of this line of research. In conclusion, it appears that the inductive definition of sublanguage and sublanguage identification would be beneficial for natural language processing."
