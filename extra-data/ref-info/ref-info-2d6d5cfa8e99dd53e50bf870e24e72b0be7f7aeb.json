                "text": "Despite the success of many pattern recognition systems in constrained domains, problems that involve noisy input and many classes remain difficult. A promising direction is to use several classifiers simultaneously, such that they can complement each other in correctness. This thesis is concerned with decision combination in a multiple classifier system that is critical to its success. \nA multiple classifier system consists of a set of classifiers and a decision combination function. It is a preferred solution to a complex recognition problem, because it allows simultaneous use of feature descriptors of many types, corresponding measures of similarity, and many classification procedures. It also allows dynamic selection, so that classifiers adapted to inputs of a particular type may be applied only when those inputs are encountered. \nDecisions by the classifiers are represented as rankings of the class set that are derivable from the results of feature matching. Rank scores contain more information than unique class choices, and can be given on a common and consistent scale by each classifier for different instances of the problem. \nThe rankings are combined by methods that either reduce or rerank a given set of classes. An intersection method and a union method are proposed for class set reduction. Three methods based on the highest rank, the Borda count, and logistic regression are proposed for class set reordering. The advantages and disadvantages of each method are discussed. \nThe theory is tested in an application to visual word recognition, where many classes need to be discriminated. A computational model is proposed that integrates three approaches to word recognition. These include a character recognition approach, a segmentation-based approach, and a word shape analysis approach. A control strategy selectively activates the suitable classifiers and candidate words in a given lexicon. The class decisions are combined by the methods given in our theory. \nThe success of the model is demonstrated in an experiment with noisy word images of multiple font types. The results show that the integrated model outperforms each individual approach. Similar results are observed in two other experiments in character recognition."

Four approaches based on different methodologies are proposed for solving this problem. One is suitable for combining individual classifiers such as Bayesian, k-nearest-neighbor, and various distance classifiers. The other three could be used for combining any kind of individual classifiers. On applying these methods to combine several classifiers for recognizing totally unconstrained handwritten numerals, the experimental results show that the performance of individual classifiers can be improved significantly. For example, on the US zipcode database, 98.9% recognition with 0.90% substitution and 0.2% rejection can be obtained, as well as high reliability with 95% recognition, 0% substitution, and 5% rejection. >"

A training set x 1, x 2, \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 x n of previous cases, along with their correct assignments, is known. These can be used to estimate Fisher's discriminant by maximum likelihood and then to assign x on the basis of the estimated discriminant, a method known as the normal discrimination procedure. Logistic regression does the same thing but with the estimation of Fisher's disriminant done conditionally on the observed values of x 1 x 2, \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7, x n . This article computes the asymptotic relative efficiency of the two procedures. Typically, logistic regression is shown to be between one half and two thirds as effective as normal discrimination for statistically interesting values of the parameters."

Relating qualitative variables to other variables through a logistic cdf functional form is logistic regression. Estimators generated for one of these problems are often used in the other. If the populations are normal with identical covariance matrices, discriminant analysis estimators are preferred to logistic regression estimators for the discriminant analysis problem. In most discriminant analysis applications, however, at least one variable is qualitative (ruling out multivariate normality). Under nonnormality, we prefer the logistic regression model with maximum likelihood estimators for solving both problems. In this article we summarize the related arguments, and report on our own supportive empirical studies."

One classifies samples based on structural features extracted from their skeletons; the other makes use of their contours. Both methods achieve high recognition rates (86.05%, 93.90%) and low substitution rates (2.25%, 1.60%). To take advantage of the inherent complementarity of the two methods, different ways of combining them are studied. It is shown that it is possible to reduce the substitution rate to 0.70%, while the recognition rate remains as high as 92.00% . Furthermore, if reliability is of utmost importance, one can avoid substitutions completely (reliability 100%) and still retain a fairly high recognition rate (84.85%).<<ETX>>"

The presentation moves systematically from simple designs through to complex problems typical of research applications. The designs include comparisons between groups, trends across groups, correlations and the use of frequency tables. Each chapter includes exercises, and a full computer program suitable for the home micro is also provided. The book concludes with an extensive set of tables, many of which are not available elsewhere."

This paper describes a quickly implementable table look-up rule based on Ashby\u2019s representation of sets in his constraint analysis. A decision region for category c in the N-dimensional measurement space is considered to be the intersection of the inverse projections of the decision regions determined for category c by Bayes rules in smaller dimensional projection spaces. Error bounds for this composite decision rule are derived: any entry in the confusion matrix for the composite decision rule is bounded above by the minimum of that entry taken over all the confusion matrices of the Bayes decision rules in the smaller dimensional projection spaces. On simulated Gaussian Data, probability of error with the table look-up rule is comparable to the optimum Bayes rule."

Plackett on behalf of the late Professor Anderson, at a meeting organized by the Research Section on Wednesday, October 5th, 1983, Professor J. B. Copas in the Chair] SUMMARY A general approach to regression modelling for ordered categorical response variables, y, is given, which is equally applicable to ordered and unordered y. The regressor variables xT = (xI, ,x ) may be continuous or categorical. The method is based on the logistic family which contains a hierarchy of regression models, ranging from ordered to unordered models. Ordered properties of the former, the stereotype model, are established. The choice between models is made empirically on the basis of model fit. This is particularly important for assessed, ordered categorical response variables, where it is not obvious a priori whether or not the ordering is relevant to the regression relationship. Model simplification is investigated in terms of whether or not the response categories are distinguishable with respect to x. The models are fitted iteratively using the method of maximum likelihood. Examples are given."

For logistic regression models, the discreteness of binary data makes it difficult to interpret such displays. Modifications and extensions of linear model displays lead to three methods for diagnostic checking of logistic regression models. Local mean deviance plots are useful for detecting overall lack of fit. Empirical probability plots help point out isolated departures from the fitted model. Partial residual plots, when smoothed to show underlying structure, help identify specific causes of lack of fit. These methods are illustrated through the analyses of simulated and real data."
