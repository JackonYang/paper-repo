We demonstrate how those two components can benefit from each other's continuous input and how the transferred knowledge can be used to improve scene analysis. Thus, scene interpretation is not left as a matter of logical reasoning, but is instead addressed by the repeated interaction and consistency checks between different levels and modes of visual processing. As our results show, the proposed tight integration significantly increases recognition performance, as well as overall system robustness. In addition, it enables the construction of novel capabilities such as the accurate 3D estimation of object locations and orientations and their temporal integration in a world coordinate frame. The system is evaluated on a challenging real-world car detection task in an urban scenario."

In order to exploit the a priori knowledge about shape and motion of vehicles in traffic scenes, a parameterized vehicle model is used for an intraframe matching process and a recursive estimator based on a motion model is used for motion estimation. An interpretation cycle supports the intraframe matching process with a state MAP-update step. Initial model hypotheses are generated using an image segmentation component which clusters coherently moving image features into candidate representations of images of a moving vehicle. The inclusion of an illumination model allows taking shadow edges of the vehicle into account during the matching process. Only such an elaborate combination of various techniques has enabled us to track vehicles under complex illumination conditions and over long (over 400 frames) monocular image sequences. Results on various real-world road traffic scenes are presented and open problems as well as future work are outlined."

The system uses a combination of color, edge, and motion information to recognize and track the road boundaries, lane markings and other vehicles on the road. Cars are recognized by matching templates that are cropped from the input data online and by detecting highway scene features and evaluating how they relate to each other. Cars are also detected by temporal differencing and by tracking motion parameters that are typical for cars. The system recognizes and tracks road boundaries and lane markings using a recursive least-squares filter. Experimental results demonstrate robust, real-time car detection and tracking over thousands of image frames. The data includes video taken under difficult visibility conditions."

The method uses a template hierarchy to capture the variety of object shapes; efficient hierarchies can be generated offline for given shape distributions using stochastic optimization techniques (i.e. simulated annealing). Online, matching involves a simultaneous coarse-to-fine approach over the shape hierarchy and over the transformation parameters. Very large speed-up factors are typically obtained when comparing this approach with the equivalent brute-force formulation; we have measured gains of several orders of magnitudes. We present experimental results on the real-time detection of traffic signs and pedestrians from a moving vehicle. Because of the highly time sensitive nature of these vision tasks, we also discuss some hardware-specific implementations of the proposed method as far as SIMD parallelism is concerned."

The responses of the body part detectors and a combined human detector provide the \"observations\" used for tracking. Trajectory initialization and termination are both fully automatic and rely on the confidences computed from the detection responses. An object is tracked by data association if its corresponding detection response can be found; otherwise it is tracked by a meanshift style tracker.

In this paper, we provide a framework for placing local object detection in the context of the overall 3D scene by modeling the interdependence of objects, surface orientations, and camera viewpoint. Most object detection methods consider all scales and locations in the image as equally likely. We show that with probabilistic estimates of 3D geometry, both in terms of surfaces and world coordinates, we can put objects into perspective and model the scale and location variance in the image. Our approach reflects the cyclical nature of the problem by allowing probabilistic object hypotheses to refine geometry and vice-versa. Our framework allows painless substitution of almost any object detector and is easily extended to include other aspects of image understanding. Our results confirm the benefits of our integrated approach."

We use a detection style algorithm that scans a detector over two consecutive frames of a video sequence. The detector is trained (using AdaBoost) to take advantage of both motion and appearance information to detect a walking person. Past approaches have built detectors based on motion information or detectors based on appearance information, but ours is the first to combine both sources of information in a single detector. The implementation described runs at about 4 frames/second, detects pedestrians at very small scales (as small as 20 \u00d7 15 pixels), and has a very low false positive rate.Our approach builds on the detection work of Viola and Jones. Novel contributions of this paper include: (i) development of a representation of image motion which is extremely efficient, and (ii) implementation of a state of the art pedestrian detection system which operates on low resolution images under difficult conditions (such as rain and snow)."

However, drivers often experience difficulties in linking the simple 2D aerial map with the visual impression that they get from the real environment, which is inherently ground-level based. Therefore, supplying realistically textured 3D city models at ground-level proves very useful for pre-visualizing an upcoming traffic situation. Because this pre-visualization can be rendered from the expected future viewpoints of the driver, the latter will more easily understand the required maneuver. 3D city models can be reconstructed from the imagery recorded by surveying vehicles. The vastness of image material gathered by these vehicles, however, puts extreme demands on vision algorithms to ensure their practical usability. Algorithms need to be as fast as possible and should result in compact, memory efficient 3D city models for future ease of distribution and visualization. For the considered application, these are not contradictory demands. Simplified geometry assumptions can speed up vision algorithms while automatically guaranteeing compact geometry models. We present a novel city modeling framework which builds upon this philosophy to create 3D content at high speed which could allow for pre-visualization of any conceivable traffic situation by car navigation modules."

First, the observation models and target distributions can be highly non-linear and non-Gaussian. Second, the presence of a large, varying number of objects creates complex interactions with overlap and ambiguities. To surmount these difficulties, we introduce a vision system that is capable of learning, detecting and tracking the objects of interest. The system is demonstrated in the context of tracking hockey players using video sequences. Our approach combines the strengths of two successful algorithms: mixture particle filters and Adaboost. The mixture particle filter [17] is ideally suited to multi-target tracking as it assigns a mixture component to each player. The crucial design issues in mixture particle filters are the choice of the proposal distribution and the treatment of objects leaving and entering the scene. Here, we construct the proposal distribution using a mixture model that incorporates information from the dynamic models of each player and the detection hypotheses generated by Adaboost. The learned Adaboost proposal distribution allows us to quickly detect players entering the scene, while the filtering process enables us to keep track of the individual players. The result of interleaving Adaboost with mixture particle filters is a simple, yet powerful and fully automatic multiple object tracking system."

In addition, we also derive metrically accurate trajectories for each one of them. Our main contribution is to show that multi-person tracking can be reliably achieved by processing individual trajectories separately over long sequences, provided that a reasonable heuristic is used to rank these individuals and avoid confusing them with one another. In this way, we achieve robustness by finding optimal trajectories over many frames while avoiding the combinatorial explosion that would result from simultaneously dealing with all the individuals."

Our basic premise is that this problem is too difficult for any type of model or feature alone. Instead, we present an algorithm that integrates evidence in multiple iterations and from different sources. The core part of our method is the combination of local and global cues via probabilistic top-down segmentation. Altogether, this approach allows examining and comparing object hypotheses with high precision down to the pixel level. Qualitative and quantitative results on a large data set confirm that our method is able to reliably detect pedestrians in crowded scenes, even when they overlap and partially occlude each other. In addition, the flexible nature of our approach allows it to operate on very small training sets."

A novel hierarchical representation allows to represent individual images as well as various objects classes in a single, scale and rotation invariant model. The recognition method is based on a codebook representation where appearance clusters built from edge based features are shared among several object classes. A probabilistic model allows for reliable detection of various objects in the same image. The approach is highly efficient due to fast clustering and matching methods capable of dealing with millions of high dimensional features. The system shows excellent performance on several object categories over a wide range of scales, in-plane rotations, background clutter, and partial occlusions. The performance of the proposed multi-object class detection approach is competitive to state of the art approaches dedicated to a single object class recognition problem."

Rather than to fuse the outputs of several distinct classifiers in a fixed setup, our approach implements a highly flexible combination scheme, where the contributions of all individual cues are flexibly recombined depending on their explanatory power for each new test image. The key idea behind our approach is to integrate the cues over an estimated top-down segmentation, which allows to quantify how much each of them contributed to the object hypothesis. By combining those contributions on a per-pixel level, our approach ensures that each cue only contributes to object regions for which it is confident and that potential correlations between cues are effectively factored out. Experimental results on several benchmark data sets show that the proposed multi-cue combination scheme significantly increases detection performance compared to any of its constituent cues alone. Moreover, it provides an interesting evaluation tool to analyze the complementarity of local feature detectors and descriptors."

In this paper we present a new paradigm for the segmentation of range images into piecewise continuous surfaces. Data aggregation is performed via model recovery in terms of variable-order bi-variate polynomials using iterative regression. Model recovery is initiated independently in regularly placed seed regions in the image. All the recovered models are potential candidates for the final description of the data. Selection of the models is defined as a quadratic Boolean problem, and the solution is sought by the WTA (winner-takes-all) technique, which turns out to be a good compromise between the speed of computation and the accuracy of the solution. The overall efficiency of the method is achieved by combining model recovery and model selection in an iterative way. Partial recovery of the models is followed by the selection (optimization) procedure and only the \u201cbest\u201d models are allowed to develop further.The major novelty of the approach lies in an effective combination of simple component algorithms, which stands in contrast to methods which attempt to solve the problem in a single processing step using sophisticated means. We present the results on several real range images."

Many different descriptors have been proposed in the literature. It is unclear which descriptors are more appropriate and how their performance depends on the interest region detector. The descriptors should be distinctive and at the same time robust to changes in viewing conditions as well as to errors of the detector. Our evaluation uses as criterion recall with respect to precision and is carried out for different image transformations. We compare shape context [Belongie, S, et al., April 2002], steerable filters [Freeman, W and Adelson, E, Setp. 1991], PCA-SIFT [Ke, Y and Sukthankar, R, 2004], differential invariants [Koenderink, J and van Doorn, A, 1987], spin images [Lazebnik, S, et al., 2003], SIFT [Lowe, D. G., 1999], complex filters [Schaffalitzky, F and Zisserman, A, 2002], moment invariants [Van Gool, L, et al., 1996], and cross-correlation for different types of interest regions. We also propose an extension of the SIFT descriptor and show that it outperforms the original method. Furthermore, we observe that the ranking of the descriptors is mostly independent of the interest region detector and that the SIFT-based descriptors perform best. Moments and steerable filters show the best performance among the low dimensional descriptors."

After reviewing existing edge and gradient based descriptors, we show experimentally that grids of histograms of oriented gradient (HOG) descriptors significantly outperform existing feature sets for human detection. We study the influence of each stage of the computation on performance, concluding that fine-scale gradients, fine orientation binning, relatively coarse spatial binning, and high-quality local contrast normalization in overlapping descriptor blocks are all important for good results. The new approach gives near-perfect separation on the original MIT pedestrian database, so we introduce a more challenging dataset containing over 1800 annotated human images with a large range of pose variations and backgrounds."

The peak of the map and, hence, the new position of the object, is found using mean shift.

Mainly off-line training methods have been used, which implies that all training data has to be a priori given; training and usage of the classifier are separate steps. Training the classifier on-line and incrementally as new data becomes available has several advantages and opens new areas of application for boosting in computer vision. In this paper we propose a novel on-line AdaBoost feature selection method. In conjunction with efficient feature extraction methods the method is real time capable. We demonstrate the multifariousness of the method on such diverse tasks as learning complex background models, visual tracking and object detection. All approaches benefit significantly by the on-line training."

In this context, we consider labeling as a special case of supervised classification with a predefined number of classes and known but arbitrary dissimilarities between each image element and each class. Using Markov random fields to model pairwise relationships, this leads to a global energy minimization problem. In order to handle its combinatorial complexity, we apply Lagrangian relaxation to derive a semidefinite program, which has several advantageous properties over alternative methods like graph cuts. In particular, there are no restrictions concerning the form of the pairwise interactions, which e.g. allows us to incorporate a basic shape concept into the energy function. Based on the solution matrix of our convex relaxation, a suboptimal solution of the original labeling problem can be easily computed. Statistical ground-truth experiments and several examples of multiclass image labeling and restoration problems show that high quality solutions are obtained with this technique."
