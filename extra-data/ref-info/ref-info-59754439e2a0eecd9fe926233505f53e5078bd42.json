The features are invariant to image scaling, translation, and rotation, and partially invariant to illumination changes and affine or 3D projection. These features share similar properties with neurons in inferior temporal cortex that are used for object recognition in primate vision. Features are efficiently detected through a staged filtering approach that identifies stable points in scale space. Image keys are created that allow for local geometric deformations by representing blurred image gradients in multiple orientation planes and at multiple scales. The keys are used as input to a nearest neighbor indexing method that identifies candidate object matches. Final verification of each match is achieved by finding a low residual least squares solution for the unknown model parameters. Experimental results show that robust object recognition can be achieved in cluttered partially occluded images with a computation time of under 2 seconds."

To this end we develop a number of novel components. First, we introduce a new edge-based local feature detector that is invariant to similarity transformations. The features are localized on edges and a neighbourhood is estimated in a scale invariant manner. Second, the neighbourhood descriptor computed for foreground features is not affected by background clutter, even if the feature is on an object boundary. Third, the descriptor generalizes Lowe's SIFT method to edges. An object model is learnt from a single training image. The object is then recognized in new images in a series of steps which apply progressively tighter geometric restrictions. A final contribution of this work is to allow sufficient flexibility in the geometric representation that objects in the same visual class can be recognized. Results are demonstrated for various object classes including bikes and rackets."

Objects are modeled as flexible constellations of parts. A probabilistic representation is used for all aspects of the object: shape, appearance, occlusion and relative scale. An entropy-based feature detector is used to select regions and their scale within the image. In learning the parameters of the scale-invariant object model are estimated. This is done using expectation-maximization in a maximum-likelihood setting. In recognition, this model is used in a Bayesian manner to classify images. The flexible nature of the model is demonstrated by excellent results over a range of datasets including geometrically constrained classes (e.g. faces, cars) and flexible objects (such as animals)."

We first use example images of a target object in typical environments to train a classifier cascade that determines whether edge pixels in an image belong to an instance of the desired object or the clutter. Presented with a novel image, we use the cascade to discard clutter edge pixels and group the object edge pixels into overall detections of the object. The features used for the edge pixel classification are localized, sparse edge density operations. Experiments validate the effectiveness of the technique for recognition of a set of complex objects in a variety of cluttered indoor scenes under arbitrary out-of-image-plane rotation. Furthermore, our experiments suggest that the technique is robust to variations between training and testing environments and is efficient at runtime."

However, the more challenging and important task of categorizing previously unseen objects remains largely unsolved. Traditionally, contour and shape based methods are regarded most adequate for handling the generalization requirements needed for this task. Appearance based methods, on the other hand, have been successful in object identification and detection scenarios. Today little work is done to systematically compare existing methods and characterize their relative capabilities for categorizing objects. In order to compare different methods we present a new database specifically tailored to the task of object categorization. It contains high-resolution color images of 80 objects from 8 different categories, for a total of 3280 images. It is used to analyze the performance of several appearance and contour based methods. The best categorization result is obtained by an appropriate combination of different methods."

The appropriate choice of type and level of description is of course task dependent, yet it is generally accepted that the low-level or so called early vision layers in the Human Visual System are context independent.This paper concentrates on the use of low-level approaches for solving computer vision problems and discusses three inter-related aspects of this: saliency; scale selection and content description. In contrast to many previous approaches which separate these tasks, we argue that these three aspects are intrinsically related. Based on this observation, a multiscale algorithm for the selection of salient regions of an image is introduced and its application to matching type problems such as tracking, object recognition and image retrieval is demonstrated."

We develop a new method for computing a transformation from a three-dimensional model coordinate frame to the two-dimensional image coordinate frame, using three pairs of model and image points. We show that this transformation always exists for three noncollinear points, and is unique up to a reflective ambiguity. The solution method is closed-form and only involves second-order equations. We have implemented a recognition system that uses this transformation method to determine possible alignments of a model with an image. Each of these hypothesized matches is verified by comparing the entire edge contours of the aligned object with the image edges. Using the entire edge contours for verification, rather than a few local feature points, reduces the chance of finding false matches. The system has been tested on partly occluded objects in highly cluttered scenes."

For discrete data, we prove the convergence of a recursive mean shift procedure to the nearest stationary point of the underlying density function and, thus, its utility in detecting the modes of the density. The relation of the mean shift procedure to the Nadaraya-Watson estimator from kernel regression and the robust M-estimators; of location is also established. Algorithms for two low-level vision tasks discontinuity-preserving smoothing and image segmentation - are described as applications. In these algorithms, the only user-set parameter is the resolution of the analysis, and either gray-level or color images are accepted as input. Extensive experimental results illustrate their excellent performance."

A proper representation of scale is essential to most visual tasks requiring stable descriptors of image structure.

In particular, we argue that reliance on a single level of perceptual grouping is inadequate, since it is responsible for the specific weaknesses of several well-known recognition techniques. Instead, recognition must use a hierarchy of perceptual grouping processes. We describe an appearance-based system that uses four distinct levels of perceptual grouping to represent 3D objects in a form that allows not only recognition, but reasoning about 3D manipulation of a sort that has been supported in the past only by 3D geometric models. The results of the algorithms have been previously reported, and the main contribution of this paper is the development of the perceptual organization hierarchy."

Using Canny's design [1], we show that a solution to his precise formulation of detection and localization for an infinite extent filter leads to an optimal operator in one dimension, which can be efficiently implemented by two recursive filters moving in opposite directions. In addition to the noise truncature immunity which results, the recursive nature of the filtering operations leads, with sequential machines, to a substantial saving in computational effort (five multiplications and five additions for one pixel, independent of the size of the neighborhood). The extension to the two-dimensional case is considered and the resulting filtering structures are implemented as two-dimensional recursive filters. Hence, the filter size can be varied by simply changing the value of one parameter without affecting the time execution of the algorithm. Performance measures of this new edge detector are given and compared to Canny's filters. Various experimental results are shown."

A curve is represented parametrically as a function of arc length by the accumulated change in direction of the curve since the starting point. This function is expanded in a Fourier series and the coefficients are arranged in the amplitude/phase-angle form. It is shown that the amplitudes are pure form invariants as well as are certain simple functions of phase angles. Rotational and axial symmetry are related directly to simple properties of the Fourier descriptors. An analysis of shape similarity or symmetry can be based on these relationships; also closed symmetric curves can be synthesized from almost arbitrary Fourier descriptors. It is established that the Fourier series expansion is optimal and unique with respect to obtaining coefficients insensitive to starting point. Several examples are provided to indicate the usefulness of Fourier descriptors as features for shape discrimination and a number of interesting symmetric curves are generated by computer and plotted out."
