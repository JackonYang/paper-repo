First. there are a wide variety of algorithms that use the eigenvectors in slightly different ways. Second, many of these algorithms have no proof that they will actually compute a reasonable clustering. In this paper, we present a simple spectral clustering algorithm that can be implemented using a few lines of Matlab. Using tools from matrix perturbation theory, we analyze the algorithm, and give conditions under which it can be expected to do well. We also show surprisingly good experimental results on a number of challenging clustering problems."

A typical example is the web, which can be described by either the hyperlinks between web pages or the words occurring in web pages. When each view is represented as a graph, one may convexly combine the weight matrices or the discrete Laplacians for each graph, and then proceed with existing clustering or classification techniques. Such a solution might sound natural, but its underlying principle is not clear. Unlike this kind of methodology, we develop multiview spectral clustering via generalizing the normalized cut from a single view to multiple views. We further build multiview transductive inference on the basis of multiview spectral clustering. Our framework leads to a mixture of Markov chains defined on every graph. The experimental evaluation on real-world web classification demonstrates promising results that validate our method."

It is simple to implement, can be solved efficiently by standard linear algebra software, and very often outperforms traditional clustering algorithms such as the k-means algorithm. On the first glance spectral clustering appears slightly mysterious, and it is not obvious to see why it works at all and what it really does. The goal of this tutorial is to give some intuition on those questions. We describe different graph Laplacians and their basic properties, present the most common spectral clustering algorithms, and derive those algorithms from scratch by several different approaches. Advantages and disadvantages of the different spectral clustering algorithms are discussed.\n"

Whereas spectral embedding methods provided only coordinates for the training points, the analysis justifies a simple extension to out-of-sample examples (the Nystrm formula) for multidimensional scaling (MDS), spectral clustering, Laplacian eigenmaps, locally linear embedding (LLE), and Isomap. The analysis provides, for all such spectral embedding methods, the definition of a loss function, whose empirical average is minimized by the traditional algorithms. The asymptotic expected value of that loss defines a generalization performance and clarifies what these algorithms are trying to learn. Experiments with LLE, Isomap, spectral clustering, and MDS show that this out-of-sample embedding formula generalizes well, with a level of error comparable to the effect of small perturbations of the training set on the embedding."

However, not much work has been done in using multi-modal information for clustering Web images. In this paper, we address the problem of Web image clustering by simultaneous integration of visual and textual features from a graph partitioning perspective. In particular, we modelled visual features, images, and words from the surrounding text of the images using a tripartite graph. This graph is actually considered as a fusion of two bipartite graphs that are partitioned simultaneously by the proposed Consistent Isoperimetric High-order Co-clustering(CIHC) framework. Although a similar approach has been adopted before, the main contribution of this work lies in the computational efficiency, quality in Web image clustering and scalability to large image repositories that CIHC is able to achieve. We demonstrate this through experimental results performed on real Web images."

In this paper we present the novel idea of modeling the document collection as a bipartite graph between documents and words, using which the simultaneous clustering problem can be posed as a bipartite graph partitioning problem. To solve the partitioning problem, we use a new spectral co-clustering algorithm that uses the second left and right singular vectors of an appropriately scaled word-document matrix to yield good bipartitionings. The spectral algorithm enjoys some optimality properties; it can be shown that the singular vectors solve a real relaxation to the NP-complete graph bipartitioning problem. We present experimental results to verify that the resulting co-clustering algorithm works well in practice."

Rather than focusing on local features and their consistencies in the image data, our approach aims at extracting the global impression of an image. We treat image segmentation as a graph partitioning problem and propose a novel global criterion, the normalized cut, for segmenting the graph. The normalized cut criterion measures both the total dissimilarity between the different groups as well as the total similarity within the groups. We show that an efficient computational technique based on a generalized eigenvalue problem can be used to optimize this criterion. We have applied this approach to segmenting static images and found results very encouraging."

Especially in recent years, with the explosive growth of the Web, image clustering has even been a critical technology to help users digest the large amount of online visual information. However, as far as we know, many previous works on image clustering only used either low-level visual features or surrounding texts, but rarely exploited these two kinds of information in the same framework. To tackle this problem, we proposed a novel method named consistent bipartite graph co-partitioning in this paper, which can cluster Web images based on the consistent fusion of the information contained in both low-level features and surrounding texts. In particular, we formulated it as a constrained multi-objective optimization problem, which can be efficiently solved by semi-definite programming (SDP). Experiments on a real-world Web image collection showed that our proposed method outperformed the methods only based on low-level features or surround texts."

Organizing the results into different semantic clusters facilitates users' browsing. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical clustering method using visual, textual and link analysis. By using a vision-based page segmentation algorithm, a web page is partitioned into blocks, and the textual and link information of an image can be accurately extracted from the block containing that image. By using block-level link analysis techniques, an image graph can be constructed. We then apply spectral techniques to find a Euclidean embedding of the images which respects the graph structure. Thus for each image, we have three kinds of representations, i.e. visual feature based representation, textual feature based representation and graph based representation. Using spectral clustering techniques, we can cluster the search results into different semantic clusters. An image search example illustrates the potential of these techniques."

Learning the joint distribution of image regions and words has many applications. We consider in detail predicting words associated with whole images (auto-annotation) and corresponding to particular image regions (region naming). Auto-annotation might help organize and access large collections of images. Region naming is a model of object recognition as a process of translating image regions to words, much as one might translate from one language to another. Learning the relationships between image regions and semantic correlates (words) is an interesting example of multi-modal data mining, particularly because it is typically hard to apply data mining techniques to collections of images. We develop a number of models for the joint distribution of image regions and words, including several which explicitly learn the correspondence between regions and words. We study multi-modal and correspondence extensions to Hofmann's hierarchical clustering/aspect model, a translation model adapted from statistical machine translation (Brown et al.), and a multi-modal extension to mixture of latent Dirichlet allocation (MoM-LDA). All models are assessed using a large collection of annotated images of real scenes. We study in depth the difficult problem of measuring performance. For the annotation task, we look at prediction performance on held out data. We present three alternative measures, oriented toward different types of task. Measuring the performance of correspondence methods is harder, because one must determine whether a word has been placed on the right region of an image. We can use annotation performance as a proxy measure, but accurate measurement requires hand labeled data, and thus must occur on a smaller scale. We show results using both an annotation proxy, and manually labeled data."

In this paper, we present an effective method for automating this process within the unsupervised learning framework. We exploit the truly multi-modal nature of multimedia collections - they have multiple views, or modalities, each of which contributes its own perspective to the collection's organization. For example, in picture galleries, image captions are often provided that form a separate view on the collection. Color histograms (or any other set of global features) form another view. Additional views are blobs, interest points and other sets of local features. Our model, called Comraf* (pronounced Comraf-Star), efficiently incorporates various views in multi-modal clustering, by which it allows great modeling flexibility. Comraf* is a light-weight version of the recently introduced combinatorial Markov random field (Comraf). We show how to translate an arbitrary Comraf into a series of Comraf* models, and give an empirical evidence for comparable effectiveness of the two. Comraf* demonstrates excellent results on two real-world image galleries: it obtains 2.5-3 times higher accuracy compared with a uni-modal k-means."

When labeled data is scarce it may be beneficial to use unlabeled data to learn an image representation that is low-dimensional, but nevertheless captures the information required to discriminate between image categories. This paper describes a method for learning representations from large quantities of unlabeled images which have associated captions; the goal is to improve learning in future image classification problems. Experiments show that our method significantly outperforms (1) a fully-supervised baseline model, (2) a model that ignores the captions and learns a visual representation by performing PCA on the unlabeled images alone and (3) a model that uses the output of word classifiers trained using captions and unlabeled data. Our current work concentrates on captions as the source of meta-data, but more generally other types of meta-data could be used."

Our dataset is 44,773 face images, obtained by applying a face finder to approximately half a million captioned news images. This dataset is more realistic than usual face recognition datasets, because it contains faces captured \"in the wild\" in a variety of configurations with respect to the camera, taking a variety of expressions, and under illumination of widely varying color. Each face image is associated with a set of names, automatically extracted from the associated caption. Many, but not all such sets contain the correct name. We cluster face images in appropriate discriminant coordinates. We use a clustering procedure to break ambiguities in labelling and identify incorrectly labelled faces. A merging procedure then identifies variants of names that refer to the same individual. The resulting representation can be used to label faces in news images or to organize news pictures by individuals present. An alternative view of our procedure is as a process that cleans up noisy supervised data. We demonstrate how to use entropy measures to evaluate such procedures."

Only a small number of local features within any given image are associated with a particular caption word. We describe a connected graph appearance model where vertices represent local features and edges encode spatial relationships. We use the repetition of feature neighborhoods across training images and a measure of correspondence with caption words to guide the search for meaningful feature configurations. We demonstrate improved results on a dataset to which an unstructured object model was previously applied. We also apply the new method to a more challenging collection of captioned images from the Web, detecting and annotating objects within highly cluttered realistic scenes."

Such data is useful for supervised learning and quantitative evaluation. To achieve this, we developed a web-based tool that allows easy image annotation and instant sharing of such annotations. Using this annotation tool, we have collected a large dataset that spans many object categories, often containing multiple instances over a wide variety of images. We quantify the contents of the dataset and compare against existing state of the art datasets used for object recognition and detection. Also, we show how to extend the dataset to automatically enhance object labels with WordNet, discover object parts, recover a depth ordering of objects in a scene, and increase the number of labels using minimal user supervision and images from the web.\n"

Often the resulting topics are broad and generic, associating large groups of people and issues that are loosely related. In many cases, it may be desirable to influence the direction in which topic models develop. In this paper, we explore the idea of centering topics around people. In particular, given a large corpus of images featuring collections of people and associated captions, it seems natural to extract topics specifically focussed on each person. What words are most associated with George Bush? Which with Condoleezza Rice? Since people play such an important role in life, it is natural to anchor one topic to each person. In this paper, we present People-LDA, which uses the coherence efface images in news captions to guide the development of topics. In particular, we show how topics can be refined to be more closely related to a single person (like George Bush) rather than describing groups of people in a related area (like politics). To do this we introduce a new graphical model that tightly couples images and captions through a modern face recognizer. In addition to producing topics that are people specific (using images as a guiding force), the model also performs excellent soft clustering efface images, using the language model to boost performance. We present a variety of experiments comparing our method to recent developments in topic modeling and joint image-language modeling, showing that our model has lower perplexity for face identification than competing models and produces more refined topics."

Marksmen side by side firing simultaneous shots at targets, so that the deviations are in part due to independent individual errors and in part to common causes such as wind, provide a familiar introduction to the theory of correlation; but only the correlation of the horizontal components is ordinarily discussed, whereas the complex consisting of horizontal and vertical deviations may be even more interesting. The wind at two places may be compared, using both components of the velocity in each place. A fluctuating vector is thus matched at each moment with another fluctuating vector. The study of individual differences in mental and physical traits calls for a detailed study of the relations between sets of correlated variates. For example the scores on a number of mental tests may be compared with physical measurements on the same persons. The questions then arise of determining the number and nature of the independent relations of mind and body shown by these data to exist, and of extracting from the multiplicity of correlations in the system suitable characterizations of these independent relations. As another example, the inheritance of intelligence in rats might be studied by applying not one but s different mental tests to N mothers and to a daughter of each"

The original Caltech-101 [1] was collected by choosing a set of object categories, downloading examples from Google Images and then manually screening out all images that did not fit the category. Caltech-256 is collected in a similar manner with several improvements: a) the number of categories is more than doubled, b) the minimum number of images in any category is increased from 31 to 80, c) artifacts due to image rotation are avoided and d) a new and larger clutter category is introduced for testing background rejection. We suggest several testing paradigms to measure classification performance, then benchmark the dataset using two simple metrics as well as a state-of-the-art spatial pyramid matching [2] algorithm. Finally we use the clutter category to train an interest detector which rejects uninformative background regions."

When people play the game they help determine the contents of images by providing meaningful labels for them. If the game is played as much as popular online games, we estimate that most images on the Web can be labeled in a few months. Having proper labels associated with each image on the Web would allow for more accurate image search, improve the accessibility of sites (by providing descriptions of images to visually impaired individuals), and help users block inappropriate images. Our system makes a significant contribution because of its valuable output and because of the way it addresses the image-labeling problem. Rather than using computer vision techniques, which don't work well enough, we encourage people to do the work by taking advantage of their desire to be entertained."
