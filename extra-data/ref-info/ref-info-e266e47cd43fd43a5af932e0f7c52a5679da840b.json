This result characterizes BP fixed-points and makes connections with variational approaches to approximate inference. \n \nMore importantly, our analysis lets us build on the progress made in statistical physics since Bethe's approximation was introduced in 1935. Kikuchi and others have shown how to construct more accurate free energy approximations, of which Bethe's approximation is the simplest. Exploiting the insights from our analysis, we derive generalized belief propagation (GBP) versions of these Kikuchi approximations. These new message passing algorithms can be significantly more accurate than ordinary BP, at an adjustable increase in complexity. We illustrate such a new GBP algorithm on a grid Markov network and show that it gives much more accurate marginal probabilities than those found using ordinary BP."

                "text": "One of the major obstacles to using Bayesian methods for pattern recognition has been its computational expense. This thesis presents an approximation technique that can perform Bayesian inference faster and more accurately than previously possible. This method, \u201cExpectation Propagation,\u201d unifies and generalizes two previous techniques: assumed-density filtering, an extension of the Kalman filter, and loopy belief propagation, an extension of belief propagation in Bayesian networks. The unification shows how both of these algorithms can be viewed as approximating the true posterior distribution with simpler distribution, which is close in the sense of KL-divergence. Expectation Propagation exploits the best of both algorithms: the generality of assumed-density filtering and the accuracy of loopy belief propagation. \nLoopy belief propagation, because it propagates exact belief states, is useful for limited types of belief networks, such as purely discrete networks. Expectation Propagation approximates the belief states with expectations, such as means and variances, giving it much wider scope. Expectation Propagation also extends belief propagation in the opposite direction\u2014propagating richer belief states which incorporate correlations between variables. \nThis framework is demonstrated in a variety of statistical models using synthetic and real-world data. On Gaussian mixture problems, Expectation Propagation is found, for the same amount of computation, to be convincingly better than rival approximation techniques: Monte Carlo, Laplace's method, and variational Bayes. For pattern recognition, Expectation Propagation provides an algorithm for training Bayes Point Machine classifiers that is faster and more accurate than any previously known. The resulting classifiers outperform Support Vector Machines on several standard datasets, in addition to having a comparable training time. Expectation Propagation can also be used to choose an appropriate feature set for classification, via Bayesian model selection.

Our work builds on recent results by Yedidia, Freeman, and Weiss (2000), who showed that the fixed points of BP and GBP algorithms correspond to extrema of the Bethe and Kikuchi free energies, respectively. We obtain two algorithms by applying CCCP to the Bethe and Kikuchi free energies, respectively (CCCP is a procedure, introduced here, for obtaining discrete iterative algorithms by decomposing a cost function into a concave and a convex part). We implement our CCCP algorithms on two- and three-dimensional spin glasses and compare their results to BP and GBP. Our simulations show that the CCCP algorithms are stable and converge very quickly (the speed of CCCP is similar to that of BP and GBP). Unlike CCCP, BP will often not converge for these problems (GBP usually, but not always, converges). The results found by CCCP applied to the Bethe or Kikuchi free energies are equivalent, or slightly better than, those found by BP or GBP, respectively (when BP and GBP converge). Note that for these, and other problems, BP and GBP give very accurate results (see Yedidia et al., 2000), and failure to converge is their major error mode. Finally, we point out that our algorithms have a large range of inference and learning applications."

Such a factorization can be visualized with a bipartite graph that we call a factor graph, In this tutorial paper, we present a generic message-passing algorithm, the sum-product algorithm, that operates in a factor graph. Following a single, simple computational rule, the sum-product algorithm computes-either exactly or approximately-various marginal functions derived from the global function. A wide variety of algorithms developed in artificial intelligence, signal processing, and digital communications can be derived as specific instances of the sum-product algorithm, including the forward/backward algorithm, the Viterbi algorithm, the iterative \"turbo\" decoding algorithm, Pearl's (1988) belief propagation algorithm for Bayesian networks, the Kalman filter, and certain fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithms."

We present a new approximate learning algorithm for Boltzmann machines, based on mean-field theory and the linear response theorem. The computational complexity of the algorithm is cubic in the number of neurons. In the absence of hidden units, we show how the weights can be directly computed from the fixed-point equation of the learning rules. Thus, in this case we do not need to use a gradient descent procedure for the learning process. We show that the solutions of this method are close to the optimal solutions and give a significant improvement when correlations play a significant role. Finally, we apply the method to a pattern completion task and show good performance for networks up to 100 neurons."

The author provides a coherent explication of probability as a language for reasoning with partial belief and offers a unifying perspective on other AI approaches to uncertainty, such as the Dempster-Shafer formalism, truth maintenance systems, and nonmonotonic logic. The author distinguishes syntactic and semantic approaches to uncertainty\u0097and offers techniques, based on belief networks, that provide a mechanism for making semantics-based systems operational. Specifically, network-propagation techniques serve as a mechanism for combining the theoretical coherence of probability theory with modern demands of reasoning-systems technology: modular declarative inputs, conceptually meaningful inferences, and parallel distributed computation. Application areas include diagnosis, forecasting, image interpretation, multi-sensor fusion, decision support systems, plan recognition, planning, speech recognition\u0097in short, almost every task requiring that conclusions be drawn from uncertain clues and incomplete information. \nProbabilistic Reasoning in Intelligent Systems will be of special interest to scholars and researchers in AI, decision theory, statistics, logic, philosophy, cognitive psychology, and the management sciences. Professionals in the areas of knowledge-based systems, operations research, engineering, and statistics will find theoretical and computational tools of immediate practical use. The book can also be used as an excellent text for graduate-level courses in AI, operations research, or applied probability."
