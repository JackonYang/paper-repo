As pointed out for example by H. E. Daniels [2], these problems can often be solved by asymptotic series derived by the saddle-point method from integrals containing a large parameter. Daniels gave a form of saddle-point theorem that is convenient for applications to probability and statistics. In the present paper we extend the theorem in various directions and give some applications to distributions connected with the multinomial distribution, especially to the distribution of $\\chi^2$ and to the distribution of the maximum entry in a multinomial distribution."

A consistent and simple approach is used in developing the various test procedures and the results are given in the form of analysis-of-information tables. Beginning with tests of hypotheses for a one-way table, tests of hypotheses of specified probabilities, independence, conditional independence, homogeneity of classifications, and symmetry are developed for contingency tables of two, three, four, and higher order classihcations. For the Markov chains, the tests include the hypotheses of a specified matrix of transition probabilities, Markovity, and homogeneity of several realizations of Markov chains. Worked examples are given throughout the paper."

Being invariant in form on transformation, this new rule avoids the mathematical inconsistencies associated with the classical rule of \u2018uniform distribution of ignorance\u2019 and yields results which, particularly in certain critical extreme cases, do not appear to be unreasonable. Such a rule is, of course, a postulate and is not susceptible of proof; its object is to enable inverse probability to operate as a unified principle upon which methods may be devised of allowing a set of statistics to tell their complete and unbiased story about the parameters of the distribution law of the population from which they have been drawn, without the introduction of any knowledge beyond and extraneous to the statistics themselves. The forms appropriate for the prior probabilities in certain other circumstances are also discussed, including the important case where the unknown parameter is a probability, or proportion, for which it is desired to allow for prior bias. Before proceeding to the main purpose of the paper, however, it is convenient to provide some background to the subject. Reference is first made to certain modern writers to indicate how the problem with which inverse probability is concerned occupies a central place in the foundations of scientific method and in modern philosophy. In quoting from these writers I am not to be taken as suggesting that they necessarily support the inverse probability approach to the problem. The next section of the paper contains some brief comments on the direct statistical methods which have been devised in recent times to side-step induction and inverse probability, and this is followed by a few remarks on the various definitions of probability."

                "text": "Following the demonstration of a significant excess of blood group A in patients with cancer of the stomach (Aird, Bentall & Roberts, 1953) and of group 0 in sufferers from peptic ulcer (Aird, Bentall, Mehigan & Roberts, 1954) and from toxaemia of pregnancy (Pike & Dickins, 1954) i t seems certain that many more studies will be made on the relation between blood groups and disease. It is therefore important that the best possible statistical methods should be used. The procedure recommended by Aird et al. (1954) is very efficient, but it is open to criticism on one rather important point. These workers take as criterion the difference in proportion of a given blood group in the disease and the control series. Denote the two blood types a and p. Suppose the disease series contains h patients of type a and k of type 8, where h + k = n, and the control series hw H of type a and K of type ,3, where H + K = N . Aird and associates calculate d = h/n H / N . This is tested for significance against its sampling variance, combined with estimates from other bodies of data to give a weighted mean estimate, and compared with these other estimates in tests for heterogeneity. Unfortunately, d will differ from one community to another even when the specific attack rate within any given blood group stays constant. This can be shown by a simple example. Consider a community of 10,000 people in which H and K are each 5000. Then if h= 100 and k = 50, d = 100/150 0.5, or 0.1667. Now consider another community in which His 9000 and K is 1000. In this case h= 180 and k10, so d = 180/190-0.9, or 0.0474. Even when the essential biological conditions are identical, differences in blood-group frequencies in the population will introduce spurious heterogeneity. This kind of artefact is avoided if one works with incidence rates in the various blood groups. The data usually do not permit calculation of absolute rates, nor are they needed. What is wanted and readily obtained is an estimate of the ratio of one rate to another. The incidence in group a will be h/H x some constant, and that in group /? will be k/K x the same constant. If the ratio is taken aa x to 1, an estimate of x will be hK/Hk, and it may readily be shown that this is the maximum-likelihood estimate. The use of x is recommended instead of d as a criterion of differential incidence of disease in relation to blood group. In all statistical computations it is best to transform x into its logarithm. This avoids difficulties due to asymmetry. If comparison of a with B gives x = 2 say, comparison of /3 with a will give x= 4; but log x will retain its numerical value, merely changing in sign. Moreover, the sampling variance of log x is a very simple expression free of \u2018nuisance parameters\u2019. This is especially true if one transforms into y=log, x. If V is the sampling variance of y, then v = l / h + l / k + 1/H+ 1/K,"

Most current statistical thinking does not use such a distribution but we feel that some illumination and understanding can be gained through its use, and, in our more enthusiastic moments, we even feel that only a completely Bayesian attitude towards statistical thinking is coherent and practical. The purpose of this paper is not to present propaganda in favor of the Bayesian attitude but merely to explore the consequences of it. The first two sections of the paper deal with the large-sample problem where the effect of the prior distribution is small and the inferences and decisions made using a Bayesian approach correspond fairly closely with current practice and are similar to those given by Le Cam [7] using the usual approach. If we emphasize any differences that do exist it is because they are of interest: the most important point is the similarity. In the final sections of the paper the problem of small samples is discussed. Here the prior distribution is important and much of the discussion centers around the choice of it. Some tentative rules are suggested for the choice and comparison is made with the work of Jeffreys. The discussion here is fragmentary and incomplete: but it is hoped that the arguments, unsatisfactory as they are, will stimulate others to produce better ones. Throughout this paper only the problem of the analysis of an experiment is discussed. Design problems are not considered."

A preliminary discussion is given of the second law of thermodynamics and of a certain class of irreversible processes, in an approximation equivalent to that of the semiclassical theory of radiation."

To a considerable extent the continuous case can be obtained through a limiting process from the discrete case by dividing the continuum of messages and signals into a large but finite number of small regions and calculating the various parameters involved on a discrete basis. As the size of the regions is decreased these parameters in general approach as limits the proper values for the continuous case. There are, however, a few new effects that appear and also a general change of emphasis in the direction of specialization of the general results to particular cases."
