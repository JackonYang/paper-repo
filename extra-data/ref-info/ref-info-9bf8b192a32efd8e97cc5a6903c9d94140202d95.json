                "text": "Multidimensional scaling can be considered as involving three basic steps. In the first step, a scale of comparative distances between all pairs of stimuli is obtained. This scale is analogous to the scale of stimuli obtained in the traditional paired comparisons methods. In this scale, however, instead of locating each stimulus-object on a given continuum, the distances between each pair of stimuli are located on a distance continuum. As in paired comparisons, the procedures for obtaining a scale of comparative distances leave the true zero point undetermined. Hence, a comparative distance is not a distance in the usual sense of the term, but is a distance minus an unknown constant. The second step involves estimating this unknown constant. When the unknown constant is obtained, the comparative distances can be converted into absolute distances. In the third step, the dimensionality of the psychological space necessary to account for these absolute distances is determined, and the projections of stimuli on axes of this space are obtained. A set of analytical procedures was developed for each of the three steps given above, including a least-squares solution for obtaining comparative distances by the complete method of triads, two practical methods for estimating the additive constant, and an extension of Young and Householder's Euclidean model to include procedures for obtaining the projections of stimuli on axes from fallible absolute distances."

The method has been developed by a colleague, William Hays, at the University of Michigan, and it grew out of his thesis work on the multidimensional unfolding of preferential choice behavior (3 ) . His manuscript on this new method3 is now in preparation. First I shall say a little about the problem of similarity, the kind of data that may be involved, and the usual method of analyzing it, then I shall discuss Hays' nonmetric model and present an application of it to a Morse code confusion matrix. The problem of similarity is fundamental to many surveillance operations that involve pattern recognition. For instance, in the interpretation of optical, infra-red or radar photographs, or interpretation of received communications signals or in the judgment of military situations, officers are continually faced with the problem of making such judgments. I don't need to dwell on the general significance of the problem of similarity to psychology. Attneave, in his paper on the dimensions of similarity ( I ) , points out its use as an intervening variable in theories about perceptual organization, association, transfer, and retroactive inhibition. These very phenomena might themselves be used to define and measure similarity but then, of course, the concept cannot be used to explain the same phenomena used to define and measure it. Consequently, one finds no uniformity in the literature on this problem. A great variety of response measures can be and have been used as the source data for measuring similarity. These include: amplitude of response, latency, probability or consistency, judgment of similarity, confusion matrices, matching behavior ( Same-Diff erent ) , GSRs, and so forth. I think an essential element of what characterizes what we mean by"

To secure judgments, schedules were sent to students of international affairs at several times during the last five years. The method of equal-appearing intervals was used to determine the relative probability of war for 88 pairs of states in January, 1937; the method of \u201ctriadic combinations\u201d to determine relative friendliness among the Great Powers in November, 1938; and the method of \u201cmultidimensional\u201d or group rank order to measure the attitudes of important states toward the Great Powers in March and April, 1939; June, 1940; and June, 1941. A chart of scale values for the pairs of Great Powers shows the changing trends since 1937. The last two methods were used to depict the Great Powers in multidimensional space according to their mutual friendliness, thus permitting the application of a type of factor analysis. The reliability of the methods employed was high, and various types of evidence support the general validity of the results."

Could other assortings of responses be made to illustrate something else-perhaps the futility of \"guided group conversation,\" as the method also has been called? Research on how to make use of transcriptions seems urgently needed. Perhaps investigators with different philosophical and methodological orientations could be induced to listen to, and to interpret, a succession of extensive transcriptions of actual group sessions. It would be interesting to see to what extent they reach similar conclusions from the babel of conversation! Some of these questions are directly involved in the further research now under way in connection with the New Jersey project in Guided Group Interaction. It would be my judgment that this experiment constitutes some of the most important research in criminology now going on in the United States. This work is likely to produce results of basic importance both for the practice of penology and for the advancement of research methodology in the field."
