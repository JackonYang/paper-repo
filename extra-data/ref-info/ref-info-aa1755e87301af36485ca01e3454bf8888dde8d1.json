The human visual recognition process is so astonishingly effortless, however, that most people take it entirely for granted, without questioning the extended complexity of neural processing that must be involved. So much so that it is sometimes difficult for people to realise just how complex is the process of visual perception, quite apart from the additional burden of recognition. Indeed, the Nobel Prizewinner Francis Crick (1979) expressed the problem well when he said \u201cFew people realise what an astonishing achievement it is to be able to see at all\u201d. One of the aims of my group at RARDE is to attempt an understanding of visual recognition, in order that it may be modelled and, ultimately, simulated by computers and electro-optic imaging systems. Clearly, an early stage in the development of modelling must involve the collection of relevant data in several different fields of human endeavour, such as physical optics, psychology and neurophysiology. The decision to use faces as recognition targets was based on their essential ubiquity and familiarity; observers would not require special training to recognise them."

In this paper, a novel recognition approach to human faces is proposed, which is based on the statistical model in the optimal discriminant space. Singular value vector has been proposed to represent algebraic features of images. This kind of feature vector has some important properties of algebraic and geometric invariance, and insensitiveness to noise. Because singular value vector is usually of high dimensionality, and recognition model based on these feature vectors belongs to the problem of small sample size, which has not been solved completely, dimensionality compression of singular value vector is very necessary. In our method, an optimal discriminant transformation is constructed to transform an original space of singular value vector into a new space in which its dimensionality is significantly lower than that in the original space. Finally, a recognition model is established in the new space. Experimental results show that our method has very good recognition performance, and recognition accuracies of 100 percent are obtained for all 64 facial images of 8 classes of human faces."

Each silhouette is preprocessed to remove noise, smooth edges, and extract the front edge. The processed silhouettes are then represented by a 12-dimensional feature vector, the components of which are obtained by a circular autocorrelation function. Using a weighted k-nearest neighbor decision rule it is shown that a recognition accuracy of 90 percent is attainable in a ten-class problem. An adaptive training procedure is also described which is used for setting up the authority files. This training procedure appears to identify those feature vectors representing a class which are either most important, from an information content point of view, or are observed most often. Finally, a comparison is made between the recognition accuracy obtained using circular autocorrelation features and moment invariant features. It is shown that the former outperforms, in this problem, the latter. The system is also compared to human observers with the result that the system performs no worse than the human observers."

This approach treats face recognition as a two-dimensional recognition problem, taking advantage of the fact that faces are normally upright and thus may be described by a small set of 2-D characteristic views. Face images are projected onto a feature space ('face space') that best encodes the variation among known face images. The face space is defined by the 'eigenfaces', which are the eigenvectors of the set of faces; they do not necessarily correspond to isolated features such as eyes, ears, and noses. The framework provides the ability to learn to recognize new faces in an unsupervised manner.<<ETX>>"

Our previous studies of physical transformations of the face, including translation, small rotations, and illumination changes, showed that the set of face images consists of relatively simple connected subregions in image space. Consequently linear matching techniques can be used to obtain reliable face recognition. However, for more general transformations, such as large rotations or scale changes, the face subregions become highly non-convex. We have therefore developed a scale-space matching technique that allows us to take advantage of knowledge about important geometrical transformations and about the topology of the face subregion in image space. While recognition of faces is the focus of this paper, the algorithm is sufficiently general to be applicable to a large variety of object recognition tasks"

Distinct facial features correspond to convex regions of the range image of the face, which is obtained by a segmentation of the range image based on the sign of the mean and Gaussian curvature at each point. Each convex region is represented by its extended Gaussian image, a 1-1 mapping between points of the region and points on the unit sphere that have the same normal. Several issues are examined that are associated with the difficult problem of interpolation of the values of the extended Gaussian image and its representation. A similarity measure between two regions is obtained by correlating their extended Gaussian images. To establish the optimal correspondence, a graph matching algorithm is applied. It uses the correlation matrix between convex regions of the two faces and incorporates additional relational constraints that account for the relative spatial locations of the convex regions in the domain of the range image.<<ETX>>"

A series of 5 experiments explored the 7-month infant's ability to discriminate among photos of faces. The infant's tendency to choose novel visual targets for inspection provides evidence of discrimination and recognition. 2 initial experiments demonstrated the infants' ability to discriminate among photos of adult male faces and among poses of the same man's face. In the third, fourth, and fifth experiments, some variant of a face that had been previously exposed served as the \"familiar\" target on recognition testing. The aim was to see if the infant was capable of identifying the variant of the previously seen face. 3 examples of this ability to detect features common to,2 instances of faces were demonstrated: Features common to different poses of a man's face were recognized; infants responded to invariance in pose; and infants identified a face as familiar on recognition testing when another instance of that same-sex face had been presented for initial examination. Providing multiple instances of the same-sex face prior to recognition testing facilitated the latter identification task."

The eye is modeled using a deformable template that specifies a parameterized geometry and an intensity model. The fit of the template is measured by a cost-functional employing robust estimators, i.e., (alpha) -trimmed means and variances, to overcome highlights, shadows, nonrigid boundaries, noise, and other such difficulties. Recognition proceeds in three stages. First, candidate eyes are located by matching a simplified eye model against the responses of a robust, general purpose detector of intensity valleys and peaks. Second, the best fit of each candidate eye is found by minimizing the energy of a cost functional. Third, each candidate is accepted or rejected based on the amount of variance in the image data it explains."

On the one hand, they included a large input from cognitive psychologists who are being increasingly successful in their attempts to fractionate the processes involved in perceiving and recognising faces. On the other hand, they highlighted how much is yet to be learned about the biological substrates of face recognition, how it develops, how it is represented in neural structures and how such knowledge can reciprocally inform the work of cognitive psychologists. Thus at many points it became evident that knowledge derived from each of these complementary approaches to common problems could and should inform and modify the models and techniques developed primarily within the other framework. Whilst the papers presented were wide ranging in their scope it is possible, nevertheless with some slight oversimplifications, to identify several recurring issues which may help to map out the most likely profitable lines of investigation for future work. In the final plenary session I identified what seemed to me to be these recurring issues and this paper summarises that presentation together with the reactions to it in the ensuing open discussion. It also looks back at the preceding papers and shows how the various contributions indicated actual or potential links at the interface between neuropsychology and cognitive psychology, whilst acknowledging that the dichotomy is a useful rather than a very substantive one."

The system learns a face by analyzing it and storing the extracted features in a database. This analysis starts from a very robust detection of a face and its position scale and orientation based on the position of the eyes. The. four transformation parameters define the face-specific coordinates which are used during the entire analysis. In these coordinates some face features are detected and stored which belong roughly to three categories: geometrical proportions surface properties and iconic features. The identification of a person using a different picture of a known person also starts from a face analysis. Using the features the presented face is correlated with all faces present in the database. The correlation of the extracted features contains two steps: individual measures (correlating iconic features computing differences in geometrical proportions or surface properties) give the similarity between two faces for one feature while a global measure (a Euclidean norm for instance) combines these similarity values. The system is therefore able to identify a known person by finding the best match. The results of the system on real images are presented. It is shown that the identification is quite selective."

The first of these tested subjects' ability to reconstruct photographs of faces made up of features randomly selected from the Kit. Two presentation procedures were examined: either the stimulus face was present throughout the reconstruction, or it was reconstructed from memory. The face present condition produced better reconstructions than did the memory condition, though both were far from perfect. Subjects (encoders) who had performed relatively well or badly on the memory condition in Expt. I were used in Expt. II which was concerned with the ease with which Photo-fit reconstructions of a photographed real face could be identified (decoded) by other subjects. The overall success rate was quite low, but the reconstructions of good encoders were more easily recognized than were those of poor encoder subjects."

In other situations, information about an object is available piecemeal as the parts are scanned sequentially, such as when eye-motions are used to explore an object. Part information is also crucially important for objects with articulating parts, or with removable parts. In all of these cases, the sensor-scanner system must divide an object into subcomponents, and must also be able to integrate the part-information using appropriate data concerning the spatial relationships among the parts as well as the temporal scan sequences. This work describes how such issues are addressed in recognizing human faces from their parts using a neural network approach. Parallels are drawn between neurophysiological and psychophysical experiments, as well as deficits in visual object recognition. This work extends our existing modular system, developed for learning and recognizing 3D objects from multiple views, by investigating the capabilities which need to be augmented for coping with objects which are represented hierarchically. The ability of the previous system to learn and recognize 3D objects invariant to their apparent size, orientation, position, perspective projection, and 3D pose serves as a strong foundation for the extension to more complex 3D objects."

Curature captures many features necessary to accurately describe the face, such as the shape of the forehead, jawline, and cheeks, which are not easily detected from standard intensity images. Moreover, the value of curvature at a point on the surface is also viewpoint invariant. Until recently range data of high enough resolution and accuracy to perform useful curvature calculations on the scale of the human face had been unavailable. Although several researchers have worked on the problem of interpreting range data from curved (although usually highly geometrically structured) surfaces, the main approaches have centered on segmentation by signs of mean and Gaussian curvature which have not proved sufficient in themselves for the case of the human face. This paper details the calculation of principal curvature for a particular data set, the calculation of general surface descriptors based on curvature, and the calculation of face specific descriptors based both on curvature features and a priori knowledge about the structure of the face. These face specific descriptors can be incorporated into many different recognition strategies. A system that implements one such strategy, depth template comparison, giving recognition rates between 80% and 90% is described."

Past work in the computer science and artificial intelligence literature on the decomposition of pictures into their basic building blocks is consistent with our motivation, but this paper will look at the simplest description over all possible methods. Thus, the program complexity of Kolmogorov given the domain is mini-mum in finite length such that a Turing Machine can compute functions in finite time. So, the string approach is well used as Kolmogorov process. The Circular Layer Chart for Recognition (CLCR) is created with total number of elements (29,-1)*4, where L is the number of layers counted from innermost cell in even 2.1 number. A sequence of string arrays, called Circular Layer String Arrays (CLSA), are achieved for each layer. In this paper there are twenty layers used for the recognition of human face pictures. The distance between both arrays of corresponding layers of test pattern and sample is calculated. The inner five layers are applied for the normalization of orientation. That is, if any of these inner layers does not match, the arrays of test pattern are rotated one position and tried again until they are rotated one circle. If any array of inner layers does not match through the normalization of orientation, the sample is rejected. Thus it can save much time for matching."

Eye spacing measurement has been identified as an important step in achieving this goal. Measurement of spacing has been made by application of the Hough transform technique to detect the instance of a circular shape and of an ellipsoidal shape which approximate the perimeter of the iris and both the perimeter of the sclera and the shape of the region below the eyebrows respectively. Both gradient magnitude and gradient direction were used to handle the noise contaminating the feature space. Results of this application indicate that measurement of the spacing by detection of the iris is the most accurate of these three methods with measurement by detection of the position of the eyebrows the least accurate. However, measurement by detection of the eyebrows' position is the least constrained method. Application of these techniques has led to measurement of a characteristic feature of the human face with sufficient accuracy to merit later inclusion in a full package for automated facial recognition."

The system is an application of the dynamic link architecture, which owes its strength to an enhancement of tradition neural networks by a new kind of variable to express the hierarchical grouping of neurons. This capability is used to group primitive local feature detectors (Gabor-based wavelets) into composite feature detectors (jets) and to preserve neighborhood relationships between jets when they lose position information on the way from the image domain to the object domain. Due to the potential for grouping, objects can be represented as attributed graphs, with jets serving as attributes. Recognition is formulated as graph matching and is implemented as a topologically constrained diffusion of image-object links. A hierarchical sequence of matches, from low-frequency components of jets to high-frequency components, is used. Size invariance is achieved by interposing diffusion steps in magnification space. The system is implemented on a network of transputers"

Performance improved markedly between ages 6 and 10 and then remained at a fixed level or actually declined for several years, finally improving again by age 16. Evidence is provided that this distinctive developmental course reflects, in part, acquisition of processes specific to the encoding effaces rather than general pattern encoding or metamemorial skills. The possibility that maturational factors contribute to the developmental course efface recognition is raised, and two sources of data relevant to assessing this possibility are discussed. Normal adults have a prodigious capacity for making new faces familiar. Whether one's high school class contained 90 or 800 people, approximately 90% of those classmates are recognized 35 years after graduation (Bahrick, Bahrick, & Wittlinger, 1975). Less dramatically, laboratory studies have shown that very brief exposure to previously unfamiliar faces permits subjects to distinguish those faces from new ones at a later time. The level of performance remains high across inspection sets that range in size from 20 to 72 (Bower & Karlin, 1974; Galper, 1970; Hochberg & Galper, 1967; Yarmey, 1971; Yin, 1969; but also see Diamond & Carey, 1977, and Patterson & Baddeley,"

Accurate visual recognition is demonstrated using a database of O(10/sup 3/) faces. The problem of recognition under general viewing orientation is also examined. A view-based multiple-observer eigenspace technique is proposed for use in face recognition under variable pose. In addition, a modular eigenspace description technique is used which incorporates salient features such as the eyes, nose and mouth, in an eigenfeature layer. This modular representation yields higher recognition rates as well as a more robust framework for face recognition. An automatic feature extraction technique using feature eigentemplates is also demonstrated.<<ETX>>"

The 3-D CG models of human faces are obtained using a new 3-D scanner. A database of synthesized face images simulating diverse imaging conditions is automatically constructed from the 3-D CG model of the subject's face by generating a series of images while varying the image synthesis parameters. The database is successfully applied to the extraction of a pair-wise discriminant that achieves higher class separability against real face images of two subjects acquired under disparate imaging conditions. The use of the 3-D CG model in training a classifier is shown to yield more accurate face recognition in the framework of 2-D image matching."

The dynamic link architecture exploits correlations in the fine-scale temporal structure of cellular signals to group neurons dynamically into higher-order entities. These entities represent a rich structure and can code for high-level objects. To demonstrate the capabilities of the dynamic link architecture, a program was implemented that can recognize human faces and other objects from video images. Memorized objects are represented by sparse graphs, whose vertices are labeled by a multiresolution description in terms of a local power spectrum, and whose edges are labeled by geometrical distance vectors. Object recognition can be formulated as elastic graph matching, which is performed here by stochastic optimization of a matching cost function. The implementation on a transputer network achieved recognition of human faces and office objects from gray-level camera images. The performance of the program is evaluated by a statistical analysis of recognition results from a portrait gallery comprising images of 87 persons. >"

Examples of this ubiquitous problem in computer vision arise in tasks involving hand-eye coordination (such as assembling or sorting), inspection tasks, gauging operations, and in navigation and localization of mobile robots. This book describes an extended series of experiments into the role of geometry in the critical area of object recognition. It provides precise definitions of the recognition and localization problems, describes the methods used to address them, analyzes the solutions to these problems, and addresses the implications of this analysis.The solution to problems of object recognition are of fundamental importance in many real applications and versions of the techniques described here are already being used in industrial settings. Although a number of questions remain to be solved, the authors provide a valuable framework for understanding both the strengths and limitations of using object shape to guide recognition.W. Eric L.

The projective coordinates of projective image on feature images are used as the feature vectors which represent the inherent attributes of human faces. Finally, the feature extraction method of human face images is derived and a hierarchical distance classifier for human face recognition is constructed. The experiments have shown that the recognition method based on the coordinate feature vector is a powerful method for recognizing human face images, and recognition accuracies of 100 percent are obtained for all 64 facial images in eight classes of human faces.<<ETX>>"

The aim is to develop methods for image understanding based on structured restoration, for example automatic detection of abnormalities. The limits of applicability of the algorithms are also traced by making the optical degradations more and more severe until the algorithms no longer succeed in their task.

A pyramid-like modular network has been developed to learn and identify hand-drawn fKia1 expressions. Because of the nature of the network architecture, image size becomes less of an issue in network learning. The network exhibits a parallel learning capability which could be used to speed up the training process. An analysis of the hidden units of the network reveals that features are used in learning when there is commonality of facial features in the training patterns. We have also demonstrated attention focusing in the network by masking off specific areas of the face during testing. Our network model creates a \"leaner\" representation of the original fe object and classification is based on this representation. By including the leaner representation and separate key features in the final training set we can simulate a coarse-to-find search method, as in image processing."

Recognition was measured as a function of number of faces viewed and of vertical orientation. Recognition accuracy was significantly greater for upright than for inverted photographs, suggesting that faces are not here perceived and stored simply as patterns. Inspection Series length did not significantly affect recognition accuracy. Comparison of upright-viewing-and-upright-recognition with inverted-viewing-and-upright-recognition yielded no significant differences in accuracy, suggesting that unlike information stored during upright viewing, information stored during inverted viewing is not strongly tied to orientation."

The author has analyzed the computations performed in the course of visual motion analysis. Workable schemes able to perform certain tasks performed by the visual system have been constructed and used as vehicles for investigating the problems faced by the visual system and its methods for solving them.Two major problems are treated: first, the correspondence problem, which concerns the identification of image elements that represent the same object at different times, thereby maintaining the perceptual identity of the object in motion or in change. The second problem is the three-dimensional interpretation of the changing image once a correspondence has been established.The author's computational approach to visual theory makes the work unique, and it should be of interest to psychologists working in visual perception and readers interested in cognitive studies in general, as well as computer scientists interested in machine vision, theoretical neurophysiologists, and philosophers of science."

                "text": "This paper explores the use of morphological operators for feature extraction in range images and curvature maps of the human face. Two general procedures are described. The first is the identification of connected part boundaries for convex structures, which is used to extract the nose outline and the eye socket outlines of the face. The part boundaries are defined locally based on minima of minimum principal curvature on the surface. The locus of these points suggests boundary lines which surround most convex regions on the surface. However, most of these boundaries are not completely connected. To remedy this problem, a general two-step connection procedure is developed: the partial boundaries are first dilated in such a way that the gaps between them are filled. Second, the resulting dilated outlines are skeletonized with the constraint that the pixels belonging to the original boundary parts cannot be removed. A marker which identifies the convex region being described is then used to select the region enclosed by the new connected outline. Examples are given of this procedure in the extraction of the nose boundary and eye socket boundary. The second general procedure discussed is the identification of connected ridge lines, which is demonstrated in the extraction of the browline and the chin/jaw line. Ridge lines are defined as local maxima of maximum curvature in the direction of maximum curvature. The same skeleton-based procedure as above is first used to connect the ridge lines. Skeletonization is then used again to reduce these lines to simply connected ones. The last step primarily consists in extracting the longest path within the obtained components: this is achieved by using the propagation function to find the extremities of these paths and then connecting them within the components by means of geodesic distance functions. The entire process provides a robust and accurate extraction of brow and chin/jaw lines."

This description has to take into account the spatial or temporal variations which are encountered throughout an image sequence.

This identification method uses a facial three-dimensional (3-D) shape that is extracted from an absolute range map. The important issue is to determine what to use as feature vector components for the identification of 3-D objects. There have been several approaches to identify 3-D objects, but in the identification of objects that have smooth and complex shape (such as a human face) such approaches did not use the whole feature included in an object, or a long time was required for the identification because of the large number of feature vector components needed. \n \n \n \nTo solve these problems, an approximation of a facial surface with a B-spline surface was made by least-square fitting, and the vertices of the B-spline surface were used as feature vector components for the identification. Since this process condenses the whole feature included in a surface into a small number of points (vertices), features can be used efficiently for the identification. By this method, identification accuracy of 98.8 percent is obtained for 33 persons (5 data/person)."

We combine the K-L expansion technique with two new operations that transform the face pattern into an invariant feature space. The two operations are the affine transformation which yields a standard face view from the input face image, and its transformation into the Fourier spectrum domain, which develops the property of shift-invariance. Although the basic idea of applying the K-L expansion to extract features for face recognition originates from the eigenface approach proposed by Turk and Pentland our scheme offers superior performance due to the transformation into the invariant feature space. The performance of the two schemes for face identification against various imaging conditions is compared."

Early visuospatial processing, and the creation and comparison of facial representations, appear to be carried out more efficiently by the right hemisphere. Comparisons based on discrete, namable features of faces may yield a left hemisphere advantage. It is also proposed that faces may activate semantic information, including names, more efficiently in the left hemisphere. The model is useful in resolving inconsistencies in the degree and direction of asymmetries found in face-recognition tasks. Suggestions are also made for future research."

This paper is addressed to the latter problem and is specifically concerned with automatic recognition of aircraft types from optical images. An experimental system is described in which certain features called moment invariants are extracted from binary television images and are then used for automatic classification. This experimental system has exhibited a significantly lower error rate than human observers in a limited laboratory test involving 132 images of six aircraft types. Preliminary indications are that this performance can be extended to a wider class of objects and that identification can be accomplished in one second or less with a small computer."

Then an optimal matching of the two profiles is done, which allows the calculation of similarity indices of profiles or surfaces.

This book examines the measurement of this movement and the use of relative movement to locate the boundaries of physical objects in the environment. It investigates the nature of the computations that are necessary to perform this analysis by any vision system, biological or artificial. \nThe author first defines the goals of these visual tasks, reveals the properties of the physical world that a vision system can rely upon to achieve such goals, and suggests general methods that can be used to carry out the tasks. From the general methods, she designs algorithms specifying a particular sequence of computations that a vision system can execute to perform these visual tasks. These algorithms are implemented on a computer system under a variety of circumstances. Combined with the traditional approaches of psychology and neurophysiology, this computational approach provides an exciting analysis of visual function, raising many new questions about the human vision system for further investigation. \nEllen Catherine Hildreth received her doctorate from MIT. She is a Research Scientist in the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory and associate director of theCenter for Biological Information Processing at the Whitaker College of Health Sciences, Technology, and Management.

It is shown that four P-type Fourier coefficients in the low frequency range can identify 65 face profiles, with the accuracy of 100%."

                "text": "We present a mid-level system for 2D object recognition, comprised of an adaptive feature extractor and a dynamical link graph matcher. The system is robust to variations caused by translation, scale, perspective, lighting, and partial occlusion. The feature extractor performs a Morlet wavelet decomposition that results in a feature vector for each point in the image. The feature vectors are quantized to a set of learned model vectors and labeled. Using a saliency measure derived during the decomposition, an object graph is formed and compared to graphs stored in the associative memory of the dynamical link graph matcher. The graph matcher that has formed the basis for our work comes from (von der Malsburg and Bienenstock, 1987). That system, not intended as a robust recognition system, was the first to use dynamical links in graph matching and demonstrated a rudimentary invariant recognition capability. We have improved on this graph matcher by providing the capacity for a richer (than binary) feature set and by increasing the processing speed through improved dynamics and a reduction in the number of nodes needed to represent an object. Our system uses a number of biologically plausible mechanisms (Gabor filters, temporal correlations, neural networks) and is in other ways guided by biological principles (local connections, saliency, internal focus of attention, self-organizing topological maps, orientation column tuning). The approach is that of an unstructured system, that is, a system in which no domain knowledge is initially embedded but which the system may learn; consequently, the system may be applied to a variety of domains with little or no alteration in architecture or dynamics. Modest extensions to the current system may include multi-modal recognition (fusion), expectation-driven perception, and 3D object recognition.

The problem also arises in monocular perception of motion3, where the two projections represent views which are separated in time as well as space. As Marr and Poggio4 have noted, the fusing of two images to produce a three-dimensional percept involves two distinct processes: the establishment of a 1:1 correspondence between image points in the two views\u2014the \u2018correspondence problem\u2019\u2014and the use of the associated disparities for determining the distances of visible elements in the scene.

Smith in the Chair] SUMMARY A continuous two-dimensional region is partitioned into a fine rectangular array of sites or \"pixels\", each pixel having a particular \"colour\" belonging to a prescribed finite set. The true colouring of the region is unknown but, associated with each pixel, there is a possibly multivariate record which conveys imperfect information about its colour according to a known statistical model. The aim is to reconstruct the true scene, with the additional knowledge that pixels close together tend to have the same or similar colours. In this paper, it is assumed that the local characteristics of the true scene can be represented by a nondegenerate Markov random field. Such information can be combined with the records by Bayes' theorem and the true scene can be estimated according to standard criteria. However, the computational burden is enormous and the reconstruction may reflect undesirable largescale properties of the random field. Thus, a simple, iterative method of reconstruction is proposed, which does not depend on these large-scale characteristics. The method is illustrated by computer simulations in which the original scene is not directly related to the assumed random field. Some complications, including parameter estimation, are discussed. Potential applications are mentioned briefly."

Closely related multiresolution structures and procedures have been developed more or less independently in diverse scientific fields. For example, pyramid and subband representations have been applied to image compression, and promise excellent performance and flexibility. Similar pyramid structures have been developed as models for the neural coding of images within the human visual system. The pyramid has been developed in the computer vision field as a general framework for implementing highly efficient algorithms, including algorithms for motion analysis and object recognition. In this paper I review these multiresolution techniques and discuss how they may be usefully combined in the future. Methods used in image compression, for example, should match the requirements of human perception, and future 'smart' transmission systems will need to perform rapid analysis in order to selectively encode the most critical information in a scene."

The success of the approach depends on the definition of a comprehensive set of goals for the computation of edge points. These goals must be precise enough to delimit the desired behavior of the detector while making minimal assumptions about the form of the solution. We define detection and localization criteria for a class of edges, and present mathematical forms for these criteria as functionals on the operator impulse response. A third criterion is then added to ensure that the detector has only one response to a single edge. We use the criteria in numerical optimization to derive detectors for several common image features, including step edges. On specializing the analysis to step edges, we find that there is a natural uncertainty principle between detection and localization performance, which are the two main goals. With this principle we derive a single operator shape which is optimal at any scale. The optimal detector has a simple approximate implementation in which edges are marked at maxima in gradient magnitude of a Gaussian-smoothed image. We extend this simple detector using operators of several widths to cope with different signal-to-noise ratios in the image. We present a general method, called feature synthesis, for the fine-to-coarse integration of information from operators at different scales. Finally we show that step edge detector performance improves considerably as the operator point spread function is extended along the edge."

We will show that a mathematical theory developed for regularizing ill-posed problems leads in a natural way to the solution of early vision problems in terms of variational principles of a certain class. This is a new theoretical framework for some of the variational solutions already obtained in the analysis of early vision processes. It also shows how several other problems in early vision can be approached and solved."

We have studied the effects of these signals in a region of the macaque temporal cortex where cells have been found to be responsive to the sight of faces. Of cells selectively responsive to the sight of the face or head but not to other objects (182 cells) 63% were sensitive to the orientation of the head. Different views of the head (full face, profile, back or top of the head, face rotated by 45\u00b0 up to the ceiling or down to the floor) maximally activated different classes of cell. All classes of cell, however, remained active as the preferred view was rotated isomorphically or was changed in size or distance. Isomorphic rotation by 90\u2013180\u00b0 increased cell response latencies by 10\u201360 ms. Sensitivity to gaze direction was found for 64% of the cells tested that were tuned to head orientation. Eighteen cells most responsive to the full face preferred eye contact, while 18 cells tuned to the profile face preferred averted gaze. Sensitivity to gaze was thus compatible with, but could be independent of, sensitivity to head orientation. Results suggest that the recognition of one type of object may proceed via the independent high level analysis of several restricted views of the object (viewer-centred descriptions)."

Regarding applications, we show how the morphological filters can be used to provide simple and systematic algorithms for image processing and analysis tasks as diverse as nonlinear image filtering, noise suppression, edge detection, region filling, skeletonization, coding, shape representation, smoothing, and recognition. Regarding theory, we summarize the representation of a large class of translation-invariant nonlinear filters (including morphological, median, order-statistic, and shape recognition filters) as a minimal combination of morphological erosions or dilations; these results provide new realizations of these filters and lead to a unified image algebra."

Three-dimensional features are extracted from the depth map of a scene. A two-pass relaxation method is developed for matching features extracted from successive depth maps. In each iteration, geometrical relationships between a feature and its neighbors in one map are compared to those between a candidate in the other map and its neighbors to update the matching probability of the candidate. The comparison of the geometrical relationship is based on the principle of conservation of distance and angle between features during rigid motion. The use of three-dimensional features allows one to find the rotation and translation components of motion separately via solving linear equations. Experimental results using several sets of real data are presented to illustrate results and difficulties."

However, previous research indicates that the quality of the likenesses produced by commercial composite systems (e.g., Photofit and Identi-kit) are very poor. This study investigated whether the face composites produced using the Mac-A-Mug Pro composite system from memory and while viewing the target differ in quality, and whether quality improves with practice. Subjects used the system over two sessions during which they constructed 11 composites (six from memory and five with the face in view). Composites produced while viewing the target face were better than the composites produced from memory, and both improved with practice. Independent judges matched all but the initial composites from memory at levels better than chance. Implications for future face recall research and the training of potential witnesses are discussed."

These descriptors can be constructed using the methods of invariant theory, which are briefly surveyed. A range of applications of invariant descriptors in 3D model-based vision is demonstrated. First, a model-based vision system that recognizes curved plane objects irrespective of their pose is demonstrated. Curves are not reduced to polyhedral approximations but are handled as objects in their own right. Models are generated directly from image data. Once objects have been recognized, their pose can be computed. Invariant descriptors for 3D objects with plane faces are described. All these ideas are demonstrated using images of real scenes. The stability of a range of invariant descriptors to measurement error is treated in detail. >"

It is based on an optimal representation of a 1-D signal in space - spatial frequency domain, the Wigner distribution. For shape clasification, one of the many 1-D representations of the 2-D contours is employed. Boundary features, or shape descriptors, are obtained using sigular value decomposition of the Wigner distribution (WD). Properties of WD singular values are presented and shown to encode certain shape features such as the space-bandwidth product, the shape complexity in terms of number of components and their spacing, and the spatial frequency vs. the space dependence. The singular values of the boundary Wigner distri bution possess all the properties required of good shape descriptors. To illustrate the effectiveness of these descriptors in shape classification, a number of examples are presented. The proposed method is useful for robust classification of any 1-D patterns."

This method is based on image intensities, motion, and an object model-i.e., a model of the image of a person in motion. Though each part of a person may move in different directions at any instant, the time averaged motion of all parts must converge to a global average value over a few seconds. People in an image may be occluded by other people, and usually it is not easy to detect their boundaries. These boundaries can be detected with motion information if they move in different directions, even if there are almost no apparent differences among object intensities or colors. Each image of a person in a scene usually can be divided into several parts, each with distinct intensities or colors. The parts of a person can be merged into a single group by an iterative merging algorithm based on the object model and the motion information because the parts move coherently. This merging is analogous to the property of perceptual grouping in human visual perception of motion. Experiments based on a sequence of complex real scenes produced results that are supportive of the authors approach to the segmentation of people in motion.<<ETX>>"

                "text": "This thesis presents algorithms for the efficient computation of image motions using hierarchical multiresolution methods operating on image data pyramids in the processing cone architecture. Three topics are addressed: (1) fast construction of image pyramids; (2) hierarchical motion detection algorithms: correlation-based and gradient-based; and (3) multilevel relaxation algorithms. \nPyramid building is the first step in hierarchical motion detection. A family of discrete Gaussian low pass filters for building low pass pyramids is presented that provide good anti-aliasing characteristics, efficient computation, and a good hierarchical Gaussian approximation. Frequency space analysis, using Fourier Transform theory, is used to compare alternative filters. \nHierarchical correlation overcomes two disadvantages of correlation matching: large search areas which require expensive searches, and repeating features which cause incorrect matches. Coarse-to-fine control provides speed and efficiency when search spaces are large, and accuracy when repeating details can be confused. \nHierarchical gradient-based algorithms extend single level gradient-based algorithms to the computation of large disparities. They use a coarse-to-fine method in which approximate disparities are refined at each level by computing relatively small updates. This allows the gradient-based method's assumption of local linearity to apply in spite of the large total disparities. Experiments show the failure of single level methods (for large disparities) and the success of hierarchical methods. \nThe two hierarchical algorithms are shown to have comparable accuracy. Comparison of the computational costs, both arithmetic and data transfer, show that the gradient-based algorithm are, in general, less costly. \nMultilevel relaxation algorithms for the computation of optic flow are developed and experiments show the expected increased convergence rate over single level relaxation, although some experiments present a problem of divergence at coarse levels. A local mode analysis of the relaxation equations shows that convergence is at least as fast as simple smoothing, and that, with strong gradients, convergence is accelerated towards the constraint line. The local mode analysis does not account for coarse level divergence. Divergence is then shown to be due to spatial variation in the image data. Fixed up/down cycling schemes are used to overcome the divergence problem."

                "text": "One basic principle of science, which typically applies to psychology, suggests that one should never seek to explain a psychological fact by a mechanism at a higher level if it can be explained by one at a lower level (Morgan, 1894). This seems to be a reasonable principle, and it compels us to attempt to specify and understand the nature of the preliminary operations that underlie a given process. Such a principle is quite relevant to the problem of face perception, and it is with early visual processes, as well as their implications for later operations, that the present chapter will be concerned. It would be misleading, however, to begin with the idea that one can account for most of the processes underlying perception by considering only these early processes, and this is especially true of face perception. For one thing, perception is a process resulting from the interaction of the incoming information and mental states or cerebral structures, and it is therefore necessary to understand the nature and characteristics of this interaction to explain perceptual processes. For another, the human face is an extremely familiar multidimensional pattern, and our frequent exposure to such a stimulus has enabled us to develop certain processing mechanisms, which some authors (e.g, Goldstein & Chance, 1981) have referred to as \u201cschemata,\u201d that allow access to consistent dimensions which facilitate perception and memory."

An aspect network is an unsupervised module of our complete artificial vision system for detecting and learning the view transitions (as the appearance of a rotating object changes), and for later recognizing objects from sequences of views. By processing sequences of views, the system accumulates evidence over time, thereby increasing the confidence of its recognition decisions. Also, when new views are revealed following views recognized previously by an aspect network during the course of observation, the new views and view-transitions are used to refine the evolving 3D object representation automatically. Recognition is possible even from novel (previously unexperienced) view sequences. The objects used for illustration are model aircraft in flight. The computations are formulated as differential equations among analog nodes and synapses to model the temporal dynamics explicitly."

A proportion of cells in the temporal cortex of monkeys responds specifically to objects, such as faces, but the type of coding used by these cells is not known. Population analysis of two sets of such cells showed that information is carried at the level of the population and that this information relates, in the anterior inferotemporal cortex, to the physical properties of face stimuli and, in the superior temporal polysensory area, to other aspects of the faces, such as their familiarity. There was often sufficient information in small populations of neurons to identify particular faces.

The specific knowledge about facial shape and facial expression is formulated in this model in the form of parameters. A direct method of estimating the two-view motion parameters that is based on the affine method is discussed. Based on the reasonable assumption that the 3-D motion of the face is almost smooth in the time domain, several approaches to predicting the motion of the next frame are proposed. Using a 3-D model, the approach is characterized by a feedback loop connecting computer vision and computer graphics. Embedding the synthesis techniques into the analysis phase greatly improves the performance of motion estimation. Simulations with long image sequences of real-world scenes indicate that the method not only greatly reduces computational complexity but also substantially improves estimation accuracy. >"

The problem considered is that of a rigid body undergoing unknown rotational and translational motion. The measurement data consists of a sequence of noisy image coordinates of two or more object correspondence points. By modeling the object dynamics as a function of time, estimates of the model parameters (including motion parameters) can be extracted from the data using recursive and/or batch techniques. This permits a desired degree of smoothing to be achieved through the use of an arbitrarily large number of images. Some assumptions regarding object structure are presently made. Results are presented for a recursive estimation procedure: the case considered here is that of a sequence of one dimensional images of a two dimensional object. Thus, the object moves in one transverse dimension, and in depth, preserving the fundamental ambiguity of the central projection image model (loss of depth information). An iterated extended Kalman filter is used for the recursive solution. Noise levels of 5-10 percent of the object image size are used. Approximate Cramer-Rao lower bounds are derived for the model parameter estimates as a function of object trajectory and noise level. This approach may be of use in situations where it is difficult to resolve large numbers of object match points, but relatively long sequences of images (10 to 20 or more) are available."

We first consider the case where only a small set of corresponding points is identified and suggest that a technique called regularization improves the quality and stability of a solution. We then observe that, if more pairs of corresponding points are available, the error function becomes smooth and the solution stable. Finally, we try to improve the quality of estimation by considering more than two consecutive frames for a moving camera looking at a stationary scene, and summing the error functions obtained for any two consecutive frames. Surprisingly enough, this technique does not improve stability unless we use regularization again."

Although the texture image may be not have a certain run in the whole image it has a certain run in a small window or local area. By the use of the run information we can easily determine local threshold to segment the image. In this paper a fast segmentation algorithm based on cross threshold selection is presented. Through the use of pipe-line technology both in x- and in y-directions of image plane simutaniously the algorithm is able to not only get a good segmented image but also save much time even in SISD computer."

A second constraint is needed. A method for finding the optical flow pattern is presented which assumes that the apparent velocity of the brightness pattern varies smoothly almost everywhere in the image. An iterative implementation is shown which successfully computes the optical flow for a number of synthetic image sequences. The algorithm is robust in that it can handle image sequences that are quantized rather coarsely in space and time. It is also insensitive to quantization of brightness levels and additive noise. Examples are included where the assumption of smoothness is violated at singular points or along lines in the image."

The maximum a posteriori (MAP) criterion is used to formulate what the best segmentation or interpretation of the scene should be, where the scene is assumed to be made up of some fixed number of moving planar surface patches. The Bayesian approach requires, first, specification of prior expectations for the optic flow field, which here is modeled as spatial and temporal Markov random fields; and, secondly, a way of measuring how well the segmentation predicts the measured flow field. The Markov random fields incorporate the physical constraints that objects and their images are probably spatially continuous, and that their images are likely to move quite smoothly across the image plane. To compute the flow predicted by the segmentation, a recent method for reconstructing the motion and orientation of planar surface facets is used. The search for the globally optimal segmentation is performed using simulated annealing."

Most research for establishing correspondence uses only two frames of a sequence to solve this problem. By using a sequence of frames, it is possible to exploit the fact that due to inertia the motion of an object cannot change instantaneously. By using smoothness of motion, it is possible to solve the correspondence problem for arbitrary motion of several nonrigid objects in a scene. We formulate the correspondence problem as an optimization problem and propose an iterative algorithm to find trajectories of points in a monocular image sequence. A modified form of this algorithm is useful in case of occlusion also. We demonstrate the efficacy of this approach considering synthetic, laboratory, and real scenes."

Lele (1991a) critically discusses these approaches and proposes a new method based on the Euclidean distance matrix representation of the form of an object. The purpose of this paper is to extend this new methodology to the comparison of groups of objects. We develop the statistical versions of various concepts introduced by Lele (1991a) and use them for developing statistical procedures for testing the hypothesis of shape difference between biological forms. We illustrate the use of this method by studying morphological differences between normal children and those affected with Crouzon and Apert syndromes and craniofacial sexual dimorphism in Cebus apella."

The image sequence can be decomposed into a set of overlapping layers, where each layer's motion is described by a smooth flow field. The discontinuities in the description are then attributed to object opacities rather than to the flow itself, mirroring the structure of the scene. A set of techniques is devised for segmenting images into coherently moving regions using affine motion analysis and clustering techniques. It is possible to decompose an image into a set of layers along with information about occlusion and depth ordering. The techniques are applied to a flower garden sequence. The scene can be analyzed into four layers, and, the entire 30-frame sequence can be represented with a single image of each layer, along with associated motion parameters.<<ETX>>"

A curve is represented parametrically as a function of arc length by the accumulated change in direction of the curve since the starting point. This function is expanded in a Fourier series and the coefficients are arranged in the amplitude/phase-angle form. It is shown that the amplitudes are pure form invariants as well as are certain simple functions of phase angles. Rotational and axial symmetry are related directly to simple properties of the Fourier descriptors. An analysis of shape similarity or symmetry can be based on these relationships; also closed symmetric curves can be synthesized from almost arbitrary Fourier descriptors. It is established that the Fourier series expansion is optimal and unique with respect to obtaining coefficients insensitive to starting point. Several examples are provided to indicate the usefulness of Fourier descriptors as features for shape discrimination and a number of interesting symmetric curves are generated by computer and plotted out."

The description is in the form of a matrix and it is obtained by a polar quantization of a shape. The quantization process takes into consideration not only a shape's outer geometry but its inner geometry as well. The descriptor is information preserving and if the quantization parameters are selected properly, it is possible to reconstruct an original shape from its description. In this technique, shape discrimination is possible by a simple EXCLUSIVE-OR operation on shape descriptions."

An algorithm is presented that gives a closed-form solution for motion parameters and the structure of the scene. The algorithm utilizes redundancy in the data to obtain more reliable estimates in the presence of noise. An approach is introduced to estimating the errors in the motion parameters computed by the algorithm. Specifically, standard deviation of the error is estimated in terms of the variance of the errors in the image coordinates of the corresponding points. The estimated errors indicate the reliability of the solution as well as any degeneracy or near degeneracy that causes the failure of the motion estimation algorithm. The presented approach to error estimation applies to a wide variety of problems that involve least-squares optimization or pseudoinverse. Finally the relationships between errors and the parameters of motion and imaging system are analyzed. The results of the analysis show, among other things, that the errors are very sensitive to the translation direction and the range of field view. Simulations are conducted to demonstrate the performance of the algorithms and error estimation as well as the relationships between the errors and the parameters of motion and imaging systems. The algorithms are tested on images of real-world scenes with point of correspondences computed automatically. >"

Pixel gray levels and the presence and orientation of edges are viewed as states of atoms or molecules in a lattice-like physical system. The assignment of an energy function in the physical system determines its Gibbs distribution. Because of the Gibbs distribution, Markov random field (MRF) equivalence, this assignment also determines an MRF image model. The energy function is a more convenient and natural mechanism for embodying picture attributes than are the local characteristics of the MRF. For a range of degradation mechanisms, including blurring, nonlinear deformations, and multiplicative or additive noise, the posterior distribution is an MRF with a structure akin to the image model. By the analogy, the posterior distribution defines another (imaginary) physical system. Gradual temperature reduction in the physical system isolates low energy states (``annealing''), or what is the same thing, the most probable states under the Gibbs distribution. The analogous operation under the posterior distribution yields the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the image given the degraded observations. The result is a highly parallel ``relaxation'' algorithm for MAP estimation. We establish convergence properties of the algorithm and we experiment with some simple pictures, for which good restorations are obtained at low signal-to-noise ratios."

They show that their coarse-to-fine method provides substantially better results of optical flow than conventional algorithms. The authors map this multiscale strategy onto their model of motion computation in primate area MT. The model consists of two stages: (1) local velocities are measured across multiple spatio-temporal channels, while (2) the optical flow field is computed by a network of direction-selective neurons at multiple spatial resolutions. Their model neurons show the same nonclassical receptive field properties as Allman's type I MT neurons and lead to a novel interpretation of some aspect of the motion capture illusion.<<ETX>>"

The flow field, which can be produced by a sensor moving through an environment with several independently moving, rigid objects, is allowed to be sparse, noisy, and partially incorrect. The approach is based on two main stages. In the first stage, the flow field is partitioned into connected segments of flow vectors, where each segment is consistent with a rigid motion of a roughly planar surface. In the second stage, segments are grouped under the hypothesis that they are induced by a single, rigidly moving object. Each hypothesis is tested by searching for three-dimensional (3-D) motion parameters which are compatible with all the segments in the corresponding group. Once the motion parameters are recovered, the relative environmental depth can be estimated as well. Experiments based on real and simulated data are presented."

Attention is given to modeling and analysis of heart wall motion, human face/head motion analysis and synthesis in model-based image compression, and the evolution of coherent structures in fluid motion. It is believed that techniques from computer vision, can be useful for solving these problems. In particular, the following computer vision techniques appear relevant: 3-D solid modeling, motion estimation, curvature analysis, shape from shading, relational structures, model-based systems, aspect graphs, and silhouette-slide theorems. The goal of the research is to develop concepts, methodologies, and techniques that will be widely applicable to many types of nonrigid motion.<<ETX>>"

But these techniques can play an even more important role in the analysis of multiple motion, where, for example, a transparent pattern moves in front of a differently moving background pattern. The pyramid framework then separates motion components based on their spatial and temporal frequency characteristics so that each can be estimated independently of the others. This property is key to recently proposed selective stabilization algorithms for the sequential analysis of multiple motion and for the detection of moving objects from a moving platform. The authors determine the conditions for component selection. Results can provide important guidance in practical applications of motion analysis.<<ETX>>"

A minimization problem which permits relatively robust parameter estimation and helps overcome poor zoom estimation when the field-of-view is small is formulated. It is assumed that the motion has a small rotary component, interframe differences are small, and the errors in the system are due to independently distributed errors in the components of the displacement vectors. A fast procedure for minimization is exposited, in which the parameter set is partitioned and conditional generalized least-squares formulas identified. Recursive application of these provides the search space for the minimization problem.

The approach is based on representing the constant acceleration translational motion and constant precession rotational motion in the form of a bilinear state-space model using standard rectilinear states for translation and quaternions for rotation. Closed-form solutions of the state transition equations are obtained to propagate the quaternions. The measurements are noisy perturbations of 3-D feature points represented in an inertial coordinate system. It is assumed that the 3-D feature points are extracted from the stereo images and matched over the frames. Owing to the nonlinearity in the state model, nonlinear filters are designed for the estimation of motion parameters. Simulation results are included. The Cramer-Rao performance bounds for motion parameter estimates are computed. A constructive proof for the uniqueness of motion parameters is given. It is shown that with uniform sampling in time, three noncollinear feature points in five consecutive binocular image pairs contain all the spatial and temporal information. Both nondegenerate and degenerate motions are analyzed. A deterministic algorithm to recover motion parameters from a stereo image sequence is summarized from the constructive proof. >"

For the first stage, three new methods are presented: the ``Bimodality Tests,'''' the ``Bi-distribution Test,'''' and the ``Dynamic Occlusion Method.'''' The second stage consists of applying the ``Structural Saliency Method,'''' by Sha''ashua and Ullman to extract complete and unique boundaries from the output of the first stage.

First, we show that seven point correspondences are sufficient to uniquely determine from two perspective views the three-dimensional motion parameters (within a scale factor for the translations) of a rigid object with curved surfaces. The seven points should not be traversed by two planes with one plane containing the origin, nor by a cone containing the origin. Second, a set of ``essential parameters'' are introduced which uniquely determine the motion parameters up to a scale factor for the translations, and can be estimated by solving a set of linear equations which are derived from the correspondences of eight image points. The actual motion parameters can subsequently be determined by computing the singular value decomposition (SVD) of a 3\u00d73 matrix containing the essential parameters."

An algorithm that can estimate the image flow velocity field when there are discontinuities due to occlusions is described. The constraint line clustering algorithm uses a statistical test to estimate the image flow velocity field in the presence of step discontinuities in the image irradiance or velocity field. Particular emphasis is placed on motion estimation and segmentation in situations such as random dot patterns where motion is the only cue to segmentation. Experimental results on a demanding synthetic test case and a real image are presented. A smoothing algorithm for improving the velocity field estimate is also described. The smoothing algorithm constructs a smooth estimate of the velocity field by approximating a surface between step discontinuities. It is noted that the velocity field estimate can be improved using surface reconstruction between velocity field boundaries. >"

Traditional approaches to this problem rely on an edge-based discontinuity model, and have problems with transparent phenomena. The authors introduce a layered model of scene segmentation based on explicitly representing the support of a homogeneous region. The model employs parallel robust estimation techniques, and uses a minimal-covering optimization to estimate the number of objects in the scene. Using a simple direct motion model of translating objects, they successfully segment real image sequences containing multiple motions.<<ETX>>"

Given a sufficient number of independent measurements, the solution is overconstrained and unique except for rotational symmetries. The proposed approach is based on the finite element method (FEM) and parametric solid modeling using implicit functions. This approach provides both the convenience of parametric modeling and the expressiveness of the physically based mesh formulation and, in addition, can provide great accuracy at physical simulation. A physically based object-recognition method that allows simple, closed-form comparisons of recovered 3-D solid models is presented. The performance of these methods is evaluated using both synthetic range data with various signal-to-noise ratios and using laser rangefinder data. >"

The method of Fourier analysis is applied to the lateral cranial projections. The patterns and extents of discrimination produced by the sine-cosine and amplitude phase-lag spectra are compared. The sine-cosine series is utilized to determine the interrelationships of extinct and extant hominoids. It is demonstrated that the patterns of discrimination are consistent with current taxonomic classifications of the extant species. It seems that Fourier analysis can, in certain circumstances, offer advantages over more traditional methods of shape measurement, especially because of its relative independence of the need to define \u2018homologous landmarks\u2019."

Regularization theory and a theoretical framework for approximation (based on regularization techniques) that leads to a class of three-layer networks called regularization networks are discussed. Regularization networks are mathematically related to the radial basis functions, mainly used for strict interpolation tasks. Learning as approximation and learning as hypersurface reconstruction are discussed. Two extensions of the regularization approach are presented, along with the approach's corrections to splines, regularization, Bayes formulation, and clustering. The theory of regularization networks is generalized to a formulation that includes task-dependent clustering and dimensionality reduction. Applications of regularization networks are discussed. >"

The models provide global deformation parameters which represent the salient shape features of natural parts, and local deformation parameters which capture shape details. The equations of motion governing the models, augmented by point-to-point constraints, make them responsive to externally applied forces. The authors extend this system of differential equations to formulate a shape and nonrigid motion estimator, a nonlinear Kalman filter, that recursively transforms the discrepancy between the data and the estimated model state into generalized forces while formally accounting for uncertainty in the observations. A Riccati update process maintains a covariance matrix that adjusts the forces in accordance with the system dynamics and the current and prior observations. The estimator applies the transformed forces to adjust the translational, rotational, and deformational degrees of freedom such that the model evolves as consistently as possible with the noisy data. The authors present model fitting and motion tracking experiments of articulated flexible objects from real and synthetic noise-corrupted 3D data.<<ETX>>"

This model is based on the finite element method, but decouples the degrees of freedom by breaking down object motion into rigid and nonrigid vibration or deformation modes. The result is an accurate representation for both rigid and nonrigid motion that has greatly reduced dimensionality, capturing the intuition that nonrigid motion is normally coherent and not chaotic. Because of the small number of parameters involved, this representation is used to obtain accurate overstrained estimates of both rigid and nonrigid global motion. It is also shown that these estimates can be integrated over time by use of an extended Kalman filter, resulting in stable and accurate estimates of both three-dimensional shape and three-dimensional velocity. The formulation is then extended to include constrained nonrigid motion. Examples of tracking single nonrigid objects and multiple constrained objects are presented. >"

                "text": "A locally connected artificial neural network based on physiological and anatomical findings in the visual system is presented for motion perception. A set of velocity selective binary neurons is used for each point in the image. Motion perception is carried out by neuron evaluation using a parallel updating scheme. Two algorithms, batch and recursive, based on this network are presented for computing the flow field from a sequence of monocular images. The batch algorithm integrates information from all images simultaneously by embedding them into the bias inputs of the network, while the recursive algorithm uses a recursive-least-squares method to update the bias inputs of the network. Detection rules are also used to find the occluding elements. Based on information on the detected occluding elements, the network automatically locates motion discontinuities. The algorithms need to compute the flow field at most twice. Hence, fewer computations are needed and the recursive algorithm is amenable to real-time applications"
