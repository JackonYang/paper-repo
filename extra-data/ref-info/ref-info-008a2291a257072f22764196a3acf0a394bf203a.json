This same method can be applied at a higher level of textual interpretation for locating chunks in the tagged text, including non-recursive \u201cbaseNP\u201d chunks. For this purpose, it is convenient to view chunking as a tagging problem by encoding the chunk structure in new tags attached to each word. In automatic tests using Treebank-derived data, this technique achieved recall and precision rates of roughly 93% for baseNP chunks (trained on 950K words) and 88% for somewhat more complex chunks that partition the sentence (trained on 200K words). Working in this new application and with larger template and training sets has also required some interesting adaptations to the transformation-based learning approach."

While previous empirical methods for base NP identification have been rather complex, this paper instead proposes a very simple algorithm that is tailored to the relative simplicity of the task. In particular, we present a corpus-based approach for finding base NPs by matching part-of-speech tag sequences. The training phase of the algorithm is based on two successful techniques: first the base NP grammar is read from a \"treebank\" corpus; then the grammar is improved by selecting rules with high \"benefit\" scores. Using this simple algorithm with a naive heuristic for matching rules, we achieve surprising accuracy in an evaluation on the Penn Treebank Wall Street Journal."

It appears, for instance, that the strongest stresses in the sentence fall one to a chunk, and pauses are most likely to fall between chunks. Chunks also represent a grammatical watershed of sorts. The typical chunk consists of a single content word surrounded by a constellation of function words, matching a fixed template. A simple context-free grammar is quite adequate to describe the structure of chunks. By contrast, the relationships between chunks are mediated more by lexical selection than by rigid templates. Co-occurrence of chunks is determined not just by their syntactic categories, but is sensitive to the precise words that head them; and the order in which chunks occur is much more flexible than the order of words within chunks."

The common practice for approaching this task is by tedious manual definition of possible pattern structures, often in the form of regular expressions or finite automata. This paper presents a novel memory-based learning method that recognizes shallow patterns in new text based on a bracketed training corpus. The training data are stored as-is, in efficient suffix-tree data structures. Generalization is performed on-line at recognition time by comparing subsequences of the new text to positive and negative evidence in the corpus. This way, no information in the training is lost, as can happen in other learning systems that construct a single generalized model at the time of training. The paper presents experimental results for recognizing noun phrase, subject-verb and verb-object patterns in English. Since the learning approach enables easy porting to new domains, we plan to apply it to syntactic patterns in other languages and to sub-language patterns for information extraction."

In practice, we have found that maximum entropy models offer the following advantages: \nState-of-the-art accuracy. The probability models for all of the tasks discussed perform at or near state-of-the-art accuracies, or outperform competing learning algorithms when trained and tested under similar conditions. Methods which outperform those presented here require much more supervision in the form of additional human involvement or additional supporting resources. \nKnowledge-poor features. The facts used to model the data, or features, are linguistically very simple, or \"knowledge-poor\", but yet succeed in approximating complex linguistic relationships. \nReusable software technology. The mathematics of the maximum entropy framework are essentially independent of any particular task, and a single software implementation can be used for all of the probability models in this thesis. \nThe experiments in this thesis suggest that experimenters can obtain state-of-the-art accuracies on a wide range of natural language tasks, with little task-specific effort, by using maximum entropy probability models."

Department of Computing Science, University of Manitoba Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, l~3T 2N2 E-mail: lindek@cs.umanitoba.ca. 1. Abstract. Overgeneration is the main source of computational complexity in previous principle-based parsers. This paper presents a message passing algorithm for principle-based parsing that avoids the overgenera-tion problem. Parsing with Principles and Classes of Information presents a parser based on current principle-based linguistic theories for English. It argues that differences in the kind of information being computed, whether lexical, structural or syntactic, play a crucial role in the mapping from grammatical theory to parsing algorithms. The direct encoding of homogeneous classes of information has computational and cognitive advantages, which are discussed in detail. This paper outlines the major computational advantages of principle-based parsing, its differences from the usual rule-based approach, and surveys several existing principle-based parsing systems used for handling languages as diverse as Warlpiri, English, and Spanish, as well as language translation.
