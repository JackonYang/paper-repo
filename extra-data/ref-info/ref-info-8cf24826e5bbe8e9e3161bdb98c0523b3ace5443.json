The rapid advance of aviation, and the consequently increased medical demands on the fitness of flying personnel have greatly contrib\u00ad uted to this. A number of papers on this subject have been published by medical men concerned with flying, and new conceptions of diseases have been created, e.g. aero-otitis media acuta. This complaint is directly ascribed to the functional failure of the tube. A study of not only this modern literature, but also older papers, shows that a number of interesting problems still remain unsolved not only as regards the healthy or diseased tube, but also as regards morbid changes in its surroundings. Little is for instance known of the variations, nature, or localization of the stenoses and strictures of the tubai canal, or of their relations to the aural diseases. The Eustachium is primarily a regulator of the air in the middle ear. This and the outside air must be in equilibrium; the ventilation of the tube in airmen is accordingly more important. In diving, for instance, the pressure must be very quickly equalized, so that any deficient functioning of the tube canal or attendant pains may not interfere with the work of the airman concerned. Anatomical investigations have shown that the Eustachium may vary considerably in width, and that projecting bony edges may occasionally produce a stricture of the canal to a fraction of a millimetre or cause a bend in it which, though allowing air to pass, will hardly admit a probe. Extreme tubai strictures are, however, considered fairly rare. They are supposed to occur almost exclusively in cases complicated by other"

Many investigators (1\u20147, 9\u201418) have pointed out this high incidence of middle ear pathology in cleft palate children with its concomitant conductive-type hearing loss. Tangen (18) empha\u2014 sized the frequent changes that occur in hearing and in middle ear findings on repeated examinations. Graham (2) carried this further with his longitudinal study, which showed that, at one time or another, about half of the cleft palate patients were found to have ear disease. Although the basic reason for the increased difficulty is unknown, it is presumed to be related to a poorly functioning Eustachian tube. In his classical article on the physiology of the Eustachian tube, Rich (14) demonstrated that the tensor veli palatini muscle opened the Eustachian tube as effectively when the soft palate was artificially cleft as when it was intact, because of the attachment of the muscle to the hamular proc\u2014 ess of the pterygoid. That contention has been disputed, however, par\u2014 ticularly by Holborow (5, 6'). No one has determined whether patients born with cleft palates have congenital malformation or malfunction of the tensor muscle itself, whether cleft palate surgery interferes with ten-sor function by virtue of its proximity to the hamular attachment if not by actual fracture of the hamulus, or whether change in tubal function is secondary to mucous membrane reaction around the tubal orifice from whatever cause. As a consequence of poor Eustachian tube function, the middle ear is not aerated each time the person swallows, yawns, or sneezes, as in normal function. Lacking this aeration, the oxygen in the middle ear is absorbed and a vacuum is created. One response to this vacuum is a marked retrac-tion of the tympanic membrane\u2014~especially pars fiaccida\u2014and subse\u2014 quently, the formation of a serous transudate which fills or partly fills the middle ear and which interferes with hearing. If the middle ear mucosa is hypertrophic, the vacuum may result in a middle ear filled with mucoid"

However, while this particular deficiency has received recognition, little is known about the nature of the hearing loss. Previous reports in the literature have presented ideas about the problem of hearing loss in the cleft-lip and cleft-palate persons. Gaines,1in her study of the problem, postulated that cleft-palate children were prone to middle-ear pathologies because of the exposure of the Eustachian tube to pathological insult or because of irregularities in the tubes. She concluded that there is a greater incidence of hearing loss in cleft-palate children and that the basis for the hearing loss was dysfunction of the Eustachian tube because of anatomical deviations of the related musculature. In the study by Gannon*the relationship of several surgical variables to hearing loss in a cleft-palate population was examined. The rationale for"

In 1818 Carus published his observations on amphibian embryos. He found structures suggestive of the gill structures in fish and concluded that the development of the eustachian tube was related to the respiratory tract. In 1825 Rathke published similar conclusions from his work with pig embryos. By the end of the 19th century the theory that the middle ear complex developed from the pharynx was universally accepted. The exact mechanism of development, however, is contested to this day. Hammar1of Upsala, using wax reconstruction, studied fetuses from three weeks to birth. He described three stages of development: (1) the anlage period; (2) the demarcation period; and (3) the transformation period.

The findings of aural pathology, hearing and nasal function were correlated to the postoperative speech evaluation. The incidence of aural pathology was 78 per cent. Despite the very high figure for aural pathology only 13 per cent of the patients had hearing losses of such a degree (30 dB or more) that it might influence the postoperative speech rehabilitation. Only 47.7 per cent of the patients had a good nasal function postoperatively. A correlation was found between the postoperative speech result regarding both hearing loss and nasal function, more marked for nasal function. Asymmetries in the nasal cavities were found to be responsible for postoperative asymmetries in the passages lateral to the velopharyngeal flap.

The incidence of both aural pathology and nasal obstruction was significantly higher in the cases of cleft lip and palate than in those of palatine deformity only.

                "text": "There is general agreement among authorities (5, 13, 19, 23) that there is a higher incidence of hearing loss in the cleft palate population than in the noncleft palate population; however, reports of the incidence of hear\u2014 ing loss of the cleft palate population vary widely. The reported incidence of hearing loss among cleft palate groups has ranged from 3% (25) to 90% (23). Table 1 presents the results of some of the investigations and indicates the number and age of subjects and the various criteria used for definition of hearing loss. There are several possible reasons for these differences among reports. As Hayes (11) has suggested, variations in hearing loss incidence data for cleft palate subjects may be due to such deficiencies and inconsist\u2014 encies in research methodology as: a) inadequate sampling methods; b) different definitions of hearing loss; c) poor testing conditions; and, d) intergroup differences among the cleft palate populations studied with respect to the type of cleft, type of management (surgical or prosthetic), and age of subjects. Several authorities (6, 25, 28) indicate that a relationship exists be\u2014 tween the incidence of hearing loss among cleft palate individuals and age. In general, a greater incidence of hearing loss has been found among cleft palate children than among cleft palate adults. Some studies have yielded data suggesting a possible relationship be\u2014 tween the type of cleft and the incidence of hearing losses associated with cleft palate. Masters and others (1 '7) and Spriestersbach and others (25) report that the highest incidence of hearing loss is found in groups with clefts of the hard and soft palates. Spriestersbach and others (25) stated, however, that the differences regarding the incidence of hearing loss and type of cleft defect observed in their study and in the study by Masters and associates were not significant when statistical tests were applied to the data. On the other hand, Drettner (3) found that individ\u2014 uals with cleft lip and palate have a higher incidence of hearing loss than do patients with clefts of the palate only. Since the available data appear to be contradictory, the relationship between the incidence of hearing loss and the type of cleft is not clear. There is a need for further investigation in this area.

Serous otitis media related to eustachian-tube dysfunction is present from birth in over 90% of infants with cleft palates and leads to middle ear changes responsible for permanent hearing loss in adulthood. Early and successful closure of the cleft palate is associated with decreased adult hearing loss and secondary surgery for hypernasal cleft palate is also associated with a decreased incidence. Hard-of-hearing patients have a tendency to remain more hypernasal than their normal-hearing peers and are less likely to respond to conventional speech therapy."
