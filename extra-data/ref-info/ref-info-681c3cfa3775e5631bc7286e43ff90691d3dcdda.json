The recent literature witnessed two popular graph cut algorithms: the Ncut using spectral graph analysis and the minimum-cut using the maximum flow algorithm. We present a third major approach by generalizing the Swendsen-Wang method - a well celebrated algorithm in statistical mechanics. Our algorithm simulates ergodic, reversible Markov chain jumps in the space of graph partitions to sample a posterior probability. At each step, the algorithm splits, merges, or regroups a sizable subgraph, and achieves fast mixing at low temperature enabling a fast annealing procedure. Experiments show it converges in 2-30 seconds on a PC for image segmentation. This is 400 times faster than the single-site update Gibbs sampler, and 20-40 times faster than the DDMCMC algorithm. The algorithm can optimize over the number of models and works for general forms of posterior probabilities, so it is more general than the existing graph cut approaches."

In this paper two approaches are proposed to generalize the Swendsen-Wang cut algorithm [A. Barbu and S.C. Zhu 2003] for sampling p. The first method is called multigrid SW-cut which runs SW-cut within a sequence of local \"attentional\" windows and thus simulates conditional probabilities of p in the partition space. The second method is called multi-level SW-cut which projects the adjacency graph into a hierarchical representation with each vertex in the high level graph corresponding to a sub-graph at the low level, and runs SW-cut at each level. Thus it simulates conditional probabilities of p at the higher level. Both methods are shown to observe the detailed balance equation and thus provide flexibilities in sampling the posterior probability p. We demonstrate the algorithms in image and motion segmentation with three levels (see Fig.1), and compare the speed improvement of the proposed methods."

Each of these techniques constructs a graph such that the minimum cut on the graph also minimizes the energy. Yet, because these graph constructions are complex and highly specific to a particular energy function, graph cuts have seen limited application to date. In this paper, we give a characterization of the energy functions that can be minimized by graph cuts. Our results are restricted to functions of binary variables. However, our work generalizes many previous constructions and is easily applicable to vision problems that involve large numbers of labels, such as stereo, motion, image restoration, and scene reconstruction. We give a precise characterization of what energy functions can be minimized using graph cuts, among the energy functions that can be written as a sum of terms containing three or fewer binary variables. We also provide a general-purpose construction to minimize such an energy function. Finally, we give a necessary condition for any energy function of binary variables to be minimized by graph cuts. Researchers who are considering the use of graph cuts to optimize a particular energy function can use our results to determine if this is possible and then follow our construction to create the appropriate graph. A software implementation is freely available."

The major restriction is that the energy function's smoothness term must only involve pairs of pixels. We propose two algorithms that use graph cuts to compute a local minimum even when very large moves are allowed. The first move we consider is an /spl alpha/-/spl beta/-swap: for a pair of labels /spl alpha/,/spl beta/, this move exchanges the labels between an arbitrary set of pixels labeled a and another arbitrary set labeled /spl beta/. Our first algorithm generates a labeling such that there is no swap move that decreases the energy. The second move we consider is an /spl alpha/-expansion: for a label a, this move assigns an arbitrary set of pixels the label /spl alpha/. Our second algorithm, which requires the smoothness term to be a metric, generates a labeling such that there is no expansion move that decreases the energy. Moreover, this solution is within a known factor of the global minimum. We experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on image restoration, stereo and motion."

The algorithm is applied to both Isotropic and Gaussian Hierarchical Markov Random Field (MRF) Models, which may be combined with low level line processes. The annealing algorithm utilizes a sampling framework that unified the processes of model selection, parameter estimation and image segmentation in a single Markov Chain. To achieve this, reversible jumps are incorporated to allow movement between different model spaces. A new method for generating jump proposals is given, which is more efficient than existing methodologies and is applicable to other, less specific model selection problems. It is based on the use of partial decoupling, rather than the more traditional Gibbs Sampler, to update the labels of the MRF. Partial decoupling is a derivative of the better known Swendsen-Wang algorithm in which an auxiliary variable bondmap is used to define regions of the image whose labels are then updated independently. We further propose a novel mechanisms by which deterministic methods, such as Gabor filtering, may be incorporated into this algorithm to sped up the convergence of the MCMC sampling process and hence, that of simulated annealing."

This result characterizes BP fixed-points and makes connections with variational approaches to approximate inference. \n \nMore importantly, our analysis lets us build on the progress made in statistical physics since Bethe's approximation was introduced in 1935. Kikuchi and others have shown how to construct more accurate free energy approximations, of which Bethe's approximation is the simplest. Exploiting the insights from our analysis, we derive generalized belief propagation (GBP) versions of these Kikuchi approximations. These new message passing algorithms can be significantly more accurate than ordinary BP, at an adjustable increase in complexity. We illustrate such a new GBP algorithm on a grid Markov network and show that it gives much more accurate marginal probabilities than those found using ordinary BP."

The belief propagation (BP) algorithm is an efficient way to solve these problems that is exact when the factor graph is a tree, but only approximate when the factor graph has cycles. We show that BP fixed points correspond to the stationary points of the Bethe approximation of the free energy for a factor graph. We explain how to obtain region-based free energy approximations that improve the Bethe approximation, and corresponding generalized belief propagation (GBP) algorithms. We emphasize the conditions a free energy approximation must satisfy in order to be a \"valid\" or \"maxent-normal\" approximation. We describe the relationship between four different methods that can be used to generate valid approximations: the \"Bethe method\", the \"junction graph method\", the \"cluster variation method\", and the \"region graph method\". Finally, we explain how to tell whether a region-based approximation, and its corresponding GBP algorithm, is likely to be accurate, and describe empirical results showing that GBP can significantly outperform BP."

The clustering problem is viewed as a graph partitioning problem, where nodes represent data elements and the weights of the edges represent pairwise similarities. We generate samples of cuts in this graph, by using Karger's contraction algorithm (1996), and compute an \"average\" cut which provides the basis for our solution to the clustering problem. The stochastic nature of our method makes it robust against noise, including accidental edges and small spurious clusters. The complexity of our algorithm is very low: O(|E| log/sup 2/ N) for N objects, |E| similarity relations, and a fixed accuracy level. In addition, and without additional computational cost, our algorithm provides a hierarchy of nested partitions. We demonstrate the superiority of our method for image segmentation on a few synthetic and real images, both B&W and color. Our other examples include the concatenation of edges in a cluttered scene (perceptual grouping) and the organization of an image database for the purpose of multiview 3D object recognition."

The data to be clustered are represented by an undirected adjacency graph G with arc capacities assigned to reflect the similarity between the linked vertices. Clustering is achieved by removing arcs of G to form mutually exclusive subgraphs such that the largest inter-subgraph maximum flow is minimized. For graphs of moderate size ( approximately 2000 vertices), the optimal solution is obtained through partitioning a flow and cut equivalent tree of G, which can be efficiently constructed using the Gomory-Hu algorithm (1961). However for larger graphs this approach is impractical. New theorems for subgraph condensation are derived and are then used to develop a fast algorithm which hierarchically constructs and partitions a partially equivalent tree of much reduced size. This algorithm results in an optimal solution equivalent to that obtained by partitioning the complete equivalent tree and is able to handle very large graphs with several hundred thousand vertices. The new clustering algorithm is applied to the image segmentation problem. The segmentation is achieved by effectively searching for closed contours of edge elements (equivalent to minimum cuts in G), which consist mostly of strong edges, while rejecting contours containing isolated strong edges. This method is able to accurately locate region boundaries and at the same time guarantees the formation of closed edge contours. >"

The paper contributes to image segmentation in three aspects. Firstly, it designs effective and well balanced Markov Chain dynamics to explore the solution space and makes the split and merge process reversible at a middle level vision formulation. Thus it achieves globally optimal solution independent of initial segmentations. Secondly, instead of computing a single maximum a posteriori solution, it proposes a mathematical principle for computing multiple distinct solutions to incorporates intrinsic ambiguities in image segmentation. A k-adventurers algorithm is proposed for extracting distinct multiple solutions from the Markov chain sequence. Thirdly, it utilizes data-driven (bottom-up) techniques, such as clustering and edge detection, to compute importance proposal probabilities, which effectively drive the Markov chain dynamics and achieve tremendous speedup in comparison to traditional jump-diffusion method. Thus DDM-CMC paradigm provides a unifying framework where the role of existing segmentation algorithms, such as; edge detection, clustering, region growing, split-merge, SNAKEs, region competition, are revealed as either realizing Markov chain dynamics or computing importance proposal probabilities. We report some results on color and grey level image segmentation in this paper and refer to a detailed report and a web site for extensive discussion."

Pixel gray levels and the presence and orientation of edges are viewed as states of atoms or molecules in a lattice-like physical system. The assignment of an energy function in the physical system determines its Gibbs distribution. Because of the Gibbs distribution, Markov random field (MRF) equivalence, this assignment also determines an MRF image model. The energy function is a more convenient and natural mechanism for embodying picture attributes than are the local characteristics of the MRF. For a range of degradation mechanisms, including blurring, nonlinear deformations, and multiplicative or additive noise, the posterior distribution is an MRF with a structure akin to the image model. By the analogy, the posterior distribution defines another (imaginary) physical system. Gradual temperature reduction in the physical system isolates low energy states (``annealing''), or what is the same thing, the most probable states under the Gibbs distribution. The analogous operation under the posterior distribution yields the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the image given the degraded observations. The result is a highly parallel ``relaxation'' algorithm for MAP estimation. We establish convergence properties of the algorithm and we experiment with some simple pictures, for which good restorations are obtained at low signal-to-noise ratios."

An important component of an MRF-based approach is the inference algorithm used to find the most likely setting of each node in the MRF. Algorithms have been proposed which use graph cuts or belief propagation for inference. These stereo algorithms differ in both the inference algorithm used and the formulation of the MRF. It is unknown whether to attribute the responsibility for differences in performance to the MRF or the inference algorithm. We address this through controlled experiments by comparing the belief propagation algorithm and the graph cuts algorithm on the same MRF's, which have been created for calculating stereo disparities. We find that the labellings produced by the two algorithms are comparable. The solutions produced by graph cuts have a lower energy than those produced with belief propagation, but this does not necessarily lead to increased performance relative to the ground truth."

While many patterns are represented well by statistical models in two dimensional regions as most image segmentation work assume, some other patterns are fundamentally one dimensional and thus cause major problems in segmentation. We call the former region processes and the latter curve processes. In this paper, we propose a stochastic algorithm for parsing an image into a number of region and curve processes. The paper makes the following contributions to the literature. Firstly, it presents a generative rope model for the curve processes in the form of Hidden Markov Model (HMM). The hidden layer is a Markov chain with each element being an image vase selected from an over-complete basis, such as Difference of Gaussians (DOG) or Difference of Offset Gaussians (DOOG) at various scales and orientations. The rope model accounts for the geometric smoothness and photometric coherence of the curve processes. Secondly, it integrates both 2D region models, such as textures, splines etc with 1D curve models uner the Bayes framework. Because both region and curve models are generative, they compete to explain input images in a layered representation. Thirdl, it achieves global optimization by effective Markov chain Monte Carlo methods in the sense of maximizing a posterior probability. The Markov chain consists of reversivle jumps and diffusions driven by bottom up information. The algorithm is applied to real images with satisfactory results. We verify the results through random synthesis and compare them against segmentations with region processes only."

                "text": "For many applications it is useful to sample from a finite set of objects in accordance with some particular distribution. One approach is to run an ergodic (i.e., irreducible aperiodic) Markov chain whose stationary distribution is the desired distribution on this set; after the Markov chain has run for M steps, with M sufficiently large, the distribution governing the state of the chain approximates the desired distribution. Unfortunately, it can be difficult to determine how large M needs to be. We describe a simple variant of this method that determines on its own when to stop and that outputs samples in exact accordance with the desired distribution. The method uses couplings which have also played a role in other sampling schemes; however, rather than running the coupled chains from the present into the future, one runs from a distant point in the past up until the present, where the distance into the past that one needs to go is determined during the running of the algorithm itself. If the state space has a partial order that is preserved under the moves of the Markov chain, then the coupling is often particularly efficient. Using our approach, one can sample from the Gibbs distributions associated with various statistical mechanics models (including Ising, random-cluster, ice, and dimer) or choose uniformly at random from the elements of a finite distributive lattice. \u00a9 1996 John Wiley & Sons, Inc."

Their interest was in assessing the performance of algorithms used to find the MAP state, such as simulated annealing. A secondary conclusion was that the MAP state, at least in the restricted setting of two-color images, does not provide a robust reconstruction of the true image. That result has been interpreted by some as indicating that the Ising MRF used by GPS is not a good prior model for such images. We show that such a judgement is premature as the MAP state does not well summarize the information in the posterior distribution in this case. In particular, the deviation of the MAP state from the mean, particularly at larger smoothing parameters, shows that the MAP state is not representative of the bulk of feasible reconstructions. We calculate other summary statistics that interpret and display the information in the posterior by implementing full Bayesian infe..."

Rather than focusing on local features and their consistencies in the image data, our approach aims at extracting the global impression of an image. We treat image segmentation as a graph partitioning problem and propose a novel global criterion, the normalized cut, for segmenting the graph. The normalized cut criterion measures both the total dissimilarity between the different groups as well as the total similarity within the groups. We show that an efficient computational technique based on a generalized eigenvalue problem can be used to optimize this criterion. We have applied this approach to segmenting static images and found results very encouraging."

The use of bounding chains solves this difficulty for some chains by giving theoretical and experimental upper bounds on the mixing time. Moreover, when used with methodologies such as coupling from the past, bounding chains allow the user to take samples drawn exactly from the stationary distribution without knowledge of the mixing time. Here we present a bounding chain for the Swendsen\u2010Wang process. The Swendsen\u2010Wang bounding chain allow us to efficiently obtain exact samples from the ferromagnetic Q\u2010state Potts model for certain classes of graphs.

The algorithm is guaranteed to converge to a local minimum and combines aspects of snakes/balloons and region growing. The classic snakes/balloons and region growing algorithms can be directly derived from our approach. We provide theoretical analysis of region competition including accuracy of boundary location, criteria for initial conditions, and the relationship to edge detection using filters. It is straightforward to generalize the algorithm to multiband segmentation and we demonstrate it on gray level images, color images and texture images. The novel color model allows us to eliminate intensity gradients and shadows, thereby obtaining segmentation based on the albedos of objects. It also helps detect highlight regions."

(1953) is presented along with an exposition of the relevant theory, techniques of application and methods and difficulties of assessing the error in Monte Carlo estimates. Examples of the methods, including the generation of random orthogonal matrices and potential applications of the methods to numerical problems arising in statistics, are discussed. For numerical problems in a large number of dimensions, Monte Carlo methods are often more efficient than conventional numerical methods. However, implementation of the Monte Carlo methods requires sampling from high dimensional probability distributions and this may be very difficult and expensive in analysis and computer time. General methods for sampling from, or estimating expectations with respect to, such distributions are as follows. (i) If possible, factorize the distribution into the product of one-dimensional conditional distributions from which samples may be obtained. (ii) Use importance sampling, which may also be used for variance reduction. That is, in order to evaluate the integral J = X) p(x)dx = Ev(f), where p(x) is a probability density function, instead of obtaining independent samples XI, ..., Xv from p(x) and using the estimate J, = Zf(xi)/N, we instead obtain the sample from a distribution with density q(x) and use the estimate J2 = Y{f(xj)p(x1)}/{q(xj)N}. This may be advantageous if it is easier to sample from q(x) thanp(x), but it is a difficult method to use in a large number of dimensions, since the values of the weights w(xi) = p(x1)/q(xj) for reasonable values of N may all be extremely small, or a few may be extremely large. In estimating the probability of an event A, however, these difficulties may not be as serious since the only values of w(x) which are important are those for which x -A. Since the methods proposed by Trotter & Tukey (1956) for the estimation of conditional expectations require the use of importance sampling, the same difficulties may be encountered in their use. (iii) Use a simulation technique; that is, if it is difficult to sample directly from p(x) or if p(x) is unknown, sample from some distribution q(y) and obtain the sample x values as some function of the corresponding y values. If we want samples from the conditional dis"

Computer simulations of this process are widely used to estimate the expectations of various observables (random variables) of a Potts system in the equilibrium (or Gibbs) distribution. The legitimacy of such simulations depends on the rate of convergence of the process to equilibrium, as measured by the \u201cmixing time.\u201d Empirical observations suggest that the mixing time of the Swendsen\u2013Wang process is short in many instances of practical interest, although proofs of this desirable behavior are known only for some very special cases. Nevertheless, we show that there are occasions when the mixing time of the Swendsen\u2013Wang process is exponential in the size of the system. This undesirable behavior is related to the phenomenon of first-order phase transitions in Potts systems with q > 2 states."

Pairwise data clustering is a combinatorial optimization method for data grouping which extracts hidden structure from proximity data. We describe a deterministic annealing approach to pairwise clustering which shares the robustness properties of maximum entropy inference. The resulting Gibbs probability distributions are estimated by mean-field approximation. A new structure-preserving algorithm to cluster dissimilarity data and to simultaneously embed these data in a Euclidian vector space is discussed which can be used for dimensionality reduction and data visualization. The suggested embedding algorithm which outperforms conventional approaches has been implemented to analyze dissimilarity data from protein analysis and from linguistics.

While a large number of algorithms for stereo correspondence have been developed, relatively little work has been done on characterizing their performance. In this paper, we present a taxonomy of dense, two-frame stereo methods. Our taxonomy is designed to assess the different components and design decisions made in individual stereo algorithms. Using this taxonomy, we compare existing stereo methods and present experiments evaluating the performance of many different variants. In order to establish a common software platform and a collection of data sets for easy evaluation, we have designed a stand-alone, flexible C++ implementation that enables the evaluation of individual components and that can easily be extended to include new algorithms. We have also produced several new multi-frame stereo data sets with ground truth and are making both the code and data sets available on the Web. Finally, we include a comparative evaluation of a large set of today's best-performing stereo algorithms."

                "text": "Recent imaging studies indicated the existence of two visual pathways in humans: a ventral stream for object and form vision and a dorsal stream for spatial and motion vision. The present study was motivated by a stimulating question: Supposing shape and motion are processed separately in the two pathways, how do the respective cortical areas respond to the stimuli of \u201cforms defined by motion\u201d? fMRI and ERP recordings were combined in order to measure the spatiotemporal activation pattern in the two pathways responding to forms defined by motion, which were produced solely by coherent movement of random dots against a background of dynamic or static random dots. The fMRI data indicated that the stimuli of forms defined by motion indeed activated both dorsal MT/V5 and ventral GTi/GF. Furthermore, the RV curves resulting from fMRI\u2010seeded dipole modeling indicated that each pair of dipoles located at MT/V5 or GTi/GF reached the same best\u2010fit point; a single pair of free dipoles located near the fMRI foci of MT/V5 and GTi/GF could be identified at the corresponding best\u2010fit point; and the source waveforms resulting from fixed dipole modeling also showed simultaneous activation of MT/V5 and GTi/GF dipoles in the time interval around the best\u2010fit point. The present results, therefore, suggest that MT/V5 and GTi/GF appear to be activated in parallel and simultaneously responding to forms defined by motion. Such findings raise interesting issues about the hierarchical organization and the functional specialization in the two pathways. Hum.

The important property of this inversion transformation is that its fixed point gives the transition point of the lattice."
