This paper describes the document spectrum (or docstrum), which is a method for structural page layout analysis based on bottom-up, nearest-neighbor clustering of page components. The method yields an accurate measure of skew, within-line, and between-line spacings and locates text lines and text blocks. It is advantageous over many other methods in three main ways: independence from skew angle, independence from different text spacings, and the ability to process local regions of different text orientations within the same image. Results of the method shown for several different page formats and for randomly oriented subpages on the same image illustrate the versatility of the method. We also discuss the differences, advantages, and disadvantages of the docstrum with respect to other lay-out methods. >"

Several critical functions have been investigated and the technical approaches are discussed. The first is the segmentation and classification of digitized printed documents into regions of text and images. A nonlinear, run-length smoothing algorithm has been used for this purpose. By using the regular features of text lines, a linear adaptive classification scheme discriminates text regions from others. The second technique studied is an adaptive approach to the recognition of the hundreds of font styles and sizes that can occur on printed documents. A preclassifier is constructed during the input process and used to speed up a well-known pattern-matching method for clustering characters from an arbitrary print source into a small sample of prototypes. Experimental results are included."

This is achieved by exploiting a small number of nearly universal typesetting and layout conventions. The system does not require prior knowledge of page orientation (module 90/spl deg/), and copes well with nonzero skew and shear angles (within 10/spl deg/). Also it locates blocks of text without reliance on detailed a priori layout models, and in spite of unknown or mixed horizontal and vertical text-line orientations. Within blocks, it infers text-line orientation and isolates lines, without knowledge of the language, symbol set, text sizes, or the number of text lines. Segmentation into words and symbols, and determination of reading order, normally require some knowledge of the language: this is held to minimum by relying on shape-driven algorithms. The underlying algorithms are based on Fourier theory, digital signal processing, computational geometry, and statistical decision theory. Most of the computation occurs within algorithms that possess unambiguous semantics (that is, heuristics are kept to a minimum). The effectiveness of the method on English, Japanese, Hebrew, Thai, and Korean documents is discussed.<<ETX>>"

To remove this bottleneck, new document processing techniques must be introduced to automatically acquire knowledge from various types of documents. By presenting a survey on the techniques and problems involved, this paper aims at serving as a catalyst to stimulate research in automatic knowledge acquisition through document processing. In this study, a document is considered to have two structures: geometric structure and logical structure. These play a key role in the process of the knowledge acquisition, which can be viewed as a process of acquiring the above structures. Extracting the geometric structure from a document refers to document analysis; mapping the geometric structure into logical structure is regarded as document understanding. Both areas are described in this paper, and the basic concept of document structure and its measurement based on entropy analysis is introduced. Logical structure and geometric models are proposed. Both top-down and bottom-up approaches and their entropy analyses are presented. Different techniques are discussed with practical examples. Mapping methods, such as tree transformation, document formatting knowledge and document format description language, are described. >"
