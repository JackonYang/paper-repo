The answer to this old chestnut is certainly \"yes\": Computers have been made to play chess and checkers, to prove theorems, to solve intricate problems of strategy. Yet the intelligence implied by such activities has an elusive, unnatural quality. It is not based on any orderly development of cognitive skills. In particular, the machines are not well equipped to select from their environment the things, or the relations, they are going to think about. In this they are sharply distinguished from intelligent living organisms. Every child learns to analyze speech into meaningful patterns long before he can prove any propositions. Computers can find proofs, but they cannot understand the simplest spoken instructions. Even the earliest computers could do arithmetic superbly, but only very recently have they begun to read the written digits that a child recognizes before he learns to add them. Understanding speech and reading print are examples of a basic intellectual skill that can variously be called cognition, abstraction or perception; perhaps the best general termfor it is patternrecognition. Except for their inability to recognize patterns, machines (or, more accurately, the programs that tell machines what to do) have now met most of the classic criteria of intelligence that skeptics have proposed. They can outperform their designers: The checker-playing program devised by Arthur L. Samuel of International Business Machines Corporation (1959a) usually beats him. They are original: The \"Logic Theorist,\" a creation of a group from the Carnegie Institute of Technology and the RAND Corporation [Newell, Simon, and Shaw (1956a, 19576)] has found proofs for many of the theorems in Principia Mathematica, the"

                "text": "Certain preliminary results on doing mathematics by machines (\u201cmechanical mathematics\u201d) were reported in an earlier paper [20]. The writer suggested developing inferential analysis as a branch of applied logic and as a sister discipline of numerical analysis. This analogy rests on the basic distinction of pure existence proofs, elegant procedures which in theory always terminate, and efficient procedures which are more complex to describe but can more feasibly be carried out in practice. In contrast with pure logic, the chief emphasis of inferential analysis is on the efficiency of algorithms, which is usually attained by paying a great deal more attention to the detailed structures of the problems and their solutions, to take advantage of possible systematic short cuts. The possibilities of much more elaborate calculations by machines provide an incentive to studying a group of rather minute questions which were formerly regarded as of small theoretical interest. When the range of actual human computation was narrow, there seemed little point in obtaining faster procedures which were still far beyond what was feasible. Furthermore, on account of the versatility of machines, it now appears that as more progress is made, strategies in the search for proofs, or what are often called heuristic methods, will also gradually become part of the subject matter of inferential analysis. An analogous situation in numerical analysis would be, for example, to make the machine choose to apply different tricks such as taking the Fourier transform to obtain a solution of some differential equation."

The second problem, \"pattern recognition,\" consists of identifying a given figure which is known to belong to one of a finite set of classes. This is the problem encountered when reading alphanumeric characters. Both recognition and detection have been successfully carried out on an IBM 704 computer which was programmed to simulate a spatial computer (a stored-program machine comprised of a master control unit directing a network of logical modules). One of the programs tested consisted of a recognition process for reading hand-lettered sans-serif alphanumeric characters. This process permits large variations in the size, shape, and proportions of the input figures and can tolerate random noise when it is well scattered in small specks. Programs for detecting L-shaped (or A-shaped) figures in the presence of other randomly drawn patterns have also been successfully tested."

We call a problem well-defined if there is a test which can be applied to a proposed solution. In case the proposed solution is a solution, the test must confirm this in a finite number of steps. If the proposed solution is not correct, we may either require that the test indicate this in a finite number of steps or else allow it to go on indefinitely. Since any test may be regarded as being performed by a Turing machine, this means that welldefined intellectual problems may be regarded as those of inverting functions and partial functions defined by Turing machines. Let fm(n) be the partial function computed by the m th Turing machine. It is not defined for a given value of n if the computation does not come to an end. This paper deals with the problem of designing a Turing machine which, when confronted by the number pair (m, r), computes as efficiently as possible a function g(m, r) such that fm(g(m, r)) = r. Again, for particular values of m and r no g(m, r) need exist. In fact, it has been shown that the existence of g(m, r) is an undecidable question in that there does not exist a Turing machine which will eventually come to a stop and print a 1 if g(m, r) does not exist. In spite of this, it is easy to show that a Turing machine exists which will"

                "text": "The hope that mathematical methods employed in the investigation of formal logic would lead to purely computational methods for obtaining mathematical theorems goes back to Leibniz and has been revived by Peano around the turn of the century and by Hilbert's school in the 1920's. Hilbert, noting that all of classical mathematics could be formalized within quantification theory, declared that the problem of finding an algorithm for determining whether or not a given formula of quantification theory is valid was the central problem of mathematical logic. And indeed, at one time it seemed as if investigations of this \u201cdecision\u201d problem were on the verge of success. However, it was shown by Church and by Turing that such an algorithm can not exist. This result led to considerable pessimism regarding the possibility of using modern digital computers in deciding significant mathematical questions. However, recently there has been a revival of interest in the whole question. Specifically, it has been realized that while no decision procedure exists for quantification theory there are many proof procedures available\u2014that is, uniform procedures which will ultimately locate a proof for any formula of quantification theory which is valid but which will usually involve seeking \u201cforever\u201d in the case of a formula which is not valid\u2014and that some of these proof procedures could well turn out to be feasible for use with modern computing machinery.\n Hao Wang [9] and P. C. Gilmore [3] have each produced working programs which employ proof procedures in quantification theory. Gilmore's program employs a form of a basic theorem of mathematical logic due to Herbrand, and Wang's makes use of a formulation of quantification theory related to those studied by Gentzen. However, both programs encounter decisive difficulties with any but the simplest formulas of quantification theory, in connection with methods of doing propositional calculus. Wang's program, because of its use of Gentzen-like methods, involves exponentiation on the total number of truth-functional connectives, whereas Gilmore's program, using normal forms, involves exponentiation on the number of clauses present. Both methods are superior in many cases to truth table methods which involve exponentiation on the total number of variables present, and represent important initial contributions, but both run into difficulty with some fairly simple examples.\nIn the present paper, a uniform proof procedure for quantification theory is given which is feasible for use with some rather complicated formulas and which does not ordinarily lead to exponentiation. The superiority of the present procedure over those previously available is indicated in part by the fact that a formula on which Gilmore's routine for the IBM 704 causes the machine to computer for 21 minutes without obtaining a result was worked successfully by hand computation using the present method in 30 minutes. Cf. \u00a76, below.\nIt should be mentioned that, before it can be hoped to employ proof procedures for quantification theory in obtaining proofs of theorems belonging to \u201cgenuine\u201d mathematics, finite axiomatizations, which are \u201cshort,\u201d must be obtained for various branches of mathematics. This last question will not be pursued further here; cf., however, Davis and Putnam [2], where one solution to this problem is given for ele"

The method may be applied to any form of spatial pattern, but in the present instance, patterns consisting of line figures are considered. The pattern is presented to a flying-spot scanner connected to a digital computer. The shape of the pattern is analysed and a statement is prepared describing the basic features of the pattern. The pattern is then recognized by comparing this statement with a number of others already stored in the computer which relate to named patterns. Patterns are recognized independently of the angle at which they are presented to the scanner, and may be of any size provided that limits imposed by the resolution of the scanner are not exceeded. The average time to recognize a character is 60 seconds with the system programmed on a medium-speed computer. Special-purpose equipment built to perform certain of the stages of the process, together with the use of higher-speed computers now envisaged, will reduce this time by at least a thousandfold. If a new pattern is presented to the machine it will indicate its inability to recognize the pattern, but by giving the machine the name of the pattern, it may become one of the standard patterns which it can subsequently recognize. All the patterns recognized by the machine are hand-drawn and consist of such symbols as the capital letters of the alphabet and numerals, although the system is in no way limited to any special set of characters. Using exactly the same method but with an increase in the degree of complexity, it will be possible for machines to read handwriting. Special allowances are made for imperfections in the patterns, including breaks and general ill-definition. Where there is some confusion and an unknown pattern resembles two or more of the standard patterns, the relative degrees of similarity of the unknown to each of these standard patterns is printed out by the machine."

A number of other problems of the same type are discussed. It is suggested that the time is ripe for a new branch of applied logic which may be called \"inferential\" analysis, which treats proofs as numerical analysis does calculations. This discipline seems capable, in the not too remote future, of leading to machine proofs of difficult new theorems. An easier preparatory task is to use machines to formalize proofs of known theorems. This line of work may also lead to mechanical checks of new mathematical results comparable to the debugging of a program."

Changes in the probability of occurrence of a response in a small time h are described with the aid of mathematical operators. The parameters which appear in the operator equations are related to experimental variables such as the amount of reward and work. Relations between the probability and empirical measures of rate of responding and latent time are defined. Acquisition and extinction of behavior habits are discussed for the simple runway and for the Skinner box. Equations of mean latent time as a function of trial number are derived for the runway problem; equations for the mean rate of responding and cumulative numbers of responses versus time are derived for the Skinner box experiments. An attempt is made to analyze the learning process with various schedules of partial reinforcement in the Skinner type experiment. Wherever possible, the correspondence between the present model and the work of Estes [2] is pointed out."

This processing is done manually in many applications. Thus, such inputs as punched cards, magnetic tape, and punched paper tape often are the result of a manual processing operation in which a human being is required to inspect visually an array of printed characters and to describe these data in a form capable of being processed by machine. In recognition of the importance of automating such operations, many investigations have been undertaken to devise automatic character sensing equipment. Suppose, however, that we attempt to view such efforts in proper perspective. We find a more fundamental problem that has, heretofore, failed to receive the attention that it warrants. The problem is one of making directly available to a computer pictorial information which would ordinarily be visually processed by human beings before being fed to a data processing system. This pictorial information may range from such highly stylized forms as printed characters, diagrams, schematic drawings, emblems, and designs through less stylized forms in cartoons and handwritten characters to such highly amorphous forms as photographs of real objects, e.g., people, aerial views, and microscopic and telescopic images."

Anyone who has had the good fortune to listen to Wiener and von Neumann and Rosenblucth and Pitts wrestling with the problems of modern computing machines that know and want, has a strange sense that he is listening to a colloquy of the ancients. But they would be the first to tell you that they themselves are drunk with an American wine of an older vintage ; they quote liberally from Charles Peirce and from Josiah Willard Gibbs. These men have altered our metaphysics by altering our physics. It is epistemology that is most affected, for it is the physics of communication which is today receiving an adequate theoretical treatment. For the first time in the history of science we know how we know and hence are able to state it clearly. Physiologists, working on the central nervous system, have long had such a goal in mind, Rudolph Magnus, inspired by Immanuel Kant, made his last great lecture one on ' the physiology of the a priori' by which he meant how those mechanisms work that determine for us the three-dimensional nature of our world, its axes and its angles, and that give to us our sense of velocity and acceleration, from which he held our notion of time to be in large measure derived. Perhaps the most notable attempt of this sort was by Sir Charles Sherrington, entitled Man on his Nature, for, near the end of a life spent on studying the ways of the brain, he was forced to the conclusion that ' in this world, Mind goes more ghostly than a ghost'. The reason for his failure was simply that his physics was not adequate to the problem that he had undertaken. That has so regularly been the shortcoming of scientists who would have approached this problem, that even Clerk Maxwell, who wanted nodiing more than to know the relation between thoughts and the molecular morions of the brain, cut short his query with the memorable phrase, ' but does not the way to"

Dr. Craik makes his philosophical point of view crystal clear. He believes in the methods of the observational scientists as the only methods of explanation. He is intolerant only of those who will not experiment and who consider that the virtue of thought is analytic precision rather than fruitfulness in the experimental field. He confesses that he has no gift for analytic precision and is particularly addicted to confusing similar concepts. He is, quite clearly, not deeply versed in traditional philosophy. This gives his book a certain freshness of outlook, although it makes his criticisms of the great philosophers, particularly Kant, appear rather na\u00efve.The Nature of ExplanationBy Dr. K. J. W.

New findings concerning the brain and behavior have forced upon us the unpleasant necessity of reexamining our models.

Ashby is a representative of this new order of sophistication in research, as he proceeds to investigate the problem of the brain's orderliness. He accepts, as fact, that the nervous system behaves adaptively and assumes that it is, in its essentials, mechanistic. These two data are approached as not irreconcilable. From this point, he proceeds to examine dynamic systems from the standpoint of rigorous scientific \u2014dominantly mathematical\u2014logic until he has evolved a theoretical counterpart of brain functioning.

Godel received public recognition of his work in 1951 when he was awarded the first Albert Einstein Award for achievement in the natural sciences perhaps the highest award of its kind in the United States. The award committee described his work in mathematical logic as \"one of the greatest contributions to the sciences in recent times.\" However, few mathematicians of the time were equipped to understand the young scholar's complex proof. Ernest Nagel and James Newman provide a readable and accessible explanation to both scholars and non-specialists of the main ideas and broad implications of Godel's discovery. It offers every educated person with a taste for logic and philosophy the chance to understand a previously difficult and inaccessible subject. New York University Press is proud to publish this special edition of one of its bestselling books. With a new introduction by Douglas R. Hofstadter, this book will appeal students, scholars, and professionals in the fields of mathematics, computer science, logic and philosophy, and science.\""

Our method is to find what sort of stimulus causes the largest activity in one nerve fiber and then what is the exciting aspect of that stimulus such that variations in everything else cause little change in the response. It has been known for the past 20 years that each fiber is connected not to a few rods and cones in the retina but to very many over a fair area. Our results show that for the most part within that area, it is not the light intensity itself but rather the pattern of local variation of intensity that is the exciting factor. There are four types of fibers, each type concerned with a different sort of pattern. Each type is uniformly distributed over the whole retina of the frog. Thus, there are four distinct parallel distributed channels whereby the frog's eye informs his brain about the visual image in terms of local pattern independent of average illumination. We describe the patterns and show the functional and anatomical separation of the channels. This work has been done on the frog, and our interpretation applies only to the frog."

In their insightful new introduction, the authors relate the book to the cognitive revolution and its handmaiden, artificial intelligence."

Both are independent of small perturbations at synapses of excitation, threshold, and synchrony, and are referred to partiular appropriate regions of the nervous system, thus suggesting experimental verification. The first mechanism averages an apparition over a group, and in the treatment of this mechanism it is suggested that scansion plays a significant part. The second mechanism reduces an apparition to a standard selected from among its many legitimate presentations. The former mechanism is exemplified by the recognition of chords regardless of pitch and shapes regardless of size. The latter is exemplified here only in the reflexive mechanism translating apparitions to the fovea. Both are extensions to contemporaneous functions of the knowing of universals heretofore treated by the authors only with respect to sequence in time."
