We present an open-source, rule-based system, MutationFinder, for extracting point mutation mentions from text. On blind test data, it achieves nearly perfect precision and a markedly improved recall over a baseline.\n\n\nAVAILABILITY\nMutationFinder, along with a high-quality gold standard data set, and a scoring script for mutation extraction systems have been made publicly available. Implementations, source code and unit tests are available in Python, Perl and Java. MutationFinder can be used as a stand-alone script, or imported by other applications.\n\n\nPROJECT URL\nhttp://bionlp.sourceforge.net."

While many manually curated databases attempt to index point mutations, most experimentally generated point mutations and the biological impacts of the changes are described in the peer-reviewed published literature. We describe an application, Mutation GraB (Graph Bigram), that identifies, extracts, and verifies point mutations from biomedical literature. The principal problem of point mutation extraction is to link the point mutation with its associated protein and organism of origin. Our algorithm uses a graph-based bigram traversal to identify these relevant associations and exploits the Swiss-Prot protein database to verify this information. The graph bigram method is different from other models for point mutation extraction in that it incorporates frequency and positional data of all terms in an article to drive the point mutation\u2013protein association. Our method was tested on 589 articles describing point mutations from the G protein\u2013coupled receptor (GPCR), tyrosine kinase, and ion channel protein families. We evaluated our graph bigram metric against a word-proximity metric for term association on datasets of full-text literature in these three different protein families. Our testing shows that the graph bigram metric achieves a higher F-measure for the GPCRs (0.79 versus 0.76), protein tyrosine kinases (0.72 versus 0.69), and ion channel transporters (0.76 versus 0.74). Importantly, in situations where more than one protein can be assigned to a point mutation and disambiguation is required, the graph bigram metric achieves a precision of 0.84 compared with the word distance metric precision of 0.73. We believe the graph bigram search metric to be a significant improvement over previous search metrics for point mutation extraction and to be applicable to text-mining application requiring the association of words."

Reviews, the traditional medium for collating published observations, are also unable to keep pace. For some specific classes of information (e.g. sequences and protein structures), obligatory data deposition policies have helped. However, a great deal of other valuable information is spread throughout the literature hindering coherent access. We are involved in the Molecular Class-Specific Information System (MCSIS) project, a collaborative effort to design and automate the maintenance of protein family databases. The first two databases, the GPCRDB and NucleaRDB, are focused on G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and nuclear hormone receptors (NRs), respectively. The main aim of the MCSIS project is to gather heterogeneous data from across a variety of electronic and literature sources in order to draw new inferences about the target protein families.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWe present a computational method that identifies and extracts mutation data from the scientific literature. We focused on the extraction of single point mutations for the GPCR and NR superfamilies. After validation by plausibility filters, the mutation data is integrated into the corresponding MCSIS where it is combined with structural and sequence information already stored in these databases. We extracted and validated 2736 true point mutations from 914 articles on GPCRs and 785 true point mutations from 1094 articles on NRs. The current version of our automated extraction algorithm identifies 49.3% of the GPCR point mutations with a specificity of 87.9%, and 64.5% of the NR point mutations with a specificity of 85.8%. MuteXt routinely analyzes 100 electronic articles in approximately 1 h."

Documents often contain tables in order to communicate densely packed, multi-dimensional information. Tables do this by employing layout patterns to efficiently indicate fields and records in two-dimensional form.Their rich combination of formatting and content present difficulties for traditional language modeling techniques, however. This paper presents the use of conditional random fields (CRFs) for table extraction, and compares them with hidden Markov models (HMMs). Unlike HMMs, CRFs support the use of many rich and overlapping layout and language features, and as a result, they perform significantly better. We show experimental results on plain-text government statistical reports in which tables are located with 92% F1, and their constituent lines are classified into 12 table-related categories with 94% accuracy. We also discuss future work on undirected graphical models for segmenting columns, finding cells, and classifying them as data cells or label cells."

Context specific information relating to a particular protein or protein family is, however, not easily integrated and must be uploaded from databases or provided through manual curation of input files. Protein Engineers spend considerable time iteratively reviewing both literature and protein structure visualizations manually annotated with mutated residues. Meanwhile, text mining tools are increasingly used to extract specific units of raw text from scientific literature and have demonstrated the potential to support the activities of Protein Engineers.The transfer of mutation specific raw-text annotations to protein structures requires integrated data processing pipelines that can co-ordinate information retrieval, information extraction, protein sequence retrieval, sequence alignment and mutant residue mapping. We describe the Mutation Miner pipeline designed for this purpose and present case study evaluations of the key steps in the process. Starting with literature about mutations made to protein families; haloalkane dehalogenase, bi-phenyl dioxygenase, and xylanase we enumerate relevant documents available for text mining analysis, the available electronic formats, and the number of mutations made to a given protein family. We review the efficiency of NLP driven protein sequence retrieval from databases and report on the effectiveness of Mutation Miner in mapping annotations to protein structure visualizations. We highlight the feasibility and practicability of the approach."

                "text": "In this paper, we consider the table understanding task and present a catalogue of particular issues that arise when the tables are those found on the web. In addition, we consider what happens when processes commonly associated with web pages are applied to those bearing tables. 1 Table Understanding and the Web The ubiquity of tables, and their ability to describe relational information in a compact and immediate manner make them attractive targets for automated understanding. Recent research into the automatic location, recognition and understanding of tables has demonstrated the viability of integrating automated table processing systems into larger knowledge management applications ([8]). However, table understanding is still a relatively novel research area, one whose definition and terminology are still not fixed. It is useful to break the task down into some subtasks, and to consider them in turn with respect to the understanding of tables delivered on the web. Generally, table processing can be conceptualized as consisting of table location; table recognition; functional and structural analysis; and finally interpretation the extraction of meaningful and unambiguously structured information ([4]). We concentrate on the first two tasks in the following. location table location is the processes of spotting tables in documents. Traditionally, this task comes in two basic forms document image sourced tables ([7], [3]) and electronic text sourced tables including HTML ([1]). The problem is extended to include the spotting of tables in other document encodings such as postscript, pdf, rtf, word, etc. In general, when considering tables on the web, the appropriate HTML tags are exploited (TABLE, TH, TD, etc.). However, this is where we come to the first two distinguishing points. the presence of the TABLE tag in an HTML document does not necessarily indicate the presence of a table ([1] suggest less than 30 % of HTML TABLEs are real tables in one particular domain). there are many other ways in which tables may be presented in web delivered documents plain text (PRE), images, mixtures of table specific tags (TABLE, etc.) and tags used within the table for their functionality in terms of placing text spatially (PRE, LI, etc.) see Figure 1 for an example of such complexities. The first point requires the creation of accurate classification technology. Given any TABLE node in the HTML, the classifier must accept or reject it. Such a classifier may be built either via hand crafted rules ([1]) or using a machine learning approach. Experiments suggest that a machine learning approach using a naive bayse classifier ([9]) based on a feature set describing the set of tags below the potential TABLE node in the document tree produces adequate results. Locating tables encoded in other formats requires technology from other areas. For example, images of tables may be processed by techniques from the document image field ([2]), pre-formatted tables (using the PRE) tag may be processed using plain text table methods ([5]). However, the classification problem extends to these cases and individual classifiers must be constructed to make decisions about document elements of each type. The remaining outstanding issues relate to the mixture of encoding types (e.g. tables built out of TABLE nodes and pre-formatted elements), as well as the mixture of encoding purposes (e.g. the use of the HTML TABLE to encode surrounding text as well as an embedded table). Figure 1. A web page using a mixture of HTML tables (on the left) and images of tables (on the right). recognition table recognition is the task of segmenting the original description of the table into a relative spatial description. In general this task is required when the input is low-level, such as a document image or an electronic text. Clearly, if such tables are found on a web page, the same process is required. Again, given certain assumptions, we can take the marked up tables in a web page to be the logical spatial table. However, there are certain issues that need to be understood in order to account for certain variations: internal cell structure though tags like TH and TD may be assumed to delimit a single cell in the table, there are cases where other non-table tags are used to provide internal structure in such a way as to associate the cell\u2019s contents with those of other cells. A solution would be required to apply a certain amount of recursive processing working into the structure and building a unified abstract table. split cells in order to gain more control over the distribution of the text in a cell, authors occasionally split the text and place it in two or more adjacent cells. This problem may be accommodated by exploiting linguistic process as described in [6] where the content of the cell can be used to indicate continuity, if any, to other cells. errors spanning errors occur when the COLSPAN or ROWSPAN values are not correctly calculated. There are two cases. In the first the cell spans beyond the border of the intended table giving the cell incorrect coordinates. In the second, the span of the cell does not communicate the correct meaning of the cell. For example, a cell that is intended to span three cells below it spans only one leading to ambiguity. The first type of problem may be repaired by some form of normalization, whereas the second requires intelligent processing in order to distinguish the following two cases:"

In this paper, we first discuss how observing curators at work informed the design and evaluation of PaperBrowser. Then, we present how we appraise PaperBrowser's navigational functionalities in a user-based study using a text highlighting task and evaluation criteria of Human-Computer Interaction. Our results show that PaperBrowser reduces the amount of interactions between two highlighting events and therefore improves navigational efficiency by about 58% compared to the navigational mechanism that was previously available to the curators. Moreover, PaperBrowser is shown to provide curators with enhanced navigational utility by over 74% irrespective of the different ways in which they highlight text in the article.ConclusionWe show that state-of-the-art performance in certain NLP tasks such as Named Entity Recognition and Anaphora Resolution can be combined with the navigational functionalities of PaperBrowser to support curation quite successfully."

Current tools that allow applications to programmatically extract this information rely heavily on user input, often in the form of labeled extracted records. The sheer size and rate of growth of the Web make any solution that relies primarily on user input is infeasible in the long term. Fortunately, many Web sites contain much explicit and implicit structure, both in layout and content, that we can exploit for the purpose of information extraction. This paper describes an approach to automatic extraction and segmentation of records from Web tables. Automatic methods do not require any user input, but rely solely on the layout and content of the Web source. Our approach relies on the common structure of many Web sites, which present information as a list or a table, with a link in each entry leading to a detail page containing additional information about that item. We describe two algorithms that use redundancies in the content of table and detail pages to aid in information extraction. The first algorithm encodes additional information provided by detail pages as constraints and finds the segmentation by solving a constraint satisfaction problem. The second algorithm uses probabilistic inference to find the record segmentation. We show how each approach can exploit the web site structure in a general, domain-independent manner, and we demonstrate the effectiveness of each algorithm on a set of twelve Web sites."

We present a wrapper-learning system called WL2 that can exploit several different representations of a document. Examples of such different representations include DOM-level and token-level representations, as well as two-dimensional geometric views of the rendered page (for tabular data) and representations of the visual appearance of text asm it will be rendered. Additionally, the learning system is modular, and can be easily adapted to new domains and tasks. The learning system described is part of an \"industrial-strength\" wrapper management system that is in active use at WhizBang Labs. Controlled experiments show that the learner has broader coverage and a faster learning rate than earlier wrapper-learning systems."

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the most frequent cancer observed in LS. However, tumors occur at a variety of extracolonic sites and individuals may have multiple primary cancers. LS is the most common hereditary form of CRC, accounting for approximately 1% of all CRC. Since the first account of mutations in MSH2 causing this cancer susceptibility syndrome in 1993, mutations in three additional MMR genes, MLH1, MSH6, and PMS2, have been shown to cause LS. More than 1,500 different variants have been identified in these four genes and approximately 80% of the alterations have been identified in MLH1 and MSH2. There have been a few previous attempts to systematically record MMR variants associated with LS patients; however, they were not complete nor were they continuously updated. Thus, it was our goal to generate and maintain a comprehensive catalogue of MMR variants from genes known to be mutated in LS (http://www.med.mun.ca/MMRvariants; last accessed 8 February 2007). Providing such a resource should aid investigators in understanding the significance of the variants. Hum Mutat 28(7), 669\u2013673, 2007. \u00a9 2007 Wiley\u2010Liss, Inc."

In this survey, the table recognition literature is presented as an interaction of table models, observations, transformations, and inferences. A table model defines the physical and logical structure of tables; the model is used to detect tables and to analyze and decompose the detected tables. Observations perform feature measurements and data lookup, transformations alter or restructure data, and inferences generate and test hypotheses. This presentation clarifies both the decisions made by a table recognizer and the assumptions and inferencing techniques that underlie these decisions."
