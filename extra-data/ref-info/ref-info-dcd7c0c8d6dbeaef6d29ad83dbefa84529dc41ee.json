However, for general three\u2013dimensional (3D) objects it is not possible to compute non\u2013trivial object specific descriptors from a single view that are invariant to general choices of viewpoint This raises the question of how to effectively organize recognition of 3D objects from single views by making various compromises w.r.t. invariance and efficiency of representations. For general shapes we can derive shape constraints, invariant to viewpoint and other camera parameters, that relate 3D and image structure. These relations can be used for verification of the presence in an image of a specific 3D object but they do not allow for the computation of view invariant indexes. In order to have an indexing system for recognition, there are basically two alternative options: If we want complete view invariance we have to restrict the class of objects. Alternatively, if we want methods that work for general unconstrained object types, we have to restrict the range of viewpoints over which invariant descriptors can be computed. We will see how this naturally leads to the introduction of incidence and order structure respectively, as a basis for shape description. The hierarchy of geometric structure descriptions: projective/affine, order and incidence can all be described in a unified way in terms of properties of bracket expressions of image coordinates in arbitrary frames."

The exact properties of human shape similarity judgements are not well understood yet, and this task is particularly difficult in domains where the shapes are not related by rigid transformation. In this paper we identify a number of possibly desirable properties of a shape similarity method, and determine the extent to which these properties can be captured by approaches that compare local properties of the contours of the shapes, through elastic matching. Special attention is devoted to objects that possess articulations, i.e. articulated parts. Elastic matching evaluates the similarity of two shapes as the sum of local deformations needed to change one shape into another. We show that similarities of part structure can be captured by such an approach, without the explicit computation of part structure. This may be of importance, since although parts appear to play a significant role in visual recognition, it is difficult to stably determine part structure. We also show novel results about how one can evaluate smooth and polyhedral shapes with the same method. Finally, we describe shape similarity effects that cannot be handled by current approaches."

In this paper, we apply this approach to the problem of representing three-dimensional shapes for the purpose of recognition. 1. Three criteria, accessibility, scope and uniqueness, and stability and sensitivity, are presented for judging the usefulness of a representation for shape recognition. 2. Three aspects of a representation\u2019s design are considered, (i) the representation\u2019s coordinate system, (ii) its primitives, which are the primary units of shape information used in the representation, and (iii) the organization the representation imposes on the information in its descriptions. 3. In terms of these design issues and the criteria presented, a shape representation for recognition should: (i) use an object-centred coordinate system, (ii) include volumetric primitives of varied sizes, and (iii) have a modular organization. A representation based on a shape\u2019s natural axes (for example the axes identified by a stick figure) follows directly from these choices. 4. The basic process for deriving a shape description in this representation must involve: (i) a means for identifying the natural axes of a shape in its image and (ii) a mechanism for transforming viewer-centred axis specifications to specifications in an object-centred coordinate system. 5. Shape recognition involves: (i) a collection of stored shape descriptions, and (ii) various indexes into the collection that allow a newly derived description to be associated with an appropriate stored description. The most important of these indexes allows shape recognition to proceed conservatively from the general to the specific based on the specificity of the information available from the image. 6. New constraints supplied by a conservative recognition process can be used to extract more information from the image. A relaxation process for carrying out this constraint analysis is described."

A number of components of this model are developed in further detail and implemented as computer algorithms. At the highest level, a verification process has been developed which can determine exact values of viewpoint and object parameters from hypothesized matches between three-dimensional object features and two-dimensional image features. This provides a reliable quantitative procedure for evaluating the correctness of an interpretation, even in the presence of noise or occlusion. Given a reliable method for final evaluation of correspondence, the remaining components of the system are aimed at reducing the size of the search space which must be covered. Unlike many previous approaches, this recognition process does not assume that it is possible to directly derive depth information from the image. Instead, the primary descriptive component is a process of perceptual organization, in which spatial relations are detected directly among two-dimensional image features. A basic requirement of the recognition process is that perceptual organization should accurately distinguish meaningful groupings from those which arise by accident of viewpoint or position. This requirement is used to derive a number of further constraints which must be satisfied by algorithms for perceptual grouping. A specific algorithm is presented for the problem of segmenting curves into natural descriptions. Methods are also presented for using the viewpoint-invariance properties of the perceptual groupings to infer three-dimensional relations directly from the image. The search process itself is described, both for covering the range of possible viewpoints and the range of possible objects. A method is presented for using evidential reasoning to combine information from multiple sources to determine the most efficient ordering for the search. This use of evidential reasoning allows a system to automatically improve its performance as it gains visual experience. In summary, spatial organization and recognition are shown to be a practical basis for current systems and to provide a promising path for further development of improved visual capabilities."

In all experiments, subjects were presented with realistically rendered images of computer-generated 3D objects, with tight control over stimulus shape, surface properties, illumination, and viewpoint, as well as subjects' prior exposure to the stimulus objects. Contrary to the predictions of the paradigmatic theory of recognition, which holds that object representations are viewpoint invariant, performance in all experiments was consistently viewpoint dependent, was only partially aided by binocular stereo and other depth information, was specific to viewpoints that were familiar, and was systematically disrupted by rotation in depth more than by deforming the 2D images of the stimuli. The emerging concept of multiple-views representation supported by these results is consistent with recently advanced computational theories of recognition based on view interpolation. Moreover, in several simulated experiments employing the same stimuli used in experiments with human subjects, models based on multiple-views representations replicated many of the psychophysical results concerning the observed pattern of human performance."
