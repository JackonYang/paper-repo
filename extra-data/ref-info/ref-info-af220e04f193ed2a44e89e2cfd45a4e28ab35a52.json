The matching is performed in a series of images depicting the same scene with different resolutions, i.e. in a resolution pyramid. Using this hierarchical structure reduces the computational load significantly. The algorithm is reasonably simple to implement and is insensitive to noise and other disturbances. The algorithm has been tested in several applications. Two of them are briefly presented. In the first application the outlines of common tools are matched to gray-level images of the same tools, with overlapping. In the second application lake edges from aerial photographs are matched to lake edges from a map, with translation, rotation, scale, and perspective changes. The hierarchical chamfer matching algorithm gives correct results using a reasonable amount of computational resources in all tested applications. >"

The selected window is optimal in the sense that it produces the disparity estimate having the least uncertainty after evaluating both the intensity and the disparity variations within a window. The algorithm employs a statistical model that represents uncertainty of disparity of points over the window; the uncertainty is assumed to increase with the distance of the point from the center point. The algorithm is completely local and does not include any global optimization. Also, the algorithm does not use any post-processing smoothing, but smooth surfaces are recovered as smooth while sharp disparity edges are retained. Experimental results have demonstrated a clear advantage of this algorithm over algorithms with a fixed-size window, for both synthetic and real images.<<ETX>>"

                "text": "The relative efficiency of any particular image-coding scheme should be defined only in relation to the class of images that the code is likely to encounter. To understand the representation of images by the mammalian visual system, it might therefore be useful to consider the statistics of images from the natural environment (i.e., images with trees, rocks, bushes, etc). In this study, various coding schemes are compared in relation to how they represent the information in such natural images. The coefficients of such codes are represented by arrays of mechanisms that respond to local regions of space, spatial frequency, and orientation (Gabor-like transforms). For many classes of image, such codes will not be an efficient means of representing information. However, the results obtained with six natural images suggest that the orientation and the spatial-frequency tuning of mammalian simple cells are well suited for coding the information in such images if the goal of the code is to convert higher-order redundancy (e.g., correlation between the intensities of neighboring pixels) into first-order redundancy (i.e., the response distribution of the coefficients). Such coding produces a relatively high signal-to-noise ratio and permits information to be transmitted with only a subset of the total number of cells. These results support Barlow's theory that the goal of natural vision is to represent the information in the natural environment with minimal redundancy."

A fundamental problem in computing such descriptions is scale: a derivative must be taken over some neighborhood, but there is seldom a principled basis for choosing its size. Scale-space filtering is a method that describes signals qualitatively, managing the ambiguity of scale in an organized and natural way. The signal is first expanded by convolution with gaussian masks over a continuum of sizes. This \"scale-space\" image is then collapsed, using its qualitative structure, into a tree providing a concise but complete qualitative description covering all scales of observation. The description is further refined by applying a stability criterion, to identify events that persist of large changes in scale."
