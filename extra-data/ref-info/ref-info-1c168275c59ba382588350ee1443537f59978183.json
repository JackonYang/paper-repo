This approach is independent of the initial state and produces natural hierarchical clustering solutions by going through a sequence of phase transitions. It is modified for a larger class of optimization problems by adding constraints to the free energy. The concept of constrained clustering is explained, and three examples are are given in which it is used to introduce deterministic annealing. The previous clustering method is improved by adding cluster mass variables and a total mass constraint. The traveling salesman problem is reformulated as constrained clustering, yielding the elastic net (EN) approach to the problem. More insight is gained by identifying a second Lagrange multiplier that is related to the tour length and can also be used to control the annealing process. The open path constraint formulation is shown to relate to dimensionality reduction by self-organization in unsupervised learning. A similar annealing procedure is applicable in this case as well. >"

The final product is a three-dimensional figure that displays a selection of density estimates for a plausible range of smoothing parameters. The boundaries of the smoothing parameter are determined by a nonparametric goodness-of-fit test that is based on the sample spacings. For each value of the smoothing parameter our estimator is selected by choosing the normal mixture that maximizes a function of the sample spacings. A point estimate is selected from this confidence set by using the method of cross-validation. An algorithm to find the mixing distribution that maximizes the spacings functional is presented. These methods are illustrated with a data set from the astronomy literature. The measurements are velocities at which galaxies in the Corona Borealis region are moving away from our galaxy. If the galaxies are clustered, the velocity density will be multimodal, with clusters correspond..."

The subclass P? contains the class NPC of NP-complete discrete optimization problems. NPC has the important property that if only one member of NPC can be shown to be polynomial solvable all members of NPC as well as a large number of other combinatorial problems are polynomial solvable.

The problem is how to organize knowledge into a conceptual structure and thus make it complete, concise, and consistent. In this paper, concepts used in knowledge description are divided into tangible ones and intermediate ones depending on whether or not they appear in the input or the output of the system. Intermediate concepts and their relationships with tangible concepts are subjected to changes. A distance measure for rules and an algorithm for conceptual clustering are described. New intermediate concepts are generated using this algorithm. A few new concepts may replace a large number of old relationships and also generate new rules for the system. An experiment on traditional Chinese medicine shows that the proposed method produces results similar to those generated by experts."
