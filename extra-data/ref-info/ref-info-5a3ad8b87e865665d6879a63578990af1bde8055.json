Our method can deal with significant affine transformations including large scale changes. Such transformations introduce significant changes in the point location as well as in the scale and the shape of the neighbourhood of an interest point. Our approach allows to solve for these problems simultaneously. It is based on three key ideas : 1) The second moment matrix computed in a point can be used to normalize a region in an affine invariant way (skew and stretch). 2) The scale of the local structure is indicated by local extrema of normalized derivatives over scale. 3) An affine-adapted Harris detector determines the location of interest points. A multi-scale version of this detector is used for initialization. An iterative algorithm then modifies location, scale and neighbourhood of each point and converges to affine invariant points. For matching and recognition, the image is characterized by a set of affine invariant points; the affine transformation associated with each point allows the computation of an affine invariant descriptor which is also invariant to affine illumination changes. A quantitative comparison of our detector with existing ones shows a significant improvement in the presence of large affine deformations. Experimental results for wide baseline matching show an excellent performance in the presence of large perspective transformations including significant scale changes. Results for recognition are very good for a database with more than 5000 images."

In other words, it generates coarse segmentation cues, and can hence be seen as preceding further processing, which can then be properly tuned. It is argued that once such information is available, many other processing tasks can become much simpler. Experiments on real imagery demonstrate that the proposed theory gives intuitive results."

                "text": "In this paper, we present an analysis of the theoretical underpinnings of the Scale Saliency algorithm recently introduced in (Kadir and Brady, 2001). Scale Saliency considers image regions salient if they are simultaneously unpredictable in some feature-space and over scale. The algorithm possesses a number of attractive properties: invariance to planar rotation, scaling, intensity shifts and translation; robustness to noise, changes in viewpoint, and intensity scalings. Moreover, the approach offers a more general model of feature saliency compared with conventional ones, such as those based on kernel convolution, for example wavelet analysis. Typically, such techniques define saliency and scale with respect to a particular set of basis morphologies. The aim of this paper is to make explicit the nature of this generality. Specifically, we aim to answer the following questions: What exactly constitutes a \u2018salient feature\u2019? How does this differ from other feature selection methods? The main result of our analysis is that Scale Saliency defines saliency and scale independently of any particular feature morphology. Instead, a more general notion is used, namely spatial unpredictability. This is determined within the geometric constraint determined by the sampling window and its parameterisation. In (Kadir and Brady, 2001) this window was a circle parameterised by a single parameter controlling the radius. Under such a scheme, features are considered salient if their feature-space properties vary rapidly with an incremental change in radius. In other words, the feature favours isotropically unpredictable features. We also present a number of variations of the original algorithm: a modification for colour images (or more generally any vector-valued image) and a generalisation of the isotropic scale constraint to the anisotropic case."

The problem of window effects is explicitly addressed by our method-our feature characterisation is invariant to linear transformations of the image data including rotation, stretch and skew. The feature matching process is optimised for a structure-from-motion application where we wish to ignore unreliable matches at the expense of reducing the number of feature matches."

The features are invariant to image scaling, translation, and rotation, and partially invariant to illumination changes and affine or 3D projection. These features share similar properties with neurons in inferior temporal cortex that are used for object recognition in primate vision. Features are efficiently detected through a staged filtering approach that identifies stable points in scale space. Image keys are created that allow for local geometric deformations by representing blurred image gradients in multiple orientation planes and at multiple scales. The keys are used as input to a nearest neighbor indexing method that identifies candidate object matches. Final verification of each match is achieved by finding a low residual least squares solution for the unknown model parameters. Experimental results show that robust object recognition can be achieved in cluttered partially occluded images with a computation time of under 2 seconds."

Such regions are then described by a set of invariant features, which makes it relatively easy to match them between views and under changing illumination. In previous work, we have presented invariant regions that are based on a combination of corners and edges. The application discussed then was image database retrieval. Here, an alternative method for extracting (affinely) invariant regions is given, that does not depend on the presence of edges or corners in the image but is purely intensity-based. Also, we demonstrate the use of such regions for another application, which is wide baseline stereo matching. As a matter of fact, the goal is to build an opportunistic system that exploits several types of invariant regions as it sees fit. This yields more correspondences and a system that can deal with a wider range of images. To increase the robustness of the system even further, two semi-local constraints on combinations of region correspondences are derived (one geometric, the other photometric). They allow to test the consistency of correspondences and hence to reject falsely matched regions."

A vocabulary of information-rich object parts is automatically constructed from a set of sample images of the object class of interest. Images are then represented using parts from this vocabulary, along with spatial relations observed among them. Based on this representation, a feature-efficient learning algorithm is used to learn to detect instances of the object class. The framework developed can be applied to any object with distinguishable parts in a relatively fixed spatial configuration. We report experiments on images of side views of cars. Our experiments show that the method achieves high detection accuracy on a difficult test set of real-world images, and is highly robust to partial occlusion and background variation.In addition, we discuss and offer solutions to several methodological issues that are significant for the research community to be able to evaluate object detection approaches."

This is done using expectation-maximization in a maximum-likelihood setting. In recognition, this model is used in a Bayesian manner to classify images. The flexible nature of the model is demonstrated by excellent results over a range of datasets including geometrically constrained classes (e.g. faces, cars) and flexible objects (such as animals)."

In a first stage, the method automatically identifies distinctive parts in the training set by applying a clustering algorithm to patterns selected by an interest operator. It then learns the statistical shape model using expectation maximization. The method achieves very good classification results on human faces and rear views of cars."

The appropriate choice of type and level of description is of course task dependent, yet it is generally accepted that the low-level or so called early vision layers in the Human Visual System are context independent.This paper concentrates on the use of low-level approaches for solving computer vision problems and discusses three inter-related aspects of this: saliency; scale selection and content description. In contrast to many previous approaches which separate these tasks, we argue that these three aspects are intrinsically related. Based on this observation, a multiscale algorithm for the selection of salient regions of an image is introduced and its application to matching type problems such as tracking, object recognition and image retrieval is demonstrated."

A new set of image elements that are put into correspondence, the so called extremal regions, is introduced. Extremal regions possess highly desirable properties: the set is closed under 1. continuous (and thus projective) transformation of image coordinates and 2. monotonic transformation of image intensities. An efficient (near linear complexity) and practically fast detection algorithm (near frame rate) is presented for an affinely-invariant stable subset of extremal regions, the maximally stable extremal regions (MSER). A new robust similarity measure for establishing tentative correspondences is proposed. The robustness ensures that invariants from multiple measurement regions (regions obtained by invariant constructions from extremal regions), some that are significantly larger (and hence discriminative) than the MSERs, may be used to establish tentative correspondences. The high utility of MSERs, multiple measurement regions and the robust metric is demonstrated in wide-baseline experiments on image pairs from both indoor and outdoor scenes. Significant change of scale (3.5\u00d7), illumination conditions, out-of-plane rotation, occlusion , locally anisotropic scale change and 3D translation of the viewpoint are all present in the test problems. Good estimates of epipolar geometry (average distance from corresponding points to the epipolar line below 0.09 of the inter-pixel distance) are obtained."

The method is based on two recent results on scale space: (1) Interest points can be adapted to scale and give repeatable results (geometrically stable). (2) Local extrema over scale of normalized derivatives indicate the presence of characteristic local structures. Our method first computes a multi-scale representation for the Harris interest point detector. We then select points at which a local measure (the Laplacian) is maximal over scales. This allows a selection of distinctive points for which the characteristic scale is known. These points are invariant to scale, rotation and translation as well as robust to illumination changes and limited changes of viewpoint. For indexing, the image is characterized by a set of scale invariant points; the scale associated with each point allows the computation of a scale invariant descriptor. Our descriptors are, in addition, invariant to image rotation, of affine illumination changes and robust to small perspective deformations. Experimental results for indexing show an excellent performance up to a scale factor of 4 for a database with more than 5000 images."

The topology is restricted to resolutions up to the extent of the local region of interest (ROI). Although the ROI's may contain many pixels, there is no spatial order on the pixels within the ROI, the only information preserved is the histogram of pixel values within the ROI's. This can be considered as an extreme case of a textel (texture element) image: The histogram is the limit of texture where the spatial order has been completely disregarded. We argue that locally orderless images are ubiquitous in perception and the visual arts. Formally, the orderless images are most aptly described by three mutually intertwined scale spaces. The scale parameters correspond to the pixellation (\u201cinner scale\u201d), the extent of the ROI's (\u201couter scale\u201d) and the resolution in the histogram (\u201ctonal scale\u201d). We describe how to construct locally orderless images, how to render them, and how to use them in a variety of local and global image processing operations."

Although the active and task-oriented nature of vision is only implicit in this formulation, this view captures several of the essential aspects of vision. As Marr (1982) phrased it in his book Vision, vision is an information processing task, in which an internal representation of information is of out-most importance. Only by representation information can be captured and made available to decision processes. The purpose of a representation is to make certain aspects of the information content explicit, that is, immediately accessible without any need for additional processing."

Arbitrary concatenations of such RF profiles yield again similar ones of higher order and for a greater degree of blurring.By replacing the illuminance with its third order jet extension we obtain position dependent geometries. It is shown how such a representation can function as the substrate for \u201cpoint processors\u201d computing geometrical features such as edge curvature. We obtain a clear dichotomy between local and multilocal visual routines. The terms of the truncated Taylor series representing the jets are partial derivatives whose corresponding RF profiles closely mimic the well known units in the primary visual cortex. Hence this description provides a novel means to understand and classify these units.Taking the receptive field outputs as the basic input data one may devise visual routines that compute geometric features on the basis of standard differential geometry exploiting the equivalence with the local jets (partial derivatives with respect to the space coordinates)."

In contrast in the case of widely separated views, methods have generally been restricted to two or three views.In this paper we investigate the problem of establishing relative viewpoints given a large number of images where no ordering information is provided. A typical application would be where images are obtained from different sources or at different times: both the viewpoint (position, orientation, scale) and lighting conditions may vary significantly over the data set.Such a problem is not fundamentally amenable to exhaustive pair wise and triplet wide baseline matching because this would be prohibitively expensive as the number of views increases. Instead, we investiate how a combination of image invariants, covariants, and multiple view relations can be used in concord to enable efficient multiple view matching. The result is a matching algorithm which is linear in the number of views.The methods are illustrated on several real image data sets. The output enables an image based technique for navigating in a 3D scene, moving from one image to whichever image is the next most appropriate."

We show that these properties taken together constrain the structure of receptive fields to a very large degree. Only those field structures that arise as solutions of a certain linear partial differential equation of the second order prove to satisfy these general constraints. The equation admits of complete, orthonormal families of solutions. These families have to be regarded as the possible receptive field families subject to certain symmetry conditions. They can be transformed into each other via unitary transformations. Thus a single representation suffices to construct all the others. This theory permits us to classify the possible linear receptive field structures exhaustively, and to define their internal and external interrelations. This induces a principled taxonomy of linear receptive fields."

Masses typically appear in a mammogram as well-defined, relatively bright regions. The converse is not true; by no means all relatively bright, circumscribed regions correspond to masses. Common to our approach to matching temporal and bilateral mammogram pairs is a representation of the nested structure of \u201csalient\u201d bright regions in a mammogram. The representation is described in Sections 2 and 3. In the case of temporal pairs, \u201csalient\u201d regions are extracted independently in two mammograms of the same breast, nominally the same view at two different times. Those that either appear in the later mammogram but not in the earlier one, or which have changed significantly between the two mammograms we seek to highlight. Similarly, in the case of matching bilateral pairs, salient regions that appear in only one of same-view left and right breast mammograms of the same patient, taken at approximately the same time we seek to highlight. A fuller version of this article appears as Chapter 13 of [4]."
