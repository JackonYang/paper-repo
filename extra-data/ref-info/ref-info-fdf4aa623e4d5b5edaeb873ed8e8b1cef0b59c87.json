In statistical language modeling, large amounts of text are used to automatically determine the model's parameters. Language modeling is useful in automatic speech recognition, machine translation, and any other application that processes natural language with incomplete knowledge. In this thesis, I view language as an information source which emits a stream of symbols from a finite alphabet (the vocabulary). The goal of language modeling is then to identify and exploit sources of information in the language stream, so as to minimize its perceived entropy. Most existing statistical language models exploit the immediate past only. To extract information from further back in the document's history, I use trigger pairs as the basic information bearing elements. This allows the model to adapt its expectations to the topic of discourse. Next, statistical evidence from many sources must be combined. Traditionally, linear interpolation and its variants have been used, but these are shown here to be seriously deficient. Instead, I apply the principle of Maximum Entropy (ME). Each information source gives rise to a set of constraints, to be imposed on the combined estimate. The intersection of these constraints is the set of probability functions which are consistent with all the information sources. The function with the highest entropy within that set is the NE solution. Language modeling, Adaptive language modeling, Statistical language modeling, Maximum entropy, Speech recognition."

They begin with improved modeling of the grammar statistics, based on a combination of the backing-off technique and zero-frequency techniques. These are extended to be more amenable to the particular system considered here. The resulting technique is greatly simplified, more robust, and gives improved recognition performance over either of the previous techniques. The authors also consider the problem of robustness of a model based on a small training corpus by grouping words into obvious semantic classes. This significantly improves the robustness of the resulting statistical grammar. A technique that allows the estimation of a high-order model on modest computation resources is also presented. This makes it possible to run a 4-gram statistical model of a 50-million word corpus on a workstation of only modest capability and cost. Finally, the authors discuss results from applying a 2-gram statistical language model integrated in the HMM (hidden Markov model) search, obtaining a list of the N-best recognition results, and rescoring this list with a higher-order statistical model.<<ETX>>"

To extract information from the document history, trigger pairs are used as the basic information-bearing elements. To combine statistical evidence from multiple triggers, the principle of maximum entropy (ME) is used. To combine the trigger-based model with the static model, the latter is absorbed into the ME formalism. Given consistent statistical evidence, a unique ME solution is guaranteed to exist, and an iterative algorithm exists which is guaranteed to converge to it. Among the advantages of this approach are its simplicity, generality, and incremental nature. Among its disadvantages are its computational requirements. The model described here was trained on five million words of Wall Street Journal text. It used some 40000 unigram constraints, 200000 bigram constraints, 200000 trigram constraints, and 60000 trigger constraints. After 13 iterations, it produced a language model whose perplexity was 12% lower than that of a conventional trigram, as measured on independent data.<<ETX>>"

The task of these distributions is to predict the probability of a new word by looking at M or even all predecessor words. The conventional approach is to limit M to 1 or 2 and to interpolate the resulting bigram and trigram models with a unigram model in a linear fashion. However, there are many other structures that can be used to model the probabilistic dependences between the predecessor word and the word to be predicted. The structures considered in this paper are: nonlinear interpolation as an alternative to linear interpolation; equivalence classes for word histories and single words; cache memory and word associations. For the optimal estimation of nonlinear and linear interpolation parameters, the leaving-one-out method is systematically used. For the determination of word equivalence classes in a bigram model, an automatic clustering procedure has been adapted. To capture long-distance dependences, we consider various models for word-by-word dependences; the cache model may be viewed as a special type of self-association. Experimental results are presented for two text databases, a Germany database and an English database."

The second technique is based on augmenting the standard trigram model with a cache component in which the words' recurrence probabilities decay exponentially over time. Both techniques yield a significant reduction in perplexity over the baseline trigram language model when faced with a multi-domain test text, the mixture-based model giving a 24% reduction and the cache-based model giving a 14% reduction. The two techniques attack the problem of adaptation at different scales, and as a result can be used in parallel to give a total perplexity reduction of 30%."

The model offers, via a nonlinear recursive procedure, a computation and space efficient solution to the problem of estimating probabilities from sparse data. This solution compares favorably to other proposed methods. While the method has been developed for and successfully implemented in the IBM Real Time Speech Recognizers, its generality makes it applicable in other areas where the problem of estimating probabilities from sparse data arises."

Specifically, the problem is to estimate the probability that a given word will be the next word uttered. Algorithms are presented for automatically constructing a binary decision tree designed to estimate these probabilities. At each node of the tree there is a yes/no question relating to the words already spoken, and at each leaf there is a probability distribution over the allowable vocabulary. Ideally, these nodal questions can take the form of arbitrarily complex Boolean expressions, but computationally cheaper alternatives are also discussed. Some results obtained on a 5000-word vocabulary with a tree designed to predict the next word spoken from the preceding 20 words are included. The tree is compared to an equivalent trigram model and shown to be superior. >"

The authors propose the application of a Poisson process model of novelty. Its ability to predict novel tokens is evaluated, and it consistently outperforms existing methods. It is applied to a practical statistical coding scheme, where a slight modification is required to avoid divergence. The result is a well-founded zero-frequency model that explains observed differences in the performance of existing methods, and offers a small improvement in the coding efficiency of text compression over the best method previously known. >"
