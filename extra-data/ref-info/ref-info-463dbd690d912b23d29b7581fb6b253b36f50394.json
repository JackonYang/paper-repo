To date, however, no satisfactory probabilistic analogue of attribute-value grammars has been proposed: previous attempts have failed to define an adequate parameter-estimation algorithm.In the present paper, I define stochastic attribute-value grammars and give an algorithm for computing the maximum-likelihood estimate of their parameters. The estimation algorithm is adapted from Della Pietra, Della Pietra, and Lafferty (1995). To estimate model parameters, it is necessary to compute the expectations of certain functions under random fields. In the application discussed by Della Pietra, Della Pietra, and Lafferty (representing English orthographic constraints), Gibbs sampling can be used to estimate the needed expectations. The fact that attribute-value grammars generate constrained languages makes Gibbs sampling inapplicable, but I show that sampling can be done using the more general Metropolis-Hastings algorithm."

Lexical-Functional Grammar (Kaplan & Bresnan, 1982), Head-Driven Phrase-Structure Grammar (Pollard & Sag, 1987), PATR (Karttunen, 1986a), FUG (Kay, 1979, 1985), and the various forms of categorial unification grammar (Karttunen, 1986b; Uszkoreit, 1986; Zeevat, Klein, & Calder, 1987) all require an analysis of a sentence to satisfy a collection of feature constraints in addition to a set of conditions on the arrangement of words and phrases. Conjunctions of equality constraints can be quickly solved by standard unification algorithms, so they in themselves do not present a computational problem. However, the equality constraints derived for typical sentences are not merely conjoined together in a form that unification algorithms can deal with directly. Rather, they are embedded as primitive elements in complex disjunctive formulas. For some formalisms, these disjunctions arise from explicit disjunction operators that the constraint language provides for (e.g., LFG) while for others disjunctive constraints are derived from the application of alternative phrase structure rules (e.g., PATR). In either case, disjunctive specifications help to simplify the statement of grammatical possibilities. Alternatives expressed locally within individual rules and lexical entries can appeal to more general disjunctive processing mechanisms to resolve their global interactions."

In addition, it has been tested on a number of sentences of linguistic interest. Built into the system are facilities for ranking parses according to syntactic and selectional considerations, and over the years, as various kinds of ambiguity have become apparent, heuristics have been devised for choosing the preferred parses. Our aim in this paper is first to present a compendium of many of these heuristics and second to propose two principles that seem to underlie the heuristics. The first will be useful to researchers engaged in building grammars of similarly broad coverage. The second is of psychological interest and may be a guide for estimating parse preferences for newly discovered ambiguities for which we lack the experience to decide among on a more empirical basis."

The main point made here is the importance of probabilistic modeling to complex problems of machine perception. \nChapter 2 studies minimum complexity regression. The results include: (1) weak consistency of the regression, (2) divergence of estimates in $L\\sp2$-norm with an arbitrary complexity assignment, and (3) condition on complexity measure to ensure strong consistency. \nChapter 3 proposes compositionality as a general principle for probabilistic modeling. The main issues covered here are: (1) existence of general compositional probability measures, (2) subsystems of compositional systems, and (3) Gibbs representation of compositional probabilities. \nChapter 4 and 5 establish some useful properties of probabilistic context-free grammars (PCFGs). The following problems are discussed: (1) consistency of estimated PCFGs, (2) finiteness of entropy, momentum, etc, of estimated PCFGs, (3) branching rates and re-normalization of inconsistent PCFGs, and (4) identifiability of parameters of PCFGs. \nChapter 6 proposes a probabilistic feature based model for languages. Issues dealt with in the chapter include: (1) formulation of such grammars using maximum entropy principle, (2) modified maximum-likelihood type scheme for parameter estimation, (3) a novel pseudo-likelihood type estimation which is more efficient for sentence analysis. \nChapter 7 develops a novel model on the origin of scale invariance of natural images. After presenting the evidence of scale invariance, the chapter goes on to: (1) argue for a 1/$r\\sp3$ law of size of object, (2) establish a 2D Poisson model on the origin of scale invariance, and (3) show numerical simulation results for this model. \nChapter 8 is a theoretical extension of Chapter 7. A general approach to construct scale and translation invariant distributions using wavelet expansion is formulated and applied to construct scale and translation invariant distributions on the spaces of generalized functions and functions defined on the whole integer lattice."

We are given a fixed system of n sites, labelled by the first n positive integers, and an associated vector x of observations, Xi, . . ., Xn, which, in turn, is presumed to be a realization of a vector X of (dependent) random variables, Xi, . . ., X.. In practice, the sites may represent points or regions in space and the random variables may be either continuous or discrete. The main statistical objectives are the following: firstly, to provide a means of using the available concomitant information, particularly the configuration of the sites, to attach a plausible probability distribution to the random vector X; secondly, to estimate any unknown parameters in the distribution from the realization x; thirdly, where possible, to quantify the extent of disagreement between hypothesis and observation."
