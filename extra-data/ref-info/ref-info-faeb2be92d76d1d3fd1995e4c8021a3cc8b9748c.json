Based on the multi-resolution wavelet analysis results of the document image, we use HMM method in both inner-scale image model and trans-scale context model to classify the pixel region properties, such as text, picture or background. In each scale, a HMM direct segmentation method is used to get better inner-scale classification result. Then another HMM method is used to fuse the inner-scale result in each scale and then get better final segmentation result. The optimized algorithm uses a stop rule in the coarse to fine multi-scale segmentation process, so the speed is improved remarkably. Experiments prove the efficiency of proposed algorithm."

The structure of the background (white space) is analyzed, assisted by an enumeration of all maximal white rectangles. For this enumeration, the most computationally expensive step, an algorithm has been developed that, aside from a sort, achieves an expected runtime linear in the number of black connected components. The crucial engineering decision is the specification of a partial order on white rectangles to express domain-specific knowledge of preferred shapes and sizes. This order determines a sequence of partial covers of the background, and thus, a sequence of nested page segmentations. In experimental trials on Manhattan layouts, good segmentations often occur early in this sequence, using a simple and uniform shape-direction rule. This is a global-to-local strategy, which for some tasks is superior to strategies currently emphasized in the literature, including bottom-up and top-down.<<ETX>>"

The algorithms are considerably easier to implement than prior methods, they return globally optimal solutions, and they require no heuristics. The paper also introduces an evaluation function that reliably identifies maximal empty rectangles corresponding to column boundaries. Combining this evaluation function with the two geometric algorithms results in an easy-to-implement layout analysis system. Reliability of the system is demonstrated on documents from the UW3 database."

While half-tone can be characterised by its inherent intensity variation, text and graphics share common characteristics except difference in spatial distribution. The success of document image analysis systems depends on the proper segmentation. The success of document image analysis systems depends on the proper segmentation of text and graphics as text is further subdivided into other classes such as heading, table and math-zones. Segmentation of graphics is essential for better OCR performance and vectorization in computer vision applications. Graphics segmentation from text is particularly difficult in the context of graphics made of small components (dashed or dotted lines etc.) which have many features similar to texts. Here we propose a robust technique for segmenting all sorts of graphics and texts in any orientation from document pages."
