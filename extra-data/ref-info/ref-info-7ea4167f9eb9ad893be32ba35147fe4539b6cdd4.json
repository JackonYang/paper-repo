Instead of top-down determination of the discriminating attributes, the system inspects a finite set of document instances that are presented to a learner in a bottom-up position. The learner itself figures out local similarities, rates them with respect to the overall structure, and determines the best structural match of two instances (neighborhood). The entire decision tree is grown step by step deducing subtrees by forming generalizations from a neighborhood. Consequently, heuristics are learned for structurally discriminating documents during subsequent classification.<<ETX>>"

By document classification, we mean the process of identification of the particular class to which a document belongs. Document understanding is defined as the process of detecting the logical structure of a document. The multistrategy approach for document classification and understanding has been implemented in a system called PLRS, which embeds two empirical learning systems: RES and INDUBIIH. Given a set of documents whose layout structure has already been detected and such that the membership class has been defined by the user, RES generates the knowledge base of an expert system devoted to the classification of a document. The language used to describe both the layout of the training documents and the learned rules is a first-order language.

Subsequently, in a step called logical labeling, the layout objects and their compositions are geometrically analyzed to identify corresponding logical objects that can be related to a human perceptible meaning, such as sender, recipient, and date in a letter. A context-sensitive text recognition for logical objects is then applied using logical vocabularies and syntactic knowledge.

This tree is used to perform a best-first search in combination with a \"hypothesize & test\"- strategy. It produces an internal, editable description of the entire document and its constituents. The system has been implemented for the analysis of single-sided business letters in Common Lisp on a SUN 3/60 Workstation. It is running for a large population of different business letters. The results obtained have been very encouraging and have convincingly confirmed the soundness of the approach."

The system identifies important conceptual parts (logical objects) within business letters, like recipient, sender or company-specific printings. Thereby, the system works completely independent of text recognition. Instead, it only utilizes geometric knowledge sources. These are: global geometric knowledge about logical object arrangements, and local geometric knowledge about formal features of logical objects (e.g. extensions, typical font sizes, etc). As a result, a document image is classified by labeling area items by corresponding logical object designators after hypothesizing and testing geometric properties of the captured physical units (layout objects). Due to this strategy, ANASTASIL can be envisioned as a key for expectation-driven further analysis of logical objects by text or graphic recognition. The system has been completely implemented and has achieved some remarkable results. It is composed of a low-level geometric analysis module for image processing tasks and a high-level geometric analysis module that performs logical labeling of layout objects. The implementation was done on a SUN 3/60 workstation in C and Common-Lisp and will be soon available in the MacIntosh environment."
