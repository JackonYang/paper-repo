The ordinary Fourier coefficients are difficult to use as input to categorizers because they contain factors dependent upon size and rotation as well as an arbitrary phase angle. From these Fourier coefficients, however, other more useful features can easily be derived. By using these derived property constants, a distinction can be made between genuine shape constants and constants representing size, location, and orientation. The usefulness of the method has been tested with a computer program that was used to classify 175 samples of handprinted letters, e.g., 7 sets of the 25 letters A to Z. In this test, 98 percent were correctly recognized when a simple nonoptimized decision method was used. The last section contains some considerations of the technical realizability of a fast preprocessing system for reading printed text."

A fundamental theorem is established to relate such moment invariants to the well-known algebraic invariants. Complete systems of moment invariants under translation, similitude and orthogonal transformations are derived. Some moment invariants under general two-dimensional linear transformations are also included. Both theoretical formulation and practical models of visual pattern recognition based upon these moment invariants are discussed. A simple simulation program together with its performance are also presented. It is shown that recognition of geometrical patterns and alphabetical characters independently of position, size and orientation can be accomplished. It is also indicated that generalization is possible to include invariance with parallel projection."

A curve is represented parametrically as a function of arc length by the accumulated change in direction of the curve since the starting point. This function is expanded in a Fourier series and the coefficients are arranged in the amplitude/phase-angle form. It is shown that the amplitudes are pure form invariants as well as are certain simple functions of phase angles. Rotational and axial symmetry are related directly to simple properties of the Fourier descriptors. An analysis of shape similarity or symmetry can be based on these relationships; also closed symmetric curves can be synthesized from almost arbitrary Fourier descriptors. It is established that the Fourier series expansion is optimal and unique with respect to obtaining coefficients insensitive to starting point. Several examples are provided to indicate the usefulness of Fourier descriptors as features for shape discrimination and a number of interesting symmetric curves are generated by computer and plotted out."

When the number of pattern classes is very large, the theorems can reveal both the advantages of a tree classifier and the main difficulties in its implementation. Suppose H is Shannon's entropy measure of the given problem. The theoretical results indicate that the tree searching time can be minimized to the order O(H), but the error rate is also in the same order O(H) due to error accumulation. However, the memory requirement is in the order 0(H exp(H)) which poses serious problems in the implementation of a tree classifier for a large number of classes. To solve these problems, several theorems related to the bounds on the search time, error rate, memory requirement and overlap factor in the design of a decision tree have been proposed and some principles have been established to analyze the behaviors of the decision tree. When applied to classify sets of 64, 450, and 3200 Chinese characters, respectively, the experimental results support the theoretical predictions. For 3200 classes, a very high recognition rate of 99.88 percent was achieved at a high speed of 873 samples/s when the experiment was conducted on a Cyber 172 computer using a high-level language."

Such spurious features most frequently appear as bright regions on a dark background and when image thresholding is performed for the purpose of feature detection, such regions appear as genuine features of the surface, causing ambiguities in the feature detection. This paper proposes a simple and effective technique for eliminating such features through an efficient border-following technique followed by linear scanning f the interiors. The effectiveness and the usefulness of the technique is demonstrated by considering a piston (in particular the surface of the piston head) of the internal combustion engine of an automobile."
