Several critical functions have been investigated and the technical approaches are discussed. The first is the segmentation and classification of digitized printed documents into regions of text and images. A nonlinear, run-length smoothing algorithm has been used for this purpose. By using the regular features of text lines, a linear adaptive classification scheme discriminates text regions from others. The second technique studied is an adaptive approach to the recognition of the hundreds of font styles and sizes that can occur on printed documents. A preclassifier is constructed during the input process and used to speed up a well-known pattern-matching method for clustering characters from an arbitrary print source into a small sample of prototypes. Experimental results are included."

Therefore, good paper-computer interfaces are necessary to transform paper documents into an electronic form, which allows the use of a filing and retrieval system. An electronic document page is an optically scanned and digitized representation of a printed page. Document analysis is the problem of interpreting and labeling the constitutents of the document. Although there are very reliable optical character recognition (OCR) methods, the process could be very inefficient. To prune the search space and to become more efficient, some search supporting methods have to be developed. This article proposes an approach to identify the layout of a document page by dividing it recursively into nested rectangular areas. The procedure is used as a basis for a document layout model, which is able to control an automatic interpretation mechanism for deriving a high level representation of the contents of a document. We have implemented our method in Common Lisp on a Symbolies 3640 Workstation and have run it for a large population of office documents. The results obtained have been very encouraging and have convincingly confirmed the soundness of our approach."

The paper formulates the theoretical framework and a method for inferring general and optimal (according to certain criteria) descriptions of object classes from examples of classification or partial descriptions. The language for expressing the class descriptions and the guidance rules is an extension of the first-order predicate calculus, called variable-valued logic calculus VL21. VL21 involves typed variables and contains several new operators especially suited for conducting inductive inference, such as selector, internal disjunction, internal conjunction, exception, and generalization. Important aspects of the theory include: 1) a formulation of several kinds of generalization rules; 2) an ability to uniformly and adequately handle descriptors (i.e., variables, functions, and predicates) of different type (nominal, linear, and structured) and of different arity (i.e., different number of arguments); 3) an ability to generate new descriptors, which are derived from the initial descriptors through a rule-based system (i.e., an ability to conduct the so called constructive induction); 4) an ability to use the semantics underlying the problem under consideration. An experimental computer implementation of the method is briefly described and illustrated by an example."
