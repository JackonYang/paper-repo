Given a single training sample in which the user has marked which fields have to be extracted from a particular document class, a document model representing structural relationships among words is built. This model is incrementally refined as the system processes more and more documents from the same class. A reformulation of the tf-idf statistic scheme allows to adjust the importance weights of the structural relationships among words. We report in the experimental section our results obtained with a large dataset of real invoices."

We start with a graph-based representation of a set of key-fields selected by clients and perform graph mining in a document in order to learn them to produce a model. Such models are aimed to use to extract information content in the absence of clients. To avoid NP-hard general problem, our graph matching is based on relation assignment to see whether pairs of nodes are semantically identical. We have validated the concept by using a real-world industrial problem."

Regarding essentially the administrative paper flow with new and continuous arrivals, all the conventional techniques reserved to static databases modeling and recognition are doomed to failure. For this purpose, a new technique based on the experience was investigated giving very promising results. This technique is related to the case-based reasoning already used in data mining and various problems of machine learning. After the presentation of the context related to the administrative document flow and its requirements in a real time processing, we present a case based reasonning for invoice processing. The case corresponds to the co-existence of a problem and its solution. The problem in an invoice corresponds to a local structure such as the keywords of an address or the line patterns in the amounts table, while the solution is related to their content. This problem is then compared to a document case base using graph probing. For this purpose, we proposed an improvement of an already existing neural network called Incremental Growing Neural Gas."

We propose the Description and Modification of Segmentation (DMOS) method, which is made of a new grammatical language (Enhanced Position Formalism\u2014EPF) and an associated parser able to deal with noise. From an EPF description of a kind of document structure, a new recognition system is produced by compilation. This method has been successfully used to produce recognition systems on musical scores, mathematical formulae and even tennis courts in videos. This DMOS generic method separates knowledge from program. Therefore, for a same kind of document like table structures, it is possible to define with EPF, more or less specific descriptions to produce more or less specific recognition systems. For example, we have been able to produce a general recognition system of table structures. It can recognize the hierarchical organization \nof a table made with rulings, whatever the number/size of column/rows and the deep of the hierarchy contents in it, as soon as the document has a not too bad quality (no missing rulings for example). We will present the way the description is done using EPF to be general enough to recognize very different table organizations. With the same DMOS generic method, we have also been able to easily define a specific recognition system of the table structure of quite damaged military forms of the 19th century. This specific description was necessary to compensate some missing informations concerning the table structure of those military forms, due to a very bad quality or hidden part of the table. This system has been successfully validated on 88,745 images, showing that this DMOS generic method can be used at an industrial level."

In this kind of document, the extraction of some information fields cannot take place without having detected the corresponding instruction fields, which are only constrained to range in given domains. We propose modeling the document's layout by means of attributed relational graphs, which turn out to be very effective for form registration, as well as for performing a focused search for instruction fields. This search is carried out by means of a hybrid model, where proper algorithms, based on morphological operations and connected components, are integrated with connectionist models. Experimental results are given in order to assess the actual performance of the system."

In order to process electronically the contents of printed documents, information must be extracted from digital images of documents. When dealing with complex documents, in which the contents of different regions and fields can be highly heterogeneous with respect to layout, printing quality and the utilization of fonts and typing standards, the reconstruction of the contents of documents from digital images can be a difficult problem. In the present article we present an efficient solution for this problem, in which the semantic contents of fields in a complex document are extracted from a digital image."

Regions are first identified through a selection of their anchor points described by a constraint graph, illustrating their typographic aspects in the nodes, and their topographical relationships in the arcs. Then the identification of the actual anchor points is performed from a list of textual candidates, using the Arc Consistency Algorithm (AC4). Finally, some contextual heuristics are investigated for properly delimiting the regions. The originality of this approach lies mainly in the absence of a rigid a priori model, replaced by a simple and reliable association of anchor points. The constraint graph used for their description can be easily derived from a general logical definition of their content. Experimental results are overall encouraging and the methodology integration is under execution for commercialization."

In this paper, we propose the Blurred Shape Model to describe handwritten symbols, and the use of Adaboost in an Error Correcting Codes framework to deal with multi-class categorization handwriting problems. It is a robust approach tolerant to the distortions and variability typically found in handwritten documents. This approach has been evaluated with the public GREC2005 database and an architectural symbol database extracted from a sketching interface, reaching high recognition rates compared with the state-of-the-art approaches."
