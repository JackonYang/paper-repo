In this article, we investigate the relation between -SVM and C-SVM in detail. We show that in general they are two different problems with the same optimal solution set. Hence, we may expect that many numerical aspects of solving them are similar. However, compared to regular C-SVM, the formulation of -SVM is more complicated, so up to now there have been no effective methods for solving large-scale -SVM.

To develop such a technique, it was necessary to rst extract factors responsible for future generalization, to obtain bounds on generalization that depend on these factors, and lastly to develop a technique that constructively minimizes these bounds. The subject of this book are methods based on combining advanced branches of statistics and functional analysis, developing these theories into practical algorithms that perform better than existing heuristic approaches. The book provides a comprehensive analysis of what can be done using Support Vector Machines, achieving record results in real-life pattern recognition problems. In addition, it proposes a new form of nonlinear Principal Component Analysis using Support Vector kernel techniques, which I consider as the most natural and elegant way for generalization of classical Principal Component Analysis. In many ways the Support Vector machine became so popular thanks to works of Bernhard Schh olkopf. The work, submitted for the title of Doktor der Naturwis-senschaften, appears as excellent. It is a substantial contribution to Machine Learning technology."

The technique can be seen as a new training algorithm for Polynomial, Radial Basis Function and Multi-Layer Perceptron networks. SVMs are currently considered slower at run-time than other techniques with similar generalization performance. In this paper we focus on SVM for classiication and investigate the problem of reducing its run-time complexity. We present two relevant results: a) the use of SVM itself as a regression tool to approximate the decision surface with a user-speciied accuracy; and b) a reformulation of the training problem that yields the exact same decision surface using a smaller number of basis functions. We believe that this reformulation ooers great potential for future improvements of the technique. For most of the selected problems, both approaches give reductions of run-time in the 50-95% range, with no system degradation."

This finding opens up the possibility of compressing data bases significantly by disposing of the data which is not important for the solution of a given task. \n \nIn addition, we show that the theory allows us to predict the classifier that will have the best generalization ability, based solely on performance on the training set and characteristics of the learning machines.

They provide an explanation of the performance of state-of-the-art learning systems such as support vector machines (SVMs) and Adaboost. The difficulty with these bounds has been either their lack of robustness or their looseness. The question of whether the generalization of a classifier can be more tightly bounded in terms of a robust measure of the distribution of margin values has remained open for some time. The paper answers this open question in the affirmative and, furthermore, the analysis leads to bounds that motivate the previously heuristic soft margin SVM algorithms as well as justifying the use of the quadratic loss in neural network training algorithms. The results are extended to give bounds for the probability of failing to achieve a target accuracy in regression prediction, with a statistical analysis of ridge regression and Gaussian processes as a special case. The analysis presented in the paper has also lead to new boosting algorithms described elsewhere."

The general asymptotic convergence was first proposed by Chang et al. However, their working set selection does not coincide with existing implementation. A later breakthrough by Keerthi and Gilbert (2000, 2002) proved the convergence finite termination for practical cases while the size of the working set is restricted to two. In this paper, we prove the asymptotic convergence of the algorithm used by the software SVM(light) and other later implementation. The size of the working set can be any even number. Extensions to other SVM formulations are also discussed."

As well as making explicit some of the details on SRM, it provides a result that allows one to trade off errors on the training sample against improved generalization performance. It then considers the more general case when the hierarchy of classes is chosen in response to the data. A result is presented on the generalization performance of classifiers with a \"large margin\". This theoretically explains the impressive generalization performance of the maximal margin hyperplane algorithm of Vapnik and co-workers (which is the basis for their support vector machines). The paper concludes with a more general result in terms of \"luckiness\" functions, which provides a quite general way for exploiting serendipitous simplicity in observed data to obtain better prediction accuracy from small training sets. Four examples are given of such functions, including the Vapnik-Chervonenkis (1971) dimension measured on the sample."

We propose a method to approach this problem by trying to estimate a function f that is positive on S and negative on the complement. The functional form of f is given by a kernel expansion in terms of a potentially small subset of the training data; it is regularized by controlling the length of the weight vector in an associated feature space. The expansion coefficients are found by solving a quadratic programming problem, which we do by carrying out sequential optimization over pairs of input patterns. We also provide a theoretical analysis of the statistical performance of our algorithm. The algorithm is a natural extension of the support vector algorithm to the case of unlabeled data."

Adopting a regularization-theoretic framework, the above are formulated as constrained optimization problems. Previous approaches such as ridge regression, support vector methods, and regularization networks are included as special cases. We show connections between the cost function and some properties up to now believed to apply to support vector machines only. For appropriately chosen cost functions, the optimal solution of all the problems described above can be found by solving a simple quadratic programming problem."

In the RBF case, the SV algorithm automatically determines centers, weights, and threshold that minimize an upper bound on the expected test error. The present study is devoted to an experimental comparison of these machines with a classical approach, where the centers are determined by X-means clustering, and the weights are computed using error backpropagation. We consider three machines, namely, a classical RBF machine, an SV machine with Gaussian kernel, and a hybrid system with the centers determined by the SV method and the weights trained by error backpropagation. Our results show that on the United States postal service database of handwritten digits, the SV machine achieves the highest recognition accuracy, followed by the hybrid system. The SV approach is thus not only theoretically well-founded but also superior in a practical application."

We show that a slight generalization of their construction can be used to give a pac style bound on the tail of the distribution of the generalization errors that arise from a given sample size. Algorithms arising from the approach are related to those of Cortes and Vapnik. We generalise the basic result to function classes with bounded fat- shattering dimension and the 1-norm of the slack variables which gives rise to Vapnik's box constraint algorithm. We also extend the results to the regression case and obtain bounds on the probability that a randomly chosen test point will have error greater than a given value. The bounds apply to the $\\epsilon$-insensitive loss function proposed by Vapnik for Support Vector Machine regression. A special case of this bound gives a bound on the probabilities in terms of the least squares error on the training set showing a quadratic decline in probability with margin."

The proofs make use of a viewpoint that is apparently novel in the field of statistical learning theory. The hypothesis class is described in terms of a linear operator mapping from a possibly infinite-dimensional unit ball in feature space into a finite-dimensional space. The covering numbers of the class are then determined via the entropy numbers of the operator. These numbers, which characterize the degree of compactness of the operator can be bounded in terms of the eigenvalues of an integral operator induced by the kernel function used by the machine. As a consequence, we are able to theoretically explain the effect of the choice of kernel function on the generalization performance of support vector machines."

Results in this paper show that if a large neural network is used for a pattern classification problem and the learning algorithm finds a network with small weights that has small squared error on the training patterns, then the generalization performance depends on the size of the weights rather than the number of weights. For example, consider a two-layer feedforward network of sigmoid units, in which the sum of the magnitudes of the weights associated with each unit is bounded by A and the input dimension is n. We show that the misclassification probability is no more than a certain error estimate (that is related to squared error on the training set) plus A/sup 3/ /spl radic/((log n)/m) (ignoring log A and log m factors), where m is the number of training patterns. This may explain the generalization performance of neural networks, particularly when the number of training examples is considerably smaller than the number of weights. It also supports heuristics (such as weight decay and early stopping) that attempt to keep the weights small during training. The proof techniques appear to be useful for the analysis of other pattern classifiers: when the input domain is a totally bounded metric space, we use the same approach to give upper bounds on misclassification probability for classifiers with decision boundaries that are far from the training examples."

This gives more accurate control over the capacity of the learning machine (VCdimension). SVAD uses ideas from ANOVA decomposition methods and extends them to generate kernels which directly implement these ideas. SVAD is used with spline kernels and results show that SVAD performs better than the respective non ANOVA decomposition kernel. The Boston housing data set from UCI has been tested on Bagging [Bre94] and Support Vector methods before [DBK97] and these results are compared to the SVAD method."

Vapnik (1995) and a sparse approximation scheme that resembles the basis pursuit denoising algorithm (Chen, 1995; Chen, Donoho, & Saunders, 1995). SVM is a technique that can be derived from the structural risk minimization principle (Vapnik, 1982) and can be used to estimate the parameters of several different approximation schemes, including radial basis functions, algebraic and trigonometric polynomials, B-splines, and some forms of multilayer perceptrons. Basis pursuit denoising is a sparse approximation technique in which a function is reconstructed by using a small number of basis functions chosen from a large set (the dictionary). We show that if the data are noiseless, the modified version of basis pursuit denoising proposed in this article is equivalent to SVM in the following sense: if applied to the same data set, the two techniques give the same solution, which is obtained by solving the same quadratic programming problem. In the appendix, we present a derivation of the SVM technique in the framework of regularization theory, rather than statistical learning theory, establishing a connection between SVM, sparse approximation, and regularization theory."

First, SVMs map training data into a higher- (maybe infinite-) dimensional space. Currently primal and dual formulations of SVM are derived in the finite dimensional space and readily extend to the infinite-dimensional space. We rigorously discuss the primal-dual relation in the infinite-dimensional spaces. Second, SVM formulations contain penalty terms, which are different from unconstrained penalty functions in optimization. Traditionally unconstrained penalty functions approximate a constrained problem as the penalty parameter increases. We are interested in similar properties for SVM formulations.

This allows the use of tools such as regularization from the theory of (supervised) risk minimization for unsupervised learning. This setting turns out to be closely related to principal curves, the generative topographic map, and robust coding.We explore this connection in two ways: (1) we propose an algorithm for finding principal manifolds that can be regularized in a variety of ways; and (2) we derive uniform convergence bounds and hence bounds on the learning rates of the algorithm. In particular, we give bounds on the covering numbers which allows us to obtain nearly optimal learning rates for certain types of regularization operators. Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of the approach."

Since the introduction of a rather simple estimator by Gasser, Sroka & JennenSteinmetz (1986) other proposals have been made. Here the one given by Hall, Kay & Titterington (1990) is of particular interest. It minimizes the asymptotic variance. Unfortunately it has severe problems with finite sample bias, and the estimator of Gasser et al. (1986) proves still to be a good choice. A new estimator is introduced, compromising between bias and variance."

This process can be viewed formally as statistical estimation of the parameters of a parametrized probability model. We exploit this formal viewpoint to give a unified theory of learng in artificial neural networks. The theory encompasses both supervised and unsupervised learning in either feedforward or recurrent networks. We begin by describing various objects appropriate for learning, such as conditional means, variances or quantiles, or conditional densities. We then show how artificial neural networks can be viewed as parametric statistical models directed toward these objects of interest. We show how a probability density can be associated with the output of any network, and use this density to define network weights indexing an information-theoretically optimal approximation to the object of interest. We next study statistical properties of quasi-maximum likelihood estimators consistent for the optimal weights, including issues associated with statistical inference about the optimal weights. Finally, we consider computational methods for obtaining these estimators, with special attention to extensions of the method of back-propagation."
