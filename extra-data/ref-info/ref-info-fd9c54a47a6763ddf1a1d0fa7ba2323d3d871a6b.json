A fundamental problem in computing such descriptions is scale: a derivative must be taken over some neighborhood, but there is seldom a principled basis for choosing its size. Scale-space filtering is a method that describes signals qualitatively, managing the ambiguity of scale in an organized and natural way. The signal is first expanded by convolution with gaussian masks over a continuum of sizes. This \"scale-space\" image is then collapsed, using its qualitative structure, into a tree providing a concise but complete qualitative description covering all scales of observation. The description is further refined by applying a stability criterion, to identify events that persist of large changes in scale."

Exceptions are signals that are antisymmetric about all their zeros (for instance infinitely periodic gratings). Our proof provides a method for reconstructing almost all signals from knowledge of how the zero-crossing contours of the signal, filtered by a gaussian filter, change with the size of the filter. The proof assumes that the filtered signal can be represented as a polynomial of finite, albeit possibly very high, order. The result applies to zero- and level-crossings of signals filtered by gaussian filters. The theorem is extended to two dimensions, that is to images. These results imply that extrema (for instance of derivatives) at different scales are a complete representation of a signal."

The technique involves generating a multiscale description of a histogram by convolving it with a series of Gaussians of gradually increasing width (standard deviation), and marking the location and direction of the sign change of zero-crossings in the second derivative. The resulting description, or fingerprint, is interpreted by relating pairs of zero-crossings to modes in the histogram where each mode or component is modeled by a normal distribution. Zero-crossings provide information from which estimates of the mixture parameters are computed. These initial estimates are subsequently refined using an iterative maximum likelihood estimation technique. Varying the scale or resolution of the analysis allows the number of components used in approximating the histogram to be controlled."

                "text": "A theory of edge detection is presented. The analysis proceeds in two parts. (1) Intensity changes, which occur in a natural image over a wide range of scales, are detected separately at different scales. An appropriate filter for this purpose at a given scale is found to be the second derivative of a Gaussian, and it is shown that, provided some simple conditions are satisfied, these primary filters need not be orientation-dependent. Thus, intensity changes at a given scale are best detected by finding the zero values of \u22072G(x, y)* I(x, y) for image I, where G(x, y) is a two-dimensional Gaussian distribution and \u22072 is the Laplacian. The intensity changes thus discovered in each of the channels are then represented by oriented primitives called zero-crossing segments, and evidence is given that this representation is complete. (2) Intensity changes in images arise from surface discontinuities or from reflectance or illumination boundaries, and these all have the property that they are spatially localized. Because of this, the zero-crossing segments from the different channels are not independent, and rules are deduced for combining them into a description of the image. This description is called the raw primal sketch. The theory explains several basic psychophysical findings, and the operation of forming oriented zero-crossing segments from the output of centre-surround \u22072G filters acting on the image forms the basis for a physiological model of simple cells (see Marr & Ullman 1979)."

We call the representation the Curvature Primal Sketch because of the close analogy to the primal sketch representation advocated by Marr for describing significant intensity changes. We define a set of primitive parameterized curvature discontinuities, and derive expressions for their convolutions with the first and second derivatives of a Gaussian. We describe an implemented algorithm that computes the Curvature Primal Sketch by matching the multiscale convolutions of a shape, and illustrate its performance on a set of tool shapes. Several applications of the representation are sketched."
