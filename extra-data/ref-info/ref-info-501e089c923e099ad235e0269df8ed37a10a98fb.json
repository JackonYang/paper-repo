While some existing methods for multiresolution registration do consider the way the resolution (scale) affects the image, they often consider the image one scale at a time, using geometric properties within that scale. Others use multiscale information, usually to produce more robust results, but only to register same-magnification images (e.g., stereo). A scale trace is the set of values that a single pixel takes on as magnification decreases and the effective point specifications corresponding increases. As such, scale traces capture information across multiple scales. This paper presents a method that uses correlation of scale traces through multiresolution images to find correspondences between images of the same scene at differing magnifications. Because the method relies solely on the multiscale properties of the images themselves and not on spatial correspondence, it is less sensitive to discrete sampling of potential scale factors. Sample results demonstrate that the method is able to accurately identify both the relative position and relative magnification (scale) of the two images."

The problem of scene matching is common to many applications in machine vision including registration, motion detection, and stereo vision. Scene matching by feature correlation can solve this problem but suffers from computational expense and failure in highly textured images. Hierarchical correlation provides both a cheaper matching algorithm and a coarse-to-fine matching strategy that overcomes textural problems by matching on gross image structures first. These methods fit naturally into the processing cone or pyramid architectures that have been proposed for image processing. Presented is a discussion of the architecture of the processing cone, the construction of image pyramids, and the use of these pyramids in hierarchical correlation. A set of experiments illustrates the operation of these ideas."

The features are invariant to image scaling, translation, and rotation, and partially invariant to illumination changes and affine or 3D projection. These features share similar properties with neurons in inferior temporal cortex that are used for object recognition in primate vision. Features are efficiently detected through a staged filtering approach that identifies stable points in scale space. Image keys are created that allow for local geometric deformations by representing blurred image gradients in multiple orientation planes and at multiple scales. The keys are used as input to a nearest neighbor indexing method that identifies candidate object matches. Final verification of each match is achieved by finding a low residual least squares solution for the unknown model parameters. Experimental results show that robust object recognition can be achieved in cluttered partially occluded images with a computation time of under 2 seconds."

The method consists of extracting local image structures and matching similar such structures between two images. Linear edge segments are extracted from both the left and right images. Each segment is characterized by its position and orientation in the image as well as its relationships with the nearby segments. A relational graph is thus built from each image. For each segment in one image as set of potential assignments is represented as a set of nodes in a correspondence graph. Arcs in the graph represent compatible assignments established on the basis of segment relationships. Stereo matching becomes equivalent to searching for sets of mutually compatible nodes in this graph. Sets are found by looking for maximal cliques. The maximal clique best suited to represent a stereo correspondence is selected using a benefit function. Numerous results obtained with this method are shown. >"

The only assumption is that there are some locally planar and unoccluded scene regions that have enough structure to be detected in the image. Those regions are classified by a set of illumination and viewpoint invariant features. The features represent the image in a very compact way and allow fast comparison and feature matching between quite different viewpoints. The matching procedure is embedded in a visual servoing system for a mobile robot. Experiments show its potential for navigation with large camera rotations and view point changes in a cluttered environment without the need for artificial landmarks."

Two extensions are made to the current small baseline algorithms: first, and most importantly, a viewpoint invariant measure is developed for assessing the affinity of corner neighbourhoods over image pairs; second, algorithms are given for generating putative corner matches between image pairs using local homographies. Two novel infrastructure developments are also described: the automatic generation of local homographies, and the combination of possibly conflicting sets of matches prior to RANSAC estimation. The wide baseline matching algorithm is demonstrated on a number of image pairs with varying relative motion, and for different scene types. All processing is automatic."

For example, we desire to obtain an understanding of natural scenes, containing roads, buildings, trees, bushes, etc., as typified by the two frames from a sequence illustrated in Figure 1. The solution to this problem that we are pursuing is to use a computer vision system based upon motion analysis of a monocular image sequence from a mobile camera. By extraction and tracking of image features, representations of the 3D analogues of these features can be constructed."

Using real stereo and video test sets, we compared the A* method to both template and hill climbing. Our results show that A* has greater accuracy than the ubiquitous coarse-to-fine hill climbing pyramidal search algorithm in both stereo matching and motion tracking."

RANSAC is capable of interpreting/smoothing data containing a significant percentage of gross errors, and is thus ideally suited for applications in automated image analysis where interpretation is based on the data provided by error-prone feature detectors. A major portion of this paper describes the application of RANSAC to the Location Determination Problem (LDP): Given an image depicting a set of landmarks with known locations, determine that point in space from which the image was obtained. In response to a RANSAC requirement, new results are derived on the minimum number of landmarks needed to obtain a solution, and algorithms are presented for computing these minimum-landmark solutions in closed form. These results provide the basis for an automatic system that can solve the LDP under difficult viewing"

Moreover, such a collineation may well be viewed as a point transfer method between two image pairs with applications to visually guided robot control. Despite this potential, methods for properly estimating such a projective transformation have received little attention in the past. In this paper we describe linear, nonlinear, and robust methods for estimating this transformation. We test the numerical stability of these methods with respect to image noise, to the number of matched points, and as a function of the number of outliers. Finally, we devise a specialized technique for the case where 3D Euclidean coordinates are provided for a number of control points."

This paper shows that interest points are geometrically stable under different transformations and have high information content (distinctiveness). These two properties make interest points very successful in the contest of image matching. To measure these two properties quantitatively, we introduce two evaluation criteria: repeatability rate and information content. The quality of the interest points depends on the detector used. In this paper several detectors are compared according to the criteria specified above. We determine which detector gives the best results and show that it satisfies the criteria well."
