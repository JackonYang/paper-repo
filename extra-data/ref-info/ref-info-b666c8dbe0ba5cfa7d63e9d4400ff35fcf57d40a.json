More specifically, one is dealing with scenes composed of planar faced, convex objects. Extensions to the general planar faced case are discussed. The visual input is provided by a TV-camera, and the problem is to interpret that input by computer, as a projection of a three-dimensional scene. The system proposed and demonstrated in this paper uses perspectively consistent two-dimensional models (prototypes) of views of three-dimensional objects, and interpretations of scene-representations are based on the establishment of mapping relationships from conglomerates of scene-elements (line-constellations) to prototypes templates. The prototypes are learned by the program through analysis of - and generalization on - ideal instances."

Emphasis is given to a method for extracting useful features from the scene data for complex industrial parts so that accurate recognition of them is possible. The proposed method has the following features: 1) simple features are detected first in the scene and more complex features are examined later, using the locations of the previously found features; 2) the system is provided with a high-level supervisor that analyzes the current information obtained from the scene and structural models of various objects, and proposes the feartures to be examined next for recognizing the objects in the scene; 3) the supervisor has problem-solving capabilities to select the most promising feature among many others; 4) the structural models are used to suggest the locations of the features to be examined; and 5) several sophisticated feature extractors are used to detect the complex features. An effort is also made to make the system versatile so that it can be readily applied to a variety of different industrial parts. The proposed system has been tested on several sets of parts for small industrial gasoline engines and the results were satisfactory."

The goal is to study algorithms which find the real straight edges in the scenes, taking into account smooth variations in intensity over the faces of the solids, blurring of edges and noise. A general mathematical analysis is made of optimal methods of identifying the edge lines in figures, given a raster of intensities covering the entire field of view. There is given in addition a suboptimal statistical decision procedure, based on the model, for the identification of a line within a narrow band on the field of view given an array of intensities from within the band. A computer program has been written and extensively tested which implements this procedure and extracts lines from real scenes. Other programs were written which judge the completeness of extracted sets of lines, and propose and text for additional lines which had escaped initial detection. The performance of these programs is discussed in relation to the theory derived from the model, and with regard to their use of global information in detecting and proposing lines."

The module (1), (2) and (3) interact with each other through a simple supervisor so that the system can locate given objects quickly-First, most reliable edges a refound and segmented, and then recognition ir. attempted using segmented lines. If recognition is not successful, less reliable edges are searched for, arid recognition is retried. An example of locating a lamp, a book stand and a telephone is shown."

Initially the photograph is subjected to a nonlinear transformation which is based on an edge detection operator by Hueckel. The gray-value variations of a photograph are transformed into short vectors (strokes), which are arranged in a two-dimensional array that has substantially fewer entries than the original image array. The display of a stroke array provides \"outline\" information that is highly intelligible to the human eye. Using graph searching techniques, strokes are assembled into structures called streaks. Streaks are digital curves which exhibit cellular as well as polygonal properties. The representation of streaks as well as other data can be marked directly in the stroke array, thus making the array usable as an associative memory. This greatly facilitates further processing."

Development of these clustering algorithms was based on examples from two-dimensional space because we wanted to copy the human perception of gestalts or point groupings. On the other hand, all the methods considered apply to higher dimensional spaces and even to general metric spaces. Advantages of these methods include determinacy, easy interpretation of the resulting clusters, conformity to gestalt principles of perceptual organization, and invariance of results under monotone transformations of interpoint distance. Brief discussion is made of the application of cluster detection to taxonomy and the selection of good feature spaces for pattern recognition. Detailed analyses of several planar cluster detection problems are illustrated by text and figures. The well-known Fisher iris data, in four-dimensional space, have been analyzed by these methods also. PL/1 programs to implement the minimal spanning tree methods have been fully debugged."
