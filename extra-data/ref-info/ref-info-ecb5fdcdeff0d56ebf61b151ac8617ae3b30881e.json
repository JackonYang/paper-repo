Following the initial binarization and deskewing operations, the image is scanned to extract all horizontal and vertical lines that are present. The table's dimensions are estimated based on these lines. Unlike other systems, the procedure described does not depend on the sole existence of lines to mark the item blocks. White streams are recognized in both the horizontal and vertical direction as substitutes for any missing demarcation lines. A structure interpretation procedure uses the extracted demarcation information to identify each of the item blocks in the table. Subsequently, the interrelations of these item blocks are used to recognize the structure of the tabulated data.<<ETX>>"

Although Y. Nakano et al. (1986) looked upon the recognition of multi-kinds of table-form documents as an important subject from a practical point of view, they could not report any successful approach because their knowledge was based only on the physical coordinate data. In the approach presented, this recognition issue was solved, using both the classification tree based on the physical characteristics and the structure description tree based on the logical characteristics. At least, it is not so difficult to classify various kinds of documents into appropriate document classes since table-form documents are well designed on the basis of vertical and horizontal line segments. However, it is not easy in the case of the other documents because the geometric and spatial characteristics of documents are not well specified. It is necessary to investigate the application techniques for the other documents from the viewpoint of the knowledge representation.<<ETX>>"
