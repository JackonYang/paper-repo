The units of translation are blocks - pairs of phrases. During decoding, we use a block unigram model and a word-based trigram language model. During training, the blocks are learned from source interval projections using an underlying word alignment. We show experimental results on block selection criteria based on unigram counts and phrase length."

The statistical translation approach uses two types of information: a translation model and a language model. The language model used is a bigram or general m-gram model. The translation model is decomposed into a lexical and an alignment model. We describe two different approaches for statistical translation and present experimental results. The first approach is based on dependencies between single words, the second approach explicitly takes shallow phrase structures into account, using two different alignment levels: a phrase level alignment between phrases and a word level alignment between single words. We present results using the Verbmobil task (German-English, 6000word vocabulary) which is a limited-domain spoken-language task. The experimental tests were performed on both the text transcription and the speech recognizer output. 1 S t a t i s t i c a l M a c h i n e T r a n s l a t i o n The goal of machine translation is the translation of a text given in some source language into a target language.

Our results show that an automatically derived translation memory can be used within a statistical framework to often find translations of higher probability than those found using solely a statistical model. The translations produced using both the translation memory and the statistical model are significantly better than translations produced by two commercial systems: our hybrid system translated perfectly 58% of the 505 sentences in a test collection, while the commercial systems translated perfectly only 40-42% of them."

We define a concept of word-by-word alignment between such pairs of sentences. For any given pair of such sentences each of our models assigns a probability to each of the possible word-by-word alignments. We give an algorithm for seeking the most probable of these alignments. Although the algorithm is suboptimal, the alignment thus obtained accounts well for the word-by-word relationships in the pair of sentences. We have a great deal of data in French and English from the proceedings of the Canadian Parliament. Accordingly, we have restricted our work to these two languages; but we feel that because our algorithms have minimal linguistic content they would work well on other pairs of languages. We also feel, again because of the minimal linguistic content of our algorithms, that it is reasonable to argue that word-by-word alignments are inherent in any sufficiently large bilingual corpus."

The decoder's job is to find the translation that is most likely according to set of previously learned parameters (and a formula for combining them). Since the space of possible translations is extremely large, typical decoding algorithms are only able to examine a portion of it, thus risking to miss good solutions. In this paper, we compare the speed and output quality of a traditional stack-based decoding algorithm with two new decoders: a fast greedy decoder and a slow but optimal decoder that treats decoding as an integer-programming optimization problem."

                "text": "The translation of a text can be viewed as a detailed annotation of the text's meaning. From this point of view, texts that exist in two languages (bitexts) are the richest accessible source of linguistic knowledge. Such knowledge can be exploited in many ways, if it can be automatically acquired. The acquisition process is invariably based on automatic methods for inducing translational equivalence relations between the two halves of a bitext. At the word token level, these relations are called bitext maps; at the word type level, they are called translation models. This dissertation advances the state of the art in methods for determining both kinds of translational equivalence. It also shows how to integrate these methods to exploit a much wider variety of bitexts than was previously possible. \nThe dissertation begins by showing that the language-specific aspects of the bitext mapping problem can be encapsulated and modularized away, leaving only a problem of geometric pattern recognition. The best solution is then the one that maximizes the signal-to-noise ratio in the search space and employs the fastest and most accurate search algorithm. The dissertation presents new methods for maximizing the signal strength, for filtering noise, and for searching the resulting scatterplot in linear expected space and time. The unprecedented accuracy of this solution enables a new application of bitext maps--automatic detection of omissions in translations. \nThe second half of the dissertation makes a number of advances in statistical translation modeling. First, it proves the feasibility of modeling translational equivalence independently of word order. Second, the dissertation shows why and how translation models can benefit from an explicit noise model. Third, it shows how the noise model can be conditioned on almost any kind of pre-existing language-specific knowledge, and that even simple linguistic clues can significantly improve translation model accuracy. Fourth, the dissertation shows how to automatically determine the sense inventories of words in bitext and how to automatically discover word sequences that are translated as a unit. This information enables translation models that account for polysemy and for phrasal translations."
