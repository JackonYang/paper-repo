It directly models the probability distribution of generating a word given previous words and the image. Image descriptions are generated by sampling from this distribution. The model consists of two sub-networks: a deep recurrent neural network for sentences and a deep convolutional network for images. These two sub-networks interact with each other in a multimodal layer to form the whole m-RNN model. The effectiveness of our model is validated on three benchmark datasets (IAPR TC-12, Flickr 8K, and Flickr 30K). Our model outperforms the state-of-the-art generative method. In addition, the m-RNN model can be applied to retrieval tasks for retrieving images or sentences, and achieves significant performance improvement over the state-of-the-art methods which directly optimize the ranking objective function for retrieval."

In analogy to image search, we propose to frame sentence-based image annotation as the task of ranking a given pool of captions. We introduce a new benchmark collection for sentence-based image description and search, consisting of 8,000 images that are each paired with five different captions which provide clear descriptions of the salient entities and events. We introduce a number of systems that perform quite well on this task, even though they are only based on features that can be obtained with minimal supervision. Our results clearly indicate the importance of training on multiple captions per image, and of capturing syntactic (word order-based) and semantic features of these captions. We also perform an in-depth comparison of human and automatic evaluation metrics for this task, and propose strategies for collecting human judgments cheaply and on a very large scale, allowing us to augment our collection with additional relevance judgments of which captions describe which image. Our analysis shows that metrics that consider the ranked list of results for each query image or sentence are significantly more robust than metrics that are based on a single response per query. Moreover, our study suggests that the evaluation of ranking-based image description systems may be fully automated."

We then introduce a structured max-margin objective that allows our model to explicitly associate these fragments across modalities. Extensive experimental evaluation shows that reasoning on both the global level of images and sentences and the finer level of their respective fragments improves performance on image-sentence retrieval tasks. Additionally, our model provides interpretable predictions for the image-sentence retrieval task since the inferred inter-modal alignment of fragments is explicit."

Previous attempts for this task mostly rely on visual clues and corpus statistics, but do not take much advantage of the semantic information inherent in the available image descriptions. Here, we present a generic method which benefits from all these three sources (i.e. visual clues, corpus statistics and available descriptions) simultaneously, and is capable of constructing novel descriptions. Our approach works on syntactically and linguistically motivated phrases extracted from the human descriptions. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our formulation mostly generates lucid and semantically correct descriptions, and significantly outperforms the previous methods on automatic evaluation metrics. One of the significant advantages of our approach is that we can generate multiple interesting descriptions for an image. Unlike any previous work, we also test the applicability of our method on a large dataset containing complex images with rich descriptions.\n \n"

However, the sentence vectors of previous models cannot accurately represent visually grounded meaning. We introduce the DT-RNN model which uses dependency trees to embed sentences into a vector space in order to retrieve images that are described by those sentences. Unlike previous RNN-based models which use constituency trees, DT-RNNs naturally focus on the action and agents in a sentence. They are better able to abstract from the details of word order and syntactic expression. DT-RNNs outperform other recursive and recurrent neural networks, kernelized CCA and a bag-of-words baseline on the tasks of finding an image that fits a sentence description and vice versa. They also give more similar representations to sentences that describe the same image."

This limitation is in part due to the increasing difficulty of acquiring sufficient training data in the form of labeled images as the number of object categories grows. One remedy is to leverage data from other sources - such as text data - both to train visual models and to constrain their predictions. In this paper we present a new deep visual-semantic embedding model trained to identify visual objects using both labeled image data as well as semantic information gleaned from unannotated text. We demonstrate that this model matches state-of-the-art performance on the 1000-class ImageNet object recognition challenge while making more semantically reasonable errors, and also show that the semantic information can be exploited to make predictions about tens of thousands of image labels not observed during training. Semantic knowledge improves such zero-shot predictions achieving hit rates of up to 18% across thousands of novel labels never seen by the visual model."

The input are initial noisy estimates of the objects and scenes detected in the image using state of the art trained detectors. As predicting actions from still images directly is unreliable, we use a language model trained from the English Gigaword corpus to obtain their estimates; together with probabilities of co-located nouns, scenes and prepositions. We use these estimates as parameters on a HMM that models the sentence generation process, with hidden nodes as sentence components and image detections as the emissions. Experimental results show that our strategy of combining vision and language produces readable and descriptive sentences compared to naive strategies that use vision alone."

An image-text multimodal neural language model can be used to retrieve images given complex sentence queries, retrieve phrase descriptions given image queries, as well as generate text conditioned on images. We show that in the case of image-text modelling we can jointly learn word representations and image features by training our models together with a convolutional network. Unlike many of the existing methods, our approach can generate sentence descriptions for images without the use of templates, structured prediction, and/or syntactic trees. While we focus on imagetext modelling, our algorithms can be easily applied to other modalities such as audio."

We cast the generation process as constraint optimization problems, collectively incorporating multiple interconnected aspects of language composition for content planning, surface realization and discourse structure. Evaluation by human annotators indicates that our final system generates more semantically correct and linguistically appealing descriptions than two nontrivial baselines."

                "text": "In this paper, we present an image parsing to text description (I2T) framework that generates text descriptions of image and video content based on image understanding. The proposed I2T framework follows three steps: 1) input images (or video frames) are decomposed into their constituent visual patterns by an image parsing engine, in a spirit similar to parsing sentences in natural language; 2) the image parsing results are converted into semantic representation in the form of Web ontology language (OWL), which enables seamless integration with general knowledge bases; and 3) a text generation engine converts the results from previous steps into semantically meaningful, human readable, and query-able text reports. The centerpiece of the I2T framework is an and-or graph (AoG) visual knowledge representation, which provides a graphical representation serving as prior knowledge for representing diverse visual patterns and provides top-down hypotheses during the image parsing. The AoG embodies vocabularies of visual elements including primitives, parts, objects, scenes as well as a stochastic image grammar that specifies syntactic relations (i.e., compositional) and semantic relations (e.g., categorical, spatial, temporal, and functional) between these visual elements. Therefore, the AoG is a unified model of both categorical and symbolic representations of visual knowledge. The proposed I2T framework has two objectives. First, we use semiautomatic method to parse images from the Internet in order to build an AoG for visual knowledge representation. Our goal is to make the parsing process more and more automatic using the learned AoG model. Second, we use automatic methods to parse image/video in specific domains and generate text reports that are useful for real-world applications. In the case studies at the end of this paper, we demonstrate two automatic I2T systems: a maritime and urban scene video surveillance system and a real-time automatic driving scene understanding system."

We describe a system that can compute a score linking an image to a sentence. This score can be used to attach a descriptive sentence to a given image, or to obtain images that illustrate a given sentence. The score is obtained by comparing an estimate of meaning obtained from the image to one obtained from the sentence. Each estimate of meaning comes from a discriminative procedure that is learned us-ingdata. We evaluate on a novel dataset consisting of human-annotated images. While our underlying estimate of meaning is impoverished, it is sufficient to produce very good quantitative results, evaluated with a novel score that can account for synecdoche."

The evaluation of computer-generated text is a notoriously difficult problem, however, the quality of image descriptions has typically been measured using unigram BLEU and human judgements. The focus of this paper is to determine the correlation of automatic measures with human judgements for this task. We estimate the correlation of unigram and Smoothed BLEU, TER, ROUGE-SU4, and Meteor against human judgements on two data sets. The main finding is that unigram BLEU has a weak correlation, and Meteor has the strongest correlation with human judgements."

The semantic meaning of images depends on the presence of objects, their attributes and their relations to other objects. But precisely characterizing this dependence requires extracting complex visual information from an image, which is in general a difficult and yet unsolved problem. In this paper, we propose studying semantic information in abstract images created from collections of clip art. Abstract images provide several advantages. They allow for the direct study of how to infer high-level semantic information, since they remove the reliance on noisy low-level object, attribute and relation detectors, or the tedious hand-labeling of images. Importantly, abstract images also allow the ability to generate sets of semantically similar scenes. Finding analogous sets of semantically similar real images would be nearly impossible. We create 1,002 sets of 10 semantically similar abstract scenes with corresponding written descriptions. We thoroughly analyze this dataset to discover semantically important features, the relations of words to visual features and methods for measuring semantic similarity."

We are interested in learning such embeddings from hundreds of thousands or millions of examples. Unfortunately, it is prohibitively expensive to fully annotate this many training images with ground-truth sentences. Instead, we ask whether we can learn better image-sentence embeddings by augmenting small fully annotated training sets with millions of images that have weak and noisy annotations (titles, tags, or descriptions). After investigating several state-of-the-art scalable embedding methods, we introduce a new algorithm called Stacked Auxiliary Embedding that can successfully transfer knowledge from millions of weakly annotated images to improve the accuracy of retrieval-based image description."

The potential benefit from this source is made more significant due to the enormous amount of language data easily available today. We present a system to automatically generate natural language descriptions from images that exploits both statistics gleaned from parsing large quantities of text data and recognition algorithms from computer vision. The system is very effective at producing relevant sentences for images. It also generates descriptions that are notably more true to the specific image content than previous work."

In this paper, we improve their performance by providing a contextual real-valued input vector in association with each word. This vector is used to convey contextual information about the sentence being modeled. By performing Latent Dirichlet Allocation using a block of preceding text, we achieve a topic-conditioned RNNLM. This approach has the key advantage of avoiding the data fragmentation associated with building multiple topic models on different data subsets. We report perplexity results on the Penn Treebank data, where we achieve a new state-of-the-art. We further apply the model to the Wall Street Journal speech recognition task, where we observe improvements in word-error-rate."

Fortunately, recent advances in Hessian-free optimization have been able to overcome the difficulties associated with training RNNs, making it possible to apply them successfully to challenging sequence problems. In this paper we demonstrate the power of RNNs trained with the new Hessian-Free optimizer (HF) by applying them to character-level language modeling tasks. The standard RNN architecture, while effective, is not ideally suited for such tasks, so we introduce a new RNN variant that uses multiplicative (or \"gated\") connections which allow the current input character to determine the transition matrix from one hidden state vector to the next. After training the multiplicative RNN with the HF optimizer for five days on 8 high-end Graphics Processing Units, we were able to surpass the performance of the best previous single method for character-level language modeling \u2013 a hierarchical non-parametric sequence model. To our knowledge this represents the largest recurrent neural network application to date."

The best-performing methods are complex ensemble systems that typically combine multiple low-level image features with high-level context. In this paper, we propose a simple and scalable detection algorithm that improves mean average precision (mAP) by more than 30% relative to the previous best result on VOC 2012 -- achieving a mAP of 53.3%. Our approach combines two key insights: (1) one can apply high-capacity convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to bottom-up region proposals in order to localize and segment objects and (2) when labeled training data is scarce, supervised pre-training for an auxiliary task, followed by domain-specific fine-tuning, yields a significant performance boost. Since we combine region proposals with CNNs, we call our method R-CNN: Regions with CNN features. We also present experiments that provide insight into what the network learns, revealing a rich hierarchy of image features. Source code for the complete system is available at http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~rbg/rcnn."

                "text": "A central goal of statistical language modeling is to learn the joint probability function of sequences of words in a language. This is intrinsically difficult because of the curse of dimensionality: a word sequence on which the model will be tested is likely to be different from all the word sequences seen during training. Traditional but very successful approaches based on n-grams obtain generalization by concatenating very short overlapping sequences seen in the training set. We propose to fight the curse of dimensionality by learning a distributed representation for words which allows each training sentence to inform the model about an exponential number of semantically neighboring sentences. Generalization is obtained because a sequence of words that has never been seen before gets high probability if it is made of words that are similar (in the sense of having a nearby representation) to words forming an already seen sentence. Training such large models (with millions of parameters) within a reasonable time is itself a significant challenge. We report on several methods to speed-up both training and probability computation, as well as comparative experiments to evaluate the improvements brought by these techniques. We finally describe the incorporation of this new language model into a state-of-the-art speech recognizer of conversational speech."

This is achieved by gathering images of complex everyday scenes containing common objects in their natural context. Objects are labeled using per-instance segmentations to aid in precise object localization. Our dataset contains photos of 91 objects types that would be easily recognizable by a 4 year old. With a total of 2.5 million labeled instances in 328k images, the creation of our dataset drew upon extensive crowd worker involvement via novel user interfaces for category detection, instance spotting and instance segmentation. We present a detailed statistical analysis of the dataset in comparison to PASCAL, ImageNet, and SUN. Finally, we provide baseline performance analysis for bounding box and segmentation detection results using a Deformable Parts Model."

However, MTurk offers only limited control over who is allowed to particpate in a particular task. This is particularly problematic for tasks requiring free-form text entry. Unlike multiple-choice tasks there is no correct answer, and therefore control items for which the correct answer is known cannot be used. Furthermore, MTurk has no effective built-in mechanism to guarantee workers are proficient English writers. We describe our experience in creating corpora of images annotated with multiple one-sentence descriptions on MTurk and explore the effectiveness of different quality control strategies for collecting linguistic data using Mechanical MTurk. We find that the use of a qualification test provides the highest improvement of quality, whereas refining the annotations through follow-up tasks works rather poorly. Using our best setup, we construct two image corpora, totaling more than 40,000 descriptive captions for 9000 images."

One approach is to represent time implicitly by its effects on processing rather than explicitly (as in a spatial representation). The current report develops a proposal along these lines first described by Jordan (1986) which involves the use of recurrent links in order to provide networks with a dynamic memory. In this approach, hidden unit patterns are fed back to themselves; the internal representations which develop thus reflect task demands in the context of prior internal states. A set of simulations is reported which range from relatively simple problems (temporal version of XOR) to discovering syntactic/semantic features for words. The networks are able to learn interesting internal representations which incorporate task demands with memory demands; indeed, in this approach the notion of memory is inextricably bound up with task processing. These representations reveal a rich structure, which allows them to be highly context-dependent while also expressing generalizations across classes of items. These representations suggest a method for representing lexical categories and the type/token distinction."

Unigrams can be matched based on their surface forms, stemmed forms, and meanings; furthermore, METEOR can be easily extended to include more advanced matching strategies. Once all generalized unigram matches between the two strings have been found, METEOR computes a score for this matching using a combination of unigram-precision, unigram-recall, and a measure of fragmentation that is designed to directly capture how well-ordered the matched words in the machine translation are in relation to the reference. We evaluate METEOR by measuring the correlation between the metric scores and human judgments of translation quality. We compute the Pearson R correlation value between its scores and human quality assessments of the LDC TIDES 2003 Arabic-to-English and Chinese-to-English datasets. We perform segment-bysegment correlation, and show that METEOR gets an R correlation value of 0.347 on the Arabic data and 0.331 on the Chinese data. This is shown to be an improvement on using simply unigramprecision, unigram-recall and their harmonic F1 combination. We also perform experiments to show the relative contributions of the various mapping modules."

We introduce and motivate a new training principle for unsupervised learning of a representation based on the idea of making the learned representations robust to partial corruption of the input pattern. This approach can be used to train autoencoders, and these denoising autoencoders can be stacked to initialize deep architectures. The algorithm can be motivated from a manifold learning and information theoretic perspective or from a generative model perspective. Comparative experiments clearly show the surprising advantage of corrupting the input of autoencoders on a pattern classification benchmark suite."

However, practical difficulties have been reported in training recurrent neural networks to perform tasks in which the temporal contingencies present in the input/output sequences span long intervals. We show why gradient based learning algorithms face an increasingly difficult problem as the duration of the dependencies to be captured increases. These results expose a trade-off between efficient learning by gradient descent and latching on information for long periods. Based on an understanding of this problem, alternatives to standard gradient descent are considered."

Results indicate that it is possible to obtain around 50% reduction of perplexity by using mixture of several RNN LMs, compared to a state of the art backoff language model. Speech recognition experiments show around 18% reduction of word error rate on the Wall Street Journal task when comparing models trained on the same amount of data, and around 5% on the much harder NIST RT05 task, even when the backoff model is trained on much more data than the RNN LM. We provide ample empirical evidence to suggest that connectionist language models are superior to standard n-gram techniques, except their high computational (training) complexity.

We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O. 1. Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms."

Here we use a series of simulation experiments to investigate the power and properties of this algorithm. In the recurrent networks studied here, any unit can be connected to any other, and any unit can receive external input. These networks run continually in the sense that they sample their inputs on every update cycle, and any unit can have a training target on any cycle. The storage required and computation time on each step are independent of time and are completely determined by the size of the network, so no prior knowledge of the temporal structure of the task being learned is required. The algorithm is nonlocal in the sense that each unit must have knowledge of the complete recurrent weight matrix and error vector. The algorithm is computationally intensive in sequential computers, requiring a storage capacity of the order of the thi..."
