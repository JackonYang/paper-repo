Existing recognition-free approaches such as word-spotting cannot scale to arbitrarily large vocabulary and document image collections. In this paper we put forth a framework that overcomes three issues of word-spotting: i) retrieving word images not labeled during indexing, ii) allow for query and retrieval of morphological variations of words and iii) scale the retrieval to large collections. We propose a character n-gram spotting framework, where word-images are considered as a bag of visual n-grams. The character n-grams are represented in a visual-feature space and indexed for quick retrieval. In the retrieval phase, the query word is expanded to its constituent n-grams, which are used to query the previously built index. A ranking mechanism is proposed that combines the retrieval results from the multiple lists corresponding to each n-gram. The approach is demonstrated on a size-able collection of English and Malayalam books. With a mean AP of 0.64, the performance of the retrieval system was found to be very promising."

                "text": "Text categorization is a fundamental task in document processing, allowing the automated handling of enormous streams of documents in electronic form. One difficulty in handling some classes of documents is the presence of different kinds of textual errors, such as spelling and grammatical errors in email, and character recognition errors in documents that come through OCR. Text categorization must work reliably on all input, and thus must tolerate some level of these kinds of problems. We describe here an N-gram-based approach to text categorization that is tolerant of textual errors. The system is small, fast and robust. This system worked very well for language classification, achieving in one test a 99.8% correct classification rate on Usenet newsgroup articles written in different languages. The system also worked reasonably well for classifying articles from a number of different computer-oriented newsgroups according to subject, achieving as high as an 80% correct classification rate. There are also several obvious directions for improving the system`s classification performance in those cases where it did not do as well. The system is based on calculating and comparing profiles of N-gram frequencies. First, we use the system to compute profiles on training set data that represent the variousmore\u00a0\u00bb categories, e.g., language samples or newsgroup content samples. Then the system computes a profile for a particular document that is to be classified. Finally, the system computes a distance measure between the document`s profile and each of the category profiles. The system selects the category whose profile has the smallest distance to the document`s profile. The profiles involved are quite small, typically 10K bytes for a category training set, and less than 4K bytes for an individual document. Using N-gram frequency profiles provides a simple and reliable way to categorize documents in a wide range of classification tasks.\u00ab\u00a0less"

Electronic documents produced by scanning and OCR software contain recognition errors. This paper uses an automatic approach to examine the selection and the effectiveness of searching techniques for possible erroneous terms for query expansion. The proposed method consists of two basic steps. In the first step, confused characters in erroneous words are located and editing operations are applied to create a collection of erroneous error-grams in the basic unit of the model. The second step uses query terms and error-grams to generate additional query terms, identify appropriate matching terms, and determine the degree of relevance of retrieved document images to the user's query, based on a vector space IR model. The proposed approach has been trained on 979 document images to construct about 2,822 error-grams and tested on 100 scanned Web pages, 200 advertisements and manuals, and 700 degraded images. The performance of our method is evaluated experimentally by determining retrieval effectiveness with respect to recall and precision. The results obtained show its effectiveness and indicate an improvement over standard methods such as vectorial systems without expanded query and 3-gram overlapping."

We describe a Collection OCR which takes advantage of the fact that multiple examples of the same word (often in the same font) may occur in a document or collection. The idea here is that an OCR or a reCAPTCHA like process generates a partial set of recognized words. In the second stage, a nearest neighbor algorithm compares the remaining word-images to those already recognized and propagates labels from the nearest neighbors. It is shown that by using an approximate fast nearest neighbor algorithm based on Hierarchical K-Means (HKM), we can do this accurately and efficiently. It is also shown that profile based features perform much better than SIFT and Pyramid Histogram of Gradient (PHOG) features. We believe that this is because profile features are more robust to word degradations (common in our documents). This approach is applied to a collection of Telugu books - a language for which no commercial OCR exists. We show from a selection of 33 Telugu books that starting with OCR labels for only 30% of the collection we can recognize the remaining 70% of the words in the collection with 70% accuracy using this approach. Since the approach makes no language specific assumptions, it should be applicable to a large number of languages. In particular we are interested in its applicability to Indic languages and scripts."

Since traditional handwriting recognizers based on optical character recognition (OCR) do not perform well on historical documents, recently a holistic word recognition approach has gained in popularity as an attractive and more straightforward solution (Lavrenko et\u00a0al. in proc. document Image Analysis for Libraries (DIAL\u201904), pp. 278\u2013287, 2004). Such techniques attempt to recognize words based on scalar and profile-based features extracted from whole word images. In this paper, we propose a new approach to holistic word recognition for historical handwritten manuscripts based on matching word contours instead of whole images or word profiles. The new method consists of robust extraction of closed word contours and the application of an elastic contour matching technique proposed originally for general shapes (Adamek and O\u2019Connor in IEEE Trans Circuits Syst Video Technol 5:2004). We demonstrate that multiscale contour-based descriptors can effectively capture intrinsic word features avoiding any segmentation of words into smaller subunits. Our experiments show a recognition accuracy of 83%, which considerably exceeds the performance of other systems reported in the literature."

Direct retrieval of documents using n-gram databases of 2 and 3-grams or 2, 3, 4 and 5-grams resulted in improved retrieval performance over standard (word based) queries on the same data when a level of 10 percent degradation or worse was achieved. A second method of using n-grams to identify appropriate matching and near matching terms for query expansion which also performed better than using standard queries is also described. This method was less effective than direct n-gram query formulations but can likely be improved with alternative query component weighting schemes and measures of term similarity. Finally, a web based retrieval application using n-gram retrieval of OCR text and display, with query term highlighting, of the source document image is described."

This represents the only available solution to bring the printed materials to the electronic media. However, the transferring process causes the system to lose the temporal information of that text. Other complexities that an off-line recognition system has to deal with are the lower resolution of the document and the poor binarisation, which can contribute to readability when essential features of the characters are deleted or obscured. Recognising Arabic script presents two additional challenges: orthography is cursive and letter shape is context sensitive. Certain character combinations form new ligature shapes, which are often font-dependent. Some ligatures involve vertical stacking of characters. Since not all letters connect, word boundary location becomes an interesting problem, as spacing may separate not only words, but also certain characters within a word. Various techniques have been implemented to achieve high recognition rates. These techniques have tackled different aspects of the recognition system. This review is organised into five major sections, covering a general overview, Arabic writing characteristics, Arabic text recognition system, Arabic OCR software and conclusions."

The system combines several techniques in order to improve the overall recognition rate. Thinning and shape extraction are performed directly on a graph of the run-length encoding of a binary image. The resulting strokes and other shapes are mapped, using a shape-clustering approach, into binary features which are then fed into a statistical Bayesian classifier. Large-scale trials have shown better than 97 percent top choice correct performance on mixtures of six dissimilar fonts, and over 99 percent on most single fonts, over a range of point sizes. Certain remaining confusion classes are disambiguated through contour analysis, and characters suspected of being merged are broken and reclassified. Finally, layout and linguistic context are applied. The results are illustrated by sample pages."

We describe an approach called word spotting which involves grouping word images into clusters of similar words by using image matching to find similarity. By annotating \u201cinteresting\u201d clusters, an index that links words to the locations where they occur can be built automatically. Image similarities computed using a number of different techniques including dynamic time warping are compared. The word similarities are then used for clustering using both K-means and agglomerative clustering techniques. It is shown in a subset of the George Washington collection that such a word spotting technique can outperform a Hidden Markov Model word-based recognition technique in terms of word error rates."

The initial experiments reported in this paper were performed using a corpus of synthetic (computer-generated) document images along with slightly degraded versions of the same that were generated by scanning printed versions of the document images and by scanning faxes of the printed versions. On a fair test set consisting of synthetic images alone we measured a character error rate of 1.0%. The character error rate on a fair test set consisting of scanned images (scans of printed versions of the synthetic images) was 1.40% while the character error rate on a fair test set of fax images (scans of printed and faxed versions of the synthetic images) was 8.7%."

The system is based on hidden Markov models (HMM), an approach that has proven to be very successful in the area of automatic speech recognition. We focus on two aspects of the OCR system. First, we address the issue of how to perform OCR on omnifont and multi-style data, such as plain and italic, without the need to have a separate model for each style. The amount of training data from each style, which is used to train a single model, becomes an important issue in the face of the conditional independence assumption inherent in the use of HMMs. We demonstrate mathematically and empirically how to allocate training data among the different styles to alleviate this problem. Second, we show how to use a word-based HMM system to perform character recognition with unlimited vocabulary. The method includes the use of a trigram language model on character sequences. Using all these techniques, we have achieved character error rates of 1.1 percent on data from the University of Washington English Document Image Database and 3.3 percent on data from the DARPA Arabic OCR Corpus."

Three main components of the system are a word segmenter, a shape based matcher for words and a search interface. The user types in a query in English within a search window, the system finds the equivalent Arabic word, e.g., by dictionary lookup, locates word images in an indexed (segmented) set of documents. A two-step approach is employed in performing the search: (1) prototype selection: the query is used to obtain a set of handwritten samples of that word from a known set of writers (these are the prototypes), and (2) word matching: the prototypes are used to spot each occurrence of those words in the indexed document database. A ranking is performed on the entire set of test word images\u2013 where the ranking criterion is a similarity score between each prototype word and the candidate words based on global word shape features. A database of 20, 000 word images contained in 100 scanned handwritten Arabic documents written by 10 different writers was used to study retrieval performance. Using five writers for providing prototypes and the other five for testing, using manually segmented documents, 55% precision is obtained at 50% recall. Performance increases as more writers are used for training."

A major change in the system is the use of continuous-density HMMs, which allow us to take advantage of a large amount of training data and to use unsupervised adaptation methods to improve accuracy in many cases, e.g., on degraded data. Another advance is the substantial increase in recognition speed. With this increased speed, the system is fast enough for practical use on Arabic and English data. The extension of the system to Chinese further demonstrated the language independence of this system and showed that this system can be used on languages with large character sets and complicated character structures. The Chinese OCR system yielded high accuracy on newspaper data."

There are no known exact algorithms for solving these high-dimensional problems that are faster than linear search. Approximate algorithms are known to provide large speedups with only minor loss in accuracy, but many such algorithms have been published with only minimal guidance on selecting an algorithm and its parameters for any given problem. In this paper, we describe a system that answers the question, \u201cWhat is the fastest approximate nearest-neighbor algorithm for my data?\u201d Our system will take any given dataset and desired degree of precision and use these to automatically determine the best algorithm and parameter values. We also describe a new algorithm that applies priority search on hierarchical k-means trees, which we have found to provide the best known performance on many datasets. After testing a range of alternatives, we have found that multiple randomized k-d trees provide the best performance for other datasets. We are releasing public domain code that implements these approaches. This library provides about one order of magnitude improvement in query time over the best previously available software and provides fully automated parameter selection."

We have successfully ported the system to Arabic, English, Chinese, Pashto, and Japanese. In this chapter, we report on our recent effort in training the system to perform recognition of Hindi (Devanagari) documents. The initial experiments reported in this chapter were performed using a corpus of synthetic (computer-generated) document images along with slightly degraded versions of the same that were generated by scanning printed versions of the document images and by scanning faxes of the printed versions. On a fair test set consisting of synthetic images alone we measured a character error rate of 1.0%. The character error rate on a fair test set consisting of scanned images (scans of printed versions of the synthetic images) was 1.40% while the character error rate on a fair test set of fax images (scans of printed and faxed versions of the synthetic images) was 8.7%."
