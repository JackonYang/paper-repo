Despite this progress, building a new ASR system remains a challenging task, requiring various resources, multiple training stages and significant expertise. This paper presents our Eesen framework which drastically simplifies the existing pipeline to build state-of-the-art ASR systems. Acoustic modeling in Eesen involves learning a single recurrent neural network (RNN) predicting context-independent targets (phonemes or characters). To remove the need for pre-generated frame labels, we adopt the connectionist temporal classification (CTC) objective function to infer the alignments between speech and label sequences. A distinctive feature of Eesen is a generalized decoding approach based on weighted finite-state transducers (WFSTs), which enables the efficient incorporation of lexicons and language models into CTC decoding. Experiments show that compared with the standard hybrid DNN systems, Eesen achieves comparable word error rates (WERs), while at the same time speeding up decoding significantly."

Recently, more direct end-to-end methods have been investigated, in which neural architectures were trained to model sequences of characters [1,2]. To our knowledge, all these approaches relied on Connectionist Temporal Classification [3] modules. We investigate an alternative method for sequence modelling based on an attention mechanism that allows a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to learn alignments between sequences of input frames and output labels. We show how this setup can be applied to LVCSR by integrating the decoding RNN with an n-gram language model and by speeding up its operation by constraining selections made by the attention mechanism and by reducing the source sequence lengths by pooling information over time. Recognition accuracies similar to other HMM-free RNN-based approaches are reported for the Wall Street Journal corpus."

We extend the attention-mechanism with features needed for speech recognition. We show that while an adaptation of the model used for machine translation in [2] reaches a competitive 18.7% phoneme error rate (PER) on the TIMET phoneme recognition task, it can only be applied to utterances which are roughly as long as the ones it was trained on. We offer a qualitative explanation of this failure and propose a novel and generic method of adding location-awareness to the attention mechanism to alleviate this issue. The new method yields a model that is robust to long inputs and achieves 18% PER in single utterances and 20% in 10-times longer (repeated) utterances. Finally, we propose a change to the attention mechanism that prevents it from concentrating too much on single frames, which further reduces PER to 17.6% level."

The recurrent neural network (RNN) encoder-decoder is such a model, performing sequence to sequence mapping without any predefined alignment. This model first transforms the input sequence into a fixed length vector representation, from which the decoder recovers the output sequence. In this paper, we extend our previous work on this model for large vocabulary end-to-end speech recognition. We first present a more effective stochastic gradient decent (SGD) learning rate schedule that can significantly improve the recognition accuracy. We then extend the decoder with long memory by introducing another recurrent layer that performs implicit language modelling. Finally, we demonstrate that using multiple recurrent layers in the encoder can reduce the word error rate. Our experiments were carried out on the Switchboard corpus using a training set of around 300 hours of transcribed audio data, and we have achieved significantly higher recognition accuracy, thereby reduced the gap compared to the hybrid baseline."

Our architecture is significantly simpler than traditional speech systems, which rely on laboriously engineered processing pipelines; these traditional systems also tend to perform poorly when used in noisy environments. In contrast, our system does not need hand-designed components to model background noise, reverberation, or speaker variation, but instead directly learns a function that is robust to such effects. We do not need a phoneme dictionary, nor even the concept of a \"phoneme.\" Key to our approach is a well-optimized RNN training system that uses multiple GPUs, as well as a set of novel data synthesis techniques that allow us to efficiently obtain a large amount of varied data for training. Our system, called Deep Speech, outperforms previously published results on the widely studied Switchboard Hub5'00, achieving 16.0% error on the full test set. Deep Speech also handles challenging noisy environments better than widely used, state-of-the-art commercial speech systems."

However, the results in that work relied on recurrent-neural-network-specific objective functions, which are difficult to integrate with existing large vocabulary speech recognition systems. This paper investigates the use of DBLSTM as an acoustic model in a standard neural network-HMM hybrid system. We find that a DBLSTM-HMM hybrid gives equally good results on TIMIT as the previous work. It also outperforms both GMM and deep network benchmarks on a subset of the Wall Street Journal corpus. However the improvement in word error rate over the deep network is modest, despite a great increase in framelevel accuracy. We conclude that the hybrid approach with DBLSTM appears to be well suited for tasks where acoustic modelling predominates. Further investigation needs to be conducted to understand how to better leverage the improvements in frame-level accuracy towards better word error rates."

Our model is based on an attention-based neural network which directly emits English/Mandarin characters as outputs. The model jointly learns the pronunciation, acoustic and language model. We evaluate the model for online speech recognition on English and Mandarin. On English, we achieve a 33.0% WER on the WSJ task, or a 5.4% absolute reduction in WER compared to an online CTC based system. We also introduce a new training method and show how we can learn joint Mandarin Character-Pinyin models. Our Mandarin character only model achieves a 72% CER on the GALE Phase 2 evaluation, and with our joint Mandarin Character-Pinyin model, we achieve 59.3% CER or 12.7% absolute improvement over the character only model."

Although DNNs work well whenever large labeled training sets are available, they cannot be used to map sequences to sequences. In this paper, we present a general end-to-end approach to sequence learning that makes minimal assumptions on the sequence structure. Our method uses a multilayered Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to map the input sequence to a vector of a fixed dimensionality, and then another deep LSTM to decode the target sequence from the vector. Our main result is that on an English to French translation task from the WMT-14 dataset, the translations produced by the LSTM achieve a BLEU score of 34.8 on the entire test set, where the LSTM's BLEU score was penalized on out-of-vocabulary words. Additionally, the LSTM did not have difficulty on long sentences. For comparison, a phrase-based SMT system achieves a BLEU score of 33.3 on the same dataset. When we used the LSTM to rerank the 1000 hypotheses produced by the aforementioned SMT system, its BLEU score increases to 36.5, which is close to the previous state of the art. The LSTM also learned sensible phrase and sentence representations that are sensitive to word order and are relatively invariant to the active and the passive voice. Finally, we found that reversing the order of the words in all source sentences (but not target sentences) improved the LSTM's performance markedly, because doing so introduced many short term dependencies between the source and the target sentence which made the optimization problem easier."

The system is based on a combination of the deep bidirectional LSTM recurrent neural network architecture and the Connectionist Temporal Classification objective function. A modification to the objective function is introduced that trains the network to minimise the expectation of an arbitrary transcription loss function. This allows a direct optimisation of the word error rate, even in the absence of a lexicon or language model. The system achieves a word error rate of 27.3% on the Wall Street Journal corpus with no prior linguistic information, 21.9% with only a lexicon of allowed words, and 8.2% with a trigram language model. Combining the network with a baseline system further reduces the error rate to 6.7%."

Unlike traditional DNN-HMM models, this model learns all the components of a speech recognizer jointly. Our system has two components: a listener and a speller. The listener is a pyramidal recurrent network encoder that accepts filter bank spectra as inputs. The speller is an attention-based recurrent network decoder that emits characters as outputs. The network produces character sequences without making any independence assumptions between the characters. This is the key improvement of LAS over previous end-to-end CTC models. On a subset of the Google voice search task, LAS achieves a word error rate (WER) of 14.1% without a dictionary or a language model, and 10.3% with language model rescoring over the top 32 beams. By comparison, the state-of-the-art CLDNN-HMM model achieves a WER of 8.0%."

In speech recognition, for example, an acoustic signal is transcribed into words or sub-word units. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are powerful sequence learners that would seem well suited to such tasks. However, because they require pre-segmented training data, and post-processing to transform their outputs into label sequences, their applicability has so far been limited. This paper presents a novel method for training RNNs to label unsegmented sequences directly, thereby solving both problems. An experiment on the TIMIT speech corpus demonstrates its advantages over both a baseline HMM and a hybrid HMM-RNN."

                "text": "Neural machine translation is a recently proposed approach to machine translation. Unlike the traditional statistical machine translation, the neural machine translation aims at building a single neural network that can be jointly tuned to maximize the translation performance. The models proposed recently for neural machine translation often belong to a family of encoder-decoders and consists of an encoder that encodes a source sentence into a fixed-length vector from which a decoder generates a translation. In this paper, we conjecture that the use of a fixed-length vector is a bottleneck in improving the performance of this basic encoder-decoder architecture, and propose to extend this by allowing a model to automatically (soft-)search for parts of a source sentence that are relevant to predicting a target word, without having to form these parts as a hard segment explicitly. With this new approach, we achieve a translation performance comparable to the existing state-of-the-art phrase-based system on the task of English-to-French translation. Furthermore, qualitative analysis reveals that the (soft-)alignments found by the model agree well with our intuition."

                "text": "Most current speech recognition systems use hidden Markov models (HMMs) to deal with the temporal variability of speech and Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) to determine how well each state of each HMM fits a frame or a short window of frames of coefficients that represents the acoustic input. An alternative way to evaluate the fit is to use a feed-forward neural network that takes several frames of coefficients as input and produces posterior probabilities over HMM states as output. Deep neural networks (DNNs) that have many hidden layers and are trained using new methods have been shown to outperform GMMs on a variety of speech recognition benchmarks, sometimes by a large margin. This article provides an overview of this progress and represents the shared views of four research groups that have had recent successes in using DNNs for acoustic modeling in speech recognition."

We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O. 1. Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms."

We show that better phone recognition on the TIMIT dataset can be achieved by replacing Gaussian mixture models by deep neural networks that contain many layers of features and a very large number of parameters. These networks are first pre-trained as a multi-layer generative model of a window of spectral feature vectors without making use of any discriminative information. Once the generative pre-training has designed the features, we perform discriminative fine-tuning using backpropagation to adjust the features slightly to make them better at predicting a probability distribution over the states of monophone hidden Markov models."

In this paper we attempt to improve the understanding of the underlying issues by exploring these problems from an analytical, a geometric and a dynamical systems perspective. Our analysis is used to justify a simple yet effective solution. We propose a gradient norm clipping strategy to deal with exploding gradients and a soft constraint for the vanishing gradients problem. We validate empirically our hypothesis and proposed solutions in the experimental section."
