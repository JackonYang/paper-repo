The statistical translation approach uses two types of information: a translation model and a language model. The language model used is a bigram or general m-gram model. The translation model is decomposed into a lexical and an alignment model. We describe two different approaches for statistical translation and present experimental results. The first approach is based on dependencies between single words, the second approach explicitly takes shallow phrase structures into account, using two different alignment levels: a phrase level alignment between phrases and a word level alignment between single words. We present results using the Verbmobil task (German-English, 6000word vocabulary) which is a limited-domain spoken-language task. The experimental tests were performed on both the text transcription and the speech recognizer output. 1 S t a t i s t i c a l M a c h i n e T r a n s l a t i o n The goal of machine translation is the translation of a text given in some source language into a target language.

Various cleaning methods are applied in this paper.

As evaluation criterion we use the quality of the resulting Viterbi alignment compared to a manually produced reference alignment. We show that models with a first-order dependence and a fertility model lead to significantly better results than the simple models IBM-1 or IBM-2, which are not able to go beyond zero-order dependencies."

We define a concept of word-by-word alignment between such pairs of sentences. For any given pair of such sentences each of our models assigns a probability to each of the possible word-by-word alignments. We give an algorithm for seeking the most probable of these alignments. Although the algorithm is suboptimal, the alignment thus obtained accounts well for the word-by-word relationships in the pair of sentences. We have a great deal of data in French and English from the proceedings of the Canadian Parliament. Accordingly, we have restricted our work to these two languages; but we feel that because our algorithms have minimal linguistic content they would work well on other pairs of languages. We also feel, again because of the minimal linguistic content of our algorithms, that it is reasonable to argue that word-by-word alignments are inherent in any sufficiently large bilingual corpus."

The decoder's job is to find the translation that is most likely according to set of previously learned parameters (and a formula for combining them). Since the space of possible translations is extremely large, typical decoding algorithms are only able to examine a portion of it, thus risking to miss good solutions. In this paper, we compare the speed and output quality of a traditional stack-based decoding algorithm with two new decoders: a fast greedy decoder and a slow but optimal decoder that treats decoding as an integer-programming optimization problem."

For extracting noun chunks, the parser generates all possible noun chunk analyses, scores them with a novel algorithm which maximizes the best chunk sequence criterion, and chooses the most probable chunk sequence.

Aside from the bilingual orientation, three major features distinguish the formalism from the finite-state transducers more traditionally found in computational linguistics: it skips directly to a context-free rather than finite-state base, it permits a minimal extra degree of ordering flexibility, and its probabilistic formulation admits an efficient maximum-likelihood bilingual parsing algorithm. A convenient normal form is shown to exist. Analysis of the formalism's expressiveness suggests that it is particularly well suited to modeling ordering shifts between languages, balancing needed flexibility against complexity constraints. We discuss a number of examples of how stochastic inversion transduction grammars bring bilingual constraints to bear upon problematic corpus analysis tasks such as segmentation, bracketing, phrasal alignment, and parsing."
