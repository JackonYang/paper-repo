                "text": "This thesis addresses the problem of formatting complex documents with electronic tools. In particular, the two problems of incorporating illustrations and laying out tables are treated in depth. The notion of style, a way of maintaining consistency in a document, runs throughout the thesis. It helps manage the complexities of formatting both illustrations and tables. The thesis reviews the history of document composition systems, including early computer typesetting systems, document compilers, and integrated document composition systems. The concept of graphical style is introduced to extend the more traditional notion of document style to illustrations. The observation that graphical style does not adequately deal with the layout problem for illustrations leads to the investigation of a more concentrated layout problem for the special case of table formatting. A grid system is used to describe the table layout arrangement and a constraint solver provides the general layout engine for formatting tables as well as the basis for future interactive table design tools. Further research based on the style and table formatting models can be extended to mathematical typesetting and full page layout. A glossary of typesetting terms and an index to the thesis are provided to help the reader deal with the typographic terminology used in the thesis."

                "text": "A document formatting system converts a document description into a formatted document, which is then displayed or printed on a hardware device. An integrated Editor/Formatter merges the creation and editing of the document description, the formatting, and the viewing of the formatted document into a single, unified, interactive system. \nA trend in non-interactive document formatting systems is to describe the document by its logical structure instead of its physical makeup, thereby increasing the flexibility of the document description. A trend in interactive systems is that of the Exact-representation Editor/Formatter (also known as WYSIWYG), which presents the same representation of the document on all output devices, with editing operations performed directly on this representation. \nThis dissertation presents an interactive system that incorporates a description by logical structure with a naturalness of document manipulation like that found in the Exact-representation Editor/Formatters. The result is an Integrated Editor/Formatter but not an Exact-representation one. \nThe work identifies a hybrid tree-based document representation with a variety of objects as leaves (e.g., text, tables, and mathematical equations). This representation permits the inclusion of a wide variety of document objects while providing a consistent, simple enclosing structure. A central part of the dissertation work is embodied in a prototype system for displaying and manipulating a portion of this three-based document representation. The interactive interface of the prototype is drive directly from a grammatical description of the document's structure and presents a template-based document view that is manipulated through separate, interacting editors. Editing commands operate directly on the document's displayed form, not on its structure. Important in providing this are heuristics that translate operations on regions in the display into operations on the underlying structure. \nOther recent systems have had similar goals. The work described in this dissertation is unique in its use of a heterogeneous document representation rather than a homogeneous one and the related use of cooperating editors, its explicit representation of all possible document components through the template, its exploitation of the separation of the Integrated from the Exact-representation Editor/Formatters, and in its mechanisms for region-oriented manipulations of the document."

                "text": "Abstract : It has become commonplace to use computers to edit and format documents, taking advantage of the machines' computational abilities and storage capacity to relieve the tedium of manual editing and composition. A distressing side effect of this computerization of a previously manual craft is that the responsibility for the appearance of the finished document, which was once handled by production editors, proofreaders, graphic designers, and typographers, is in the hands of the writer instead of the production staff. In this theses the author describes the design and implementation of a computer system for the production of documents, in which the separation of form and content is achieved. A writer prepares manuscript text that contains no mention of specific format; this manuscript text, represented in a document specification language, is processed by a compiler into a finished document. The compiler draws on a database of format specifications that have been prepared by a graphic designer, producing a document that contains the author's text in the designer's format. To simplify the knowledge representation task in the document design database, the document preparation task was parameterized into approximately one hundred independent variables, and the formatting compiler is controlled by changing the values of those variables. The content of the document design database is primarily tables of variable names and the values to be assigned to them. To enable substantial feedback from actual users for validating the design, parameterization, and general utility of such an approach, the resulting computer system was built as a production-quality program and documented as a piece of software rather than as an experiment."

Since there was no significant blank character m RUNOFF (unpaddable space character), \" .nojust\" is invoked before the itemized listing to prevent extra spaces from being inserted into the lines. Filling of lines continues. \".adjust\" restores justification. \" . indent\" resets the left margin, \" .undent\" decreases the \". indent\" for the one line following. The underlined word in the next to last paragraph would have to be produced by the editor (TYPSET) before runmng RUNOFF since RUNOFF did not have facilities for underlining. crete document was viewed on a line printer with uppercase and lowercase letters. Again, as with RUNOFF, many commands manipulate concrete page-oriented physical objects: groups of lines (filling, justification, defining length) and pages (breakup, numbering, defining height, multiple columnation, specifying headers and footers). Others, however, address more logical, content-oriented, objects: words (producing alphabetical listing of words used), phrases (underlining, centering, capitalizing, horizontal spacing between sentences), and paragraphs (indenting, placing blank lines between paragraphs, eliminating widows). Unlike the treatment of characters in RUNOFF, FORMAT's operations may apply to individual characters (specifying case, overprinting). Horizontal spacing commands (tabbing) as well as vertical spacing commands are also provided. Figure 4 presents the document of Figure 2 specified for processing by FORMAT. Three types of commands are present. The character-level commands are reserved characters that appear in the text but have special meanings. Phrase-level commands are single letters that may be grouped together. A group of phrase-level commands is preceded by the escape character \")\" and terminated by a blank. Some phrase-level commands specify a particular action (e.g., terminating the current line), and others act as toggles (i.e., the first use starts an action, the next terminates it). The third type of command, the paragraph-level command, does not cause immediate formatting actions but establishes values for the general attributes of the document, for example, the left margin position, the page length, or the meaning associated with special characters.

The lines following the \")V\" until the line containing GO are paragraph-level commands, defining global attributes which hold until they are reset. Each symbol within the text following the escape symbol \")\"and preceding the next blank is a phrase-level command which has a more limited scope of action. Some, such as \")P\", the begin paragraph command, and \")L\", the terminate current line command, have an immediate effect. Others, such as \")M\", center phrase, and \")\u00a2 \", capitalize phrase, serve as toggles. The first appearance turns the action on, the next turns the action back off. Character-level commands, represented by special symbols (\u00a2, capitalize next character, and #, significant blank, in this document) affect the next character only. Notice that \u00a2 is both a phrase-level and a character-level command. Input is expected to come from cards. Characters are converted to lower case unless a \"capitalize\" command is in effect. The end of a line has no special significance within the input. No macro facility is provided and it is not possible to modify the actions of par t icular commands .

The partial order model introduces the idea of partially ordered sets as the basic construct for modelling data. This model exhibits two novel properties. First, it is capable of describing structure without reference to data types. Second, it inherently separates the structure of data from the objects being structured. These two properties mean that the model naturally facilitates the use of multiple structures for data. \nWe investigate a collection of algebraic operators for manipulating ordered sets. An implementation of these operators is presented, based on the use of realizers as a data structure. An algorithm is provided for generating realizers for arbitrary finite partial orders. \nThe partial order model is useful for data domains that involve containment or dependency relationships. Text databases and software repositories are two examples of such domains. We show how the partial order model can be used to structure text and software data, and how it provides new insights in both areas. In particular, partial orders can be the foundation of better systems for handling both tables and makefiles. \nPartial orders are prominent not only for data stored in databases, but for database system internals as well. Partial orders play key roles in dependency theory, object-oriented modelling, and the management of redundant data. Thus partial orders are a concept of broad importance both in understanding and implementing the fundamentals of almost any database system."

Cedar combines in a single integrated environment: high-quality graphics, a sophisticated editor and document preparation facility, and a variety of tools for the programmer to use in the construction and debugging of his programs. The Cedar Programming Language is a strongly-typed, compiler-oriented language of the Pascal family. What is especially interesting about the Ce~ar project is that it is one of the few examples where an interactive, experimental programming environment has been built for this kind of language. In the past, such environments have been confined to dynamically typed languages like Lisp and Smalltalk. The first paper, \"The Roots of Cedar,\" describes the conditions in 1978 in the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center's Computer Science Laboratory that led us to embark on the Cedar project and helped to define its objectives and goals. Important decisions had to be made about what facilities and features were essential versus simply desirable, both with regard to the programming language as well as tools and packages. This section not only presents these decisions, but also describes the process by which we reached them. These deliberations are especially interesting in light of the fact that three communities with diverse programming languages (Mesa, lisp, and Smalltalk) and very different programming styles, met to discuss the merits and drawbacks of their individual systems and religions, with the purpose of reaching some sort of consensus that would allow the construction of a programming environment that would be satisfactory to all of them. The second paper, \"A Tour Through Cedar,\" is essentially a travelogue through the current Cedar environment (as of September, 1983) in the form of a transcript of an actual session. This transcript consists of numerous snapshots of the display screen interspersed with dialogue and commentary. The intent is to produce an effect similar to that of the reader sitting down with a user in front of a display terminal and being given a live demonstration of the system, while an expert comments on some of the why's and wherefore's. During the course of this demonstration, the reader is introduced to most of the salient features of the Cedar Programming Environment as they come up and are used. In many cases we will digress from this demonstration to discuss some aspect of these features, such as why we did it this way, how important this particular facility actually turned out to be, etc. The final paper, \"Cedar: The Report Card,\" discusses and attempts to evaluate how well we have succeeded in reaching our objectives and goals, to what extent the original objectives . and goals were changed or evolved during the course of the project, and what remains to be done. A version of the paper \"A Tour Through Cedar\" appeared in IEEE Software, April 1984. XEROX PARCo CSL-83-11. JUNE 1984"

A fully redundant table, one that required no additional arithmetic operations, could be used more quickly than a schematic table, and in schematic tables it was more important to have each of the major units given directly rather than each of the minor units. A matrix, although fully redundant, was much more difficult to use than the corresponding table of lists. Many subjects clearly did not understand the principles of matrix format.

In this paper we investigate the problem of optimal compression of propositional Horn production rule knowledge bases. The standard approach to this problem, consisting in the removal of redundant rules from a knowledge base, leads to an \"irredundant\" but not necessarily optimal knowledge base. We prove here that the number of rules in any irredundant Horn knowledge base involving n propositional variables is at most n 0 1 times the minimum possible number of rules. In order to formalize the optimal compression problem, we define a Boolean function of a knowledge base as being the function whose set of true points is the set of models of the knowledge base. In this way the optimal compression of production rule knowledge bases becomes a problem of Boolean function minimization. In this paper we prove that the minimization of Horn functions (i.e. Boolean functions associated to Horn knowledge bases) is..."

All tables contained 10 numerical coll values arranged either as a 4 \u00d7 4 matrix or as a 16 \u00d7 1 row. It was found that for both these arrangements people were slower and more error-prone when they had to make four successive binary decisions than when making two decisions each time selecting among four alternatives. People also made more errors when the presentation format required them to combine decisions along two different spatial dimensions (using both row and column headings) compared with u format for which the decisions could he made successively along a single dimension (nosted column headings). This latter format approximates a logical tree structure and the present findings support other evidence that such formats are particularly useful for problems having extraneous information."

Subjects fixated a marked point on a VDU, and then looked across to an entry in a table of three-digit numbers. This was read out, and the overall reaction time recorded. This was found not to vary with the vertical position of the entry in the table, for viewing distances of 570, 885 and 1140 mm. The horizontal angular separation was varied both within the display and by means of viewing distance. Reaction times increased with separation of the initial fixation point and the target for a fixed viewing distance. Changes in angular separation due to viewing distance had little effect. Eye movement recordings showed that the latency of eye movements was constant, but that the latency of response following a displacement ..."

In this classic book, George Dantzig looks at a wealth of examples and develops linear programming methods for their solutions. He begins by introducing the basic theory of linear inequalities and describes the powerful simplex method used to solve them. Treatments of the price concept, the transportation problem, and matrix methods are also given, and key mathematical concepts such as the properties of convex sets and linear vector spaces are covered.\"The author of this book was the main force in establishing a new mathematical discipline, and he has contributed to its further development at every stage and from every angle. This volume ... is a treasure trove for those who work in this field--teachers, students, and users alike. Its encyclopaedic coverage, due in part to collaboration with other experts, makes it an absolute must.\"--S. Vajda, Zentralblatt fYr Mathematik und ihre Grenzgebiete"

one of the most challenging aspects of document typesetting Tables may contain di erent kinds of objects such as text graphics mathematical formulas and so on which display dis tinct characteristics and need di erent treatment From the logical point of view tables are multi dimensional objects They are however usually presented in two dimensions Tabular typesetting needs to solve the same problem that we need to solve to typeset text and tabular typesetting raises additional problems that need to be solved Moreover we often need to explore di erent layouts and styles of the same tables so that we can choose one layout and style that presents the table s data in a convincing way We do not know of any generally available tabular composition system that satis es these requirements We introduce various aspects of tabular composition in this chapter We rst describe the characteristics of tables We then discuss the di erent stages that are involved in tabular composition Next we review the development of tabular composition systems and give our research objectives Finally we state the major research contributions of the thesis\nCHAPTER INTRODUCTION\nTable The average marks

nition of a table is elusive The Oxford English Dictionary de nes a table as An arrangement of numbers words or items of any kind in a de nite and compact form so as to exhibit some set of facts or relations in a distinct and comprehensive way for convenience of study reference or calculation This de nition summarizes the characteristics of a table using three di erent aspects content form and function\nThe content of a table\nThe content of a table is a collection of interrelated items which may be numbers\ntext symbols gures mathematical equations or even other tables Some of the items are the basic data a table displays and the others are the auxiliary data that are used to locate the basic data We use the term entries to denote the former kind of data and the term labels to denote the latter kind Labels are further classi ed into categories that are organized hierarchically For example Table presents the average marks of the\nDEFINITION AND CHARACTERISTICS\nassignments and examinations for a course o ered in the three trimesters of and\nThe marks are entries and the strings that denote the years the terms and the\nkinds of marks are labels Furthermore Year is a category that consists of the labels\nand Term is another category that consists of the labelsWinter Spring\nand Fall Mark is a category that consists of the subcategories Assignments and Examinations and the label Final Grade There are logical relationships between the entries and the labels Each entry is associated with one label from each of the categories For example the entry at the top left corner is associated with the labels Winter and Ass and the entry at the bottom right corner is associated with the labels Fall and Final Grade The tabular items and their logical relationships provide the logical structure of the table and the number of categories de nes the logical dimension of the table Table has three categories thus it is a three dimensional table\nThe presentational form of a table\nThe content of a table must be presented in some form and on some medium Usually ta bles are presented as row column structures on a planar medium such as paper or screen Fig de nes the terminology for the parts of a table represented as a row column struc ture We inherit the most terminology from The Chicago Manual of Style Chi except that we de ne the concepts of stub head and block for our convenience A table is divided into four main regions by stub separation and boxhead separation The stub is the lower left region that contains the row headings the boxhead is the upper right region that contains the column headings the stub head is the upper left region that contains the categories in the stub and the body is the region to the right of the stub and below the boxhead that contains the entries The intersection of a row and a column is called a cell and a rectangular collection of cells is called a block\nIn traditional tabular presentation the entries are usually put in the body of a table and the labels are placed in the stub or in the boxhead To present multidimensional tables in two dimensions we have to associate more than one category with the stub or with the boxhead In this case some labels appear more than once For example in the stub of Table the labels of category Term appear twice so as to present the asso\nCHAPTER

labels decides the arrangement of entries Each entry is usually put in a cell such that it is to the right of its associ ated labels in the stub and beneath its associated labels in the boxhead Di erent types of typographic cues can be used to help readers search for information in a table We can use rules or white space to separate tabular items distinct type faces or point sizes to distinguish di erent types of items and background colors or patterns to highlight important information\nAlthough the row column structure is a familiar and natural form for tabular pre\nsentation tabular data can also be presented in other forms For example Fig is a pictorial form of Table The combination of pictorial form and the row column struc ture can increase the accuracy of obtaining tabular information PLSS The reasons are that the row column structure provides precise information for a particular question while the pictorial form provides general information for browsing and comparison Vari ous graphical techniques have been investigated to reveal tabular information with visual presentation Bri Tuf Tuf Zei In this thesis we focus on presenting tables only in the row column structure We use layout structure to denote the presentational form of a table\nThe function of a table\nThe main function of tables is to present detailed information in a compact way such that the ability to search and compare the information is enhanced Since tabular information is conveyed by its presentational form one critical factor in determining how easily tables can be read depends on the presentational forms selected by the designer This selection is motivated in part by an understanding of how users interact with tables Wri At least three cognitive processes are involved in users interaction with a table Wri a Wri b\nA comprehension process needed for understanding the principle on which the table is organized to grasp the underlying logical structure of the table\nA search process needed for locating the relevant information within the table\nAn interpretive and comparative process needed to answer speci c questions after the relevant information has been obtained\nCHAPTER INTRODUCTION\nUniversity of XXX Sponsored Research funds awarded in millions of dollars\nYears\nFunds\nGRANTS CONTRACTS\nFigure A pictorial form of Table\nTABULAR COMPOSITION\nTable University of XXX sponsored research funds in millions of dollars\nYear Fund\nGrant Contract\nBased on these three cognitive processes a well designed table should be organized in such a way that the underlying logical structure is made obvious and tabular items are located and interpreted easily\nTabular composition\nIn traditional typesetting tables were always treated separately from the main body of text They involve the most frequent change in typographic style within the text and require the skill of a compositor or typesetter to handle them Wil Two kinds of people are involved in the composition of tables The author is mainly responsible for the design of the logical structure and the topological arrangement whereas the graphic designer is concerned with the presentational style Since authors know their subject ma terial and graphic designers are familiar with aesthetic principles and publishers styles their cooperation guarantees the production of high quality tables Nowadays however anybody can produce tables with the help of a tabular editor and formatter Although\nCHAPTER INTRODUCTION\nusers may know their subject material very well and be quite familiar with statistical principles they still may not know how to design high quality tables or even realize the shortcomings of a given table\nThe criteria for a well designed table may di er for di erent people and di erent purposes The most important criteria that most people agree with are legibility and accuracy A well designed table should enable readers to obtain information rapidly and make few errors With respect to the three cognitive processes we mentioned in Section a well designed table should enable readers to learn to use the table quickly with little or no instruction in the comprehension process to locate information easily and accurately in the search process and to avoid the time consuming calculations that provide opportunities to make mistakes in the interpretive and comparative process The other criteria that a ect the design of tables are the style of a publisher the space constraints of the medium on which a table is to be displayed and the purpose for which a table is to be used\nResearchers from psychology statistics and typography have suggested possible guide\nlines for the design of high quality tables Hall Hal discusses the principles and technical details involved in the design of statistical tables and the improvement of the tables He gives rules to guide the design of tables and gives examples that illustrate how badly designed tables can be improved by applying these rules In a series of pa pers WF Wri Wri Wright provides guidelines for the design of tables based on previous cognitive research and experiments conducted by herself and others Her research focuses on improving the comprehension of the underlying logical structure of a table and on improving the e ectiveness of obtaining tabular information Ehren berg Ehr provides basic precepts for the presentation of numerical data which have largely been ignored in statistical practice These precepts can be used to address the criterion that the underlying logical structure of a table should be obvious at a glance with little or no instruction Norrish Nor gives the conventions for tabular presenta tion in the traditional publishing industry These conventions not only address the issues of how to present the table body but also how tables are related to the surrounding text The Chicago Manual of Style Chi is the standard style guide for authors and editors involved in publishing It devotes one section to the conventions and techniques for tabular typesetting including the arrangement of elements the selection of styles for\nTABULAR COMPOSITION\ndi erent components and the handling of di erent sizes and shapes Zeisel Zei draws attention to the di culties in the presentation of statistical tables and presents some solutions to these di culties He also discusses analytical techniques for the re nement of statistical tables to meet readers requirements The emphasis of his book is on the relationships among data that describe what is and what happens rather than on issues of presentational form\nBased on these studies we have abstracted guidelines for the design of high quality\ntables at di erent stages of composition These guidelines are summarized\nLogical structure design\nAt this stage we decide the content of a table by taking into account the readers re quirements and convenience There are three guidelines for this stage\nContain only necessary information Hal Zei\nSuppose a course instructor needs to design a table to show students their nal marks Students are concerned not only with their marks but also how their marks compare with those of other students Thus the table should list not only the marks for each student but should also give the average minimum and maximum marks On the other hand a large table with complex structure needs more time to comprehend If a table contains more information than readers need it is better to simplify the table by combining items and removing redundant and unrelated items For example if a department chair wants to examine the marks for a course he or she is probably interested only in the average minimum and maximum marks and how many students have failed the course Thus a table for the chair need not display the marks of every student We can consider such a summary table a view in the database sense of the original table\nPresent a table as an explicit structure WF\nA table in which all the information is given explicitly such that a reader needs only to locate the required item is called an explicit structure A table that contain all necessary information but requires readers to do some calculation after locating\nCHAPTER INTRODUCTION\nan item is called an implicit structure For example if we design a table conversion from pounds to kilograms in the range through pounds an explicit structure will list all the conversion values for pounds whereas an implicit structure may list only the conversion values for pounds and\npounds The implicit structure requires readers to do an addition if they want to know how many kilograms are equivalent to pounds Obviously an explicit structure is more e cient for the reader and an implicit structure s presentation normally uses less space\nReduce the number of categories and subcategories as appropriate Wri Zei\nExperiments carried out by Wright have shown that increasing the number of de cisions to be made is a handicap in reading tabular information The number of decisions is proportional to the number of categories and the number of subcate gories in each category We can combine categories to reduce the logical dimension or merge two levels of labels to lower the depth of a category For example we can combine the categories Year and Term in Table to form a new category that has labels W S F W S and F One advantage of the reduction of the logical dimension or the depth of category is that it can save space in the presentation of a table\nTabular arrangement\nAfter we decide on the content of a table we need to arrange the items in two dimensions so that the logical structure of the table is clearly seen Some guidelines for this stage are\nPlace related items close together WF Ehr\nPlacing related items close together helps readers locate and compare information For example university terms are normally used in connection with years It would be unwise to change the topological arrangement of Table by placing category Term in the boxhead and category Year in the stub Similarly Midterm and Final are closely related in that they are both examinations It is inappropriate to separate them with other items\nTABULAR COMPOSITION\nAvoid using two dimensions whenever possible WF Wri\nAlthough presenting a table in two dimensions using both row and column head ings saves space a two dimensional structure is more di cult to comprehend than a one dimensional structure because readers need to integrate a row heading and a column heading simultaneously to locate a cell This guideline is however appro priate for tables that have only one or two categories even though we can always reduce the dimension of a table to one When a table has more than two cate gories it is better to present it in two dimensions A one dimensional presentation of a table with three or more categories is hard to read and it is aesthetically displeasing\nPlace the most frequently referenced items to the left or at the top of a table Wri\nWesterners are used to reading information from left to right and from top to bottom These reading habits greatly a ect the way we read tables Previous stud ies provide evidence that searching from left to right takes less time than searching from right to left That is why in traditional tabular presentation labels are usually put in the stub and boxhead and entries in the body\nVertically arrange items to be compared WF Ehr\nIt is easier to search and compare items reading down a column rather than reading across a row especially for a large number of items Ehr For example it is easier to compare a group of decimal numbers that are aligned vertically on their decimal points\nArrange items in some meaningful order Hal Ehr\nArranging the rows and columns in some meaningful order often enables readers to see the overall distribution of the data It also helps readers to compare a particular entry with others For example if we want to generate a table to show students the marks in a course we may want to sort the students names in decreasing order of their marks\nCHAPTER INTRODUCTION\nPresentational style\nFinally we are at the stage of selecting a presentational style for a table In the world of publishing various publishers have their own styles for tabular presentation Chi AAU These styles control the general appearance of tables throughout a publica tion although for some particular tables we may need to specify speci c styles Some guidelines for the selection of presentational style are\nUse type sizes between and point WF Chi\nResearchers have found that an point typeface is more legible than a point typeface in mathematical tables Tin and for non numerical material a type size larger than point can reduce reading e ciency Spe Type sizes between\npoint and point are the best choices\nSeparate and group items by spaces or rules Hal WF Ehr Nor\nOccasionally using spaces and rules to separate or group items can help the read ers eyes to align the items across a row and down a column Wright WF has observed that it is better to leave less space between related columns than between unrelated ones Wri Widely spaced items require the readers eyes to travel too far and slow down the searching process Tinker Tin has found that group ing rows is much more helpful than having all rows equally spaced and grouping rows into blocks of approximately ve rows is the best solution With the advent of mechanization in typesetting such as the use of linotype machines it became di cult and expensive to typeset vertical rules Consequently there was a uni versal trend by publishers to give up the use of vertical rules Although there is no longer a problem in generating vertical rules with computer aided typesetting many publishers still maintain this style and many style manuals such as The Chicago Manual of Style Chi still do not advocate the use of vertical rules\nUse typographic cues to distinguish di erent kinds of items WF\nPrevious studies indicate that distinguishing di erent kinds of items by typographic cues such as type faces type sizes foreground and background colors and patterns can signi cantly reduce errors when reading a table Typographic cues can help readers scan selectively and locate the appropriate answers more easily\nTABULAR COMPOSITION\nFlush left and indent the row headings in the stub Chi Nor\nMany publishers prefer to left justify the row headings left in the stub If there are two or more levels of subheadings successive levels are indented at least two quads from the previous levels Tables presented in this way not only clearly display the logical structure but also use less space\nAlign the items as appropriate for di erent classes of items Chi\nFor example numbers should be aligned vertically on decimal points dollar sym bols pound symbols or percentage symbols Mathematical formulae are aligned on operators such as ! and so on For columns that contain text if all entries are short then they may be centered in the column Long segments of text and mixed length segments of text are normally left justi ed\nRound numbers to just two or three signi cant digits Ehr\nIt is di cult to compare a pair of numbers and calculate their di erence mentally if the numbers are too long Rounding numbers to two or three signi cant digits makes comparison easier\nSpan the items that contain the same value Chi\nIf adjacent entries contain the same values we can present the common value once and place it in the center of the area occupied by these entries An item that occupies more than one table cell is spanned Spanning items enable us to easily comprehend which entries share the same value and may reduce the presented table size if the common items occur very frequently\nDealing with size and shape\nAt all stages of tabular composition we should take into account the space limitations of the medium on which a table is presented and the proportion between tabular width and height Chi No publisher is happy to see a tall thin table or a short fat one that must be printed broadside Also the variation among column widths and among row heights a ects the appearance of a table We would prefer not to have a table that\nCHAPTER INTRODUCTION\ncontains one column that is a centimeter wide and another one that is centimeters wide\nIf a table has unsatisfactory size or shape we can improve it by changing the content the topological arrangement or the typographic style of the table To change the con tent of a table we can remove unnecessary information and use shorter text to make a large table smaller or replace abbreviations with their complete forms to make a narrow column wider To change the topological arrangement we can transpose a fat and short table or move some categories from the stub to the boxhead for a tall and thin table To change the typographic style we can select smaller type sizes and reduce the white space between columns and rows of a large table or change the sizes of columns and rows to correct unpleasant proportions between them When we change the width of a column that contains long text the line breaking points have to be adjusted to t the new width\nIf we cannot place a large table on one page then we have to use other typesetting techniques We can break a table that is too tall but is not too fat into multiple pages by duplicating the column headings for each page For a table that is too fat for one page we can print it broadside or print it on facing pages If a table is still too fat then we have to print it on a larger sheet of paper and fold it an expense that no publisher likes to incur except for important tables in pro table books\nReview of previous work\nWe rst brie y describe the development of computer aided document typesetting and how it has a ected the evolution of electronic tabular composition We then describe several tabular composition systems in some detail Finally we evaluate these systems according to criteria that evaluate their functionality and ability to support the di erent stages of tabular composition\nThe development of electronic tabular composition\nTables are indispensable objects and the evolution of electronic tabular formatting is closely associated with the development of computer aided typesetting Fur The use\nREVIEW OF PREVIOUS WORK\nof the computer for document typesetting began in the s The earliest discussions of computer composition systems are Barnett s Computer Typesetting Bar Stevens s Automatic Typographic Quality Typesetting Techniques SL and Phillips s Computer Peripherals and Typesetting Phi All of the early document formatting systems ac cepted a stream of text characters interleaved with action codes and produced very simple layouts Some of them did not even deal with page layout but only produced typeset galleys to be pasted up manually in the traditional way Early e orts in tabu lar typesetting used special programs that performed calculations over numerical data and generated tables in a single format The pioneering system in style speci cation was TABPRINT Bar developed by Barnett at MIT in the early s Typographic styles for each table preceded the data and provided basic formatting choices\nA signi cant evolution of document formatters occurred when formatting commands were embedded in documents to govern the presentation of the logical content of the documents The document formatting systems at this stage such as troff with me and ms macros Oss Scribe Rei and TEX with LATEX macros Knu Lam compile a document with embedded formatting tags and generate formatted documents possibly accompanied by some error and warning messages These systems separate the document structure from the document style and enable users who lack the skills of document design to produce high quality documents in multiple presentational layouts They describe tables as row structures and provide more styles for tabular formatting including vertical and horizontal alignment options for text di erent types of rules and spanning speci cation These systems do not capture the logical structure of tables and they treat rows and columns di erently Moreover the available document styles provide little support for the achievement of a consistent appearance for tables\nNLS EE the rst interactive document composition systems introduced the\nnotion of wysiwyg what you see is what you get during the late s Subse quently a number of integrated document composition systems including Etude Ils Janus Cea Tioga Tei Furuta s system Fur and Grif QV were developed to provide a wysiwyg environment for editing and formatting structured documents These systems allow users to view and manipulate documents through a visual interface and integrate multiple objects into a uniform representation A wysiwyg environment is especially suitable for tabular editing and formatting because tabular items are orga\nCHAPTER INTRODUCTION\nnized simultaneously in two dimensions rows and columns and the logical relationships among the items are presented through their relative positions in two dimensions By modeling tables as two dimensional row column structures these interactive composi tion systems can manipulate rows and columns equally well and select styles in a more direct way for both rows and columns Yet these systems still do not capture the logical structure of tables\nAlthough the separation of the logical and layout structures of documents has been\nwidely used there was no distinction between the logical and layout structures of ta bles until Improv Imp a commercial spread sheet system was introduced At about the same time Vanoirbeek adopted a new tabular model in Grif QV that speci es the logical structure of tables Van Both systems maintain the logical relationships among tabular items provide the ability to arrange these interrelated items easily in two dimensions and allow users to manipulate tables based on their logical structure These two systems however are weak in the manipulation of tabular logical structure and pro vide insu cient styles to govern the presentation of logical components More recently a tabular formatting system called TAFEL MUSIK SKS SSK was designed to spec ify the logical structure and typographic styles using database schemas and techniques This system does not appear to support tabular editing\nSome tabular composition systems\nWe introduce only systems that are representative of the di erent approaches to tabular processing at di erent development periods"

white space and satis es all the user speci ed size constraints expressed as linear inequalities The algorithm divides the entire optimization problem into a number of subproblems and it uses accelerating techniques to increase e ciency\nEvaluation of prior work\nWe evaluate tabular composition systems based on the following criteria which we believe can be used to indicate whether they provide su cient functionality to support the di erent stages of tabular composition\nREVIEW OF PREVIOUS WORK\nDoes it specify the multi dimensional logical structure of tables and provide su cient functionality to manipulate the logical structure\nDoes it specify the topological arrangement of tables and provide the ability to arrange tabular items exibly in both the horizontal and vertical dimensions\nDoes it specify su cient styles for di erent kinds of tabular components to achieve high quality layout\nDoes it help users to deal with di erent table sizes and shapes\nThe early system TABPRINT provides little functionality to support tabular com\nposition It can generate tables according to only limited formatting styles that control the presentation of the whole table Variant styles for di erent items are not allowed\nUsing Tbl and LATEX users specify tables explicitly based on the topological arrange ment thus there is no clear separation between the logical structure and the topol ogy Tbl and LATEX are speci cation languages that rely on the underlying formatting systems troff and TEX respectively These formatting systems do not provide true two dimensional formatting Table speci cations are precompiled and tabular items are broken down into two separate formatting processes a horizontal formatting process followed by a vertical formatting process Because Tbl and LATEX do not provide editing facilities users have to respecify tables if they want to change the topological arrange ment of these tables Tbl provides many typographic styles but the styles for columns and rows are treated di erently LATEX provides styles for only columns It is di cult for users to specify tables that require complex layouts such as the cut in style and grouping items in a number of rows with white space and rules Tbl and LATEX can break text into lines if the text width is given and the tabular markup mechanism speci es size constraints for both rows and columns Such functionality can help users to control table size and shape to a limited extent\nThe tabular markup methods using SGML are not tabular composition systems They specify explicitly the topological arrangement and do not separate the logical structure from the topology Like Tbl and LATEX they require the respeci cation of a table if its topological arrangement needs to be changed The latest tabular markup method in SGML provides many styles for the whole table the column headings the rows and the\nCHAPTER INTRODUCTION\ncells but it provides no styles for the columns except an alignment option It also allows size constraints for both rows and columns\nTABLE spreadsheet systems Beach s system Furuta s prototype and Cameron s\nsystem which are all interactive also describe tables based on their topological arrange ment and do not separate the logical structure from the topology These systems provide true two dimensional formatting and treat rows and columns equally Although these systems provide a wysiwyg environment for editing the topological arrangement of a table users may need many editing operations to rearrange tabular items For example if we want to change the topological arrangement of a table by exchanging the labels in the stub and the boxhead we have to use many moving operations These systems are able to specify typographic styles interactively for the whole table columns rows blocks and cells Beach s system can automatically calculate the heights of rows and widths of columns that satisfy a set of size constraints expressed as linear inequalities and achieve the minimal value for the sum of the tabular width and height It assumes however that the text is broken into lines in advance which enables the system to nd a layout in polynomial time\nImprov and Vanoirbeek s system are able to specify the multi dimensional logical structures of tables Neither of them however provides su cient ability to modify the logical structure of a table Both systems o er only the basic functions to create a new logical structure interactively Some changes to an existing structure such as the change from an implicit structure to an explicit one may require the user to abandon the old structure and create a new one Both systems provide the ability to edit the topological arrangement by changing the position of a category inside the stub or the boxhead and by moving a category from the stub to the boxhead and conversely This ability also helps users to control tabular size and shape Although Improv captures the tabular logical structure it provides few typographic styles to control the presentation of logical components Vanoirbeek s system does provide some basic typographic styles for categories labels and entries but it provides no typographic styles for complex tabular layouts Both Improv and Vanoirbeek s system can control the sizes and shapes by specifying the widths and heights of tables or the sizes of columns and rows Yet they do not deal with automatic line breaking and size constraints during the calculation of the physical dimensions of a table\nRESEARCH OBJECTIVES\nTAFEL MUSIK is a tabular typesetting system that is currently under development\nand as such little is known about it It also describes tables based on their multi dimensional logical structure It is however a batch oriented formatting system and provides no editing ability to update the logical structures of tables TAFEL MUSIK provides a powerful ability to control tabular size and shape by allowing users to specify size constraints as linear inequalities automatically breaking text into lines and calcu lating the optimal layouts for a small number of objective functions\nResearch Objectives\nThe general goal of our research is to create a tabular model for the design of high quality tables in two dimensions It should support the di erent stages of tabular composition including the design of the logical structure the arrangement of tabular items the speci cation of typographic styles and the formatting of concrete tables This model should be based only on the nature of tables and should be independent of any existing formatting and editing systems The speci c objectives are\nTo propose an abstract model to specify tabular logical structure\nLike Vanoirbeek s system and TAFEL MUSIK our abstract model should also describe the multi dimensional logical structure of tables The major di erence between our abstract model and theirs should be the representation used to specify the logical structure Vanoirbeek s system abstracts tables as a tree with additional edges to comply with the hierarchical structure used in its host system Grif TAFEL MUSIK uses a two dimensional database model to specify multi dimensional tables Neither the hierarchical structure nor the database model naturally describe the characteristics of multi dimensional tables Our abstract model should use well understood mathematical notation to abstract tables and should hide the represen tation and implementation\nTo investigate what operations are needed for the manipulation of abstract tables\nThe editing operations for row column structures have been investigated The operations for multi dimensional logical structures however have been little in\nCHAPTER INTRODUCTION\nvestigated The editing model should manipulate tables at an abstract level The operations in the editing model should be topology independent\nTo explore what topological and style rules are necessary to specify a tabular layout structure\nWe divide layout speci cation into two parts topological speci cation and style speci cation In topological speci cation we should focus on the rules needed to specify the relative placement of tabular items in two dimensions In style speci cation we should provide style rules that govern the presentation of the whole table the main regions the stub boxhead stub head and body the logical components categories labels and entries and the layout components rows columns and blocks These style rules should include not only basic formatting attributes such as the type face and point size spacing and rule type horizontal and vertical alignment options and size constraints but also formatting attributes that enable us to easily specify complex layout structures such as grouping items cut in headings and spanning options for entries\nTo solve the formatting problem arising in the generation of a concrete table when applying layout speci cations to an abstract table\nThe most di cult problem arising in tabular formatting is how to determine ef\nciently the physical dimensions of a table that satis es user speci ed size con\nstraints Beach Bea has given a polynomial time algorithm that requires users to indicate the line breaks in advance TAFEL MUSIK s developers have designed an exponential time algorithm that achieves automatic line breaking and satis es one of a small number of objective functions Automatic line breaking and size con straints are important features that can help users to deal with table size and shape Our objectives are to analyze the computational complexity of tabular formatting with respect to di erent restrictions and to design an algorithm that supports au tomatic line breaking and size constraints expressed as linear inequalities and nds the physical dimensions in polynomial time for many tables\nTo demonstrate that our model is feasible by implementing a prototype tabular composition system that helps users to e ciently design high quality tables\nCONTRIBUTIONS\nBased on our tabular model we should implement a prototype tabular editor and formatter This prototype should provide an interactive interface to help users easily specify and manipulate logical structure topological arrangement and ty pographic styles It should also generate formatted tabular outputs for di erent typesetting systems\nContributions\nThe contributions of this thesis can be summarized from ve aspects First we propose an abstract model to specify the multi dimensional logical structure of tables This model uses well understood mathematical notation such as sets and functions to abstract tables which distinguishes our model from other models This model not only precisely abstracts the category structure and the logical associations between labels and entries but also allows us to determine what operations are necessary for the manipulation of the multi dimensional logical structure\nSecond we present an editing model for the manipulation of the multi dimensional logical structure of tables The editing model enables us to edit tables independently of their topology We no longer need to perform a transformation between logical compo nents and layout components when editing tabular logical structure As far as we know no one has explored what operations are needed for multi dimensional tables at such an abstract level\nThird we give a presentational model for the speci cation of tabular layout struc\nture We adopt a similar arrangement of the categories to those used in Improv and in Vanoirbeek s system but o er more options to arrange labels The style rules provided in the presentational model can be used to specify style from di erent viewpoints In addition to the traditional style for the row column structure we provide style rules to specify the style for the logical components of an abstract table and for the four major regions of a table stub boxhead stub head and the body To our knowledge no current system o ers such an abundance of style rules for tabular presentation Moreover we also propose an approach to solve style con icts when applying a set of styles rules to a table\nCHAPTER INTRODUCTION\nFourth we are the rst to prove that the tabular formatting is NP complete with respect to two useful features automatic line breaking and size constraints expressed as linear inequalities We also design a polynomial time greedy algorithm that can partially solve the tabular formatting problem for many tables\nLastly we implemented a prototype to validate our ideas and demonstrate that we can integrate our models in an interactive tabular editor and formatter This prototype not only helps users to easily design high quality tables in two dimensions but also o ers users a tool to analyze and explore tabular data e ciently\nThis thesis describes our proposals discussion and investigations and it presents\npossible future work based on our current achievements In Chapter we present a for mal model for the abstraction of tabular logical structure In Chapter we discuss the operations for the manipulation of tabular logical structure In Chapter we describe what presentational rules are necessary for topological speci cation and style speci ca tion In Chapter we formally de ne the tabular formatting problem and prove its NP completeness We also give an algorithm that solves the problem in polynomial time for many common cases In Chapter we introduce a prototype interactive tabular edi tor and formatter which is based on the tabular model and describes how we solve some key problems arising during the implementation of the prototype In the last chapter we draw some conclusions about current achievements and discuss what remains to be done"

                "text": "De afgelopen jaren zijn er tal van hervormingen in het stelsel van sociale zekerheid doorgevoerd. Bij de verzekering tegen het risico van arbeidsongeschiktheid is de Wet op de arbeidsongeschiktheidsverzekering (WAO) omgevormd tot de Wet werk en inkomen naar arbeidsvermogen (WIA). De Werkloosheidswet (WW) is aangepast en de duur van de uitkering bij werkloosheid beperkt. De gemeenten zijn financieel verantwoordelijk gemaakt voor de bijstand. De fiscale ondersteuning van regelingen voor vervroegde uittreding is \u2013 met een ruime overgangsregeling \u2013 gestopt. De regelingen voor aanvullende pensioenen zijn versoberd. En ten slotte is een nieuwe levensloopregeling ingevoerd. Volgens sommigen is er na al deze hervormingen geen dringende noodzaak meer om het stelsel verder aan te passen. Het Coalitieakkoord uit februari 2007 stelt echter dat de veranderingen in de samenleving gevolgen hebben voor de bestaande systemen van de verzorgingsstaat. Het vervolgt met de constatering dat nieuwe arrangementen nodig zijn, die beantwoorden aan de dynamiek van deze en de komende tijd. In de literatuur worden voorstellen gedaan voor een nieuwe opzet van de sociale zekerheid. Wellicht het meest opvallend zijn de voorstellen om te komen tot (verplichte) individuele spaarsystemen in de sociale zekerheid. Individuele spaartegoeden zouden, al dan niet in aanvulling op een collectieve verzekering of voorziening, gebruikt kunnen worden voor de dekking van (een deel van) het werkloosheidsrisico en het risico van inkomensderving door andere oorzaken. Als belangrijk voordeel van dit alternatief wordt de efficiencywinst gezien: door gebruik te maken van individuele spaartegoeden kunnen individuen het inkomen op doelmatige wijze over de levensloop spreiden en worden de prikkels voor arbeidsdeelname versterkt. Bij non-participatie wordt immers ingeteerd op het spaartegoed en daarmee op toekomstig inkomen. De levensloopregeling zou kunnen worden gezien als een eerste stapje in een dergelijke richting. Tot nu toe kunnen spaartegoeden in de levensloopregeling worden gebruikt bij inkomensderving als gevolg van vormen van verlof. Het Coalitieakkoord kondigt echter een uitbreiding van de aanwendingsmogelijkheden van de regeling aan, waarbij ook het gebruik van de regeling om de periode tussen twee banen te overbruggen als mogelijkheid wordt genoemd. Dit kan moeilijk anders worden begrepen dan het gebruik van spaartegoeden om het werkloosheidsrisico (voor een deel) te dekken. Dit hoofdstuk bespreekt aan de hand van de beschikbare relevante literatuur de vooren nadelen van individuele spaarsystemen in de sociale zekerheid. Deze analyse kan leren of en in hoeverre spaarsystemen een kansrijke hervormingsoptie vormen en zo ja, voor welke"
