It permits efficient compression of a variety of signals, such as sound and images. The predefined libraries of modulated waveforms include orthogonal wavelet-packets and localized trigonometric functions, and have reasonably well-controlled time-frequency localization properties. The idea is to build out of the library functions an orthonormal basis relative to which the given signal or collection of signals has the lowest information cost. The method relies heavily on the remarkable orthogonality properties of the new libraries: all expansions in a given library conserve energy and are thus comparable. Several cost functionals are useful; one of the most attractive is Shannon entropy, which has a geometric interpretation in this context. >"

One approach to reducing storage and computation requirements is to organize the set of reproduction vectors as the Cartesian product of a vector codebook describing the shape of each reproduction vector and a scalar codebook describing the gain or energy. Such shape-gain vector quantizers can be applied both to waveform coding using a quadratic-error distortion measure and to voice coding using an Itakura-Saito distortion measure. In each case, the minimum distortion reproduction vector can be found by first selecting a shape code-word, and then, based on that choice, selecting a gain codeword. Several algorithms are presented for the design of shape-gain vector quantizers based on a traning sequence of data or a probabilistic model. The algorithms are used to design shape-gain vector quantizers for both the waveform coding and voice coding application. The quantizers are simulated, and their performance is compared to that of previously reported vector quantization systems."

The goal of such a system is data compression: to reduce the bit rate so as to minimize communication channel capacity or digital storage memory requirements while maintaining the necessary fidelity of the data. The mapping for each vector may or may not have memory in the sense of depending on past actions of the coder, just as in well established scalar techniques such as PCM, which has no memory, and predictive quantization, which does. Even though information theory implies that one can always obtain better performance by coding vectors instead of scalars, scalar quantizers have remained by far the most common data compression system because of their simplicity and good performance when the communication rate is sufficiently large. In addition, relatively few design techniques have existed for vector quantizers. During the past few years several design algorithms have been developed for a variety of vector quantizers and the performance of these codes has been studied for speech waveforms, speech linear predictive parameter vectors, images, and several simulated random processes. It is the purpose of this article to survey some of these design techniques and their applications."

I owe special thanks to Guido Weiss for substituting as advisor while Victor Wickerhauser was on academic leave in the spring of 1998. I would also like to thank Terri Schneider for her support and professionalism throughout the years. I am grateful to Lars F. Villemoes of the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm for his interest in my work and for inviting me to come and give a talk in Stockholm in December 1998. Thanks to Gerd Grubb of the University of Copenhagen for inviting me to Copenhagen in April 1998. I would like to speciically acknowledge the help and encouragement I have received from Arne Jensen of Aalborg University over the past ve years, and for his support in my job search. Finally I would like to acknowledge that my three years at Washington University were nanced in full by a generous grant from the Danish Research Academy."
