The layout of a document contains a significant amount of information that can be used to classify a document's type in the absence of domain specific models. A document type or genre can be defined by the user based primarily on layout structure. Our classification approach is based on 'visual similarity' of the layout structure by building a supervised classifier, given examples of the class. We use image features, such as the percentages of tex and non-text (graphics, image, table, and ruling) content regions, column structures, variations in the point size of fonts, the density of content area, and various statistics on features of connected components which can be derived from class samples without class knowledge. In order to obtain class labels for training samples, we conducted a user relevance test where subjects ranked UW-I document images with respect to the 12 representative images. We implemented our classification scheme using the OC1, a decision tree classifier, and report our findings."

This feature set encodes region layout information in fixed-length vectors which can be used for fast page layout comparison. The paper describes experiments and results to rank-order a set of document pages in terms of their layout similarity to a test document.

At first, logo images are converted into a structured representation based on contour trees. Recursive neural networks are then learnt using the contourtrees as inputs to the neural nets. On the other hand, the contour-tree is constructed by associating a node with each exterior or interior contour extracted from the logo instance. Nodes in the tree are labeled by a feature vector, which describes the contour by means of its perimeter, surrounded area, and a synthetic representation of its curvature plot. The contour-tree representation contains the topological structured information of logo and continuous values pertaining to each contour node. Hence symbolic and sub-symbolic information coexist in the contour-tree representation of logo image. Experimental results are reported on 40 real logos distorted with artificial noise and performance of recursive neural network is compared with another two types of neural approaches."

On the other hand, most connectionist models assume that data are organized according to relatively poor structures, like arrays or sequences. The framework described in this paper is an attempt to unify adaptive models like artificial neural nets and belief nets for the problem of processing structured information. In particular, relations between data variables are expressed by directed acyclic graphs, where both numerical and categorical values coexist. The general framework proposed in this paper can be regarded as an extension of both recurrent neural networks and hidden Markov models to the case of acyclic graphs. In particular we study the supervised learning problem as the problem of learning transductions from an input structured space to an output structured space, where transductions are assumed to admit a recursive hidden statespace representation. We introduce a graphical formalism for representing this class of adaptive transductions by means of recursive networks, i.e., cyclic graphs where nodes are labeled by variables and edges are labeled by generalized delay elements. This representation makes it possible to incorporate the symbolic and subsymbolic nature of data. Structures are processed by unfolding the recursive network into an acyclic graph called encoding network. In so doing, inference and learning algorithms can be easily inherited from the corresponding algorithms for artificial neural networks or probabilistic graphical model."
