Traditional approaches cope with graphical data structures using a preprocessing phase which transforms the graphs into a set of flat vectors. However, in this way, important topological information may be lost and the achieved results may heavily depend on the preprocessing stage. This paper presents a new neural model, called graph neural network (GNN), capable of directly processing graphs. GNNs extends recursive neural networks and can be applied on most of the practically useful kinds of graphs, including directed, undirected, labelled and cyclic graphs. A learning algorithm for GNNs is proposed and some experiments are discussed which assess the properties of the model."

Here we use these principles to derive several specific classes of DAG-RNN architectures based on lattices, trees, and other structured graphs. These architectures can process a wide range of data structures with variable sizes and dimensions. While the overall resulting models remain probabilistic, the internal deterministic dynamics allows efficient propagation of information, as well as training by gradient descent, in order to tackle large-scale problems. These methods are used here to derive state-of-the-art predictors for protein structural features such as secondary structure (1D) and both fine- and coarse-grained contact maps (2D). Extensions, relationships to graphical models, and implications for the design of neural architectures are briefly discussed. The protein prediction servers are available over the Web at: www.igb.uci.edu/tools.htm ."

We present a connectionist architecture together with a novel supervised learning scheme which is capable of solving inductive inference tasks on complex symbolic structures of arbitrary size. Labeled directed acyclic graphs are the most general structures that can be handled. The processing in this architecture is driven by the inherent recursive nature of the given structures. Our approach can be viewed as a generalization of the well-known discrete-time, continuous-space recurrent neural networks and their corresponding training procedures. We give first results from experiments with inductive learning tasks consisting in the classification of logical terms. These range from the detection of a certain subterm to the satisfaction of complex matching constraints and also capture certain concepts of syntactical variables."

In fact, feature-based approaches usually fail to give satisfactory solutions because of the sensitivity of the approach to the a priori selection of the features, and the incapacity to represent any specific information on the relationships among the components of the structures. However, we show that neural networks can, in fact, represent and classify structured patterns. The key idea underpinning our approach is the use of the so called \"generalized recursive neuron\", which is essentially a generalization to structures of a recurrent neuron. By using generalized recursive neurons, all the supervised networks developed for the classification of sequences, such as backpropagation through time networks, real-time recurrent networks, simple recurrent networks, recurrent cascade correlation networks, and neural trees can, on the whole, be generalized to structures. The results obtained by some of the above networks (with generalized recursive neurons) on the classification of logic terms are presented."

On the other hand, most connectionist models assume that data are organized according to relatively poor structures, like arrays or sequences. The framework described in this paper is an attempt to unify adaptive models like artificial neural nets and belief nets for the problem of processing structured information. In particular, relations between data variables are expressed by directed acyclic graphs, where both numerical and categorical values coexist. The general framework proposed in this paper can be regarded as an extension of both recurrent neural networks and hidden Markov models to the case of acyclic graphs. In particular we study the supervised learning problem as the problem of learning transductions from an input structured space to an output structured space, where transductions are assumed to admit a recursive hidden statespace representation. We introduce a graphical formalism for representing this class of adaptive transductions by means of recursive networks, i.e., cyclic graphs where nodes are labeled by variables and edges are labeled by generalized delay elements. This representation makes it possible to incorporate the symbolic and subsymbolic nature of data. Structures are processed by unfolding the recursive network into an acyclic graph called encoding network. In so doing, inference and learning algorithms can be easily inherited from the corresponding algorithms for artificial neural networks or probabilistic graphical model."

Here, we propose the first fully unsupervised model, namely an extension of traditional self-organizing maps (SOMs), for the processing of labeled directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). The extension is obtained by using the unfolding procedure adopted in recurrent and recursive neural networks, with the replicated neurons in the unfolded network comprising of a full SOM. This approach enables the discovery of similarities among objects including vectors consisting of numerical data. The capabilities of the model are analyzed in detail by utilizing a relatively large data set taken from an artificial benchmark problem involving visual patterns encoded as labeled DAGs. The experimental results demonstrate clearly that the proposed model is capable of exploiting both information conveyed in the labels attached to each node of the input DAGs and information encoded in the DAG topology."

Moreover, the face recognition problem is usually solved having assumed that the face was previously localized, often via heuristics based on prototypes of the whole face or significant details. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to the solution of the face localization problem using recursive neural networks. In particular, the proposed approach assumes a graph\u2013based representation of images that combines structural and sub\u2013symbolic visual features. Such graphs are then processed by recursive neural networks, in order to establish the eventual presence and the position of the faces inside the image. Some preliminary experiments on snapshots from video sequences are reported, showing very promising results."

They enable the application of kernel methods, such as support vector machines, to the analysis and classification of graphs, for example, chemical compounds. These graph kernels are obtained by marginalizing a kernel between paths with respect to a random walk model on the graph vertices along the edges. We propose two extensions of these graph kernels, with the double goal to reduce their computation time and increase their relevance as measure of similarity between graphs. First, we propose to modify the label of each vertex by automatically adding information about its environment with the use of the Morgan algorithm. Second, we suggest a modification of the random walk model to prevent the walk from coming back to a vertex that was just visited. These extensions are then tested on benchmark experiments of chemical compounds classification, with promising results."

At first, logo images are converted into a structured representation based on contour trees. Recursive neural networks are then learnt using the contourtrees as inputs to the neural nets. On the other hand, the contour-tree is constructed by associating a node with each exterior or interior contour extracted from the logo instance. Nodes in the tree are labeled by a feature vector, which describes the contour by means of its perimeter, surrounded area, and a synthetic representation of its curvature plot. The contour-tree representation contains the topological structured information of logo and continuous values pertaining to each contour node. Hence symbolic and sub-symbolic information coexist in the contour-tree representation of logo image. Experimental results are reported on 40 real logos distorted with artificial noise and performance of recursive neural network is compared with another two types of neural approaches."

In this tutorial paper, we give an overview about extensions of pattern recognition towards non-standard data which are not contained in a finite dimensional space, such as strings, sequences, trees, graphs, or functions. Two major directions can be distinguished in the neural networks literature: models can be based on a similarity measure adapted to non-standard data, including kernel methods for structures as a very prominent approach, but also alternative metric based algorithms and functional networks; alternatively, non-standard data can be processed recursively within supervised and unsupervised recurrent and recursive networks and fully recurrent systems."

The FA is a recurrent neural network architecture which is especially suited for adaptive structure processing, i.e. learning approximations of mappings from symbolic term structures to IR n. The main objective of this paper is to demonstrate that the FA can be successfully applied to approximate quantitative structure activity relationships (QSARs), which play an important role during a drug design process. Several approaches for the conversion of a QSAR problem to suitable learning tasks for the FA are presented. Finally the FA is applied to a well-known QSAR benchmark, viz. the inhibition of E. coli dihydrofolate reductase by triazines. The achieved results are compared with results of other machine learning approaches on the same QSAR benchmark, and prove that the FA is signiicantly better. activity relationships, inhibition of E. coli dihydrofolate reductase by triazines."

This paper discusses this issue of convolution kernels, and then proposes a new approach based on statistical feature selection that avoids this issue. To enable the proposed method to be executed efficiently, it is embedded into an original kernel calculation process by using sub-structure mining algorithms. Experiments are undertaken on real NLP tasks to confirm the problem with a conventional method and to compare its performance with that of the proposed method."

In this paper, similarity measures on graphs and related algorithms will be reviewed.

Several problems concerning the presence of faces in images, including face recognition, pose estimation, and expression recognition have focused the research efforts in the last few years. Moreover, those problems are usually solved having assumed that the face was previously localized, often via heuristics based on prototypes of the whole face or significant details. Therefore, each fully automated system, which is able to analyze the information contained in images of faces, requires an efficient face localization method. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to the solution of the face localization problem using recursive neural networks. In particular, the proposed approach assumes a graph\u2013based representation of images that combines structural and sub\u2013symbolic visual features. Each image is represented by a forest of trees. Such trees are then processed by recursive neural networks, in order to establish the eventual presence and the position of faces inside the image. Some preliminary experiments on snapshots from video sequences are reported, showing very promising results."

Although widely accepted and experimentally supported under a cognitive perspective as a model of the human parser, the incrementality assumption has never been exploited for building automatic parsers of unconstrained real texts. The essentials of the hypothesis are that words are processed in a left-to-right fashion, and the syntactic structure is kept totally connected at each step.Our proposal relies on a machine learning technique for predicting the correctness of partial syntactic structures that are built during the parsing process. A recursive neural network architecture is employed for computing predictions after a training phase on examples drawn from a corpus of parsed sentences, the Penn Treebank. Our results indicate the viability of the approach and lay out the premises for a novel generation of algorithms for natural language processing which more closely model human parsing. These algorithms may prove very useful in the development of efficient parsers."

We propose to formalize a scene (consisting of a set of objects with various properties and relations) as a labeled directed graph and describe content selection (which properties to include in a referring expression) as a subgraph construction problem. Cost functions are used to guide the search process and to give preference to some solutions over others. The current approach has four main advantages: (1) Graph structures have been studied extensively, and by moving to a graph perspective we get direct access to the many theories and algorithms for dealing with graphs; (2) many existing generation algorithms can be reformulated in terms of graphs, and this enhances comparison and integration of the various approaches; (3) the graph perspective allows us to solve a number of problems that have plagued earlier algorithms for the generation of referring expressions; and (4) the combined use of graphs and cost functions paves the way for an integration of rule-based generation techniques with more recent stochastic approaches."

The model is a sparse representation of the object, and consists of a star topology configuration of parts modeling the output of a variety of feature detectors. The optimal choice of feature types (whose repertoire includes interest points, curves and regions) is made automatically. In recognition, the model may be applied efficiently in an exhaustive manner, bypassing the need for feature detectors, to give the globally optimal match within a query image. The approach is demonstrated on a wide variety of categories, and delivers both successful classification and localization of the object within the image."

The basic computational module of the technique is an old pattern recognition procedure: the mean shift. For discrete data, we prove the convergence of a recursive mean shift procedure to the nearest stationary point of the underlying density function and, thus, its utility in detecting the modes of the density. The relation of the mean shift procedure to the Nadaraya-Watson estimator from kernel regression and the robust M-estimators; of location is also established. Algorithms for two low-level vision tasks discontinuity-preserving smoothing and image segmentation - are described as applications. In these algorithms, the only user-set parameter is the resolution of the analysis, and either gray-level or color images are accepted as input. Extensive experimental results illustrate their excellent performance."

These summaries also serve as indices for evaluating the complex path expressions common to XML and semi-structured query languages. However, to answer all path queries accurately, summaries must encode information about long, seldom-queried paths, leading to increased size and complexity with little added value. We introduce the A(k)-indices, a family of approximate structural summaries. They are based on the concept of k-bisimilarity, in which nodes are grouped based on local structure, i.e., the incoming paths of length up to k. The parameter k thus smoothly varies the level of detail (and accuracy) of the A(k)-index. For small values of k, the size of the index is substantially reduced. While smaller, the A(k) index is approximate, and we describe techniques for efficiently extracting exact answers to regular path queries. Our experiments show that, for moderate values of k, path evaluation using the A(k)-index ranges from being very efficient for simple queries to competitive for most complex queries, while using significantly less space than comparable structures."
