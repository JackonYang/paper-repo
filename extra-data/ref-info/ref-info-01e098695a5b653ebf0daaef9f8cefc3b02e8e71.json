Impressive detection results have been achieved for many objects such as faces [11, 14, 9] and cars [11]. The robustness of these systems emerges from a training stage utilizing thousands of positive examples. One approach to enable learning from a small set of training examples is to find an efficient set of features that accurately represent the target object. Unfortunately, automatically selecting such a feature set is a difficult task in itself. In this paper we present a novel feature selection method that is based on the notion of object categories. We assume that when learning to recognize a new object (like an apple) we also know a category it belongs to (fruit). We further assume that features that are useful for learning other objects in the same category (e.g. pear or orange) will also be useful for learning the novel object. This leads to a simple criterion for selecting features and building classifiers. We show that our method gives significant improvement in detection performance in challenging domains."

Traditional approaches require applying a battery of different classifiers to the image, which can be slow and require much training data. We present a multi-class boosting procedure (joint boosting) that reduces both the computational and sample complexity, by finding common features that can be shared across the classes. The detectors for each class are trained jointly, rather than independently. For a given performance level, the total number of features required is observed to scale approximately logarithmically with the number of classes. In addition, we find that the features selected by independently trained classifiers are often specific to the class, whereas the features selected by the jointly trained classifiers are more generic features, such as lines and edges."

We propose to use the RCA algorithm, which is a simple and efficient algorithm for learning a full ranked Mahalanobis metric (Shental et al., 2002). We first show that RCA obtains the solution to an interesting optimization problem, founded on an information theoretic basis. If the Mahalanobis matrix is allowed to be singular, we show that Fisher's linear discriminant followed by RCA is the optimal dimensionality reduction algorithm under the same criterion. We then show how this optimization problem is related to the criterion optimized by another recent algorithm for metric learning (Xing et al., 2002), which uses the same kind of side information. We empirically demonstrate that learning a distance metric using the RCA algorithm significantly improves clustering performance, similarly to the alternative algorithm. Since the RCA algorithm is much more efficient and cost effective than the alternative, as it only uses closed form expressions of the data, it seems like a preferable choice for the learning of full rank Mahalanobis distances."

The first task is the discrimination of \"irregular\" motion trajectory of an individual or a group of individuals in a video sequence. We use the SVM approach using f(A,B) where an input matrix represents the motion trajectory of a group of individuals over a certain (fixed) time frame. We show that the classification (irregular versus regular) greatly outperforms the conventional representation where all the trajectories form a single vector. The second application is the visual recognition of faces from input video sequences representing head motion and facial expressions where f(A,B) is used to compare two image sequences."

It is based upon minimizing the summed component-wise (pixel-wise) entropies over a continuous set of transforms on the data. One of the biproducts of this minimization is a set of transform, one associated with each original training sample. We then demonstrate a procedure for effectively bringing test data into correspondence with the data-defined model produced in the congealing process. Subsequently; we develop a probability density over the set of transforms that arose from the congealing process. We suggest that this density over transforms may be shared by many classes, and demonstrate how using this density as \"prior knowledge\" can be used to develop a classifier based on only a single training example for each class."

Detectors involving a hierarchy of tests based on edges have been used elsewhere and shown to be quite fast online. However, significant further gains in efficiency in representation, error rates and computation can be realized if the family of detectors is constructed from common parts. Our parts are flexible, extended edge configurations; they are learned, not pre-designed. In training, object classes are presented sequentially; the objective is then to accommodate new classes by maximally reusing parts. Ideally, the number of distinct parts in the system would grow much more slowly than linearly with the number of classes.

Using a simple large deviation argument, we prove tight data-dependent bounds for the risk of this hypothesis in terms of an easily computable statistic M/sub n/ associated with the on-line performance of the ensemble. Via sharp pointwise bounds on M/sub n/, we then obtain risk tail bounds for kernel perceptron algorithms in terms of the spectrum of the empirical kernel matrix. These bounds reveal that the linear hypotheses found via our approach achieve optimal tradeoffs between hinge loss and margin size over the class of all linear functions, an issue that was left open by previous results. A distinctive feature of our approach is that the key tools for our analysis come from the model of prediction of individual sequences; i.e., a model making no probabilistic assumptions on the source generating the data. In fact, these tools turn out to be so powerful that we only need very elementary statistical facts to obtain our final risk bounds."

In our framework, the measurement of similarity is preceded by (1) solving for correspondences between points on the two shapes, (2) using the correspondences to estimate an aligning transform. In order to solve the correspondence problem, we attach a descriptor, the shape context, to each point. The shape context at a reference point captures the distribution of the remaining points relative to it, thus offering a globally discriminative characterization. Corresponding points on two similar shapes will have similar shape contexts, enabling us to solve for correspondences as an optimal assignment problem. Given the point correspondences, we estimate the transformation that best aligns the two shapes; regularized thin-plate splines provide a flexible class of transformation maps for this purpose. Dis-similarity between two shapes is computed as a sum of matching errors between corresponding points, together with a term measuring the magnitude of the aligning transform. We treat recognition in a nearest-neighbor classification framework. Results are presented for silhouettes, trademarks, handwritten digits and the COIL dataset."

The concepts of an optimal number of features, representativeness of the training data, and the need to avoid overfitting to the training data are stressed. The chapter shows that methods such as the support vector machine and artificial neural networks are subject to these same training limitations, although each has its advantages. For neural networks, the multilayer perceptron architecture and back-propagation algorithm are described. The chapter distinguishes between supervised and unsupervised learning, demonstrating the advantages of the latter and showing how methods such as clustering and principal components analysis fit into the SPR framework. The chapter also defines the receiver operating characteristic, which allows an optimum balance between false positives and false negatives to be achieved."

The features are invariant to image scaling, translation, and rotation, and partially invariant to illumination changes and affine or 3D projection. These features share similar properties with neurons in inferior temporal cortex that are used for object recognition in primate vision. Features are efficiently detected through a staged filtering approach that identifies stable points in scale space. Image keys are created that allow for local geometric deformations by representing blurred image gradients in multiple orientation planes and at multiple scales. The keys are used as input to a nearest neighbor indexing method that identifies candidate object matches. Final verification of each match is achieved by finding a low residual least squares solution for the unknown model parameters. Experimental results show that robust object recognition can be achieved in cluttered partially occluded images with a computation time of under 2 seconds."

The algorithm receives pairs of instances and predicts their similarity according to a pseudo-metric. The pseudo-metrics we use are quadratic forms parameterized by positive semi-definite matrices. The core of the algorithm is an update rule that is based on successive projections onto the positive semi-definite cone and onto half-space constraints imposed by the examples. We describe an efficient procedure for performing these projections, derive a worst case mistake bound on the similarity predictions, and discuss a dual version of the algorithm in which it is simple to incorporate kernel operators. The online algorithm also serves as a building block for deriving a large-margin batch algorithm. We demonstrate the merits of the proposed approach by conducting experiments on MNIST dataset and on document filtering."

We combine these two approaches and propose a general kernel method for recognition with local features. We show that the proposed kernel satisfies the Mercer condition and that it is, suitable for many established local feature frameworks. Large-scale recognition results are presented on three different databases, which demonstrate that SVMs with the proposed kernel perform better than standard matching techniques on local features. In addition, experiments on noisy and occluded images show that local feature representations significantly outperform global approaches."

To achieve this aim, new kinds of vision algorithms need to be developed which run in real time and subserve the robot's goals. Two fundamental goals are determining the location of a known object. Color can be successfully used for both tasks.This article demonstrates that color histograms of multicolored objects provide a robust, efficient cue for indexing into a large database of models. It shows that color histograms are stable object representations in the presence of occlusion and over change in view, and that they can differentiate among a large number of objects. For solving the identification problem, it introduces a technique calledHistogram Intersection, which matches model and image histograms and a fast incremental version of Histogram Intersection, which allows real-time indexing into a large database of stored models. For solving the location problem it introduces an algorithm calledHistogram Backprojection, which performs this task efficiently in crowded scenes."

In later years, though, we were only introduced to other languages (most notably C and Java), and were expected to learn the rest ourselves. What I took from this experience was the ability to learn a new programming language myself, and because I had been taught the fundamental principles of programming, instead of any particular programming language, I was able to do that. This became more apparent, though, when I started working on the OCC, as it was developed in Visual Basic; a programming environment that I had never used before. After the few years of programming with Java, it came as quite a shock that Visual Basic did not have inheritance, even though it did have classes. Despite this, I was able to employ my knowledge of programming paradigms to this \u201cnew\u201d language, and produce just as well structured code as I could with any other language I was already familiar with."
