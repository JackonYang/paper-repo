Since a typical drawing contains both text strings and graphics, an algorithm has been developed to locate and separate text strings of various font sizes, styles, and orientations. This is accomplished by applying the Hough transform to the centroids of connected components in the image. The graphics in the segmented image are processed to represent thin entities by their core-lines and thick objects by their boundaries. The core-lines and boundaries are segmented into straight line segments and curved lines. The line segments and their interconnections are analyzed to locate minimum redundancy loops which are adequate to generate a succinct description of the graphics. Such a description includes the location and attributes of simple polygonal shapes, circles, and interconnecting lines, and a description of the spatial relationships and occlusions among them. Hatching and filling patterns are also identified. The performance of the system is evaluated using several test images, and the results are presented. The superiority of these algorithms in generating meaningful interpretations of graphics, compared to conventional data compression schemes, is clear from these results. >"

White streams are recognized in both the horizontal and vertical direction as substitutes for any missing demarcation lines.

The system comprises a feature extraction stage and a classifier (a feedforward network) that is trained using error backpropagation. The feature extraction stage consists of two steps. Given a bilevel image of a character, the system first extracts a set of experimentally optimized raw geometric features. These features are then combined to obtain higher order features which have higher discriminating ability according to the Fisher discriminant measure. The specific combinations of raw features that are chosen in particular application are determined by statistical analysis of the training data. The nonlinearity introduced by the feature combination is found to be much more powerful than the traditional sigmoid nonlinearity of backpropagation neural network classifiers. It is shown that by using the high-order features, one can drastically reduce the number of hidden nodes required in the classifier while retraining the same level of classification accuracy.<<ETX>>"
