This is achieved by encoding each document page as a two-dimensional grid of characters. Based on this representation, we present a generic document understanding pipeline for structured documents. This pipeline makes use of a fully convolutional encoder-decoder network that predicts a segmentation mask and bounding boxes. We demonstrate its capabilities on an information extraction task from invoices and show that it significantly outperforms approaches based on sequential text or document images."

To avoid designing expert rules for each specific type of document, some published works attempt to tackle the problem by learning a model to explore the semantic context in text sequences based on the Named Entity Recognition (NER) method in the NLP field. In this paper, we propose to harness the effective information from both semantic meaning and spatial distribution of texts in documents. Specifically, our proposed model, Convolutional Universal Text Information Extractor (CUTIE), applies convolutional neural networks on gridded texts where texts are embedded as features with semantical connotations. We further explore the effect of employing different structures of convolutional neural network and propose a fast and portable structure. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on a dataset with up to $4,484$ labelled receipts, without any pre-training or post-processing, achieving state of the art performance that is much better than the NER based methods in terms of either speed and accuracy. Experimental results also demonstrate that the proposed CUTIE model being able to achieve good performance with a much smaller amount of training data."

In VRDs, visual and layout information is critical for document understanding, and texts in such documents cannot be serialized into the one-dimensional sequence without losing information. Classic information extraction models such as BiLSTM-CRF typically operate on text sequences and do not incorporate visual features. In this paper, we introduce a graph convolution based model to combine textual and visual information presented in VRDs. Graph embeddings are trained to summarize the context of a text segment in the document, and further combined with text embeddings for entity extraction. Extensive experiments have been conducted to show that our method outperforms BiLSTM-CRF baselines by significant margins, on two real-world datasets. Additionally, ablation studies are also performed to evaluate the effectiveness of each component of our model."

This is even more challenging for historical forms due to noise and degradation. A crucial part of the extraction process is associating input text with pre-printed labels. We present a learned, template-free solution to detecting pre-printed text and input text/handwriting and predicting pair-wise relationships between them. While previous approaches to this problem have been focused on clean images and clear layouts, we show our approach is effective in the domain of noisy, degraded, and varied form images. We introduce a new dataset of historical form images (late 1800s, early 1900s) for training and validating our approach. Our method uses a convolutional network to detect pre-printed text and input text lines. We pool features from the detection network to classify possible relationships in a language-agnostic way. We show that our proposed pairing method outperforms heuristic rules and that visual features are critical to obtaining high accuracy."

In this paper, we propose a VIsion-based Page Segmentation (VIPS) algorithm to detect the semantic content structure in a web page. Compared with simple DOM based segmentation method, our page segmentation scheme utilizes useful visual cues to obtain a better partition of a page at the semantic level. By using our VIPS algorithm to assist the selection of query expansion terms in pseudo-relevance feedback in web information retrieval, we achieve 27% performance improvement on Web Track dataset."

However, existing approaches use decoupled strategies - attempting to do data record detection and attribute labeling in two separate phases. In this paper, we show that separately extracting data records and attributes is highly ineffective and propose a probabilistic model to perform these two tasks simultaneously. In our approach, record detection can benefit from the availability of semantics required in attribute labeling and, at the same time, the accuracy of attribute labeling can be improved when data records are labeled in a collective manner. The proposed model is called Hierarchical Conditional Random Fields. It can efficiently integrate all useful features by learning their importance, and it can also incorporate hierarchical interactions which are very important for Web data extraction. We empirically compare the proposed model with existing decoupled approaches for product information extraction, and the results show significant improvements in both record detection and attribute labeling."

Although specific domain knowledge can be used to help design representations, learning with generic priors can also be used, and the quest for AI is motivating the design of more powerful representation-learning algorithms implementing such priors. This paper reviews recent work in the area of unsupervised feature learning and deep learning, covering advances in probabilistic models, autoencoders, manifold learning, and deep networks. This motivates longer term unanswered questions about the appropriate objectives for learning good representations, for computing representations (i.e., inference), and the geometrical connections between representation learning, density estimation, and manifold learning."

The problem for wider deployment of the technology is adaptability: the ability to customize IE rapidly to new domains. In this paper we discuss some methods that have been tried to ease this problem, and to create something more rapid than the bench-mark one-month figure, which was roughly what ARPA teams in IE needed to adapt an existing system by hand to a new domain of corpora and templates. An important distinction in discussing the issue is the degree to which a user can be assumed to know what is wanted, to have preexisting templates ready to hand, as opposed to a user who has a vague idea of what is needed from a corpus. We shall discuss attempts to derive templates directly from corpora; to derive knowledge structures and lexicons directly from corpora, including discussion of the recent LE project ECRAN which attempted to tune existing lexicons to new corpora. An important issue is how far established methods in Information Retrieval of tuning to a user\u2019s needs with feedback at an interface can be transferred to IE."

Recent NLP inroads in high-value domains have sparked interest in the more general setting of extracting n-ary relations that span multiple sentences. In this paper, we explore a general relation extraction framework based on graph long short-term memory networks (graph LSTMs) that can be easily extended to cross-sentence n-ary relation extraction. The graph formulation provides a unified way of exploring different LSTM approaches and incorporating various intra-sentential and inter-sentential dependencies, such as sequential, syntactic, and discourse relations. A robust contextual representation is learned for the entities, which serves as input to the relation classifier. This simplifies handling of relations with arbitrary arity, and enables multi-task learning with related relations. We evaluate this framework in two important precision medicine settings, demonstrating its effectiveness with both conventional supervised learning and distant supervision. Cross-sentence extraction produced larger knowledge bases. and multi-task learning significantly improved extraction accuracy. A thorough analysis of various LSTM approaches yielded useful insight the impact of linguistic analysis on extraction accuracy."

In this paper, we explore the use of page segmentation algorithms to partition web pages into blocks and investigate how to take advantage of block-level evidence to improve retrieval performance in the web context. Because of the special characteristics of web pages, different page segmentation method will have different impact on web search performance. We compare four types of methods, including fixed-length page segmentation, DOM-based page segmentation, vision-based page segmentation, and a combined method which integrates both semantic and fixed-length properties. Experiments on block-level query expansion and retrieval are performed. Among the four approaches, the combined method achieves the best performance for web search. Our experimental results also show that such a semantic partitioning of web pages effectively deals with the problem of multiple drifting topics and mixed lengths, and thus has great potential to boost up the performance of current web search engines."

Metric Learning: A Review presents an overview of existing research in this topic, including recent progress on scaling to high-dimensional feature spaces and to data sets with an extremely large number of data points. It presents as unified a framework as possible under which existing research on metric learning can be cast. The monograph starts out by focusing on linear metric learning approaches, and mainly concentrates on the class of Mahalanobis distance learning methods. It then discusses nonlinear metric learning approaches, focusing on the connections between the non-linear and linear approaches. Finally, it discusses extensions of metric learning, as well as applications to a variety of problems in computer vision, text analysis, program analysis, and multimedia. Metric Learning: A Review is an ideal reference for anyone interested in the metric learning problem. It synthesizes much of the recent work in the area and it is hoped that it will inspire new algorithms and applications."

In contrast to previous work, CloudScan does not rely on templates of invoice layout, instead it learns a single global model of invoices that naturally generalizes to unseen invoice layouts. The model is trained using data automatically extracted from end-user provided feedback. This automatic training data extraction removes the requirement for users to annotate the data precisely. We describe a recurrent neural network model that can capture long range context and compare it to a baseline logistic regression model corresponding to the current CloudScan production system. We train and evaluate the system on 8 important fields using a dataset of 326,471 invoices. The recurrent neural network and baseline model achieve 0.891 and 0.887 average F1 scores respectively on seen invoice layouts. For the harder task of unseen invoice layouts, the recurrent neural network model outperforms the baseline with 0.840 average F1 compared to 0.788."

The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data."

The technique is a variation of Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (Hinton and Roweis, 2002) that is much easier to optimize, and produces significantly better visualizations by reducing the tendency to crowd points together in the center of the map. t-SNE is better than existing techniques at creating a single map that reveals structure at many different scales. This is particularly important for high-dimensional data that lie on several different, but related, low-dimensional manifolds, such as images of objects from multiple classes seen from multiple viewpoints. For visualizing the structure of very large datasets, we show how t-SNE can use random walks on neighborhood graphs to allow the implicit structure of all of the data to influence the way in which a subset of the data is displayed. We illustrate the performance of t-SNE on a wide variety of datasets and compare it with many other non-parametric visualization techniques, including Sammon mapping, Isomap, and Locally Linear Embedding. The visualizations produced by t-SNE are significantly better than those produced by the other techniques on almost all of the datasets."

We surveyed the landscape of IE technologies and identified a major disconnect between industry and academia: while rule-based IE dominates the commercial world, it is widely regarded as dead-end technology by the academia. We believe the disconnect stems from the way in which the two communities measure the benefits and costs of IE, as well as academia\u2019s perception that rulebased IE is devoid of research challenges. We make a case for the importance of rule-based IE to industry practitioners. We then lay out a research agenda in advancing the state-of-theart in rule-based IE systems which we believe has the potential to bridge the gap between academic research and industry practice."

Here, we study its mechanism in details. Pursuing the theory behind warmup, we identify a problem of the adaptive learning rate (i.e., it has problematically large variance in the early stage), suggest warmup works as a variance reduction technique, and provide both empirical and theoretical evidence to verify our hypothesis. We further propose RAdam, a new variant of Adam, by introducing a term to rectify the variance of the adaptive learning rate. Extensive experimental results on image classification, language modeling, and neural machine translation verify our intuition and demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed method. All implementations are available at: this https URL."
