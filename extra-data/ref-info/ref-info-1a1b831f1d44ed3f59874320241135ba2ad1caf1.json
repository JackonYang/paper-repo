In a previous evaluation study, the modified quadratic discriminant function (MQDF) proposed by Kimura et al. was shown to be superior in noncharacter resistance but inferior in classification accuracy to neural networks. This paper proposes a discriminative learning algorithm to optimize the parameters of MQDF with aim to improve the classification accuracy while preserving the superior noncharacter resistance. We refer to the resulting classifier as discriminative learning QDF (DLQDF). The parameters of DLQDF adhere to the structure of MQDF under the Gaussian density assumption and are optimized under the minimum classification error (MCE) criterion. The promise of DLQDF is justified in handwritten digit recognition and numeral string recognition, where the performance of DLQDF is comparable to or superior to that of neural classifiers. The results are also competitive to the best ones reported in the literature."

To approximate the class conditional density more precisely, it can be represented by an orthogonal Gaussian mixture model (OGMM). The parameters of the OGMM are commonly estimated by an expectation-maximization algorithm (EM), which converges to the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). Since the MLE cannot directly minimize the classification errors as the goal of classifier design, a discriminative training method based on the minimum classification error (MCE) criterion is used to adjust the parameters of the OGMM. In order to achieve good generalization, the complexity of the classifier, namely the number of components in the OGMM, is determined by following the structure risk minimization (SRM) principle. Finally, the recognition performance is demonstrated by applying it to the handwritten numerals in the NIST database."

Before extracting directional element feature (DEF) from each character image, transformation based on partial inclination detection (TPID) is used to reduce undesired effects of degraded images. In the recognition process, city block distance with deviation (CBDD) and asymmetric Mahalanobis distance (AMD) are proposed for rough classification and fine classification. With this recognition system, the experimental result of the database ETL9B reaches to 99.42%."

The first method, Preprocess Using Relative Distances (PURD) is a tree\u00adbased reorganization of a flat list of patterns, designed to speed up nearest\u00ad neighbor matching. The second method is a variant of agglomerative hierarchical clustering (HCLUS) which aims at finding a hierarchical structure of centroids in the pattern space. Results indicate that the PURD method is a very fast, effective and convenient method for the speedup of 1NN search, from which it is, however, difficult to derive usable character prototypes. HCLUS can be used to obtain very fast search with acceptable classification rate while providing character prototypes, however, at the cost of significant training efforts."
