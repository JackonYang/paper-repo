Levin starts with the hypothesis that a verb's meaning influences its syntactic behavior and develops it into a powerful tool for studying the English verb lexicon. She shows how identifying verbs with similar syntactic behavior provides an effective means of distinguishing semantically coherent verb classes, and isolates these classes by examining verb behavior with respect to a wide range of syntactic alternations that reflect verb meaning. The first part of the book sets out alternate ways in which verbs can express their arguments. The second presents classes of verbs that share a kernel of meaning and explores in detail the behavior of each class, drawing on the alternations in the first part. Levin's discussion of each class and alternation includes lists of relevant verbs, illustrative examples, comments on noteworthy properties, and bibliographic references. The result is an original, systematic picture of the organization of the verb inventory. Easy to use, \"English Verb Classes and Alternations\" sets the stage for further explorations of the interface between lexical semantics and syntax. It will prove indispensable for theoretical and computational linguists, psycholinguists, cognitive scientists, lexicographers, and teachers of English as a second language. Beth Levin is associate professor of linguistics at Northwestern University."

                "text": "Selectional constraints are limitations on the applicability of predicates to arguments. For example, the statement \"The number two is blue\" may be syntactically well formed, but at some level it is anomalous-- scBLUE is not a predicate that can be applied to numbers. \nIn this dissertation, I propose a new, information-theoretic account of selectional constraints. Unlike previous approaches, this proposal requires neither the identification of primitive semantic features nor the formalization of complex inferences based on world knowledge. The proposed model assumes instead that lexical items are organized in a conceptual taxonomy according to class membership, where classes are defined simply as sets--that is, extensionally, rather than in terms of explicit features or properties. Selection is formalized in terms of a probabilistic relationship between predicates and concepts: the selectional behavior of a predicate is modeled as its distributional effect on the conceptual classes of its arguments, expressed using the information-theoretic measure of relative entropy. The use of relative entropy leads to an illuminating interpretation of what selectional constraints are: the strength of a predicate's selection for an argument is identified with the quantity of information it carries about that argument. \nIn addition to arguing that the model is empirically adequate, I explore its application to two problems. The first concerns a linguistic question: why some transitive verbs permit implicit direct objects (\"John ate $\\emptyset$\") and others do not (\"*John brought $\\emptyset$\"). It has often been observed informally that the omission of objects is connected to the ease with which the object can be inferred. I have made this observation more formal by positing a relationship between inferability and selectional constraints, and have confirmed the connection between selectional constraints and implicit objects in a set of computational experiments. \nSecond, I have explored the practical applications of the model in resolving syntactic ambiguity. A number of authors have recently begun investigating the use of corpus-based lexical statistics in automatic parsing; the results of computational experiments using the present model suggest that often lexical relationships are better viewed in terms of underlying conceptual relationships such as selectional preference and concept similarity. Thus the information-theoretic measures proposed here can serve not only as components in a theory of selectional constraints, but also as tools for practical natural language processing."

In addressing these issues, I will discuss what I think are some of the central problems facing the lexical semantics community, and suggest ways of best approaching these issues. Then, I will provide a method for the decomposition of lexical categories and outline a theory of lexical semantics embodying a notion of cocompositionality and type coercion, as well as several levels of semantic description, where the semantic load is spread more evenly throughout the lexicon. I argue that lexical decomposition is possible if it is performed generatively. Rather than assuming a fixed set of primitives. I will assume a fixed number of generative devices that can be seen as constructing semantic expressions. I develop a theory of Qualia Structure, a representation language for lexical items, which renders much lexical ambiguity in the lexicon unnecessary, while still explaining the systematic polysemy that words carry. Finally, I discuss how individual lexical structures can be integrated into the larger lexical knowledge base through a theory of lexical inheritance. This provides us with the necessary principles of global organization for the lexicon, enabling us to fully integrate our natural language lexicon into a conceptual whole."

Our study serves to highlight some of themost useful tools available for structured lexical representation, in particular (multiple) inheritance, default specification, and lexical rules. It then illustrates the value of these mechanisms in illuminating one corner of the lexicon involving an unusual kind of complementation among a group of adjectives exemplified by easy. The virtues of the structured lexicon are its succinctness and its tendency to highlight significant clusters of linguistic properties. From its succinctness follow two practical advantages, namely its ease of maintenance and modification. In order to suggest how important these may be practically, we extend the analysis of adjectival complementation in several directions. These further illustrate how the use of inheritance in lexical representation permits exact and explicit characterizations of phenomena in the language under study. We demonstrate how the use of the mechanisms employed in the analysis of easy enables us to give a unified account of related phenomena featuring nouns such as pleasure, and even the adverbs (adjectival specifiers) too and enough. Along the way we motivate some elaborations of the HPSG (head-driven phrase structure grammar) framework in which we couch our analysis, and offer several avenues for further study of this part of the English lexicon."

It is concluded that the best theory for describing this domain is not a traditional system of discrete roles (Agent, Patient, Source, etc.) but a theory in which the only roles are two cluster-concepts called PROTO-AGENT and PROTO-PATIENT, each characterized by a set of verbal entailments: an argument of a verb may bear either of the two proto-roles (or both) to varying degrees, according to the number of entailments of each kind the verb gives it. Both fine-grained and coarse-grained classes of verbal arguments (corresponding to traditional thematic roles and other classes as well) follow automatically, as do desired 'role hierarchies'. By examining occurrences of the 'same' verb with different argument configurations\u2014e.g. two forms of psych predicates and object-oblique alternations as in the familiar spray/load class\u2014it can also be argued that proto-roles act as defaults in the learning of lexical meanings. Are proto-role categories manifested elsewhere in language or as cognitive categories? If so, they might be a means of making grammar acquisition easier for the child, they might explain certain other typological and acquisitional observations, and they may lead to an account of contrasts between unaccusative and unergative intransitive verbs that does not rely on deriving unaccusatives from underlying direct objects."

The principal intended area of application is the representation of lexical entries for natural language processing, and we use examples from this domain throughout. In this paper we present the syntax and inference mechanisms for the language. The goal of the DATR enterprise is the design of a simple language that (i) has the necessary expressive power to encode the lexical entries presupposed by contemporary work in the unification grammar tradition, (ii) can express all the evident generalizations about such entries, (iii) has an explicit theory of inference, (iv) is computationally tractable, and (v) has an explicit declarative semantics. The present paper is primarily concerned with (iii), though the examples used may hint at our strategy in respect of (i) and (ii)."

Dr Jackendoff has attempted to take a broader view of semantics, studying the important contribution it makes to the syntactic patterns of English.The research is carried out in the framework of an interpretive theory, that is, a theory of grammar in which syntactic structures are given interpretations by an autonomous syntactic component. The book investigates a wide variety of semantic rules, stating them in considerable detail and extensively treating their consequences for the syntactic component of the grammar. In particular, it is shown that the hypothesis that transformations do not change meaning must be abandoned; but equally stringent restrictions on transformations are formulated within the interpretive theory.Among the areas of grammar discussed are the well-known problems of case relations, pronominalization, negation, and quantifiers. In addition, the author presents semantic analyses of such neglected areas as adverbs and intonation contours; he also proposes radically new approaches to the so-called Crossover Principle, the control problem for complement subjects, parentheticals, and the interpretation of nonspecific noun phrases."

While most approaches to the machine translation for natural languages seek ways to translate source language texts into target language texts without full understanding of the text, knowledge-based machine translation is based on extracting and representing the meaning of the source text. It is scientifically the most challenging approach to the task of machine translation, and significant progress has been achieved within it in recent years. \n \nThe authors introduce the general paradigm of knowledge-based MT, survey major recent developments, compare it with other approaches and present a paradigmatic view of its component processes-natural language analysis, natural language generation, text meaning representation, ontological modeling, etc. Special chapters are devoted to machine-aided translation, speech translation, and challenges and solutions for knowledge representation. Based on these analyses, as well as on a review of general trends in MT, the authors discuss interesting directions for future research and development. \n \nThis book will be of interest to researchers and advanced students in machine translation, natural language processing, computational linguistics, artificial intelligence, and even to some philosophers of language and theoretical linguists."

The system answers questions, executes commands, and accepts information in an interactive English dialog. It is based on the belief that in modeling language understanding, we must deal in an integrated way with all of the aspects of language\u2014syntax, semantics, and inference. The system contains a parser, a recognition grammar of English, programs for semantic analysis, and a general problem solving system. We assume that a computer cannot deal reasonably with language unless it can understand the subject it is discussing. Therefore, the program is given a detailed model of a particular domain. In addition, the system has a simple model of its own mentality. It can remember and discuss its plans and actions as well as carrying them out. It enters into a dialog with a person, responding to English sentences with actions and English replies, asking for clarification when its heuristic programs cannot understand a sentence through the use of syntactic, semantic, contextual, and physical knowledge. Knowledge in the system is represented in the form of procedures, rather than tables of rules or lists of patterns. By developing special procedural representations for syntax, semantics, and inference, we gain flexibility and power. Since each piece of knowledge can be a procedure, it can call directly on any other piece of knowledge in the system."

If the conjunctive structures existing in a long sentence can be analyzed correctly, ambiguities can be reduced greatly and a sentence can be parsed in a high successful rate. Since the prior part and the posterior part of a conjunctive structure have a similar structure very often, finding two similar series of words is an essential point in solving this problem. Similarities of all pairs of words are calculated and then the two series of words which have the greatest sum of similarities are found by a technique of dynamic programming. We deal with not only conjunctive noun phrases, but also conjunctive predicative clauses created by \"Renyoh chuushi-ho\". We will illustrate the effectiveness of this method by the analysis of 180 long Japanese sentences."

                "text": "Different words \"mean\" different things in the sense that they can make different contributions to communication. These contributions can be compared if we have some standard of measure for \"measuring\" (describing) different words' communicative potential (that is, their \"meaning\"). As pointed out by Descartes, Pascal, Leibniz, and others, such a common measure can be found in a set of words regarded as conceptual primes: we can single out in any language a group of words in terms of which the \"meaning\" (that is, communicative potential) of all other words in that language can be described and compared; this description and comparison will be illuminating if the words chosen as primes are themselves intuitively clear and intelligible. On this view of language, semantic description makes sense if it is anchored in a set of conceptual primitives linked with lexical indefinables, that is, words (or morphemes, or expressions) whose meaning is intuitively clear, and in terms of which all the other words in the lexicon can be characterized revealingly and accurately. This paper argues that the distinction between definable and indefinable concepts (and words) must be the cornerstone of any fruitful and linguistically relevant theory of definitions. Fodor, Garrett, Walker and Parkes (1980) put forward the destructive slogan \"Against definitions\", which soon enough led them to the conclusion that semantic analysis in general is impossible and must be abandoned. The author argues that it is time to recognize the self-defeating nature of this slogan, and she shows that meanings can be rigorously described and compared if they are recognized for what they are: unique and culture-specific configurations of universal semantic primitives. 1. Linguistic meaning This article will not review the enormous literature on definitions but rather present my own conclusions on the subject emerging from two decades of research, in the course of which several hundred definitions have been worked out. My basic premiss is that language is a tool for conveying meaning. Though a truism, this proposition is what imparts direction, purpose, and a sense of identity to linguistics as a science. The metaphorical phrasing (implying movement of some entities from one person to another) has recently come under attack (cf. LANGACKER 1987:161-164; REDDY 1979), but this fact has no bearing on the basic truth of the tenet. 1 I would like to thank Tim Curnow and Fredric Dolezal, who read the first draft of this paper and offered a number of helpful comments and suggestions. I am also very grateful to Igor Mel'Suk, who discussed with me my definitions of the verbs paint and krasif, and who offered a number of valuable insights. LEXICOGRAPHICA 8/1992 Back to definitions: Cognition, semantics, and lexicography 147 A \"definition\" in the sense of this word which is relevant to linguistics is a tool for showing what the meaning of a word or an expression is. This statement, too, is somewhat metaphorical, since it implies that a word \"has\" a meaning (as a person may \"have\" a car or a house). One could argue that it would be more accurate to say that it is not a word but a sentence which \"means\" something, or not even a sentence but a person. But setting that debate aside, I will say that a person, a sentence or a word can \"mean\" something; and that a \"definition\" is a linguistic expression, or a set of linguistic expressions, which \"shows\" what a word means. How can a linguistic expression \"show\" what a word means? This, too, is a metaphor: a word is not a container with hidden contents which can be extracted or a black hole whose contents can be suddenly illuminated. Different words \"mean\" different things in the sense that they can make different contributions to communication. These contributions can be compared if we have some standard of measure for \"measuring\" (describing) different words' communicative potential (that is, their \"meaning\"). As pointed out by Descartes, Pascal, Leibniz, and others, such a common measure can be found in a set of words regarded as conceptual primes: we can single out in any language a group of words in terms of which the \"meaning\" (that is, communicative potential) of all other words in that language can be described and compared; this description and comparison will be illuminating if the words chosen as primes are themselves intuitively clear and intelligible. On this view of language, semantic description makes sense if it is anchored in a set of conceptual primitives linked with lexical indefmables, that is, words (or morphemes, or expressions) whose meaning is intuitively clear, and in terms of which all the other words in the lexicon can be characterized revealingly and accurately. The distinction between definable and indefinable words is so crucial to all attempts at characterizing the meaning of words that it is worth quoting some classic expositions of this point. Thus, Pascal (in what ROBINSON (1950:46) called \"about the clearest and truest thing ever written on definition\") wrote: It is clear that there are words which cannot be defined; and if nature hadn't provided for this by giving all people the same idea all our expressions would be obscure; but in fact we can use those words with the same confidence and certainty as if they had been explained in the clearest possible way; because nature itself has given us, without additional words, an understanding of them better than what our art could give through our explanations.

                "text": "How do children learn the language-specific components of their native language? How is language grounded in perception? Knowledge of the meanings of utterances containing unknown words presumably aids children in the process of determining their meanings. A complete account of such a process must ultimately explain how children extract utterance meanings from their non-linguistic context. Algorithms are presented which utilize a cross-situational learning strategy whereby the learner finds a language model which is consistent across several utterances paired with their non-linguistic context. This allows the learner to acquire partial knowledge from ambiguous situations and combine it across situations to infer a unique language model. M scAIMRA learns word-to-meaning and word-to-category mappings from a corpus pairing utterances with sets of expressions representing the potential meanings of those utterances hypothesized by the learner from the non-linguistic context. M scAIMRA's syntactic theory is embodied in a fixed context-free grammar. D scAVRA extends M scAIMRA by replacing the context-free grammar with a parameterized variant of X theory. K scENUNIA incorporates a more comprehensive model of universal grammar supporting movement, adjunction, and empty categories, as well as more extensive parameterization of its X theory component. \nI advance three claims about event perception and the process of grounding language in visual perception. Notions of support, contact, and attachment play a central role in defining the meanings of simple spatial motion verbs in a way that delineates prototypical occurrences of events described by those verbs from non-occurrences. Support, contact, and attachment relations between objects are recovered from images by a process of counterfactual simulation. This imagination capacity, while superficially similar in intent to traditional kinematic simulation, is actually based on a drastically different foundation which takes naive physical constraints such as substantiality, continuity, and attachment relations between objects to be primary. This theory of event perception has been implemented in a program called A scBIGAIL which watches a computer-generated animated movie and produces a description of the objects and events which occur in that movie. A scBIGAIL's event perception processes rely on counter-factual simulation to recover changing support, contact, and attachment relations between objects.

These interpretation processes will be an essential component, and indeed the principal component, of systems for automatic message routing and systems for the automatic extraction of information from messages for entry into a data base or an expert system. In the latter application, for example, it is desirable to be able to recognize conditions in the message that instantiate conditions in the antecedents of the expert system's rules, so that the expert system can reason on the basis of more up-to-date and more specific information."

The authors demonstrate that the number of units in the input layer can be greatly reduced with proper encoding. A neural network maps a group of input vectors to a group of target vectors. It generalizes the responses for inputs that are similar to the inputs on which it has been trained. With this similarity property, if the input pattern vectors are encoded according to the interrelationship among the target patterns, the network may behave better, and fewer units will be needed in the input layer. The authors present such an input pattern encoding method for a neural network with recurrent connections. A modified genetic algorithm was used to do a generalized adaptive search for a good encoding.<<ETX>>"
