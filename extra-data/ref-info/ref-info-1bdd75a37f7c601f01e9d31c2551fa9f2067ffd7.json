This paper aims to align books to their movie releases in order to provide rich descriptive explanations for visual content that go semantically far beyond the captions available in the current datasets. To align movies and books we propose a neural sentence embedding that is trained in an unsupervised way from a large corpus of books, as well as a video-text neural embedding for computing similarities between movie clips and sentences in the book. We propose a context-aware CNN to combine information from multiple sources. We demonstrate good quantitative performance for movie/book alignment and show several qualitative examples that showcase the diversity of tasks our model can be used for."

Given an image and a natural language question about the image, the task is to provide an accurate natural language answer. Mirroring real-world scenarios, such as helping the visually impaired, both the questions and answers are open-ended. Visual questions selectively target different areas of an image, including background details and underlying context. As a result, a system that succeeds at VQA typically needs a more detailed understanding of the image and complex reasoning than a system producing generic image captions. Moreover, VQA is amenable to automatic evaluation, since many open-ended answers contain only a few words or a closed set of answers that can be provided in a multiple-choice format. We provide a dataset containing $$\\sim $$\u223c0.25\u00a0M images, $$\\sim $$\u223c0.76\u00a0M questions, and $$\\sim $$\u223c10\u00a0M answers (www.visualqa.org), and discuss the information it provides. Numerous baselines and methods for VQA are provided and compared with human performance. Our VQA demo is available on CloudCV (http://cloudcv.org/vqa)."

                "text": "We present MCTest, a freely available set of stories and associated questions intended for research on the machine comprehension of text. Previous work on machine comprehension (e.g., semantic modeling) has made great strides, but primarily focuses either on limited-domain datasets, or on solving a more restricted goal (e.g., open-domain relation extraction). In contrast, MCTest requires machines to answer multiple-choice reading comprehension questions about fictional stories, directly tackling the high-level goal of open-domain machine comprehension. Reading comprehension can test advanced abilities such as causal reasoning and understanding the world, yet, by being multiple-choice, still provide a clear metric. By being fictional, the answer typically can be found only in the story itself. The stories and questions are also carefully limited to those a young child would understand, reducing the world knowledge that is required for the task. We present the scalable crowd-sourcing methods that allow us to cheaply construct a dataset of 500 stories and 2000 questions. By screening workers (with grammar tests) and stories (with grading), we have ensured that the data is the same quality as another set that we manually edited, but at one tenth the editing cost. By being open-domain, yet carefully restricted, we hope MCTest will serve to encourage research and provide a clear metric for advancement on the machine comprehension of text. 1 Reading Comprehension A major goal for NLP is for machines to be able to understand text as well as people. Several research disciplines are focused on this problem: for example, information extraction, relation extraction, semantic role labeling, and recognizing textual entailment. Yet these techniques are necessarily evaluated individually, rather than by how much they advance us towards the end goal. On the other hand, the goal of semantic parsing is the machine comprehension of text (MCT), yet its evaluation requires adherence to a specific knowledge representation, and it is currently unclear what the best representation is, for open-domain text. We believe that it is useful to directly tackle the top-level task of MCT. For this, we need a way to measure progress. One common method for evaluating someone\u2019s understanding of text is by giving them a multiple-choice reading comprehension test. This has the advantage that it is objectively gradable (vs. essays) yet may test a range of abilities such as causal or counterfactual reasoning, inference among relations, or just basic understanding of the world in which the passage is set. Therefore, we propose a multiple-choice reading comprehension task as a way to evaluate progress on MCT. We have built a reading comprehension dataset containing 500 fictional stories, with 4 multiple choice questions per story. It was built using methods which can easily scale to at least 5000 stories, since the stories were created, and the curation was done, using crowd sourcing almost entirely, at a total of $4.00 per story. We plan to periodically update the dataset to ensure that methods are not overfitting to the existing data. The dataset is open-domain, yet restricted to concepts and words that a 7 year old is expected to understand. This task is still beyond the capability of today\u2019s computers and algorithms."

Such descriptions are by design mainly visual and thus naturally form an interesting data source for computer vision and computational linguistics. In this work we propose a novel dataset which contains transcribed ADs, which are temporally aligned to full length HD movies. In addition we also collected the aligned movie scripts which have been used in prior work and compare the two different sources of descriptions. In total the MPII Movie Description dataset (MPII-MD) contains a parallel corpus of over 68K sentences and video snippets from 94 HD movies. We characterize the dataset by benchmarking different approaches for generating video descriptions. Comparing ADs to scripts, we find that ADs are far more visual and describe precisely what is shown rather than what should happen according to the scripts created prior to movie production."

Our model performs 1.8 times better than the only published results on an existing image QA dataset. We also present a question generation algorithm that converts image descriptions, which are widely available, into QA form. We used this algorithm to produce an order-of-magnitude larger dataset, with more evenly distributed answers. A suite of baseline results on this new dataset are also presented."

We obtain such synopses from websites such as Wikipedia and propose various methods to align each sentence of the plot to shots in the video. Thus, the semantic story-based video retrieval problem is transformed into a much simpler text-based search. Finally, we return the set of shots aligned to the sentences as the video snippet corresponding to the query. The alignment is performed by first computing a similarity score between every shot and sentence through cues such as character identities and keyword matches between plot synopses and subtitles. We then formulate the alignment as an optimization problem and solve it efficiently using dynamic programming. We evaluate our methods on the fifth season of a TV series Buffy the Vampire Slayer and show encouraging results for both the alignment and the retrieval of story events."

However, the highly-varied nature of language presents a major barrier to its effective use. What is needed are models that can reason over uncertainty over both videos and text. In this paper, we tackle the core task of person naming: assigning names of people in the cast to human tracks in TV videos. Screenplay scripts accompanying the video provide some crude supervision about who\u2019s in the video. However, even the basic problem of knowing who is mentioned in the script is often difficult, since language often refers to people using pronouns (e.g., \u201che\u201d) and nominals (e.g., \u201cman\u201d) rather than actual names (e.g., \u201cSusan\u201d). Resolving the identity of these mentions is the task of coreference resolution, which is an active area of research in natural language processing. We develop a joint model for person naming and coreference resolution, and in the process, infer a latent alignment between tracks and mentions. We evaluate our model on both vision and NLP tasks on a new dataset of 19 TV episodes. On both tasks, we significantly outperform the independent baselines."

Unlike previous methods, our approach can annotate arbitrary videos without requiring the expensive collection and annotation of a similar training video corpus.

By combining latest advances in image representation and natural language processing, we propose Neural-Image-QA, an end-to-end formulation to this problem for which all parts are trained jointly. In contrast to previous efforts, we are facing a multi-modal problem where the language output (answer) is conditioned on visual and natural language input (image and question). Our approach Neural-Image-QA doubles the performance of the previous best approach on this problem. We provide additional insights into the problem by analyzing how much information is contained only in the language part for which we provide a new human baseline. To study human consensus, which is related to the ambiguities inherent in this challenging task, we propose two novel metrics and collect additional answers which extends the original DAQUAR dataset to DAQUAR-Consensus."

This dataset, the Visual Madlibs dataset, is collected using automatically produced fill-in-the-blank templates designed to gather targeted descriptions about: people and objects, their appearances, activities, and interactions, as well as inferences about the general scene or its broader context. We provide several analyses of the Visual Madlibs dataset and demonstrate its applicability to two new description generation tasks: focused description generation, and multiple-choice question-answering for images. Experiments using joint-embedding and deep learning methods show promising results on these tasks."

Using the continuity of text from books, we train an encoder-decoder model that tries to reconstruct the surrounding sentences of an encoded passage. Sentences that share semantic and syntactic properties are thus mapped to similar vector representations. We next introduce a simple vocabulary expansion method to encode words that were not seen as part of training, allowing us to expand our vocabulary to a million words. After training our model, we extract and evaluate our vectors with linear models on 8 tasks: semantic relatedness, paraphrase detection, image-sentence ranking, question-type classification and 4 benchmark sentiment and subjectivity datasets. The end result is an off-the-shelf encoder that can produce highly generic sentence representations that are robust and perform well in practice."

Harvesting automatically labeled sequences of actions from video would enable creation of large-scale and highly-varied datasets. To enable such collection, we focus on the task of recovering scene structure in movies and TV series for object tracking and action retrieval. We present a weakly supervised algorithm that uses the screenplay and closed captions to parse a movie into a hierarchy of shots and scenes. Scene boundaries in the movie are aligned with screenplay scene labels and shots are reordered into a sequence of long continuous tracks or threads which allow for more accurate tracking of people, actions and objects. Scene segmentation, alignment, and shot threading are formulated as inference in a unified generative model and a novel hierarchical dynamic programming algorithm that can handle alignment and jump-limited reorderings in linear time is presented. We present quantitative and qualitative results on movie alignment and parsing, and use the recovered structure to improve character naming and retrieval of common actions in several episodes of popular TV series."

To measure progress towards that goal, we argue for the usefulness of a set of proxy tasks that evaluate reading comprehension via question answering. Our tasks measure understanding in several ways: whether a system is able to answer questions via chaining facts, simple induction, deduction and many more. The tasks are designed to be prerequisites for any system that aims to be capable of conversing with a human. We believe many existing learning systems can currently not solve them, and hence our aim is to classify these tasks into skill sets, so that researchers can identify (and then rectify) the failings of their systems. We also extend and improve the recently introduced Memory Networks model, and show it is able to solve some, but not all, of the tasks."

We investigate the problem of aligning scripts to TV video/movies in cases where subtitles are not available, e.g. in the case of silent films or for film passages which are non-verbal. To this end we identify a number of \u201cmodes of alignment\u201d and train classifiers for each of these. The modes include visual features, such as locations and face recognition, and audio features such as speech. In each case the feature gives some alignment information, but is too noisy when used independently. We show that combining the different features into a single cost function and optimizing this using dynamic programming, leads to a performance superior to each of the individual features. The method is assessed on episodes from the situation comedy Seinfeld, and on Charlie Chaplin and Indian movies."

In this paper we present a new problem: to align book chapters with video scenes. Such an alignment facilitates finding differences between the adaptation and the original source, and also acts as a basis for deriving rich descriptions from the novel for the video clips. We propose an efficient method to compute an alignment between book chapters and video scenes using matching dialogs and character identities as cues. A major consideration is to allow the alignment to be non-sequential. Our suggested shortest path based approach deals with the non-sequential alignments and can be used to determine whether a video scene was part of the original book. We create a new data set involving two popular novel-to-film adaptations with widely varying properties and compare our method against other text-to-video alignment baselines. Using the alignment, we present a qualitative analysis of describing the video through rich narratives obtained from the novel."

Importantly, in doing so, we reason about which particular object each noun/pronoun is referring to in the image. This allows us to utilize visual information in order to disambiguate the so-called coreference resolution problem that arises in text. Towards this goal, we propose a structure prediction model that exploits potentials computed from text and RGB-D imagery to reason about the class of the 3D objects, the scene type, as well as to align the nouns/pronouns with the referred visual objects. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the challenging NYU-RGBD v2 dataset, which we enrich with natural lingual descriptions. We show that our approach significantly improves 3D detection and scene classification accuracy, and is able to reliably estimate the text-to-image alignment. Furthermore, by using textual and visual information, we are also able to successfully deal with coreference in text, improving upon the state-of-the-art Stanford coreference system [15]."

In order to provide natural language descriptions for visual content, this paper combines two important ingredients. First, we generate a rich semantic representation of the visual content including e.g. object and activity labels. To predict the semantic representation we learn a CRF to model the relationships between different components of the visual input. And second, we propose to formulate the generation of natural language as a machine translation problem using the semantic representation as source language and the generated sentences as target language. For this we exploit the power of a parallel corpus of videos and textual descriptions and adapt statistical machine translation to translate between our two languages. We evaluate our video descriptions on the TACoS dataset, which contains video snippets aligned with sentence descriptions. Using automatic evaluation and human judgments we show significant improvements over several baseline approaches, motivated by prior work. Our translation approach also shows improvements over related work on an image description task."

In this paper, we present a generative model based on a deep recurrent architecture that combines recent advances in computer vision and machine translation and that can be used to generate natural sentences describing an image. The model is trained to maximize the likelihood of the target description sentence given the training image. Experiments on several datasets show the accuracy of the model and the fluency of the language it learns solely from image descriptions. Our model is often quite accurate, which we verify both qualitatively and quantitatively. For instance, while the current state-of-the-art BLEU-1 score (the higher the better) on the Pascal dataset is 25, our approach yields 59, to be compared to human performance around 69. We also show BLEU-1 score improvements on Flickr30k, from 56 to 66, and on SBU, from 19 to 28. Lastly, on the newly released COCO dataset, we achieve a BLEU-4 of 27.7, which is the current state-of-the-art."

Solutions to image description have either focused on a top-down approach of generating language through combinations of object detections and language models or bottom-up propagation of keyword tags from training images to test images through probabilistic or nearest neighbor techniques. In contrast, describing videos with natural language is a less studied problem. In this paper, we combine ideas from the bottom-up and top-down approaches to image description and propose a method for video description that captures the most relevant contents of a video in a natural language description. We propose a hybrid system consisting of a low level multimodal latent topic model for initial keyword annotation, a middle level of concept detectors and a high level module to produce final lingual descriptions. We compare the results of our system to human descriptions in both short and long forms on two datasets, and demonstrate that final system output has greater agreement with the human descriptions than any single level."

Our approach leverages datasets of images and their sentence descriptions to learn about the inter-modal correspondences between language and visual data. Our alignment model is based on a novel combination of Convolutional Neural Networks over image regions, bidirectional Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) over sentences, and a structured objective that aligns the two modalities through a multimodal embedding. We then describe a Multimodal Recurrent Neural Network architecture that uses the inferred alignments to learn to generate novel descriptions of image regions. We demonstrate that our alignment model produces state of the art results in retrieval experiments on Flickr8K, Flickr30K and MSCOCO datasets. We then show that the generated descriptions outperform retrieval baselines on both full images and on a new dataset of region-level annotations. Finally, we conduct large-scale analysis of our RNN language model on the Visual Genome dataset of 4.1 million captions and highlight the differences between image and region-level caption statistics."

State-of-the-art methods learn action and role models from detailed spatio temporal annotations, which requires extensive human effort. In this work, we propose a method to learn such models based on natural language descriptions of the training videos, which are easier to collect and scale with the number of actions and roles. There are two challenges with using this form of weak supervision: First, these descriptions only provide a high-level summary and often do not directly mention the actions and roles occurring in a video. Second, natural language descriptions do not provide spatio temporal annotations of actions and roles. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a topic-based semantic relatedness (SR) measure between a video description and an action and role label, and incorporate it into a posterior regularization objective. Our event recognition system based on these action and role models matches the state-of-the-art method on the TRECVID-MED11 event kit, despite weaker supervision."

Unlike previous approaches that map both sentences and images to a common embedding, we enable the generation of novel sentences given an image. Using the same model, we can also reconstruct the visual features associated with an image given its visual description. We use a novel recurrent visual memory that automatically learns to remember long-term visual concepts to aid in both sentence generation and visual feature reconstruction. We evaluate our approach on several tasks. These include sentence generation, sentence retrieval and image retrieval. State-of-the-art results are shown for the task of generating novel image descriptions. When compared to human generated captions, our automatically generated captions are preferred by humans over $19.8\\%$ of the time. Results are better than or comparable to state-of-the-art results on the image and sentence retrieval tasks for methods using similar visual features."

The input are initial noisy estimates of the objects and scenes detected in the image using state of the art trained detectors. As predicting actions from still images directly is unreliable, we use a language model trained from the English Gigaword corpus to obtain their estimates; together with probabilities of co-located nouns, scenes and prepositions. We use these estimates as parameters on a HMM that models the sentence generation process, with hidden nodes as sentence components and image detections as the emissions. Experimental results show that our strategy of combining vision and language produces readable and descriptive sentences compared to naive strategies that use vision alone."

Towards this goal, we first parse the sentential descriptions into a semantic graph, which is then matched to visual concepts using a generalized bipartite matching algorithm. Our approach exploits object appearance, motion and spatial relations, and learns the importance of each term using structure prediction. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a new dataset designed for semantic search in the context of autonomous driving, which exhibits complex and highly dynamic scenes with many objects. We show that our approach is able to locate a major portion of the objects described in the query with high accuracy, and improve the relevance in video retrieval."

The field appears to be advancing closer to this goal with recent breakthroughs in deep learning for natural language grounding in static images. In this paper, we propose to translate videos directly to sentences using a unified deep neural network with both convolutional and recurrent structure. Described video datasets are scarce, and most existing methods have been applied to toy domains with a small vocabulary of possible words. By transferring knowledge from 1.2M+ images with category labels and 100,000+ images with captions, our method is able to create sentence descriptions of open-domain videos with large vocabularies. We compare our approach with recent work using language generation metrics, subject, verb, and object prediction accuracy, and a human evaluation."

The highly parallel nature of this data allows us to use simple n-gram comparisons to measure both the semantic adequacy and lexical dissimilarity of paraphrase candidates. In addition to being simple and efficient to compute, experiments show that these metrics correlate highly with human judgments."

Specifically, we extract actor/action pairs from the script and use them as constraints in a discriminative clustering framework. The corresponding optimization problem is formulated as a quadratic program under linear constraints. People in video are represented by automatically extracted and tracked faces together with corresponding motion features. First, we apply the proposed framework to the task of learning names of characters in the movie and demonstrate significant improvements over previous methods used for this task. Second, we explore the joint actor/action constraint and show its advantage for weakly supervised action learning. We validate our method in the challenging setting of localizing and recognizing characters and their actions in feature length movies Casablanca and American Beauty."

Our previous work (Everingham et al.

In this paper we build on that method, extending the coverage greatly by the detection and recognition of characters in profile views. In addition, we make the following contributions: (i) seamless tracking, integration and recognition of profile and frontal detections, and (ii) a character specific multiple kernel classifier which is able to learn the features best able to discriminate between the characters. We report results on seven episodes of the TV series \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\", demonstrating significantly increased coverage and performance with respect to previous methods on this material."

Our pipeline effectively unifies joint image-text embedding models with multimodal neural language models. We introduce the structure-content neural language model that disentangles the structure of a sentence to its content, conditioned on representations produced by the encoder. The encoder allows one to rank images and sentences while the decoder can generate novel descriptions from scratch. Using LSTM to encode sentences, we match the state-of-the-art performance on Flickr8K and Flickr30K without using object detections. We also set new best results when using the 19-layer Oxford convolutional network. Furthermore we show that with linear encoders, the learned embedding space captures multimodal regularities in terms of vector space arithmetic e.g. *image of a blue car* - \"blue\" + \"red\" is near images of red cars. Sample captions generated for 800 images are made available for comparison."

While some commonsense knowledge is explicitly stated in human-generated text and can be learnt by mining the web, much of it is unwritten. It is often unnecessary and even unnatural to write about commonsense facts. While unwritten, this commonsense knowledge is not unseen! The visual world around us is full of structure modeled by commonsense knowledge. Can machines learn common sense simply by observing our visual world? Unfortunately, this requires automatic and accurate detection of objects, their attributes, poses, and interactions between objects, which remain challenging problems. Our key insight is that while visual common sense is depicted in visual content, it is the semantic features that are relevant and not low-level pixel information. In other words, photorealism is not necessary to learn common sense. We explore the use of human-generated abstract scenes made from clipart for learning common sense. In particular, we reason about the plausibility of an interaction or relation between a pair of nouns by measuring the similarity of the relation and nouns with other relations and nouns we have seen in abstract scenes. We show that the commonsense knowledge we learn is complementary to what can be learnt from sources of text."

The semantic meaning of images depends on the presence of objects, their attributes and their relations to other objects. But precisely characterizing this dependence requires extracting complex visual information from an image, which is in general a difficult and yet unsolved problem. In this paper, we propose studying semantic information in abstract images created from collections of clip art. Abstract images provide several advantages over real images. They allow for the direct study of how to infer high-level semantic information, since they remove the reliance on noisy low-level object, attribute and relation detectors, or the tedious hand-labeling of real images. Importantly, abstract images also allow the ability to generate sets of semantically similar scenes. Finding analogous sets of real images that are semantically similar would be nearly impossible. We create 1,002 sets of 10 semantically similar abstract images with corresponding written descriptions. We thoroughly analyze this dataset to discover semantically important features, the relations of words to visual features and methods for measuring semantic similarity. Finally, we study the relation between the saliency and memorability of objects and their semantic importance."

The core part of such a system is the semantic parser that maps questions to logical forms. Semantic parsers are typically trained from examples of questions annotated with their target logical forms, but this type of annotation is expensive.Our goal is to instead learn a semantic parser from question\u2013answer pairs, where the logical form is modeled as a latent variable. We develop a new semantic formalism, dependency-based compositional semantics (DCS) and define a log-linear distribution over DCS logical forms. The model parameters are estimated using a simple procedure that alternates between beam search and numerical optimization. On two standard semantic parsing benchmarks, we show that our system obtains comparable accuracies to even state-of-the-art systems that do require annotated logical forms."

In this paper, we strive to build a computational model that predicts the motivation behind the actions of people from images. To our knowledge, this challenging problem has not yet been extensively explored in computer vision. We present a novel learning based framework that uses high-level visual recognition to infer why people are performing an actions in images. However, the information in an image alone may not be sufficient to automatically solve this task. Since humans can rely on their own experiences to infer motivation, we propose to give computer vision systems access to some of these experiences by using recently developed natural language models to mine knowledge stored in massive amounts of text. While we are still far away from automatically inferring motivation, our results suggest that transferring knowledge from language into vision can help machines understand why a person might be performing an action in an image."

The architecture is a form of Memory Network [23] but unlike the model in that work, it is trained end-to-end, and hence requires significantly less supervision during training, making it more generally applicable in realistic settings. It can also be seen as an extension of RNNsearch [2] to the case where multiple computational steps (hops) are performed per output symbol. The flexibility of the model allows us to apply it to tasks as diverse as (synthetic) question answering [22] and to language modeling. For the former our approach is competitive with Memory Networks, but with less supervision. For the latter, on the Penn TreeBank and Text8 datasets our approach demonstrates comparable performance to RNNs and LSTMs. In both cases we show that the key concept of multiple computational hops yields improved results."

This is achieved by gathering images of complex everyday scenes containing common objects in their natural context. Objects are labeled using per-instance segmentations to aid in precise object localization. Our dataset contains photos of 91 objects types that would be easily recognizable by a 4 year old. With a total of 2.5 million labeled instances in 328k images, the creation of our dataset drew upon extensive crowd worker involvement via novel user interfaces for category detection, instance spotting and instance segmentation. We present a detailed statistical analysis of the dataset in comparison to PASCAL, ImageNet, and SUN. Finally, we provide baseline performance analysis for bounding box and segmentation detection results using a Deformable Parts Model."

One contribution is our technique for the automatic collection of this new dataset \u2013 performing a huge number of Flickr queries and then filtering the noisy results down to 1 million images with associated visually relevant captions. Such a collection allows us to approach the extremely challenging problem of description generation using relatively simple non-parametric methods and produces surprisingly effective results. We also develop methods incorporating many state of the art, but fairly noisy, estimates of image content to produce even more pleasing results. Finally we introduce a new objective performance measure for image captioning."

We develop a novel recurrent convolutional architecture suitable for large-scale visual learning which is end-to-end trainable, and demonstrate the value of these models on benchmark video recognition tasks, image description and retrieval problems, and video narration challenges. In contrast to current models which assume a fixed spatio-temporal receptive field or simple temporal averaging for sequential processing, recurrent convolutional models are \u201cdoubly deep\u201d in that they can be compositional in spatial and temporal \u201clayers\u201d. Such models may have advantages when target concepts are complex and/or training data are limited. Learning long-term dependencies is possible when nonlinearities are incorporated into the network state updates. Long-term RNN models are appealing in that they directly can map variable-length inputs (e.g., video frames) to variable length outputs (e.g., natural language text) and can model complex temporal dynamics; yet they can be optimized with backpropagation. Our recurrent long-term models are directly connected to modern visual convnet models and can be jointly trained to simultaneously learn temporal dynamics and convolutional perceptual representations. Our results show such models have distinct advantages over state-of-the-art models for recognition or generation which are separately defined and/or optimized."

The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm."

Whereas the tremendous recent progress in object recognition tasks is due to the availability of large datasets like ImageNet and the rise of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for learning high-level features, performance at scene recognition has not attained the same level of success. This may be because current deep features trained from ImageNet are not competitive enough for such tasks. Here, we introduce a new scene-centric database called Places with over 7 million labeled pictures of scenes. We propose new methods to compare the density and diversity of image datasets and show that Places is as dense as other scene datasets and has more diversity. Using CNN, we learn deep features for scene recognition tasks, and establish new state-of-the-art results on several scene-centric datasets. A visualization of the CNN layers' responses allows us to show differences in the internal representations of object-centric and scene-centric networks."

The main hallmark of this architecture is the improved utilization of the computing resources inside the network. By a carefully crafted design, we increased the depth and width of the network while keeping the computational budget constant. To optimize quality, the architectural decisions were based on the Hebbian principle and the intuition of multi-scale processing. One particular incarnation used in our submission for ILSVRC14 is called GoogLeNet, a 22 layers deep network, the quality of which is assessed in the context of classification and detection."

While there are many problems which are simply problems of certain technical decisions, other areas are more fundamental and lead to different perspectives and eventually implementations of service oriented systems. We argue that the current emphasis of service orientation as a collection of interface descriptions misses the critical point of services, which is that they revolve around resources. With a more resource-centered approach, the investment into a service oriented architecture can be made much more promising, because the resource-centered approach is better suited for the design of loosely coupled systems than the current interface-based approach."
