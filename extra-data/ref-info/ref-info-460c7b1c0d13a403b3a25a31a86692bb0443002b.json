Many visual feature representations have been explored and many systems built. While these research efforts establish the basis of CBIR, the usefulness of the proposed approaches is limited. Specifically, these efforts have relatively ignored two distinct characteristics of CBIR systems: (1) the gap between high level concepts and low level features; (2) subjectivity of human perception of visual content. This paper proposes a relevance feedback based interactive retrieval approach, which effectively takes into account the above two characteristics in CBIR. During the retrieval process, the user's high level query and perception subjectivity are captured by dynamically updated weights based on the user's relevance feedback. The experimental results show that the proposed approach greatly reduces the user's effort of composing a query and captures the user's information need more precisely."

However, successful content-based image retrieval systems require the integration of the two. There is an urgent need to develop integration mechanisms to link the image retrieval model to text retrieval model, such that the well established text retrieval techniques can be utilized. Approaches of converting image feature vectors (IF domain) to weighted-term vectors (IR domain) are proposed in this paper. Furthermore, the relevance feedback technique from the IR domain is used in content-based image retrieval to demonstrate the effectiveness of this conversion. Experimental results show that the image retrieval precision increases considerably by using the proposed integration approach."

Two key properties of QBIC are (1) its use of image and video content-computable properties of color, texture, shape and motion of images, videos and their objects-in the queries, and (2) its graphical query language, in which queries are posed by drawing, selecting and other graphical means.

approach for utilizing many data dependent user dependent and task dependent features in a semi automated tool Instead of requiring universal similarity measures or manual selection of relevant features the approach provides a learning algorithm for selecting and combining groupings of the data where groupings can be induced by highly spe cialized and context dependent features The se lection process is guided by a rich example based interaction with the user The inherent com binatorics of using multiple features is reduced by a multistage grouping generation weighting and collection process The stages closest to the user are trained fastest and slowly propagate their adaptations back to earlier stages The weighting stage adapts the collection stage s search space across uses so that in later interactions good groupings are found given few examples from the user Described is an interactive time imple mentation of this architecture for semi automatic within image segmentation and across image la beling driven by concurrently active color mod els texture models or manually provided group ings Issues for digital libraries Digital libraries of images video and sound are a rich area for pattern recognition research They also introduce a host of new problems and requirements since the range of possible queries is immense and requires the utilization of many spe cialized features Also systems for retrieval browsing and annotation i e classifying regions often must perform with only a small number of examples from a user i e an insuf cient amount of training data by traditional requirements Thus the area is doubly exciting since it presents the eld of pattern recognition with new challenges while beckoning in new applications One important issue for digital libraries is nding good models and similarity measures for comparing database en tries A part of this di culty is that feature extraction and comparison methods are highly data dependent see Figure This work was supported in part by BT PLC Hewlett Packard Labs and NEC for an example with texture Similarity measures are also user and task dependent as demonstrated by Figure Un fortunately these dependencies are not at this point under stood well enough especially by the typical digital library user to permit careful selection of the optimal measure be forehand Note that the multi resolution simultaneous auto regressive MRSAR model of which fares poorly com pared to the shift invariant eigenvector EV model in the above two examples scores clearly above the EV model on the standard Brodatz database On the same test data but for a perceptually motivated similarity criteria based on periodicity directionality and randomness both the EV and MRSAR models are beat by a new Wold based model Attempts to use intuitive texture features like coarseness contrast and directionality are appropri ate in some cases but do not fully determine all the qualities people might use in judging similarity Thus an a priori opti mal context dependent selection among similarity measures either by human or computer seems unlikely Next the scope of queries that databases need to address is immense Current computational solutions attempt to of fer location of perceptual content nd round red objects and objective content nd pictures of people in Boston Desirable queries also extend to subjective content give me a scene of a romantic forest task speci c content I need something with open space to place text collaborative con tent show me pictures children like and more An swering such queries requires a variety of features or meta data to be attached to the data in a digital library some of which may not be computable directly from the data The implication for algorithms is that they cannot rely on one model or one small set of carefully picked features but will have to drink from a veritable feature hydrant from which only a few drops may be relevant for the query Finally there is a signi cant need for semi automated ver sus fully automated tools Human computer synergy can make ill de ned tasks manageable and has the power to over come many of the problems of current pattern recognition tools An important application of semi automated tools is to assist the population of a database viz the creation of metadata A crucial technical issue for such tools is the selec tion and combination of existing features which features are most useful for a given query or annotation how should they be combined and which combinations are useful for the sys tem to remember so that it gets smarter with increased use This last point is important since not only are the queries immensely variable but the amount of training data i e ex amples provided by a user of what they do and don t want available at any instant is usually limited Hence a tool should strive to improve its generalization ability"

Examples of the content we use include color, texture, and shape of image objects and regions. Potential applications include medical (`Give me other images that contain a tumor with a texture like this one'), photo-journalism (`Give me images that have blue at the top and red at the bottom'), and many others in art, fashion, cataloging, retailing, and industry. Key issues include derivation and computation of attributes of images and objects that provide useful query functionality, retrieval methods based on similarity as opposed to exact match, query by image example or user drawn image, the user interfaces, query refinement and navigation, high dimensional database indexing, and automatic and semi-automatic database population. We currently have a prototype system written in X/Motif and C running on an RS/6000 that allows a variety of queries, and a test database of over 1000 images and 1000 objects populated from commercially available photo clip art images. In this paper we present the main algorithms for color texture, shape and sketch query that we use, show example query results, and discuss future directions."

Systems are beginning to emerge in both the research and commercial sectors based on 'content-based' image retrieval, a technique which explicitly manages image assets by directly representing their visual attributes. The Virage image search engine provides an open framework for building such systems. The Virage engine expresses visual features as image 'primitives.' Primitives can be very general (such as color, shape, or texture) or quite domain specific (face recognition, cancer cell detection, etc.). The basic philosophy underlying this architecture is a transformation from the data-rich representation of explicit image pixels to a compact, semantic-rich representation of visually salient characteristics. In practice, the design of such primitives is non-trivial, and is driven by a number of conflicting real-world constraints (e.g. computation time vs. accuracy). The virage engine provides an open framework for developers to 'plug-in' primitives to solve specific image management problems. The architecture has been designed to support both static images and video in a unified paradigm. The infrastructure provided by the Virage engine can be utilized to address high-level problems as well, such as automatic, unsupervised keyword assignment, or image classification."

We present here an implementation of NeTra, a prototype image retrieval system that uses color, texture, shape and spatial location information in segmented image regions to search and retrieve similar regions from the database. A distinguishing aspect of this system is its incorporation of a robust automated image segmentation algorithm that allows object- or region-based search. Image segmentation significantly improves the quality of image retrieval when images contain multiple complex objects. Images are segmented into homogeneous regions at the time of ingest into the database, and image attributes that represent each of these regions are computed. In addition to image segmentation, other important components of the system include an efficient color representation, and indexing of color, texture, and shape features for fast search and retrieval. This representation allows the user to compose interesting queries such as \u201cretrieve all images that contain regions that have the color of object A, texture of object B, shape of object C, and lie in the upper of the image\u201d, where the individual objects could be regions belonging to different images. A Java-based web implementation of NeTra is available at http://vivaldi.ece.ucsb.edu/Netra."

Most of this data is multimedia in nature, including digital images, video, audio and simple text data. To make use of this vast amount of multimedia data, we need to develop techniques to e ciently retrieve information over large multimedia repositories based on their content. Due to the di culty in capturing the content of multimedia objects using textual annotations and the non-scalability of the approach to large data sets (due to a high degree of manual e ort required in de ning the annotations), the approach based on supporting content-based retrieval over visual features has become a promising research direction. This is evidenced by several prototypes[15, 8, 6, 4] and commercial systems[3, 2] that have been built recently."

New visual information in the form of images, graphics, animations and videos is being published on the Web at an incredible rate. However, cataloging this visual data is beyond the capabilities of current text-based Web search engines. In this paper, we describe a complete system by which visual information on the Web is (1) collected by automated agents, (2) processed in both text and visual feature domains, (3) catalogued and (4) indexed for fast search and retrieval. We introduce an image and video search engine which utilizes both text-based navigation and content-based technology for searching visually through the catalogued images and videos. Finally, we provide an initial evaluation based upon the cataloging of over one half million images and videos collected from the Web."

To address this problem, this paper proposes the concept of similarity matching toolkit which consists of different similarity measures simulating human's perceptions of the given feature from di erent aspects. The toolkit supports a feedback-driven tool selection mechanism which adapts to the similarity measure that best ts the user's perception. To illustrate the advantage of the proposed toolkit approach, we apply it to shape-based image retrieval. The paper describes a shape matching toolkit consisting of four transformation-invariant and computationally e cient matching tools and describes how relevance feedback can be used for automatic tool selection. Experimental results validate the exibility of the matching toolkit and show the e ectiveness of the relevance feedback for shape matching tool selection."

The main image representations we deal with are fractal image coding and wavelet transform coding. The experiments we conducted in this research demonstrate the effectiveness of our approaches. \nWe first investigate the image representation through fractal image coding, which exploits self-similarity within an image. We build an image data model called nona-tree to facilitate image retrieval based on matching of fractal codes between the query image and database images. It ensures a query can be carried out to retrieve images based on the query image not only as a whole example image, but also as a subimage. \nWe then extend the work of fractal coding to joint fractal coding, a technique which can be utilized to explore similarities between images. An effective similarity metric has been set up for measuring degree of similarity between the query image and a database image. Joint fractal coding is proved to be a powerful clustering approach for large image databases. We believe that the clustering of images into categories on the basis of content is a prerequisite to the effective and efficient execution of such queries. Once the query is narrowed to a specific category, image retrieval can then proceed efficiently. \nWe also describe the implementation of an image retrieval approach based on measuring the feature vectors constructed by subband energies obtained from wavelet transform. We compare the effectiveness of image retrieval from the fractal coding approach and the wavelet approach. \nFinally we describe the design and implementation of ImageSeek, a Graphical User Interface developed by X Windows/Motif widget sets, for interactively performing image retrieval. We demonstrate the functions we have for the interface, and discuss future integration into a more comprehensive multimedia retrieving tool. \nThe results presented in this dissertation collectively offer a viable and practical approach to the design and implementation of effective image clustering and image retrieval in a large image database environment. We believe that the research conducted is well suited for incorporation into many digital library applications to support effective and efficient visual data retrieval."

In applications such as database retrieval, it is important that image features used in pattern comparison provide good measures of image perceptual similarities. We present an image model with a new set of features that address the challenge of perceptual similarity. The model is based on the 2D Wold decomposition of homogeneous random fields. The three resulting mutually orthogonal subfields have perceptual properties which can be described as \"periodicity,\" \"directionality,\" and \"randomness,\" approximating what are indicated to be the three most important dimensions of human texture perception. The method presented improves upon earlier Wold-based models in its tolerance to a variety of local inhomogeneities which arise in natural textures and its invariance under image transformation such as rotation. An image retrieval algorithm based on the new texture model is presented. Different types of image features are aggregated for similarity comparison by using a Bayesian probabilistic approach. The, effectiveness of the Wold model at retrieving perceptually similar natural textures is demonstrated in comparison to that of two other well-known pattern recognition methods. The Wold model appears to offer a perceptually more satisfying measure of pattern similarity while exceeding the performance of these other methods by traditional pattern recognition criteria. Examples of natural scene Wold texture modeling are also presented."

This is in contrast to methods such as entering SQL keys manually for each image as it is filed and later correctly re-entering those keys to retrieve the same image. An SQL-based approach does not take into account information that is hard to describe with text, such as sounds and images. Neural networks can be trained to translate `noisy' or chaotic image data into simpler, more reliable feature sets. By converting the images into the level of abstraction necessary for symbolic processing, standard database indexing methods can then be applied, or used in layers of associative database neural networks directly."

The authors show that with this relatively simple feature set, effective texture discrimination can be achieved. In the paper, subband-energy feature sets extracted from the following typical image decompositions are compared: wavelet subband, uniform subband, discrete cosine transform (DCT), and spatial partitioning. The authors report that over 90% correct classification was attained using the feature set in classifying the full Brodatz [1965] collection of 112 textures. Furthermore, the subband energy-based feature set can be readily applied to a system for indexing images by texture content in image databases, since the features can be extracted directly from spatial-frequency decomposed image data. The authors also show that to construct a suitable space for discrimination, Fisher discrimination analysis (Dillon and Goldstein, 1984) can be used to compact the original features into a set of uncorrelated linear discriminant functions. This procedure makes it easier to perform texture-based searches in a database by reducing the dimensionality of the discriminant space. The authors also examine the effects of varying training class size, the number of training classes, the dimension of the discriminant space and number of energy measures used for classification. The authors hope that the performance for texture discrimination of these simple energy-based features will allow images in a database to be efficiently and effectively indexed by contents of their textured regions.<<ETX>>"

To explore video structure at the semantic level this paper presents an effective approach for video scene structure construction, in which shots are grouped into semantic-related scenes. The output of the proposed algorithm provides a structured video that greatly facilitates user's access.

This paper describes some easily computable textural features based on gray-tone spatial dependancies, and illustrates their application in category-identification tasks of three different kinds of image data: photomicrographs of five kinds of sandstones, 1:20 000 panchromatic aerial photographs of eight land-use categories, and Earth Resources Technology Satellite (ERTS) multispecial imagery containing seven land-use categories. We use two kinds of decision rules: one for which the decision regions are convex polyhedra (a piecewise linear decision rule), and one for which the decision regions are rectangular parallelpipeds (a min-max decision rule). In each experiment the data set was divided into two parts, a training set and a test set. Test set identification accuracy is 89 percent for the photomicrographs, 82 percent for the aerial photographic imagery, and 83 percent for the satellite imagery. These results indicate that the easily computable textural features probably have a general applicability for a wide variety of image-classification applications."

A conjunction, such as (Color=\u2018red\u2019) \u2227 (Sound=\u2018loud\u2019), is evaluated by first evaluating the individual conjuncts and then combining the answers by some scoring function. Typical scoring functions include the min (the standard scoring function for the conjunction in fuzzy logic) and the average. We address the question of how to permit the user to weight the importance of atomic subformulas. In particular, we give a semantics for permitting non-uniform weights, by giving an explicit formula (that is based on the underlying scoring function). This semantics permits an efficient implementation with a low database access cost in a multimedia database system in important cases of interest."

Kass et al., proposed a variational technique; Amini used dynamic programming; and Williams and Shah introduced a fast, greedy algorithm. We combine the advantages of the latter two methods in a two-stage algorithm. The first stage is a greedy procedure that provides fast initial convergence. It is enhanced with a cost term that extends over a large number of points to avoid oscillations. The second stage, when accuracy becomes important, uses dynamic programming. This step is accelerated by the use of alternating search neighborhoods and by dropping stable points from the iterations. We have also added several features for user interaction. First, the user can define points of high confidence. Mathematically, this results in an extra cost term and, in that way, the robustness in difficult areas (e.g., noisy edges, sharp corners) is improved. We also give the user the possibility of incremental contour tracking, thus providing feedback on the refinement process. The algorithm has been tested on numerous photographic clip art images and extensive tests on medical images are in progress."

A Gabor feature representation for textured images is proposed, and its performance in pattern retrieval is evaluated on a large texture image database.

A simple hybrid neural network algorithm is used to learn the similarity by simple clustering in the texture feature space. With learning similarity the performance of similar pattern retrieval improves significantly. An important aspect of this work is its application to real image data. Texture feature extraction with similarity learning is used to search through large aerial photographs.

In this paper, we propose two techniques to improve the performance of the basic histogram/moment-based technique. First, we propose to use orthogonal Legendre moments for representing histograms. Since Legendre moments are orthogonal, they provide superior indexing performance compared to regular moments at a similar complexity. Secondly, we propose to compare the histograms of wavelet coefficients at different scales. The wavelet coefficients provide important directional information, and hence improve the performance of the basic histogram-based technique. The proposed scheme can be easily extended to color images and also be integrated into a wavelet-based image coder."

                "text": "One of the most important technologies needed across many traditional and emerging applications is the management of visual information. Every day we are bombarded with information presented in the form of images. So important are images in our world of information technology, that we generate literally millions of images every day, and this number keeps escalating with advances in imaging, visualization, video, and computing technologies. Advances in video technology and its marriage with computing are resulting in the video-computing discipline. High Performance Computing and Communications (HPCC ) is emerging as a key technology for asserting international leadership in industrial, medical, scientific, defense, and environmental areas. Improved computational methods and information management tools are critical in order to enhance the national competitive edge across broad sectors of the economy. The Federal HPCC initiative will address the development of technologies which are essential for building the infrastructure to strengthen our position in meeting the challenges posed by the global developments in industry, political situations, and the environment areas. It would be impossible to cope with this explosion of image information, unless the images were organized for rapid retrieval on demand. A similar situation occurred in the past for numeric and other structured data, and led to the creation of computerized database management systems. In these systems, large amounts of data are organized into fields and important or key fields are used to index the databases making search very efficient. These information management systems have changed several aspects of the modern society. These systems, however, are limited by the fact that they work well only with numeric data and short alpha-numeric strings. Since so much information is in non-alphanumeric form (such as images, video, speech), to deal with such information, researchers started exploring the design and implementation of image databases. But creation of mere image repositories is of little value unless there are methods for fast retrieval of images based on their content, ideally with an efficiency that we find in today's databases. We should be able to search image databases with image-based queries, in addition to alphanumeric queries. The fundamental problem is that images, video, and other similar data differ from numeric data and text in format, and hence they require a totally different technique of organization, indexing, and query processing. We need to consider the issues in visual information management , rather than simply extending the existing database technology to deal with images. We must treat images as one of the central sources of information rather than as an appendix to the main database. A few researchers have addressed problems in image databases. Most of these efforts in image databases, however, focussed either on only a small aspect of the problem, such as data structures or pictorial queries, or on a very narrow application, such as databases for pottery articles of a particular tribe. Other researchers have developed image processing shells which use several images. Clearly, visual information management systems encompass not only databases, but aspects of image processing and image understanding, very sophisticated interfaces, knowledge-based systems, compression and decompression of images. Moreover, memory management and organization issues start becoming much more serious than in the largest alphanumeric databases. In failing to address any of these topics, one may either address only theoretical issues, or may work in a microcosm that will, at best, be extremely narrow in its utility and extensibility. It is clear that the tremendous progress in processing speed and memory technology has made it not only possible, but also attractive to design Visual Information Management Systems (VIMS) for many disparate applications. People already call the 90s the decade of imaging. On considering any of the Grand Challenge problems, such as weather forecasting, air pollution, the earth's biosphere, genome research, or the education network, it becomes clear that the existing database technology must be extended in several new dimensions, from managing tertiary memory to representing an object at varying degrees of detail. Many of the current issues in databases, such as interconnecting heterogeneous databases, are also important to VIMS. Moreover, VIMS have several of their own problems that must be addressed for making progress in challenging industrial and medical applications. Considering the growing need and interest in the organization and retrieval of visual and other non-alphanumeric information, and the insufficient number of academic projects in this area, a workshop on visual information management systems was sponsored Robotics and Machine Inteffigence, and Database and Expert Systems Programs of the National Science Foundation. The aim of the workshop was to bring together active researchers in databases, object- oriented systems, image and signal processing, multi-media, and other related areas to discuss important issues in managing the large amount of visual information that will play a key role in designing information systems of the future. In addition to the researchers in the above and related areas, a few researchers and practitioners interested in applying these systems were also invited."

We approximated in computational form six basic textural features, namely, coarseness, contrast, directionality, line-likeness, regularity, and roughness. In comparison with psychological measurements for human subjects, the computational measures gave good correspondences in rank correlation of 16 typical texture patterns. Similarity measurements using these features were attempted. The discrepancies between human vision and computerized techniques that we encountered in this study indicate fundamental problems in digital analysis of textures.

The development of this transform is motivated by the observation that a large class of natural textures can be modeled as quasi-periodic signals whose dominant frequencies are located in the middle frequency channels. With the transform, it is possible to zoom into any desired frequency channels for further decomposition. In contrast, the conventional pyramid-structured wavelet transform performs further decomposition in low-frequency channels. A progressive texture classification algorithm which is not only computationally attractive but also has excellent performance is developed. The performance of the present method is compared with that of several other methods."
