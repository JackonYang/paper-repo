Results are presented showing that learning long-term dependencies in such recurrent networks using gradient descent is a very difficult task. It is shown how this difficulty arises when robustly latching bits of information with certain attractors. The derivatives of the output at time t with respect to the unit activations at time zero tend rapidly to zero as t increases for most input values. In such a situation, simple gradient descent techniques appear inappropriate. The consideration of alternative optimization methods and architectures is suggested.<<ETX>>"

Most of the proposed training approaches are based on computational ways to efficiently obtain the gradient of the error function, and can be generally grouped into five major groups. In this study we present a derivation that unifies these approaches. We demonstrate that the approaches are only five different ways of solving a particular matrix equation. The second goal of this paper is develop a new algorithm based on the insights gained from the novel formulation. The new algorithm, which is based on approximating the error gradient, has lower computational complexity in computing the weight update than the competing techniques for most typical problems. In addition, it reaches the error minimum in a much smaller number of iterations. A desirable characteristic of recurrent network training algorithms is to be able to update the weights in an on-line fashion. We have also developed an on-line version of the proposed algorithm, that is based on updating the error gradient approximation in a recursive manner."

As a result of the weight adjustments, internal \u2018hidden\u2019 units which are not part of the input or output come to represent important features of the task domain, and the regularities in the task are captured by the interactions of these units. The ability to create useful new features distinguishes back-propagation from earlier, simpler methods such as the perceptron-convergence procedure1."

Fortunately, recent advances in Hessian-free optimization have been able to overcome the difficulties associated with training RNNs, making it possible to apply them successfully to challenging sequence problems. In this paper we demonstrate the power of RNNs trained with the new Hessian-Free optimizer (HF) by applying them to character-level language modeling tasks. The standard RNN architecture, while effective, is not ideally suited for such tasks, so we introduce a new RNN variant that uses multiplicative (or \"gated\") connections which allow the current input character to determine the transition matrix from one hidden state vector to the next. After training the multiplicative RNN with the HF optimizer for five days on 8 high-end Graphics Processing Units, we were able to surpass the performance of the best previous single method for character-level language modeling \u2013 a hierarchical non-parametric sequence model. To our knowledge this represents the largest recurrent neural network application to date."

Metaphorically, the adaptation allows us to find needles in haystacks in the form of very predictive but rarely seen features. Our paradigm stems from recent advances in stochastic optimization and online learning which employ proximal functions to control the gradient steps of the algorithm. We describe and analyze an apparatus for adaptively modifying the proximal function, which significantly simplifies setting a learning rate and results in regret guarantees that are provably as good as the best proximal function that can be chosen in hindsight. We give several efficient algorithms for empirical risk minimization problems with common and important regularization functions and domain constraints. We experimentally study our theoretical analysis and show that adaptive subgradient methods outperform state-of-the-art, yet non-adaptive, subgradient algorithms."

At bifurcation points, the output of a network can change discontinuously with the change of parameters and therefore convergence of gradient descent algorithms is not guaranteed. Furthermore, learning equations used for error gradient estimation can be unstable. However, some kinds of bifurcations are inevitable in training a recurrent network as an automaton or an oscillator. Some of the factors underlying successful training of recurrent networks are investigated, such as choice of initial connections, choice of input patterns, teacher forcing, and truncated learning equations."

We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O. 1. Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms."

One approach is to represent time implicitly by its effects on processing rather than explicitly (as in a spatial representation). The current report develops a proposal along these lines first described by Jordan (1986) which involves the use of recurrent links in order to provide networks with a dynamic memory. In this approach, hidden unit patterns are fed back to themselves; the internal representations which develop thus reflect task demands in the context of prior internal states. A set of simulations is reported which range from relatively simple problems (temporal version of XOR) to discovering syntactic/semantic features for words. The networks are able to learn interesting internal representations which incorporate task demands with memory demands; indeed, in this approach the notion of memory is inextricably bound up with task processing. These representations reveal a rich structure, which allows them to be highly context-dependent while also expressing generalizations across classes of items. These representations suggest a method for representing lexical categories and the type/token distinction."

Each processor updates its state by applying a \u201csigmoidal\u201d scalar nonlinearity to a linear combination of the previous states of all units. We prove that one may simulate all Turing Machines by rational nets. In particular, one can do this in linear time, and there is a net made up of about 1,000 processors which computes a universal partial-recursive function. Products (high order nets) are not required, contrary to what had been stated in the literature. Furthermore, we assert a similar theorem about non-deterministic Turing Machines. Consequences for undecidability and complexity issues about nets are discussed too."

Traditional techniques for estimating these models are based on N gram counts. Despite known weaknesses of N -grams and huge efforts of research communities across many fields (speech recognition, machine translation, neuroscience, artificial intelligence, natural language processing, data compression, psychology etc.), N -grams remained basically the state-of-the-art. The goal of this thesis is to present various architectures of language models that are based on artificial neural networks. Although these models are computationally more expensive than N -gram models, with the presented techniques it is possible to apply them to state-of-the-art systems efficiently. Achieved reductions of word error rate of speech recognition systems are up to 20%, against stateof-the-art N -gram model. The presented recurrent neural network based model achieves the best published performance on well-known Penn Treebank setup.

Although a CPG can oscillate autonomously, its rhythm and phase must be well coordinated with the state of the physical system using sensory inputs. In this paper we propose a learning algorithm for synchronizing neural and physical oscillators with specific phase relationships. Sensory input connections are modified by the correlation between cellular activities and input signals. Simulations show that the learning rule can be used for setting sensory feedback connections to a CPG as well as coupling connections between CPGs."
