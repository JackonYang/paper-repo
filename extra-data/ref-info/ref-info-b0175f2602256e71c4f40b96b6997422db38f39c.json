The understanding phase is based on two knowledge levels: a specific knowledge for each class, called a document model; and knowledge on the whole domain of interest, called a domain model. The invoices of a known class are understood by its document model, while the invoices of an unknown class are understood by using the domain model. The main contribution of this work is related to the use of the physical and logical constraints of the domain of interest for document understanding, without using an OCR system. Our approach has been tested by some experiments that are intended to identify some regions within invoices of unknown classes. In most cases, the results have shown the reliability of the approach."

The multistrategy approach for document classification and understanding has been implemented in a system called PLRS, which embeds two empirical learning systems: RES and INDUBIIH. Given a set of documents whose layout structure has already been detected and such that the membership class has been defined by the user, RES generates the knowledge base of an expert system devoted to the classification of a document. The language used to describe both the layout of the training documents and the learned rules is a first-order language.

To remove this bottleneck, new document processing techniques must be introduced to automatically acquire knowledge from various types of documents. By presenting a survey on the techniques and problems involved, this paper aims at serving as a catalyst to stimulate research in automatic knowledge acquisition through document processing. In this study, a document is considered to have two structures: geometric structure and logical structure. These play a key role in the process of the knowledge acquisition, which can be viewed as a process of acquiring the above structures. Extracting the geometric structure from a document refers to document analysis; mapping the geometric structure into logical structure is regarded as document understanding. Both areas are described in this paper, and the basic concept of document structure and its measurement based on entropy analysis is introduced. Logical structure and geometric models are proposed. Both top-down and bottom-up approaches and their entropy analyses are presented. Different techniques are discussed with practical examples. Mapping methods, such as tree transformation, document formatting knowledge and document format description language, are described. >"

Initially, Pi ODA extracts a part-of hierarchy of nested layout objects such as text-blocks, lines, and words based on their presentation on the page. Subsequently, in a step called logical labeling, the layout objects and their compositions are geometrically analyzed to identify corresponding logical objects that can be related to a human perceptible meaning, such as sender, recipient, and date in a letter. A context-sensitive text recognition for logical objects is then applied using logical vocabularies and syntactic knowledge. As a result, Pi ODA produces a document representation that conforms to the ODA international standard.<<ETX>>"

We propose modeling the document's layout by means of attributed relational graphs, which turn out to be very effective for form registration, as well as for performing a focused search for instruction fields. This search is carried out by means of a hybrid model, where proper algorithms, based on morphological operations and connected components, are integrated with connectionist models. Experimental results are given in order to assess the actual performance of the system."

Domain-specific as well as generic knowledge about document layout is used in order to classify, logically group, and determine the read-order of the individual blocks in the image, i.e., translate the physical structure of the document into a layout-independent logical structure. We have developed a computational model for the derivation of the logical structure of documents. Our model uses a rule-based control structure, as well as a hierarchical multi-level knowledge representation scheme in which knowledge about various types of documents is encoded into a document knowledge base and is used by reasoning processes to make inferences about the document. An important issue addressed in our research is the kind of domain knowledge that is required for such analysis. A document logical structure derivation system (DeLoS) has been developed based on the above model, and has achieved good results in deriving the logical structure of complex multi- articled documents such as newspaper pages. Applications of this approach include its use in information retrieval from digital libraries, as well as in comprehensive document understanding systems."

Document image processing is a crucial process in office automation and begins at the \u2018OCR\u2019 phase with difficulties in document \u2018analysis\u2019 and \u2018understanding\u2019. This paper presents a hybrid and comprehensive approach to document structure analysis. Hybrid in the sense that it makes use of layout (geometrical) as well as textual features of a given document. These features are the base for potential conditions which in turn are used to express fuzzy matched rules of an underlying rule base. Rules can be formulated based on features which might be observed within one specific layout object. However, rules can also express dependencies between different layout objects. In addition to its rule driven analysis, which allows an easy adaptation to specific domains with their specific logical objects, the system contains domain-independent markup algorithms for common objects (e.g., lists)."

According to the specific characteristics of financial documents, it can be concluded that it is possible to build a system for recognizing specific types of financial documents, instead of a complex and general one aiming at different kinds of documents. In this paper, a financial document recognition prototype system which can process bank cheques, payment slips and bills, is presented. It consists of four major parts: (a) document image acquisition including scanning and binarization, (b) fixed document processing subsystem based on the detection of staff lines, (c) flexible document processing subsystem operating in a form description language (FDL), and (d) character recognition. Numerous experimental results are presented and discussed. >"

However, these approaches are applicable to only the same kind of documents because they are based on the paradigm that specifies the structure definition information in advance so as to be able to analyze a particular class of documents intelligently. In this paper, the authors propose a method to recognize the layout structures of multi-kinds of table-form document images. For this purpose, the authors introduce a classification tree to manage the relationships among different classes of layout structures. The authors' recognition system has two modes: layout knowledge acquisition and layout structure recognition. In the layout knowledge acquisition mode, table-form document images are distinguished according to this. Classification tree and then the structure description trees which specify the logical structures of table-form documents are generated automatically. While, in the layout structure recognition mode, individual item fields in the table-form document images are extracted and classified successfully by searching the classification tree and interpreting the structure description tree. >"

The composition of meaningful entities, such as title, author, address, or abstract, on the other, in terms of a logical structure. Both views to the contents of a document are complementary. They relate to each other as being explicitely given by publication guidelines where the position and dimensions of logical objects are precisely described. Moreover such \u201cpublication guidelines\u201d more or less hold for various types of documents. Although they are intuitively understandable for human beings, they are hard to formalize explicitly because of the freedom originators and authors of documents have in order to incorporate their own creativity. However, humans use these intrinsic layout features to get first hints towards the logical meaning of document information.

This system, named STRETCH (STorage and RETrieval by Content of imaged documents), is based on an Archiving and Retrieval Engine, which overcomes the bottleneck of document profiling bypassing some limitations of existing pre-defined indexing schemes. The engine exploits a structured document representation and can activate appropriate methods to characterise and automatically index heterogeneous documents with variable layout. The originality of STRETCH lies principally in the possibility for unskilled users to define the indexes relevant to the document domains of their interest by simply presenting visual examples and applying reliable automatic information extraction methods (document classification, flexible reading strategies) to index the documents automatically, thus creating archives as desired. STRETCH offers ease of use and application programming and the ability to dynamically adapt to new types of documents. The system has been tested in two applications in particular, one concerning passive invoices and the other bank documents. In these applications, several classes of documents are involved. The indexing strategy first automatically classifies the document, thus avoiding pre-sorting, then locates and reads the information pertaining to the specific document class. Experimental results are encouraging overall; in particular, document classification results fulfill the requirements of high-volume application. Integration into production lines is under execution."

One central task in postal automation is the localization of target addresses on mail pieces. After preprocessing, a mail piece consists of a set of bounding boxes for each region. In this paper a formal graph representation for mail pieces will be shown, in which relative constellations of bounding boxes are represented in a qualitative way. From a labeled set of such graphs, a model graph of the domain represented by the training set can be derived automatically. The model graphs only hold qualitative relations between items found on mail pieces of the training set. An inference mechanism based on the A* algorithm is used to find inexact subgraph isomorphism between a learned model and a formerly unseen mail piece. The implemented system has been evaluated on real letters and the recognition results are discussed."

The classification engine is based on a new modular connectionist architecture, where a multilayer perceptron (MLP) acting as a classifier is properly combined with a set of autoassociators \u2013 one for each class \u2013 trained to copy the input to the output layer. The MLP-based classifier selects a small group of classes with high score, that are afterwards verified by the corresponding autoassociators. The learning samples used to train the classifiers are constructed by means of a synthetic noise generator starting from few grey level characters labeled by the user. We report experimental results for comparing three neural architectures: an MLP-based classifier, an autoassociator-based classifier, and the proposed combined architecture. The experiments show that the proposed architecture exhibits the best performance, without increasing significantly the computational burden."

An efficient representation scheme for document images is necessary to solve this problem. Document representation involves techniques of thresholding, skew detection, geometric layout analysis, and logical layout analysis. The derived representation can then be used in document storage and retrieval. Page segmentation is an important stage in representing document images obtained by scanning journal pages. The performance of a document understanding system greatly depends on the correctness of page segmentation and labeling of different regions such as text, tables, images, drawings, and rulers. We use the traditional bottom-up approach based on the connected component extraction to efficiently implement page segmentation and region identification. A new document model which preserves top-down generation information is proposed based on which a document is logically represented for interactive editing, storage, retrieval, transfer, and logical analysis. Our algorithm has a high accuracy and takes approximately 1.4 seconds on a SGI Indy workstation for model creation, including orientation estimation, segmentation, and labeling (text, table, image, drawing, and ruler) for a 2550/spl times/3300 image of a typical journal page scanned at 300 dpi. This method is applicable to documents from various technical journals and can accommodate moderate amounts of skew and noise."

The outline of this method is described as follows. First, ruled lines are extracted from the input image of a form. After that, several lines are grouped as one to be recognised as data corresponding to a sub-form. These lines and sub-forms are both used for understanding the form, taking into account their feature attributes and the relationships between them. Each feature in the input image of a form is expected to correspond to a feature in one of the model forms, which are described as structured features. This correspondence is represented by a node in an association graph, where an arc represents compatible correspondences established on the basis of feature relationships. The best match is found as the largest maximal clique in the association graph. Experimental results show the method is robust and effective for document images of poor quality, and also for various styles of forms."

Recognizing these objects facilitates the recognition of document classes. Some promising results have been achieved by using autoassociator-based artificial neural networks (AANN) in the presence of homogeneously distributed noise. However, the performance drops significantly when dealing with spot-noisy logos, where strips or blobs produce a partial obstruction of the pictures. We propose a new approach for training AANNs especially conceived for dealing with spot noise. The basic idea is to introduce new metrics for assessing the reproduction error in AANNs. The proposed algorithm, referred to as spot-backpropagation (S-BP), is significantly more robust with respect to spot-noise than classical Euclidean norm-based backpropagation (BP). Our experimental results are based on a database of 88 real logos that are artificially corrupted by spot-noise."

At first, logo images are converted into a structured representation based on contour trees. Recursive neural networks are then learnt using the contourtrees as inputs to the neural nets. On the other hand, the contour-tree is constructed by associating a node with each exterior or interior contour extracted from the logo instance. Nodes in the tree are labeled by a feature vector, which describes the contour by means of its perimeter, surrounded area, and a synthetic representation of its curvature plot. The contour-tree representation contains the topological structured information of logo and continuous values pertaining to each contour node. Hence symbolic and sub-symbolic information coexist in the contour-tree representation of logo image. Experimental results are reported on 40 real logos distorted with artificial noise and performance of recursive neural network is compared with another two types of neural approaches."

For each candidate destination address block (DAB), the address block location (ABL) system determines the line segmentation, global orientation, block skew, an indication of whether the address appears to be handwritten or machine printed, and a value indicating the degree of confidence that the block actually contains the destination address. With 20-MHz Sparc processors, the average time per mail piece for the combined hardware and software system components is 0.210 seconds. The system located 89.0% of the addresses as the top choice. Recent developments in the system include the use of a top-down segmentation tool, address syntax analysis using only connected component data, and improvements to the segmentation refinement routines. This has increased top choice performance to 91.4%.<<ETX>>"

At the core of the algorithm are the processes of filtering run lengths, assembling filtered run lengths, generating top silhouette, and thresholding the gradient of the top silhouette to extract one horizontal line at a time. The method is robust in the presence of distortion; it can tolerate significant skew and warping, both local and global, and can bridge significant breaks in lines without too many false positive lines."
