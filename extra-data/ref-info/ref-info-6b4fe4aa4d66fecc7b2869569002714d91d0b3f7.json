                "text": "In the central nervous system the visual pathway from retina to striate cortex provides an opportunity to observe and compare single unit responses at several distinct levels. Patterns of light stimuli most effective in influencing units at one level may no longer be the most effective at the next. From differences in responses at successive stages in the pathway one may hope to gain some understanding of the part each stage plays in visual perception. By shining small spots of light on the light-adapted cat retina Kuffler (1953) showed that ganglion cells have concentric receptive fields, with an 'on' centre and an 'off ' periphery, or vice versa. The 'on' and 'off' areas within a receptive field were found to be mutually antagonistic, and a spot restricted to the centre of the field was more effective than one covering the whole receptive field (Barlow, FitzHugh & Kuffler, 1957). In the freely moving lightadapted cat it was found that the great majority of cortical cells studied gave little or no response to light stimuli covering most of the animal's visual field, whereas small spots shone in a restricted retinal region often evoked brisk responses (Hubel, 1959). A moving spot of light often produced stronger responses than a stationary one, and sometimes a moving spot gave more activation for one direction than for the opposite. The present investigation, made in acute preparations, includes a study of receptive fields of cells in the cat's striate cortex. Receptive fields of the cells considered in this paper were divided into separate excitatory and inhibitory ('on' and 'off') areas. In this respect they resembled retinal ganglion-cell receptive fields. However, the shape and arrangement of excitatory and inhibitory areas differed strikingly from the concentric pattern found in retinal ganglion cells. An attempt was made to correlate responses to moving stimuli"

Receptive fields of these units were mapped out, in the light-adapted state, with small sports of light. In their general arrangement geniculate receptive fields resembled those of retinal ganglion cells, having an excitatory ('on') centre and inhibitory ('off') preriphery, or reverse. The two portions of a receptive field were mutually antagonistic; the decrease in centre responses cauded by inclusion of peripheral portions of receptive fields was termed peripheral suppression. Cells recorded in layers A and B of the lateral geniculate body were driven from the contralateral eye; cells in layer A1 from the ipsilateral eye. In penetrations normal to the layers receptive fields of cells in a single layer were close together or superimposed, and from one layer to the next occupied exactly homologous positions in the two retinas. Binocular interaction was not observed in any of the cells studied. All three layers of the lateral geniculate contained both 'on'-centre and 'off'-centre units. Cells in layers A and A1 were similar both in their firing patterns and in average receptive field size. Cells in layer B were more sluggish in their responses to light stimuli, and tended to have larger receptive field centres. Cells with receptive fields within or near the area centralis tended to have smaller field centres and stronger suppression by the receptive field periphery than cells with their fields situated in more peripheral regions of the retina."

Most units responded either feebly or not at all to stimulation of the retina with diffuse light, but gave brisk responses to stationary or moving restricted spots of light. Responses to moving spots often varied with the direction of movement. It was clear that such responses must be the result of complex integrative mechanisms. The present study was undertaken to find out whether similar responses occur in retinal ganglion cells or cells of the dorsal lateral geniculate body. Lateral geniculate units have not previously been studied with restricted light stimulation, and although the cat's retinal ganglion cell has been extensively investigated by Kuffler and his co-workers (Kuffler, 1953; iKuffler, FitzHugh & Barlow, 1957), responses to moving spots were not examined. Thus it has not been possible to say whether the complex activity of cortical units originates in the cortex itself, or at lower levels. Methods for stereotaxic depth recordings in the unanaesthetized unrestrained animal were developed in order to make cortical and depth studies under similar conditions. These techniques make it possible to record from single units from virtually any part of the brain of the freely moving animal."

Both its complex anatomical structure (O'Leary, 1940; Clark, 1942; Walls, 1953) and the functional properties of its synapses, as revealed by electrical stimulation of the optic nerve (Bishop & Evans, 1956; Bishop, Burke & Davis, 1958, 1959; Bishop & Davis, 1960), suggest that this nucleus provides a site for integrative mechanisms. Brindley (1960) and Crescitelli (1960) have recently discussed the role of the lateral geniculate body. Hubel (1960), recording the responses of single geniculate units in conscious, unrestrained cats, found that the activity of the lateral geniculate body is modified by arousal; the organization of the receptive field, however, as seen in the retina, undergoes no change until the impulses reach the cortex. In the present study, of which preliminary communications have appeared (Erulkar & Fillenz, 1956, 1958), the responses of single units in the lateral geniculate body of cats anaesthetized with sodium pentobarbitone to diffuse light stimuli were studied. Variation in the light intensity and different combinations of binocular stimulation revealed the occurrence of some integration at the level of the lateral geniculate body."

All fields mapped with white light had a concentric arrangement sililar to that of the cat retinal ganglion cells, with a sharply demarcated 'on' centre surrounded by an antagonistic 'off' periphery, or the reverse. The smallest receptive field centres were found near the fovea, and the size of centres tended to increase with increasing distance from the fovea. The smallest centre had a diameter of 4 minutes of arc (corresponding to about 20 microns on the retina) and was located 4 degrees from the fovea; the largest centre had a diameter of 2 degrees. Three ganglion cells out of about 100 responded in a specific way to coloured stimuli. In these cells light of short wave-length produced an 'on' response and light of long wave-length evoked inhibition followed by an 'off' response. Transition between the two types of response occurred at about 500 millimicrons, light of this wave-length evoked only feebel 'off' responses. Very weak responses were obtained to white light, presumably owing to the antagonism between light of short and long wavelengths. (Author)"

Our method is to find what sort of stimulus causes the largest activity in one nerve fiber and then what is the exciting aspect of that stimulus such that variations in everything else cause little change in the response. It has been known for the past 20 years that each fiber is connected not to a few rods and cones in the retina but to very many over a fair area. Our results show that for the most part within that area, it is not the light intensity itself but rather the pattern of local variation of intensity that is the exciting factor. There are four types of fibers, each type concerned with a different sort of pattern. Each type is uniformly distributed over the whole retina of the frog. Thus, there are four distinct parallel distributed channels whereby the frog's eye informs his brain about the visual image in terms of local pattern independent of average illumination. We describe the patterns and show the functional and anatomical separation of the channels. This work has been done on the frog, and our interpretation applies only to the frog."

These are the historic, anatomic, pathologic, and biologic aspects of the vertebrate visual system. The author\u2019s approach was primarily anatomic. Therefore, this section describes in minute detail the gross and microscopic structures concerned with the visual pathways which center chiefly on man, apes, and monkeys. Naturally, there is some repetition concerning the retina and optic radiation from the author\u2019s previous works. However, the 418 pages devoted to these and other structures portray the system as a whole in an orderly fashion and with considerable new material, including a detailed account of the blood supply and drainage. The most helpful part of the anatomic portion deals with the general theory of the organization of the nervous systems and visual functions. Here one finds in review an interpretation of neuronal patterns, especially retinal elements. Biographic sketches with photographs of those who have made significant contributions to this phase of the subject are scattered throughout this section. The first section of this book deals historically with the study of the visual system. In dealing with the pathologic and biologic sections, the historical aspect is also stressed as each topic of discussion is brought into focus."

                "text": "THE DISCHARGES carried in the optic nerve fibers contain all the information which the central nervous system receives from the retina. A correct interpretation of discharge patterns therefore constitutes an important step in the analysis of visual events. Further, investigations of nervous activity arising in the eye reveal many aspects of the functional organization of the neural elements within the retina itself. Following studies of discharges in the optic nerve of the eel\u2019s eye by Adrian and Matthews (2,3), Hartline and his colleagues described the discharge pattern in the eye of the Limulus in a series of important and lucid papers (for a summary see 20). In the Limulus the relationship between the stimulus to the primary receptor cell and the nerve discharges proved relatively simple, apparently because the connection between sense cell and nerve fiber was a direct one. Thus, when stimulation is confined to one receptor the discharge in a single Limulus nerve fiber will provide a good indication of excitatory events which take place as a result of photochemical processes. Discharges last for the duration of illumination and their frequency is a measure of stimulus strength. Lately, however, it was shown by Hartline et al. (22) that inhibitory interactions may be revealed when several receptors are excited. On the whole, the Limulus preparation shows many features which are similar to other simple sense organs, for instance, stretch receptors. In the latter, however, instead of photochemical events, stretch-deformation acts as the adequate stimulus on sensory terminals and is translated into a characteristic discharge pattern. The discharge from the cold-blooded vertebrate retina (mainly frogs) proved much more complex. Hartline found three main types when recording from single optic nerve fibers: (i) \u201con\u201d discharges, similar to those in the Limulus, firing for the duration of the light stimulus, (ii) \u201coff\u201d discharges appearing when a light stimulus was withdrawn, and (iii) \u2018con-off\u201d discharges, a combination of the former two, with activity confined mainly to onset and cessation of illumination. The mammalian discharge patterns were studied in a number of species by Granit and his co-workers in the course of their extensive work on the physiology of the visual system (summaries in 13, 15). On the whole, they did not observe any fundamental differences between frog and mammalian discharge types (see later)."

Surface responses produced by stimulation of the contralateral eye are larger in amplitude than those produced by stimulation of the ipsilateral eye, while those produced by binocular stimulation are larger still. The amplitude of the surface responses increases to a maximum with increasing intensity of stimulation. For any given single cell, there is a constant ratio between the average number of unit discharges in response to contralateral, ipsilateral and binocular stimulation. At different stimulus intensities this ratio is constant, although the absolute numbers of discharges may be different. It has been possible to divide the cells into functional groups according to a ) which eye produces the larger number of discharges, i.e. which eye is \u2018dominant\u2019 and b ) whether binocular stimulation produces more, fewer, or as many discharges as stimulation of the dominant eye alone. All the functionally different types of neurones may be found in all the cellular layers of the cortex. The latency of the unit responses is shorter with binocular than with monocular stimulation, and is shorter when brighter stimuli are used."

This has been strongly supported by the anatomical work of Le Gros Clark and Penman (1934) and of Polyak (1957), but there is not yet agreement even on the exact projection of the macular area on the cerebral cortex. The best physiological work which has been done is that by Talbot and Marshall (1941), who have mapped the exposed postero-lateral surface of the occipital lobe in the monkey. In the present work we have used an essentially similar technique, but by introducing long steel needles we have mapped most of the cortex of the calcarine fissures and can give a quantitative account of the nature of the calcarine visual projection."

A beam of light, reflected from a plane mirror on a contact lens, is used to project onto a screen an image of a dark line against a bright background. The screen is viewed by the same eye through an optical system which compensates for the doubling of the angle of rotation of the beam projected from the mirror on the contact lens. Thus, any motion of the eye causes a deviation of the beam such that the retinal image of the projected line undergoes the same displacement as do the retinal receptor cells. By comparison with normal viewing of the same test objects it is found that (1) when first presented, the finest lines are seen with normal or slightly better than normal acuity, (2) within a few seconds the lines begin to disappear, and (3) within one minute even coarse lines are seen only intermittently. The results may be interpreted in terms of local retinal adaptation to a stationary field."

These methods eliminate anaesthetics, paralysing drugs, brain-stem lesions, and other acute experimental procedures. They make it possible to record electrical events in the higher central nervous system with the animal in a normal state, and to correlate these electrical events with such variables as waking state, attention, learning, and motor activity. The present paper describes a method for unit recording from the cortex of unanaesthetized, unrestrained cats, and presents some observations from the striate cortex. The objectives have been (1) to observe maintained unit activity under various conditions such as sleep and wakefulness, and (2) to find for each unit the natural stimuli which most effectively influence firing. Of 400 units observed, some 200 are presented here because of their common characteristics. Since there is reason to believe that the remainiing 200 units were afferent fibres from the lateral geniculate nucleus, these will be described in a separate paper. A preliminary account of some of this work has been given elsewhere (Hubel, 1958)."

A small number of cells (< 8.5 percent) receive afferents directly from both optic nerves and are discharged by stimulating either nerve (direct interaction). More common is delayed interaction, where the cells are discharged independently by either optic nerve but only after a relatively long latency. Indirect interaction effects also occur."
