The physical meaning of content-addressable memory is described by an appropriate phase space flow of the state of a system. A model of such a system is given, based on aspects of neurobiology but readily adapted to integrated circuits. The collective properties of this model produce a content-addressable memory which correctly yields an entire memory from any subpart of sufficient size. The algorithm for the time evolution of the state of the system is based on asynchronous parallel processing. Additional emergent collective properties include some capacity for generalization, familiarity recognition, categorization, error correction, and time sequence retention. The collective properties are only weakly sensitive to details of the modeling or the failure of individual devices."

Genetic algorithms have also been shown to be effective in evolving solutions to optimization problems which involve objective functions that are not 'nice'. The approach presented here is the utilization of genetic algorithms to evolve the number of neurons in an artificial neural network, the weights of their interconnects, and the interconnect structure itself. With this approach, no a priori assumptions about interconnect structure, weights, number of layers. or to which neurons the inputs or outputs are connected need to be made. A combined neural network evaluation and genetic algorithm evaluation program has been written in C on a Sun workstation. The method has been successfully applied to the 9*9 bit character recognition problem.<<ETX>>"

This interest on the part of solid state physicists and others has led to models of pattern recognition and associative memory (1,2,3). In these models, it is largely the dynamical attractors which are of interest as the classes, or memories, stored in the systems. Further, the mathematical tractability of threshold systems with symmetric coupling, that is, in which each binary device \u201cfires\u201d if a weighted sum of excitation minus inhibition exceeds some threshold, and couplings between two binary devices are symmetrical, has focused particular attention on this subclass of automata. The marked advantage of this subclass of automata is the existence of a potential function allowing prescription of weightings on inputs to each binary device in order to choose steady state attractors with desired properties such as location in state space, and stability to perturbation (1,2,3)."

In the recurrent networks studied here, any unit can be connected to any other, and any unit can receive external input. These networks run continually in the sense that they sample their inputs on every update cycle, and any unit can have a training target on any cycle. The storage required and computation time on each step are independent of time and are completely determined by the size of the network, so no prior knowledge of the temporal structure of the task being learned is required. The algorithm is nonlocal in the sense that each unit must have knowledge of the complete recurrent weight matrix and error vector.

A synaptic evolution scheme of a new kind is proposed in which incoming patterns rather than converging afferents compete. The change in the efficacy of a given synapse depends not only on instantaneous pre- and postsynaptic activities but also on a slowly varying time-averaged value of the postsynaptic activity. Assuming an appropriate nonlinear form for this dependence, development of selectivity is obtained under quite general conditions on the sensory environment. One does not require nonlinearity of the neuron's integrative power nor does one need to assume any particular form for intracortical circuitry. This is first illustrated in simple cases, e.g., when the environment consists of only two different stimuli presented alternately in a random manner. The following formal statement then holds: the state of the system converges with probability 1 to points of maximum selectivity in the state space. We next consider the problem of early development of orientation selectivity and binocular interaction in primary visual cortex. Giving the environment an appropriate form, we obtain orientation tuning curves and ocular dominance comparable to what is observed in normally reared adult cats or monkeys. Simulations with binocular input and various types of normal or altered environments show good agreement with the relevant experimental data. Experiments are suggested that could test our theory further."

This paper reports on a new approach in which the size and shape of the solution to such problems is dynamically created using Darwinian principles of reproduction and survival of the fittest. Moreover, the resulting solution is inherently hierarchical. The paper describes computer experiments, using the author's 4341 line LISP program, in five areas of artifical intelligence, namely (1) sequence induction (e.g. inducing a computational procedure for the recursive Fibonacci sequence and inducing a computational procedure for a cubic polynomial sequence), (2) automatic programming (e.g. discovering a computational procedure for solving pairs of linear equations, solving quadratic equations for complex roots, and discovering trigonometric identities), (3) machine learning of functions (e.g. learning a Boolean multiplexer function previously studied in neural net and classifier system work and learning the exclusive-or and parity function), (4) planning (e.g. developing a robotic action sequence that can stack an arbitrary initial configuration of blocks into a specified order), and (5) pattern recognition (e.g. translation-invariant recognition of a simple one dimensional shape in a linear retina)."

Our method is to find what sort of stimulus causes the largest activity in one nerve fiber and then what is the exciting aspect of that stimulus such that variations in everything else cause little change in the response. It has been known for the past 20 years that each fiber is connected not to a few rods and cones in the retina but to very many over a fair area. Our results show that for the most part within that area, it is not the light intensity itself but rather the pattern of local variation of intensity that is the exciting factor. There are four types of fibers, each type concerned with a different sort of pattern. Each type is uniformly distributed over the whole retina of the frog. Thus, there are four distinct parallel distributed channels whereby the frog's eye informs his brain about the visual image in terms of local pattern independent of average illumination. We describe the patterns and show the functional and anatomical separation of the channels. This work has been done on the frog, and our interpretation applies only to the frog."

Analytic circuit models, in which a set of the design equations enables one to evaluate the performance of a circuit for different sets of specifications without actually going into the circuit details, can be developed not only for operational amplifiers but also for other types of analog functional blocks, such as comparators and A/D (analog-to-digital) converters.<<ETX>>"

These include (1) the precise description of the discharge patterns of identified motoneurones and the correlation of electrophysiological and behavioural data, (2) the demonstration of central rhythm generators for producing the basic rhythmicity of leg movements, (3) the recording of intracellular events in motoneurones and interneurones during rhythmic leg movements, and (4) the effects on motor output of changes in feedback from leg receptors. The most intensively studied animal has been the cockroach. For this animal it is clear that central mechanisms determine the basic rhythmicity and reciprocity in the activity supplying the muscles producing the alternate flexion and extension movement of the femur. Preliminary studies indicate that non-spiking interneurones are involved in the central patterning of motor output."

Previous analyses of this problem have compared the performance of human or animal observers in detection or discrimination tasks with the signals carried by individual neurons, but have been hampered because neuronal and perceptual data were not obtained at the same time and under the same conditions1\u20134. We have now measured the performance of monkeys and of visual cortical neurons while the animals performed a psychophysical task well matched to the properties of the neurons under study. Here we report that the reliability and sensitivity of most neurons on this task equalled or exceeded that of the monkeys. We therefore suggest that under our conditions, psychophysical judgements could be based on the activity of a relatively small number of neurons."

This stimulus has the advantages that it presents numerous wave forms in random order without prejudgement as to their efficacies, and that it allows straightforward statistical calculations. 2. Stimulation with a repeating segment of Gaussian white\u2010noise current revealed remarkable invariance in the firing times of the tested neurones and indicated a high degree of reliability of their response. 3. Frequencies (less than 5 Hz) involved in spike triggering propagated faithfully for up to several millimetres, justifying intrasomatic current injection to examine spike initiation at the trigger locus. 4. Examination of current wave forms preceding spikes indicated that a wide variety could be effective. Hence, a statistical analysis was performed, including computation of probability densities, averages, standard deviations and correlation coefficients of pairs of current values. Each statistic was displayed as a function of time before the spike. 5. The average current trajectory preceding a spike was multiphasic and depended on the presence and polarity of a d.c. bias. An early relatively small inward\u2010 or outward\u2010going phase was followed by a large outward phase before the spike. The early phase tended to oppose the polarity of the d.c. bias. 6. The late outward phase of the average current trajectory reached a maximum 40\u2010\u201075 msec before triggering the action potential (AP) and returned to near zero values at the moment of triggering. The fact that the current peak occurs in advance of the AP may be partially explained by a phase delay between the transmembrane current and potential. The failure of the average current trajectory to return to control values immediately following the peak argues for a positive role of the declining phase in spike triggering. 7. Probability densities preceding spikes were Gaussian, indicating that the average was also the most probable value. Although the densities were broad, confirming that spikes were preceded by a wide variety of current wave forms, their standard deviations were reduced significantly with respect to controls, suggesting preferred status of the average current trajectory in spike triggering. 8. The matrix of correlation coefficients between current pairs suggested that spikes tended to be preceded by wave forms that in part kept close to the average current trajectory and in part preserved its shape. 9. The average first and second derivatives of spike\u2010evoking epochs revealed that current slope and acceleration, respectively, were most crucial in the last 200 msec before spike triggering, and that these dynamic stimulus components were more important for a cell maintained under a depolarizing, rather than a hyperpolarizing bias. 10..."

                "text": "There are several different ways in which the electric activity of a nerve fiber depends on movements of inorganic ions. In the first place, activity at one point on a fiber stimulates the regions ahead by means of local-circuit currents flowing forward in the axis cylinder, out through the membrane, and back in the external fluid. The current in the external fluid is clearly carried by a straightforward process of conduction in an electrolyte, and the same thing is almost certainly true of the current in the axis cylinder. Evidence for this is given by the three following facts: (1) that the longitudinal current obeys Ohm\u2019s law fairly closely (Hodgkin and Rushton, 1946; Rashbass and Rushton, 1949); (2) that the specific resistance of the axoplasm is about what would be expected for an aqueous solution of the ions that are known by chemical analysis to be present; and (3) that the mobility and diffusion coefficient of the internal K+ are close to those in aqueous solution (Hodgkin and Keynes, 1953). The ions in question are partly inorganic-notably potassium-but organic ions are also concerned in some cases a t least. Thus, there are considerable quantities of dicarboxylic amino acids in crustacean nerve (Silber, 1941 ; Lewis, 1952); these are also present in squid nerve, but here the predominant anion appears to be isethionate (Koechlin, 1955). Phosphate esters are also likely to carry an appreciable fraction of the current in all kinds of nerve. A second way in which ion movements are important is in the maintenance of the resting potential. As is well known, Bernstein (1902) suggested, on the basis of the dependence of the demarcation potential on temperature, that the resting potential is a concentration potential, due probably to potassium ions. The ability of K ions to cross the membrane that is required on this theory has been amply demonstrated in recent years both by observing net movements (Boyle and Conway, 1941) and by tracer measurement of K exchange in the resting state (Krogh, 1946, and Keynes and Lewis, 1951u, among others). Although these downhill movements of K are clearly an important factor, they are not the only means by which positive charge is carried outward to maintain the resting potential. On the one hand, C1 ions probably act in the same way (Boyle and Conway, 1941; Hodgkin and Katz, 1949~); Bernstein himself was aware that the C1 concentration ratio was in the right direction, but he appears to have thought (1912, page 99) that an emf due to chloride ions should add to that due to K+, while in fact it is the currents carried by the various ionic species that are additive, the p.d. across the membrane being the same for all. On the other hand, there are also \u201cactive\u201d movements of ions (Na and K), which we may regard as the third kind of ion movement of importance in nerve activity. These active movements, in which the net flux of the ion is in the direction that requires work to be done against its electrochemical gradient, have been much studied by tracer methods, and they are clearly essential for the"

When viewed in this way, the process of solving these problems becomes equivalent to searching a space of possible computer programs for a most fit individual computer program. The new \"genetic programming\" paradigm described herein provides a way to search for this most fit individual computer program. In this new \"genetic programming\" paradigm, populations of computer programs are genetically bred using the Darwinian principle of survival of the fittest and using a genetic crossover (recombination) operator appropriate for genetically mating computer programs. In this paper, the process of formulating and solving problems using this new paradigm is illustrated using examples from various areas. Examples come from the areas of machine learning of a function; planning; sequence induction; function function identification (including symbolic regression, empirical discovery, \"data to function\" symbolic integration, \"data to function\" symbolic differentiation); solving equations, including differential equations, integral equations, and functional equations); concept formation; automatic programming; pattern recognition, time-optimal control; playing differential pursuer-evader games; neural network design; and finding a game-playing strategyfor a discrete game in extensive form."

The former are responsible for the conduction of impulses in nerve and muscle fibres and the latter for synaptic transmission. It is now clear that the sodium and potassium channels in electrically excitable membranes are functionally distinct, since each can be blocked without affecting the behaviour of the other. It has recently proved possible to study, in the voltage-clamped squid giant axon, the movements of the mobile charges or dipoles that form the voltage-sensitive portion of the sodium channels, which give rise to the so-called 'gating' current. Detailed comparisons can now be made between the kinetics of the ionic conductances as described by Hodgkin & Huxley, and the steady-state distribution and kinetics of the charged controlling particles, which should lead to useful conclusions about the intramolecular organization of the sodium channels and the conformational changes that take place under the influence of the electric field. There is as yet little information about the chemical nature of the electrically excitable channels, but significant progress has been made towards the isolation and characterization of the acetylcholine receptors in muscle and electric organ."

The term 'directionally selective' means that a unit gives a vigorous discharge of impulses when a stimulus object is moved through its receptive field in one direction (called the preferred direction), whereas motion in the reverse direction (called null) evokes little or no response. The preferred direction differs in different units, and the activity of a set of such units signals the direction of movement of objects in the visual field. In the rabbit the preferred and null directions cannot be predicted from a map of the receptive field showing the regions yielding on or off-responses to stationary spots. Furthermore, the preferred direction is unchanged by changing the stimulus; in particular, reversing the contrast of a spot or a black-white border does not reverse the preferred direction. Hubel & Wiesel (1962) thought that the directional selectivity of the cat's cortical neurons could be explained by the asymmetrical arrangement of on and off zones in the receptive field, and the simple interaction of effects summated over these zones, but the foregoing results rule out this explanation, at least in the rabbit's retina (Barlow & Hill, 1963). In the present paper we go on from this point to describe experiments which show, first, that directional selectivity is not due to optical aberrations of some kind and, secondly, that it is not a simple matter of the latency of response varying systematically across the receptive field. After these negative results we describe experiments upon the organization of directional selectivity within the receptive field, and upon its mechanism. These lead us to the conclusion that the ganglion cells responding to a"

In a previous paper (Barlow, 1957) it was shown that this idea (modified by assuming that there is also a weak intrinsic source of noise) leads to theoretical curves which fit experimental determinations of increment threshold made with a short duration small area test stimulus superimposed upon a large uniform adapting field. It was also shown that big changes in the amount of temporal and spatial summation occur when the background intensity is changed, with the result that when thresholds are determined with a long duration large area test stimulus the experimental points deviate from the appropriate theoretical curve and tend to obey the Weber law instead. In following up this finding there were two objectives. The quantum fluctuation hypothesis predicts that the increment threshold intensity should be inversely proportional to the square root ofthe area and duration ofthe stimulus, and the first object was to find whether the occurrence of these laws fitted in with the hypothesis: the results show that the predicted laws of summation do hold over certain ranges, but when they hold the actual values of the thresholds are higher than the theory predicts. The second objective was to determine the parameters oc and r which were introduced in the previous paper; these are the area and time over which quanta absorbed from the background light are liable to be confused with those absorbed from a short duration small area stimulus light, and here the results obtained are disappointing, for one can only derive lower limits to these quantities. On the other hand, the results do show up the complicated interrelations between temporal and spatial summation and background intensity; tentative explanations of these effects, and of the failure to perform up to the quantal fluctuation limit, are put forward. 22 PHYSIO.

These take into account important advances in cognitive psychology and the science of design while confirming and extending the book's basic thesis: that a physical symbol system has the necessary and sufficient means for intelligent action.

Clinical neuropsychologists assess human memory by the paired-associate learning test, in which a series of paired words or figures is presented and the subject is then asked to retrieve the other pair member associated with each cue1. Patients with lesions of the temporal lobe show marked impairment in this test2\u20136. In our study, we trained monkeys in a pair-association task7 using a set of computer-generated paired patterns. We found two types of task-related neurons in the anterior temporal cortex. One type selectively responded to both pictures of the paired associates. The other type, which had the strongest response to one picture during the cue presentation, exhibited increasing activity during the delay period when the associate of that picture was used as a cue. These results provide new evidence that single neurons acquire selectivity for visual patterns through associative learning.

This method is applied to simple cells in the cat striate cortex. 2. It is demonstrated that the reverse correlation method yields results with several desirable properties, including convergence and reproducibility independent of modest changes in stimulus parameters. 3. In contrast to results obtained with moving stimuli, we find that the bright and dark excitatory subregions in simple receptive fields do not overlap to any great extent. This difference in results may be attributed to confounding the independent variables space and time when using moving stimuli. 4. All simple receptive fields have subregions that vary smoothly in all directions in space. There are no sharp transitions either between excitatory subregions or between subregions and the area surrounding the receptive field. 5. Simple receptive fields vary both in the number of subregions observed, in the elongation of each subregion, and in the overall elongation of the field. In contrast with results obtained using moving stimuli, we find that subregions within a given receptive field need not be the same length. 6. The hypothesis that simple receptive fields can be modeled as either even symmetric or odd symmetric about a central axis is evaluated. This hypothesis is found to be false in general. Most simple receptive fields are neither even symmetric nor odd symmetric. 7. The hypothesis that simple receptive fields can be modeled as the product of a width response profile and an orthogonal length response profile (Cartesian separability) is evaluated. This hypothesis is found to be true for only approximately 50% of the cells in our sample."

A local learning rule is proposed, which allows a network to learn to generalize across such transformations. During the learning phase, the network is exposed to temporal sequences of patterns undergoing the transformation. An application of the algorithm is presented in which the network learns invariance to shift in retinal position. Such a principle may be involved in the development of the characteristic shift invariance property of complex cells in the primary visual cortex, and also in the development of more complicated invariance properties of neurons in higher visual areas."

Here we report a direct experimental test of this hypothesis. Neuronal responses were recorded simultaneously from two to four sites with overlapping receptive fields in cat visual cortex. Correlation analysis revealed that all cells synchronized their responses irrespective of their orientation preference when they were activated by a single light bar. However, when stimulated with two superimposed light bars of different orientations, the same cells segregated into distinct assemblies according to their orientation preferences. Within each of these assemblies responses were synchronized, but correlation was absent between the two assemblies. These results are compatible with the hypothesis that responses to individual objects in a scene are distinguished by synchrony, whereas responses to different objects show no temporal correlation, thus allowing for the segmentation of superimposed stimuli. We conclude that stimulus-specific synchronization of spatially distributed neuronal responses may provide a physiological mechanism for scene segmentation."

                "text": "This paper presents a systematic analysis of the role of opponent type processing in colour vision and the relation between opponent type colour transformations and the initial three colour mechanisms. It is shown that efficient information transmission is achieved by a transformation of the initial three colour mechanisms into an achromatic and two opponent chromatic channels. The derivation of the transformation is dependent solely on criteria from information theory. Thus it provides a logical rationale reconciling opponent type processing as an optimal necessary step after the initial three colour mechanisms, unifying respectively the Hering and Young-Helmholtz approaches to colour vision. The effects of chromatic adaptation on the spectral response of the achromatic and two chromatic channels are discussed from the point of view of information theory. It is argued that adaptation serves as a dynamic readjustment of these responses, necessary to meet criteria of efficient colour information transmission. The results are confronted with empirical observations to test the principles of the theory and the relation to other theories is discussed. Within the same framework the issue of trichromacy is discussed. It is argued that a broad class of typical colour spectra can effectively be represented by three significant degrees of freedom that make up a trichromatic system."

Using ab initio quantum-chemistry techniques including electron correlation they model the abstraction of hydrogen from dihydrogen, methane, acetylene, benzene and isobutane by the acetylene radical. By conservative estimates, the abstraction barrier is small (less than 7.7 kcal mol^-1) in all cases except for acetylene and zero in the case of isobutane. Thermal vibrations at room temperature should be sufficient to supply the small activation energy. Several methods of creating the radical in a controlled vacuum setting should be feasible. The authors show how nanofabrication processes can be accurately and inexpensively designed in a computational framework."
