                "text": "A new efficient MRF optimization algorithm, called Fast-PD, is proposed, which generalizes\u03b1-expansion. One of its main advantages is that it offers a sub stantial speedup over that method, e.g. it can be at least 3-9 times faster than \u03b1-expansion. Its efficiency is a result of the fact that Fast-PD exploits information coming not only from the o riginal MRF problem, but also from a dual problem. Furthermore, besides static MRFs, it can also be used for boosting the performance of dynamic MRFs, i.e. MRFs varying over time. In addition, de spite being fast, Fast-PD makes no compromise about the optimality of its solutions: it can c ompute exactly the same answer as \u03b1expansion, but, unlike that method, it can also guarantee an almost optimal solution for a much wider class of NP-hard MRF problems. Results on static and dynamic MRFs demonstrate the algorithm\u2019s efficiency and power. E.g. Fast-PD has been able to compute di sparity for stereoscopic sequences in real time, with the resulting disparity coinciding with tha of \u03b1-expansion.

Cet algorithme s\u2019appelle Fast-PD, et g\u00e9n\u00e9ralise l\u2019 algorithme de\u03b1-expansion. Parmi ses principaux avantages, nous notons sa grande rapidit\u00e9 par ra port \u00e0 la derni\u00e8re m\u00e9thode. Il peut \u00eatre de 3 \u00e0 9 fois plus rapide que l\u2019algorithme de \u03b1-expansion. Il puise son efficacit\u00e9 dans l\u2019exploitation des informations qui \u00e9manent non seulement du champ de Markov pr imal, mais aussi du probl\u00e8me dual. En outre, son utilisation pour acc\u00e9l\u00e9rer les champs de Marko v statiques s\u2019\u00e9tend aussi \u00e0 l\u2019am\u00e9lioration des performances des champs de Markov dynamiques, c\u2019est \u00e0 di re ceux qui varient au cours du temps. En plus de sa rapidit\u00e9, Fast-PD ne fait aucun compromi s quant \u00e0 l\u2019optimalit\u00e9 de ses solutions : il peut calculer les m\u00eames solutions que \u03b1-expansion, mais contrairement \u00e0 cette m\u00e9thode, il peut aussi garantir une solution presque optimale pour une c lasse beaucoup plus large de probl\u00e8mes NP-difficiles de champs de Markov. Les r\u00e9sultats obtenus sur des champs de Markov statiques et dynamiques d\u00e9montrent l\u2019efficacit\u00e9 et la puissance de cet al gorithme. A titre d\u2019exemple, Fast-PD est utilis\u00e9 pour calculer la disparit\u00e9 sur des s\u00e9quences d\u2019i mages st\u00e9r\u00e9oscopiques en temps r\u00e9el.

Our new Active Cuts (AC) method can effectively use a good approximate solution (initial cut) that is often available in dynamic, hierarchical, and multi-label optimization problems in vision. In many problems AC works faster than the state-of-the-art max-flow methods [2] even if initial cut is far from the optimal one. Moreover, empirical speed improves several folds when initial cut is spatially close to the optima. Before converging to a global minima, Active Cuts outputs a multitude of intermediate solutions (intermediate cuts) that, for example, can be used be accelerate iterative learning-based methods or to improve visual perception of graph cuts realtime performance when large volumetric data is segmented. Finally, it can also be combined with many previous methods for accelerating graph cuts."

We show how this algorithm can be used to efficiently compute MAP estimates for dynamically changing MRF models of labeling problems in computer vision, such as image segmentation. Specifically, given the solution of the max-flow problem on a graph, we show how to efficiently compute the maximum flow in a modified version of the graph. Our experiments showed that the time taken by our algorithm is roughly proportional to the number of edges whose weights were different in the two graphs. We test the performance of our algorithm on one particular problem: the object-background segmentation problem for video and compare it with the best known st-mincut algorithm. The results show that the dynamic graph cut algorithm is much faster than its static counterpart and enables real time image segmentation. It should be noted that our method is generic and can be used to yield similar improvements in many other cases that involve dynamic change in the graph"

The combinatorial optimization literature provides many min-cut/max-flow algorithms with different polynomial time complexity. Their practical efficiency, however, has to date been studied mainly outside the scope of computer vision. The goal of this paper is to provide an experimental comparison of the efficiency of min-cut/max flow algorithms for applications in vision. We compare the running times of several standard algorithms, as well as a new algorithm that we have recently developed. The algorithms we study include both Goldberg-Tarjan style \"push -relabel\" methods and algorithms based on Ford-Fulkerson style \"augmenting paths.\" We benchmark these algorithms on a number of typical graphs in the contexts of image restoration, stereo, and segmentation. In many cases, our new algorithm works several times faster than any of the other methods, making near real-time performance possible. An implementation of our max-flow/min-cut algorithm is available upon request for research purposes."

                "text": "One of the most exciting advances in early vision has been the development of efficient energy minimization algorithms. Many early vision tasks require labeling each pixel with some quantity such as depth or texture. While many such problems can be elegantly expressed in the language of Markov Random Fields (MRF's), the resulting energy minimization problems were widely viewed as intractable. Recently, algorithms such as graph cuts and loopy belief propagation (LBP) have proven to be very powerful: for example, such methods form the basis for almost all the top-performing stereo methods. Unfortunately, most papers define their own energy function, which is minimized with a specific algorithm of their choice. As a result, the tradeoffs among different energy minimization algorithms are not well understood. In this paper we describe a set of energy minimization benchmarks, which we use to compare the solution quality and running time of several common energy minimization algorithms. We investigate three promising recent methods\u2014graph cuts, LBP, and tree-reweighted message passing\u2014as well as the well-known older iterated conditional modes (ICM) algorithm. Our benchmark problems are drawn from published energy functions used for stereo, image stitching and interactive segmentation. We also provide a general-purpose software interface that allows vision researchers to easily switch between optimization methods with minimal overhead. We expect that the availability of our benchmarks and interface will make it significantly easier for vision researchers to adopt the best method for their specific problems. Benchmarks, code, results and images are available at http://vision.middlebury.edu/MRF."

The major restriction is that the energy function's smoothness term must only involve pairs of pixels. We propose two algorithms that use graph cuts to compute a local minimum even when very large moves are allowed. The first move we consider is an /spl alpha/-/spl beta/-swap: for a pair of labels /spl alpha/,/spl beta/, this move exchanges the labels between an arbitrary set of pixels labeled a and another arbitrary set labeled /spl beta/. Our first algorithm generates a labeling such that there is no swap move that decreases the energy. The second move we consider is an /spl alpha/-expansion: for a label a, this move assigns an arbitrary set of pixels the label /spl alpha/. Our second algorithm, which requires the smoothness term to be a metric, generates a labeling such that there is no expansion move that decreases the energy. Moreover, this solution is within a known factor of the global minimum. We experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on image restoration, stereo and motion."

The synthesized image, called a digital tapestry, can be viewed as a visual summary or a virtual 'thumbnail' of all the images in the input collection. The problem of creating the tapestry is cast as a multi-class labeling problem such that each region in the tapestry is constructed from input image blocks that are salient and such that neighboring blocks satisfy spatial compatibility. This is formulated using a Markov random field and optimized via the graph cut based expansion move algorithm. The standard expansion move algorithm can only handle energies with metric terms, while our energy contains non-metric (soft and hard) constraints. Therefore we propose two novel contributions. First, we extend the expansion move algorithm for energy functions with non-metric hard constraints. Secondly, we modify it for functions with \"almost\" metric soft terms, and show that it gives good results in practice. The proposed framework was tested on several consumer photograph collections, and the results are presented."
