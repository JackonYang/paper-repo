We demonstrate the scalability and performance of our system on a dataset of over 1 million images crawled from the photo-sharing site, Flickr [3], using Oxford landmarks as queries. Building an image-feature vocabulary is a major time and performance bottleneck, due to the size of our dataset. To address this problem we compare different scalable methods for building a vocabulary and introduce a novel quantization method based on randomized trees which we show outperforms the current state-of-the-art on an extensive ground-truth. Our experiments show that the quantization has a major effect on retrieval quality. To further improve query performance, we add an efficient spatial verification stage to re-rank the results returned from our bag-of-words model and show that this consistently improves search quality, though by less of a margin when the visual vocabulary is large. We view this work as a promising step towards much larger, \"web-scale \" image corpora."

We adopt the bag-of-visual-words architecture which has proven successful in achieving high precision at low recall. Unfortunately, feature detection and quantization are noisy processes and this can result in variation in the particular visual words that appear in different images of the same object, leading to missed results. In the text retrieval literature a standard method for improving performance is query expansion. A number of the highly ranked documents from the original query are reissued as a new query. In this way, additional relevant terms can be added to the query. This is a form of blind rele- vance feedback and it can fail if 'outlier' (false positive) documents are included in the reissued query. In this paper we bring query expansion into the visual domain via two novel contributions. Firstly, strong spatial constraints between the query image and each result allow us to accurately verify each return, suppressing the false positives which typically ruin text-based query expansion. Secondly, the verified images can be used to learn a latent feature model to enable the controlled construction of expanded queries. We illustrate these ideas on the 5000 annotated image Oxford building database together with more than 1M Flickr images. We show that the precision is substantially boosted, achieving total recall in many cases."

A key component of these approaches is that local regions of images are characterized using high-dimensional descriptors which are then mapped to ldquovisual wordsrdquo selected from a discrete vocabulary.This paper explores techniques to map each visual region to a weighted set of words, allowing the inclusion of features which were lost in the quantization stage of previous systems. The set of visual words is obtained by selecting words based on proximity in descriptor space. We describe how this representation may be incorporated into a standard tf-idf architecture, and how spatial verification is modified in the case of this soft-assignment. We evaluate our method on the standard Oxford Buildings dataset, and introduce a new dataset for evaluation. Our results exceed the current state of the art retrieval performance on these datasets, particularly on queries with poor initial recall where techniques like query expansion suffer. Overall we show that soft-assignment is always beneficial for retrieval with large vocabularies, at a cost of increased storage requirements for the index."

This leads us to derive a more precise representation based on Hamming embedding (HE) and weak geometric consistency constraints (WGC). HE provides binary signatures that refine the matching based on visual words. WGC filters matching descriptors that are not consistent in terms of angle and scale. HE and WGC are integrated within an inverted file and are efficiently exploited for all images in the dataset. We then introduce a graph-structured quantizer which significantly speeds up the assignment of the descriptors to visual words. A\u00a0comparison with the state of the art shows the interest of our approach when high accuracy is needed.Experiments performed on three reference datasets and a dataset of one million of images show a significant improvement due to the binary signature and the weak geometric consistency constraints, as well as their efficiency. Estimation of the full geometric transformation, i.e., a re-ranking step on a short-list of images, is shown to be complementary to our weak geometric consistency constraints. Our approach is shown to outperform the state-of-the-art on the three datasets."

Errors in this quantization procedure propagate throughout the rest of the system, either harming performance or requiring correction using additional storage or processing. This paper aims to reduce these quantization errors at source, by learning a projection from descriptor space to a new Euclidean space in which standard clustering techniques are more likely to assign matching descriptors to the same cluster, and nonmatching descriptors to different clusters. \n \nTo achieve this, we learn a non-linear transformation model by minimizing a novel margin-based cost function, which aims to separate matching descriptors from two classes of non-matching descriptors. Training data is generated automatically by leveraging geometric consistency. Scalable, stochastic gradient methods are used for the optimization. \n \nFor the case of particular object retrieval, we demonstrate impressive gains in performance on a ground truth dataset: our learnt 32-D descriptor without spatial re-ranking outperforms a baseline method using 128-D SIFT descriptors with spatial re-ranking."

Our method is based on an analysis of the k-reciprocal nearest neighbor structure in the image space. At query time the information obtained from this process is used to treat different parts of the ranked retrieval list with different distance measures. This leads effectively to a re-ranking of retrieved images. As we will show, this has two benefits: first, using different similarity measures for different parts of the ranked list allows for compensation of the \u201ccurse of dimensionality\u201d. Second, it allows for dealing with the uneven distribution of images in the data space. Dealing with both challenges has very beneficial effect on retrieval accuracy. Furthermore, a major part of the process happens offline, so it does not affect speed at retrieval time. Finally, the method operates on the bag-of-words level only, thus it could be combined with any additional measures on e.g. either descriptor level or feature geometry making room for further improvement. We evaluate our approach on common object retrieval benchmarks and demonstrate a significant improvement over standard bag-of-words retrieval."

In large scale problems, memory becomes a limiting factor - local geometry is stored for each feature detected in each image and requires storage larger than the inverted file and term frequency and inverted document frequency weights together. We propose a novel method for learning discretized local geometry representation based on minimization of average reprojection error in the space of ellipses. The representation requires only 24 bits per feature without drop in performance. Additionally, we show that if the gravity vector assumption is used consistently from the feature description to spatial verification, it improves retrieval performance and decreases the memory footprint. The proposed method outperforms state of the art retrieval algorithms in a standard image retrieval benchmark."

The object is represented by a set of viewpoint invariant region descriptors so that recognition can proceed successfully despite changes in viewpoint, illumination and partial occlusion. The temporal continuity of the video within a shot is used to track the regions in order to reject unstable regions and reduce the effects of noise in the descriptors. The analogy with text retrieval is in the implementation where matches on descriptors are pre-computed (using vector quantization), and inverted file systems and document rankings are used. The result is that retrieved is immediate, returning a ranked list of key frames/shots in the manner of Google. The method is illustrated for matching in two full length feature films."

The efficiency and quality is exhibited in a live demonstration that recognizes CD-covers from a database of 40000 images of popular music CD\u2019s. The scheme builds upon popular techniques of indexing descriptors extracted from local regions, and is robust to background clutter and occlusion. The local region descriptors are hierarchically quantized in a vocabulary tree. The vocabulary tree allows a larger and more discriminatory vocabulary to be used efficiently, which we show experimentally leads to a dramatic improvement in retrieval quality. The most significant property of the scheme is that the tree directly defines the quantization. The quantization and the indexing are therefore fully integrated, essentially being one and the same. The recognition quality is evaluated through retrieval on a database with ground truth, showing the power of the vocabulary tree approach, going as high as 1 million images."

We first propose a simple yet efficient way of aggregating local image descriptors into a vector of limited dimension, which can be viewed as a simplification of the Fisher kernel representation. We then show how to jointly optimize the dimension reduction and the indexing algorithm, so that it best preserves the quality of vector comparison. The evaluation shows that our approach significantly outperforms the state of the art: the search accuracy is comparable to the bag-of-features approach for an image representation that fits in 20 bytes. Searching a 10 million image dataset takes about 50ms."

The most common approach has been based on the bag-of-words (BOW) method, in which local image features are clustered into visual words. This can provide significant savings in memory compared to storing and matching each feature independently. In this paper we take an additional step to reducing memory requirements by selecting only a small subset of the training features to use for recognition. This is based on the observation that many local features are unreliable or represent irrelevant clutter. We are able to select \u201cuseful\u201d features, which are both robust and distinctive, by an unsupervised preprocessing step that identifies correctly matching features among the training images. We demonstrate that this selection approach allows an average of 4% of the original features per image to provide matching performance that is as accurate as the full set. In addition, we employ a graph to represent the matching relationships between images. Doing so enables us to effectively augment the feature set for each image through merging of useful features of neighboring images. We demonstrate adjacent and 2-adjacent augmentation, both of which give a substantial boost in performance."

We, first, analyze bag-of-features in the framework of approximate nearest neighbor search. This shows the sub-optimality of such a representation for matching descriptors and leads us to derive a more precise representation based on 1) Hamming embedding (HE) and 2) weak geometric consistency constraints (WGC). HE provides binary signatures that refine the matching based on visual words. WGC filters matching descriptors that are not consistent in terms of angle and scale. HE and WGC are integrated within the inverted file and are efficiently exploited for all images, even in the case of very large datasets. Experiments performed on a dataset of one million of images show a significant improvement due to the binary signature and the weak geometric consistency constraints, as well as their efficiency. Estimation of the full geometric transformation, i.e., a re-ranking step on a short list of images, is complementary to our weak geometric consistency constraints and allows to further improve the accuracy."

In this paper we present a novel approach that includes an offline step of feature matching which allows us to observe how local descriptors transform under large camera motions.

Often, what is required is that images taken in the same place, of the same thing, or of the same person be conceptually grouped together. This work focuses on grouping images containing the same object, despite significant changes in scale, viewpoint and partial occlusions, in very large (1M+) image collections automatically gathered from Flicker. The scale of the data and the extreme variation in imaging conditions makes the problem very challenging. We describe a scalable method that first computes a matching graph over all the images. Image groups can then be mined from this graph using standard clustering techniques. The novelty we bring is that both the matching graph and the clustering methods are able to use the spatial consistency between the images arising from the common object (if there is one). We demonstrate our methods on a publicly available dataset of 5 K images of Oxford, a 37 K image dataset containing images of the Statue of Liberty, and a much larger 1M image dataset of Rome. This is, to our knowledge, the largest dataset to which image-based data mining has been applied."

This is a challenging task due to changes in scale, viewpoint and lighting between the query and the images in the database. One of the key problems in place recognition is the presence of objects such as trees or road markings, which frequently occur in the database and hence cause significant confusion between different places. As the main contribution, we show how to avoid features leading to confusion of particular places by using geotags attached to database images as a form of supervision. We develop a method for automatic detection of image-specific and spatially-localized groups of confusing features, and demonstrate that suppressing them significantly improves place recognition performance while reducing the database size. We show the method combines well with the state of the art bag-of-features model including query expansion, and demonstrate place recognition that generalizes over wide range of viewpoints and lighting conditions. Results are shown on a geotagged database of over 17K images of Paris downloaded from Google Street View."

Compact and yet discriminative appearance-based object class models are automatically learned from a set of training images. The method is simple and extremely fast, making it suitable for many applications such as semantic image retrieval, Web search, and interactive image editing. It classifies a region according to the proportions of different visual words (clusters in feature space). The specific visual words and the typical proportions in each object are learned from a segmented training set. The main contribution of this paper is twofold: i) an optimally compact visual dictionary is learned by pair-wise merging of visual words from an initially large dictionary. The final visual words are described by GMMs. ii) A novel statistical measure of discrimination is proposed which is optimized by each merge operation. High classification accuracy is demonstrated for nine object classes on photographs of real objects viewed under general lighting conditions, poses and viewpoints. The set of test images used for validation comprise: i) photographs acquired by us, ii) images from the Web and iii) images from the recently released Pascal dataset. The proposed algorithm performs well on both texture-rich objects (e.g. grass, sky, trees) and structure-rich ones (e.g. cars, bikes, planes)"

In this paper, we focus on learning such descriptors, which make use of the DAISY configuration and are simple to compute both sparsely and densely. We develop a new training set of match/non-match image patches which improves on previous work. We test a wide variety of gradient and steerable filter based configurations and optimize over all parameters to obtain low matching errors for the descriptors. We further explore robust normalization, dimension reduction and dynamic range reduction to increase the discriminative power and yet reduce the storage requirement of the learned descriptors. All these enable us to obtain highly efficient local descriptors: e.g, 13.2% error at 13 bytes storage per descriptor, compared with 26.1% error at 128 bytes for SIFT."

At the same time, retrieval with the proposed similarity function is faster than the reference method."

It is common practice to use the L 2 metric for comparing SIFT descriptors. This practice assumes that SIFT bins are aligned, an assumption which is often not correct due to quantization, distortion, occlusion etc. \n \nIn this paper we present a new Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) variant. We show that it is a metric (unlike the original EMD [1] which is a metric only for normalized histograms). Moreover, it is a natural extension of the L 1 metric. Second, we propose a linear time algorithm for the computation of the EMD variant, with a robust ground distance for oriented gradients. Finally, extensive experimental results on the Mikolajczyk and Schmid dataset [2] show that our method outperforms state of the art distances."

As kernel machines are difficult to scale to large training sets, it has been proposed to perform an explicit mapping of the data and to learn directly linear classifiers in the new space. In this paper, we consider the problem of learning image categorizers on large image sets (e.g. > 100k images) using bag-of-visual-words (BOV) image representations and Support Vector Machine classifiers. We experiment with three approaches to BOV embedding: 1) kernel PCA (kPCA) [15], 2) a modified kPCA we propose for additive kernels and 3) random projections for shift-invariant kernels [14]. We report experiments on 3 datasets: Cal-tech101, VOC07 and ImageNet. An important conclusion is that simply square-rooting BOV vectors \u2013 which corresponds to an exact mapping for the Bhattacharyya kernel \u2013 already leads to large improvements, often quite close to the best results obtained with additive kernels. Another conclusion is that, although it is possible to go beyond additive kernels, the embedding comes at a much higher cost."

                "text": "We propose a randomized data mining method that finds clusters of spatially overlapping images. The core of the method relies on the min-Hash algorithm for fast detection of pairs of images with spatial overlap, the so-called cluster seeds. The seeds are then used as visual queries to obtain clusters which are formed as transitive closures of sets of partially overlapping images that include the seed. We show that the probability of finding a seed for an image cluster rapidly increases with the size of the cluster. The properties and performance of the algorithm are demonstrated on data sets with 104, 105, and 5 \u00d7 106 images. The speed of the method depends on the size of the database and the number of clusters. The first stage of seed generation is close to linear for databases sizes up to approximately 234 \u00bf 1010 images. On a single 2.4 GHz PC, the clustering process took only 24 minutes for a standard database of more than 100,000 images, i.e., only 0.014 seconds per image."

This enables efficient learning methods for linear kernels to be applied to the non-linear intersection kernel, expanding the applicability of this model to much larger problems. In this paper we generalize this idea, and analyse a large family of additive kernels, called homogeneous, in a unified framework. The family includes the intersection, Hellinger's, and \u03c72 kernels commonly employed in computer vision. Using the framework we are able to: (i) provide explicit feature maps for all homogeneous additive kernels along with closed form expression for all common kernels; (ii) derive corresponding approximate finite-dimensional feature maps based on the Fourier sampling theorem; and (iii) quantify the extent of the approximation. We demonstrate that the approximations have indistinguishable performance from the full kernel on a number of standard datasets, yet greatly reduce the train/test times of SVM implementations. We show that the \u03c72 kernel, which has been found to yield the best performance in most applications, also has the most compact feature representation. Given these train/test advantages we are able to obtain a significant performance improvement over current state of the art results based on the intersection kernel."

In particular, common techniques which use feature detectors and descriptors to solve problems in image matching and augmented reality cannot be used due to their space and processing requirements. We propose a general descriptor compression method which reduces descriptor size and provides fast descriptor matching without requiring decompression. By demonstrating how to apply our method to the commonly used SIFT, SURF and GLOH descriptors, we show its effectiveness in reducing size and increasing accuracy. In all cases, we reduce the size of the descriptor by an order of magnitude and achieve higher accuracy at a detection rate of 95%."

The cross-bin \u03c72-like normalization reduces the effect of large bins having undo influence. Normalization was shown to be helpful in many cases, where the \u03c72 histogram distance outperformed the L2 norm. However, \u03c72 is sensitive to quantization effects, such as caused by light changes, shape deformations etc. The Quadratic-Form part of QC members takes care of cross-bin relationships (e.g. red and orange), alleviating the quantization problem. We present two new crossbin histogram distance properties: Similarity-Matrix-Quantization-Invariance and Sparseness-Invariance and show that QC distances have these properties.We also show that experimentally they boost performance. QC distances computation time complexity is linear in the number of non-zero entries in the bin-similarity matrix and histograms and it can easily be parallelized.We present results for image retrieval using the Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) and color image descriptors. In addition, we present results for shape classification using Shape Context (SC) and Inner Distance Shape Context (IDSC). We show that the new QC members outperform state of the art distances for these tasks, while having a short running time. The experimental results show that both the cross-bin property and the normalization are important."

The codebook approach describes an image as a bag of discrete visual codewords, where the frequency distributions of these words are used for image categorization. There are two drawbacks to the traditional codebook model: codeword uncertainty and codeword plausibility. Both of these drawbacks stem from the hard assignment of visual features to a single codeword. We show that allowing a degree of ambiguity in assigning codewords improves categorization performance for three state-of-the-art datasets."

Our scale and affine invariant detectors are based on the following recent results: (1) Interest points extracted with the Harris detector can be adapted to affine transformations and give repeatable results (geometrically stable). (2) The characteristic scale of a local structure is indicated by a local extremum over scale of normalized derivatives (the Laplacian). (3) The affine shape of a point neighborhood is estimated based on the second moment matrix.Our scale invariant detector computes a multi-scale representation for the Harris interest point detector and then selects points at which a local measure (the Laplacian) is maximal over scales. This provides a set of distinctive points which are invariant to scale, rotation and translation as well as robust to illumination changes and limited changes of viewpoint. The characteristic scale determines a scale invariant region for each point. We extend the scale invariant detector to affine invariance by estimating the affine shape of a point neighborhood. An iterative algorithm modifies location, scale and neighborhood of each point and converges to affine invariant points. This method can deal with significant affine transformations including large scale changes. The characteristic scale and the affine shape of neighborhood determine an affine invariant region for each point.We present a comparative evaluation of different detectors and show that our approach provides better results than existing methods. The performance of our detector is also confirmed by excellent matching results; the image is described by a set of scale/affine invariant descriptors computed on the regions associated with our points."

In the context of image search, burstiness corrupts the visual similarity measure, i.e., the scores used to rank the images. In this paper, we propose a strategy to handle visual bursts for bag-of-features based image search systems. Experimental results on three reference datasets show that our method significantly and consistently outperforms the state of the art."
