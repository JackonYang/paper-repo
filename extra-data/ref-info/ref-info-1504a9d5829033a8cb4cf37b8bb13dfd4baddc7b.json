While these taggers obtain high accuracy, linguistic information is captured indirectly, typically in tens of thousands of lexical and contextual probabilities. In (Brill 1992), a trainable rule-based tagger was described that obtained performance comparable to that of stochastic taggers, but captured relevant linguistic information in a small number of simple non-stochastic rules. In this paper, we describe a number of extensions to this rule-based tagger. First, we describe a method for expressing lexical relations in tagging that stochastic taggers are currently unable to express. Next, we show a rule-based approach to tagging unknown words. Finally, we show how the tagger-can be extended into a k-best tagger, where multiple tags can be assigned to words in some cases of uncertainty."

As opposed to the two dominant techniques of computing statistics or writing specialized grammars, our document-centered approach works by considering suggestive local contexts and repetitions of individual words within a document. This approach proved to be robust to domain shifts and new lexica and produced performance on the level with the highest reported results. When incorporated into a part-of-speech tagger, it helped reduce the error rate significantly on capitalized words and sentence boundaries. We also investigated the portability to other languages and obtained encouraging results."

In practice, we have found that maximum entropy models offer the following advantages: \nState-of-the-art accuracy. The probability models for all of the tasks discussed perform at or near state-of-the-art accuracies, or outperform competing learning algorithms when trained and tested under similar conditions. Methods which outperform those presented here require much more supervision in the form of additional human involvement or additional supporting resources. \nKnowledge-poor features. The facts used to model the data, or features, are linguistically very simple, or \"knowledge-poor\", but yet succeed in approximating complex linguistic relationships. \nReusable software technology. The mathematics of the maximum entropy framework are essentially independent of any particular task, and a single software implementation can be used for all of the probability models in this thesis. \nThe experiments in this thesis suggest that experimenters can obtain state-of-the-art accuracies on a wide range of natural language tasks, with little task-specific effort, by using maximum entropy probability models."
