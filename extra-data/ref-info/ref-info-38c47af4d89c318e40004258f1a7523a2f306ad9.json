                "text": "Graphical models provide a powerful general framework for encoding the structure of large-scale estimation problems. However, the graphs describing typical real-world phenomena contain many cycles, making direct estimation procedures prohibitively costly. In this paper, we develop an iterative inference algorithm for general Gaussian graphical models. It operates by exactly solving a series of modified estimation problems on spanning trees embedded within the original cyclic graph. When these subproblems are suitably chosen, the algorithm converges to the correct conditional means. Moreover, and in contrast to many other iterative methods, the tree-based procedures we propose can also be used to calculate exact error variances. Although the conditional mean iteration is effective for quite densely connected graphical models, the error variance computation is most efficient for sparser graphs. In this context, we present a modeling example suggesting that very sparsely connected graphs with cycles may provide significant advantages relative to their tree-structured counterparts, thanks both to the expressive power of these models and to the efficient inference algorithms developed herein. The convergence properties of the proposed tree-based iterations are characterized both analytically and experimentally. In addition, by using the basic tree-based iteration to precondition the conjugate gradient method, we develop an alternative, accelerated iteration that is finitely convergent. Simulation results are presented that demonstrate this algorithm's effectiveness on several inference problems, including a prototype distributed sensing application."

This allows us to analyze the computational hardness of the learning problem, and devise global optimization algorithms with proven performance guarantees. Markov networks are a class of graphical models that use an undirected graph to capture dependency information among random variables. Of particular interest are Markov networks over low treewidth graphs, under which many operations are tractable. We study the problem of finding a maximum likelihood distribution among Markov networks over graphs of bounded treewidth. We define the maximum hypertree problem, which is the problem of finding an acyclic hypergraph of bounded width, that maximizes the weight of hyperedges it covers (or equivalently, a triangulated graph of bounded clique size maximizing the weight of its cliques). We show that the maximum likelihood Markov network problem can be formulated as a maximum hypertree problem, and in fact the two problems are equivalent. This extends the work of Chow and Liu (1968) who considered the case where k = 1 (i.e. trees). We show that the maximum hypertree problem is NP-hard even for k = 2 and give the first constant factor approximation algorithm for it. More precisely, for any fixed treewidth objective k, we find a k-hypertree with an f(k) fraction of the maximum possible weight of any k-hypertree graph.

By exactly solving a series of modified problems on embedded spanning trees, it computes the conditional means with an efficiency comparable to or better than other techniques. Unlike other methods, the embedded trees algorithm also computes exact error covariances. The error covariance computation is most efficient for graphs in which removing a small number of edges reveals an embedded tree. In this context, we demonstrate that sparse loopy graphs can provide a significant increase in modeling power relative to trees, with only a minor increase in estimation complexity."

                "text": "Recently, a class of multiscale stochastic models has been introduced in which random processes and fields are described by scale-recursive dynamic trees. A major advantage of this framework is that it leads to an extremely efficient, statistically optimal algorithm for least-squares estimation. In certain applications, however, estimates based on the types of multiscale models previously proposed may not be adequate, as they have tended to exhibit a visually distracting blockiness. We eliminate this blockiness by discarding the standard assumption that distinct nodes on a given level of the multiscale process correspond to disjoint portions of the image domain; instead, we allow a correspondence to overlapping portions of the image domain. We use these so-called overlapping-tree models for both modeling and estimation. In particular, we develop an efficient multiscale algorithm for generating sample paths of a random field whose second-order statistics match a prespecified covariance structure, to any desired degree of fidelity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that under easily satisfied conditions, we can \"lift\" a random field estimation problem to one defined on an overlapped tree, resulting in an estimation algorithm that is computationally efficient, directly produces estimation error covariances, and eliminates blockiness in the reconstructed imagery without any sacrifice in the resolution of fine-scale detail."

Given the correlation structure of a 1-D or 2-D random process, our methods provide a systematic way to realize the given correlation as the finest scale of a multiscale process. Motivated by Akaike's use of canonical correlation analysis to develop both exact and reduced-order models for time-series, we too harness this tool to develop multiscale models. We apply our realization scheme to build reduced-order multiscale models for two applications, namely linear least-squares estimation and generation of random-field sample paths. For the numerical examples considered, least-squares estimates are obtained having nearly optimal mean-square errors, even with multiscale models of low order. Although both field estimates and field sample paths exhibit a visually distracting blockiness, this blockiness is not an important issue in many applications. For such applications, our approach to multiscale stochastic realization holds promise as a valuable, general tool."

When the graph is singly connected, local propagation rules of the sort proposed by Pearl (1988) are guaranteed to converge to the correct posterior probabilities. Recently a number of researchers have empirically demonstrated good performance of these same local propagation schemes on graphs with loops, but a theoretical understanding of this performance has yet to be achieved. For graphical models with a single loop, we derive an analytical relationship between the probabilities computed using local propagation and the correct marginals. Using this relationship we show a category of graphical models with loops for which local propagation gives rise to provably optimal maximum a posteriori assignments (although the computed marginals will be incorrect). We also show how nodes can use local information in the messages they receive in order to correct their computed marginals. We discuss how these results can be extended to graphical models with multiple loops and show simulation results suggesting that some properties of propagation on single-loop graphs may hold for a larger class of graphs. Specifically we discuss the implication of our results for understanding a class of recently proposed error-correcting codes known as turbo codes."

Local belief propagation rules of the sort proposed by Pearl (1988) are guaranteed to converge to the correct posterior probabilities in singly connected graphs. Recently, good performance has been obtained by using these same rules on graphs with loops, a method we refer to as loopy belief propagation. Perhaps the most dramatic instance is the near Shannon-limit performance of Turbo codes, whose decoding algorithm is equivalent to loopy propagation. Except for the case of graphs with a single loop, there has been little theoretical understanding of loopy propagation. Here we analyze belief propagation in networks with arbitrary topologies when the nodes in the graph describe jointly gaussian random variables. We give an analytical formula relating the true posterior probabilities with those calculated using loopy propagation. We give sufficient conditions for convergence and show that when belief propagation converges, it gives the correct posterior means for all graph topologies, not just networks with a single loop. These results motivate using the powerful belief propagation algorithm in a broader class of networks and help clarify the empirical performance results."

A natural framework for developing such a theory is the study of stochastic processes indexed by nodes on lattices or trees in which different depths in the tree or lattice correspond to different spatial scales in representing a signal or image. In particular, it is shown how the wavelet transform directly suggests such a modeling paradigm. This perspective then leads directly to the investigation of several classes of dynamic models and related notions of multiscale stationarity in which scale plays the role of a time-like variable. The investigation of models on homogeneous trees is emphasized. The framework examined here allows for consideration, in a very natural way, of the fusion of data from sensors with differing resolutions. Also, thanks to the fact that wavelet transforms do an excellent job of 'compressing' large classes of covariance kernels, it is seen that these modeling paradigms appear to have promise in a far broader context than one might expect. >"

However, there has been little understanding of the algorithm or the nature of the solutions it finds for general graphs. \n \nWe show that BP can only converge to a stationary point of an approximate free energy, known as the Bethe free energy in statistical physics. This result characterizes BP fixed-points and makes connections with variational approaches to approximate inference. \n \nMore importantly, our analysis lets us build on the progress made in statistical physics since Bethe's approximation was introduced in 1935. Kikuchi and others have shown how to construct more accurate free energy approximations, of which Bethe's approximation is the simplest. Exploiting the insights from our analysis, we derive generalized belief propagation (GBP) versions of these Kikuchi approximations. These new message passing algorithms can be significantly more accurate than ordinary BP, at an adjustable increase in complexity. We illustrate such a new GBP algorithm on a grid Markov network and show that it gives much more accurate marginal probabilities than those found using ordinary BP."

It includes belief propagation (BP), which can be reformulated as a very local form of reparameterization. More generally, we consider algorithms that perform exact computations over spanning trees of the full graph. On the practical side, we find that such tree reparameterization (TRP) algorithms have convergence properties superior to BP. The reparameterization perspective also provides a number of theoretical insights into approximate inference, including a new characterization of fixed points; and an invariance intrinsic to TRP/BP. These two properties enable us to analyze and bound the error between the TRP/BP approximations and the actual marginals. While our results arise naturally from the TRP perspective, most of them apply in an algorithm-independent manner to any local minimum of the Bethe free energy. Our results also have natural extensions to more structured approximations [e.g., 1, 2]."

This also leads to greater efficiency in terms of the computational algorithms that empower such representations. The increasing complexity of these models, however, quickly renders exact probabilistic calculations infeasible. We propose a principled framework for approximating graphical models based on variational methods. \nWe develop variational techniques from the perspective that unifies and expands their applicability to graphical models. These methods allow the (recursive) computation of upper and lower bounds on the quantities of interest. Such bounds yield considerably more information than mere approximations and provide an inherent error metric for tailoring the approximations individually to the cases considered. These desirable properties, concomitant to the variational methods, are unlikely to arise as a result of other deterministic or stochastic approximations. \nThe thesis consists of the development of this variational methodology for probabilistic inference, Bayesian estimation, and towards efficient diagnostic reasoning in the domain of internal medicine.

In this paper we investigate the behavior of an PPA in graphs with a single cycle such as the graph of a tail-biting code. First, we show that for strictly positive local kernels, the iterations of the PPA converge to a unique fixed point, (which was also observed by Anderson and Hladik (1998) and Weiss (1997)). Secondly, we shall generalize a result of McEliece and Rodemich (1995), by showing that if the hidden variables in the cycle are binary-valued, the PPA will always make an optimal decision. (This was also observed independently by Weiss). When the hidden variables can assume 3 or more values, the behavior of the PPA is much harder to characterize."

This paper gives an \"orthogonal\" decomposition of such a system based on information geometry. A typical example is the decomposition of stochastic dependency among a number of random variables. In general, they have a complex structure of dependencies. Pairwise dependency is easily represented by correlation, but it is more difficult to measure effects of pure triplewise or higher order interactions (dependencies) among these variables. Stochastic dependency is decomposed quantitatively into an \"orthogonal\" sum of pairwise, triplewise, and further higher order dependencies. This gives a new invariant decomposition of joint entropy. This problem is important for extracting intrinsic interactions in firing patterns of an ensemble of neurons and for estimating its functional connections. The orthogonal decomposition is given in a wide class of hierarchical structures including both exponential and mixture families. As an example, we decompose the dependency in a higher order Markov chain into a sum of those in various lower order Markov chains."

Hammersley and Clifford [3] proved the same result for the more general case when the domain is the set of sites of an arbitrary finite graph and the number of possible states for each site is finite. In order to show this, they extended the notion of a Gibbs ensemble to embrace more complex interactions than occur on the cubic lattice. Their method was circuitous and showed merely the existence of a potential function for a Markov field with little indication of its form. In [4], Preston gives a more direct approach to the two-state problem and presents an explicit formula for the potential. We show here that the equivalence of Markov fields and Gibbs ensembles follows immediately from a very simple application of the Mobius inversion theorem of [5] which allows us to construct a natural expression for the potential function of a Markov field. We confine our attention to the set of sites of an arbitrary finite graph and allow each site to be in any one of a countable set of states. The two-state solution of Preston emerges as a corollary."

However, the computing time is typically exponential in the number of nodes in the graph. Within the variational framework for approximating these models, we present two classes of distributions, decimatable Boltzmann Machines and Tractable Belief Networks that go beyond the standard factorized approach. We give generalised mean-field equations for both these directed and undirected approximations. Simulation results on a small benchmark problem suggest using these richer approximations compares favorably against others previously reported in the literature."

                "text": "The focus of this thesis is on the identification of multiscale autoregressive (MAR) models for stochastic processes from second-order statistical characterizations. The class of MAR processes constitutes a rich and powerful stochastic modeling framework that admits efficient statistical inference algorithms. To harness the utility of MAR processes requires that the phenomena of interest be effectively modeled in the framework. This thesis addresses this challenge and develops MAR model identification theory and algorithms that overcome some of the limitations of previous approaches (e.g., model inconsistency and computational complexity) and that extend the breadth of applicability of the framework. One contribution of this thesis is the resolution of the problem of model inconsistency. This is achieved through a new parameterization of so-called internal MAR processes. This new parameterization admits a computationally efficient, scale-recursive approach to model realization. The efficiency of this approach stems from both its scale-recursive structure and from a novel application of the estimation-theoretic concept of predictive efficiency. Another contribution of this thesis is to provide a unification of the MAR and wavelet frameworks. This unification leads to wavelet-based stochastic models that are fundamentally different from conventional ones. \nA limitation of previous MAR model identification approaches is that they require a complete second-order characterization of the process to be modeled. Relaxing this assumption leads to the problem of covariance extension in which unknown covariance elements are inferred from known ones. This thesis makes two contributions in this area. First, the classical covariance extension algorithm (Levinson's algorithm) is generalized to address a wider range of extension problems. Second, this algorithm is applied to the problem of designing a MAR model from a partially known covariance matrix. The final contribution of this thesis is the development of techniques for incorporating nonlocal variables (e.g., multiresolution measurements) into a MAR model. These techniques are more powerful than those previously developed and lead to computational efficiencies in model realization and statistical inference.

In this paper, we will recast the YFW results in the context of the \u201cgeneralized distributive law\u201d [1] formulation of belief propagation. Our main result is that if the GDL is applied to junction graph, the fixed points of the algorithm are in one-to-one correspondence with the stationary points of a certain Bethe-Kikuchi free energy. If the junction graph has no cycles, the BK free energy is convex and has a unique stationary point, which is a global minimum. On the other hand, if the junction graph has cycles, the main result at least shows that the GDL is trying to do something sensible."

Institute of Mathematical Statistics is collaborating with JSTOR to digitize, preserve and extend access to The Annals of Probability. Some geometric properties of PD's are established, Kullback's I-divergence playing the role of squared Euclidean distance. The minimum discrimination information problem is viewed as that of projecting a PD onto a convex set of PD's and useful existence theorems for and characterizations of the minimizing PD are arrived at. A natural generalization of known iterative algorithms converging to the minimizing PD in special situations is given; even for those special cases, our convergence proof is more generally valid than those previously published. As corollaries of independent interest, generalizations of known results on the existence of PD's or nonnegative matrices of a certain form are obtained. The Lagrange multiplier technique is not used."

We conclude that: 1) \"Orthodox\" sampling theory methods are useful in problems where we have a known model (sampling distribution) for the properties of the noise, but no appreciable prior information about the quantities being estimated. 2) MAXENT is optimal in problems where we have prior information about multiplicities, but no noise. 3) The full Bayesian solution includes both of these as special cases and is needed in problems where we have both prior information and noise. 4) AR models are in one sense a special case of MAXENT, but in another sense they are ubiquitous in all spectral analysis problems with discrete time series. 5) Empirical methods such as Blackman-Tukey, which do not invoke even a likelihood function, are useful in the preliminary, exploratory phase of a problem where our knowledge is sufficient to permit intuitive judgments about how to organize a calculation (smoothing, decimation, windows, prewhitening, padding with zeroes, etc.) but insufficient to set up a quantitative model which would do the proper things for us automatically and optimally."

The solution of the new problem formulation is computed with an efficient multiscale algorithm. Experiments on several image sequences demonstrate the substantial computational savings that can be achieved due to the fact that the algorithm is noniterative and in fact has a per pixel computational complexity that is independent of image size. The new approach also has a number of other important advantages. Specifically, multiresolution flow field estimates are available, allowing great flexibility in dealing with the tradeoff between resolution and accuracy. Multiscale error covariance information is also available, which is of considerable use in assessing the accuracy of the estimates. In particular, these error statistics can be used as the basis for a rational procedure for determining the spatially-varying optimal reconstruction resolution. Furthermore, if there are compelling reasons to insist upon a standard smoothness constraint, the new algorithm provides an excellent initialization for the iterative algorithms associated with the smoothness constraint problem formulation. Finally, the usefulness of the approach should extend to a wide variety of ill-posed inverse problems in which variational techniques seeking a \"smooth\" solution are generally used."

We extend the standard mean field method by using an approximating distribution that factorises into cluster potentials. This includes undirected graphs, directed acyclic graphs and junction trees. We derive generalized mean field equations to optimize the cluster potentials. We show that the method bridges the gap between the standard mean field approximation and the exact junction tree algorithm. In addition, we address the problem of how to choose the graphical structure of the approximating distribution. From the generalised mean field equations we derive rules to simplify the structure of the approximating distribution in advance without affecting the quality of the approximation.

These models are hierarchical models that can be represented by a simple, undirected graph on as many vertices as the dimension of the corresponding table. Further all these models can be given an interpretation in terms of conditional independence and the interpretation can be read directly off the graph in the form of a Markov property. The class of graphical models contains that of decomposable models and we give a simple criterion for decomposability of a given graphical model. To some extent we discuss estimation problems and give suggestions for further work."

The network polynomial itself is exponential in size, but we show how it can be computed efficiently using an arithmetic circuit that can be evaluated and differentiated in time and space linear in the circuit size. The proposed framework for inference subsumes one of the most influential methods for inference in Bayesian networks, known as the tree-clustering or jointree method, which provides a deeper understanding of this classical method and lifts its desirable characteristics to a much more general setting. We discuss some theoretical and practical implications of this subsumption."

Standard algorithms such as EM (or em) used in this context are unfortunately not stable in the sense that they can lead to a dramatic loss of accuracy with the inclusion of incomplete observations. We provide a more controlled solution to this problem through differential equations that govern the evolution of locally optimal solutions (fixed points) as a function of the source weighting. This approach permits us to explicitly identify any critical (bifurcation) points leading to choices unsupported by the available complete data. The approach readily applies to any graphical model in O(n) time where n is the number of parameters. We use the naive Bayes model to illustrate these ideas and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in the context of text classification problems.

                "text": "Hidden Markov models (HMMs) have proven to be one of the most widely used tools for learning probabilistic models of time series data. In an HMM, information about the past is conveyed through a single discrete variable\u2014the hidden state. We discuss a generalization of HMMs in which this state is factored into multiple state variables and is therefore represented in a distributed manner. We describe an exact algorithm for inferring the posterior probabilities of the hidden state variables given the observations, and relate it to the forward\u2013backward algorithm for HMMs and to algorithms for more general graphical models. Due to the combinatorial nature of the hidden state representation, this exact algorithm is intractable. As in other intractable systems, approximate inference can be carried out using Gibbs sampling or variational methods. Within the variational framework, we present a structured approximation in which the the state variables are decoupled, yielding a tractable algorithm for learning the parameters of the model. Empirical comparisons suggest that these approximations are efficient and provide accurate alternatives to the exact methods. Finally, we use the structured approximation to model Bach's chorales and show that factorial HMMs can capture statistical structure in this data set which an unconstrained HMM cannot."

Theoretical and experimental results have shown that these models provide an extremely rich framework for representing both processes which are intrinsically multiscale, e.g., 1/f processes, as well as 1D Markov processes and 2D Markov random fields. Moreover, efficient optimal estimation algorithms have been developed for these models by exploiting their scale-recursive structure. The authors exploit this structure in order to develop a computationally efficient and parallelizable algorithm for likelihood calculation. They illustrate one possible application to texture discrimination and demonstrate that likelihood-based methods using the algorithm achieve performance comparable to that of Gaussian Markov random field based techniques, which in general are prohibitively complex computationally."

Building on original research by the authors over a number of years, this book gives a thorough and rigorous mathematical treatment of the underlying ideas, structures, and algorithms, emphasizing those cases in which exact answers are obtainable. The book will be of interest to researchers and graduate students in artificial intelligence who desire an understanding of the mathematical and statistical basis of probabilistic expert systems, and to students and research workers in statistics wanting an introduction to this fascinating and rapidly developing field. The careful attention to detail will also make this work an important reference source for all those involved in the theory and applications of probabilistic expert systems."

In this paper they present a detailed system-theoretic analysis of this filter and of the new scale-recursive Riccati equation associated with it. While this analysis is similar in spirit to that for standard Kalman filters, the structure of the dyadic tree leads to several significant differences. In particular, the structure of the Kalman filter error dynamics leads to the formulation of an ML version of the filtering equation and to a corresponding smoothing algorithm based on triangularizing the Hamiltonian for the smoothing problem. In addition, the notion of stability for dynamics requires some care as do the concepts of reachability and observability. Using these system-theoretic constructs, the stability and steady-state behavior of the fine-to-coarse Kalman filter and its Riccati equation are analysed. >"

As expected, the resulting estimators are unbiased and consistent. Computations can be performed iteratively, by using simple Monte Carlo algorithms, with remarkable success, as demonstrated by simulations. The work concentrates on binary, second-order Gibbs random fields, de6ned on a rectangular lattice. However, the proposed methods can be easily extended to more general Gibbs random fields.

The dualistic structures of the exponential families and curved exponential families are elucidated from the geometrical viewpoint. The duality connected by the Legendre transformation is thus extended to include two kinds of affine connections and two kinds of curvatures. The second-order information loss is calculated for Fisher-efficient estimators, and is decomposed into the sum of two non-negative terms. One is related to the exponential curvature of the statistical model and the other is related to the mixture curvature of the estimator. Only the latter term depends on the estimator, and vanishes for the maximum-likelihood estimator. A set of statistics which recover the second-order information loss are given. The second-order efficiency also is obtained. The differential geometry of the function space of distributions is discussed."

We consider relative entropy minimisation and an iterative algorithm for its calculation, which exploits the presence of multiple constraints. Using these principles, optimal iterative decoders, with guaranteed monotone convergence will be described, followed by reduced-complexity sub-optimal decoders which may or may not converge. Also discussed is the use of iterative relative entropy minimisation for optimal inference on sets of data that are generated independently, but are not independent given an observation (e.g. joint channel estimation and data detection). It is shown that the general marginalised iterative relative entropy algorithm has xed points. Conditions for monotone convergence (to a xed point) of the marginalised iterative algorithm (i.e. turbo-style decoder) are derived."

                "text": "in general plane regions and with respect to linear boundary conditions, is a classical problem of numerical analysis. Many such boundary value problems have been solved successfully on high-speed computing machines, using the (iterative) Young-Frankel \"successive overrelaxation\" (SOR) method as defined in [1 ] and [2], and variants thereof (\"line\" and \"block\" overrelaxation). For this method, estimates of the rate of convergence and the \"optimum relaxation factor\" can both be rigorously extended from the special case of V2u = S in a rectangle, and Dirichlet-type boundary conditions, to the general case. Recently, two variants [3; 4] of a new \"implicit alternating direction\" (IAD) method have been proved to converge much more rapidly, in the special case just mentioned, than the successive overrelaxation method and its variants. This fact has led to much speculation regarding the relative rates of convergence of SOR and IAD methods for more general elliptic boundary value problems. In [3, p. 41], suceess was reported in solving V2u= S for \"several examples involving more complex regions and less simple boundary conditions,\" but no theoretical analysis was given of the convergence rate of the \"Peaceman-Rachford\" process used in these examples. In [4, p. 421], the \"Douglas-Rachford\" process was asserted to be stable (i.e., convergent) for V2u = S and Dirichlet-type boundary conditions in general plane regions, but again the cases of variable D, N 0, and mixed boundary conditions were not covered. Our main result below (Theorem 3) is that the convergence estimates given in [3] and [4] are applicable to the modified Helmholtz equation c2u V2u = S in a rectangle with sides parallel to the axes, with the boundary condition au/an+ku=0, k>O, and essentially to no other case. In dramatic contrast to the situation as regards SOR methods, the analysis of the rectangular case, via discrete Fourier analysis of eigenfunctions, gives no clue as to the general self-adjoint case. Nevertheless, IAD methods work well for many other cases of great interest. We present in ??8-9 also a few positive results, giving partial theoretical justification for this success."

Unlike loopy belief propagation, which iterates fixed point equations, we directly descend on the Bethe free energy. The algorithm consists of two phases, first we update the pairwise probabilities, given the marginal probabilities at each unit, using an analytic expression. Next, we update the marginal probabilities, by following the negative gradient of the Bethe free energy. Both steps are guaranteed to decrease the Bethe free energy, and since it is lower bounded, the algorithm is guaranteed to converge to a local minimum. We also show that the Bethe free energy is equal to the TAP free energy up to second order in the weights. In experiments we confirm that when belief propagation converges it usually finds identical solutions as our belief optimization method. The stable nature of belief optimization makes it ideally suited for learning graphical models from data."

                "text": "Statistical modeling and estimation of large-scale dynamic systems is important in a wide range of scientific applications. Conventional optimal estimation methods, however, are impractical due to their computational complexity. In this thesis, we consider an alternative multiscale modeling framework first developed by Basseville, Willsky, et al. [6, 18]. This multiscale estimation methodology has been successfully applied to a number of large-scale static estimation problems, one of which is the application of the socalled 11f multiscale models to the mapping of ocean surface height from satellite altimetric measurements. A modified 11f model is used in this thesis to jointly estimate the surface height of the Mediterranean Sea and the correlated component of the measurement noise in order to remove the artifacts apparent in maps generated with the more simplistic assumption that the measurement noise is white. The main contribution of this thesis is the extension of the multiscale framework to dynamic estimation. We introduce a recursive procedure that propagates a multiscale model for the estimation errors in a manner analogous to, but more efficient than, the Kalman filter's propagation of the error covariances. With appropriately chosen multiscale models, such as the new class of non-redundant models that we introduce, the computational gain can be substantial. We use I-D and 2-D diffusion processes to illustrate the development of our algorithm. The resulting multiscale estimators achieve O(N) computational complexity with near-optimal performance in I-D and 0 (N 3/2) in 2-D, as compared to the 0 (N 3) complexity of the standard Kalman filter. Thesis Supervisor: Alan S. Willsky Title: Professor of Electrical Engineering Acknowledgments I wish to express my deepest gratitude to my thesis advisor, Prof. Alan Willsky. This thesis would not have been possible without the many great ideas he so freely and generously gave out. His intellectual prowess and his energy have been inspirational. Alan allows his student wide latitude to explore interesting research ideas, yet pays close attention to keep progress on track. His gentle encouragement and firm guidance have been instrumental in the completion of this work. I would like to thank Prof. Paul Fieguthl for his help throughout my Ph.D. program and for serving on my thesis committee. I benefited a great deal from observing, at close range, a sharp mind at work and at play. I would like to thank Dr. Dimitris Menemenlis and Paul for our work on the oceanography application in Chapter 6. Paul and Dimitris generously allowed me to claim a lot of their work as my own. I would like to thank Prof. Carl Wunsch and Prof. Sanjoy Mitter for valuable discussions and for graciously serving on my thesis committee. I would like to thank the American taxpayers for their generous financial support through three years of National Science Foundation Graduate Fellowship and three years of research assistantships underwritten by the Army. After twenty-one years in school, although without paying a cent in tuition, I am finally ready to earn my keep and repay my debt to society in part by striving to put myself into a higher tax bracket. My Ph.D. experience would have been less satisfying had I not had the company of the many wonderful SSG groupies, past and present. The number of good people I shall mention here bears testimony to how long it has taken me to finish my thesis (and/or how prosperous SSG has been). I would like to thank Cedric for his daily 2 dose of insanity checks, Qedric-ism , major contribution to the SSG Manifesto Board, 'formerly Dr. Paul, and more formerly just Paul 2Qedric-ism example 1: \"Will it ever end?\" \"No.\" Example 2: \"Big, fat, bloated, blood sucking ticks on the back of the $$G ca$h cow.\" and 2 x K20'. I would like to thank Mike S. for our insightful discussions on, among a great variety of topics, cookie recipes, for our successful attempts at the asexual propagation of Chlorophytum, and for our interesting experiment with a ChiaCat. I would like to thank Paul, now Prof. Paul, for delaying the implementation of his 5 Manifesto on Technology . I would like to thank Andy V for allowing me to pick on him, but like what Dewey would say, \"Yeah, whatever.\" I would like to thank AJ for giving me grief about T. Rex'ing the computers in ingenious ways from time to time. I would like to thank Frakt for many trips to the brickyard'. I would like to thank Ilya for his fine taste in chocolate and ballet. I would like to thank John-John, Rachel, Seema, Mike D., Charlie, and Bill for being far too well-adjusted and all too married to be poked fun here. To be in the company of such capable a group of people is truly a humbling experience. My Ph.D. years in the larger context of my MIT experience had been influenced by my other personal friends and two in particular. I would like to thank Ed for his friendship and for being there with me whether it was 100 feet under the Caribbean or 54' under the equator. I would like to thank Sunil for his friendship, for being brave enough to step out of a Cessna at 3000 feet with me, twice, and for being even more brave to agree to sit in the right seat of my Katana. I thank my parents for their love, support, and understanding through these years. I hope they may find some pride and joy in whatever meager achievements I have had. With the completion of this thesis I am again at a crossroad in my life. I look back with a sense of accomplishment and pride mixed with a sense of closure and renaissance. I think of the many people who came into my life some by design and some by accident people who shaped and influenced who I am today. For better or for worse, it's been an experience. 3Krank2O, substituted variously with Surge, Jolt, Storm, Mountain Dew, or Dr. Pepper. 4spiderplant 'The resemblance extends to facial features. 6a.k.a.

The codes are built from highly irregular bipartite graphs with carefully chosen degree patterns on both sides. Our theoretical analysis of the codes is based on the work of Richardson and Urbanke (see ibid., vol.47, no.2, p.599-618, 2000). Assuming that the underlying communication channel is symmetric, we prove that the probability densities at the message nodes of the graph possess a certain symmetry. Using this symmetry property we then show that, under the assumption of no cycles, the message densities always converge as the number of iterations tends to infinity. Furthermore, we prove a stability condition which implies an upper bound on the fraction of errors that a belief-propagation decoder can correct when applied to a code induced from a bipartite graph with a given degree distribution. Our codes are found by optimizing the degree structure of the underlying graphs. We develop several strategies to perform this optimization. We also present some simulation results for the codes found which show that the performance of the codes is very close to the asymptotic theoretical bounds."

After reviewing a variety of graphical models (Markov random fields, Tanner graphs, and Bayesian networks), we derive a general distributed marginalization algorithm for functions described by factor graphs. From this general algorithm, Pearl's (1986) belief propagation algorithm is easily derived as a special case. We point out that iterative decoding algorithms for various codes, including \"turbo decoding\" of parallel-concatenated convolutional codes, may be viewed as probability propagation in a graphical model of the code. We focus on Bayesian network descriptions of codes, which give a natural input/state/output/channel description of a code and channel, and we indicate how iterative decoders can be developed for parallel-and serially concatenated coding systems, product codes, and low-density parity-check codes."

The set of all the Boltzmann machines with a fixed topology forms a geometric manifold of high dimension, where modifiable synaptic weights of connections play the role of a coordinate system to specify networks. A learning trajectory, for example, is a curve in this manifold. It is important to study the geometry of the neural manifold, rather than the behavior of a single network, in order to know the capabilities and limitations of neural networks of a fixed topology. Using the new theory of information geometry, a natural invariant Riemannian metric and a dual pair of affine connections on the Boltzmann neural network manifold are established. The meaning of geometrical structures is elucidated from the stochastic and the statistical point of view. This leads to a natural modification of the Boltzmann machine learning rule."

                "text": "One of the major obstacles to using Bayesian methods for pattern recognition has been its computational expense. This thesis presents an approximation technique that can perform Bayesian inference faster and more accurately than previously possible. This method, \u201cExpectation Propagation,\u201d unifies and generalizes two previous techniques: assumed-density filtering, an extension of the Kalman filter, and loopy belief propagation, an extension of belief propagation in Bayesian networks. The unification shows how both of these algorithms can be viewed as approximating the true posterior distribution with simpler distribution, which is close in the sense of KL-divergence. Expectation Propagation exploits the best of both algorithms: the generality of assumed-density filtering and the accuracy of loopy belief propagation. \nLoopy belief propagation, because it propagates exact belief states, is useful for limited types of belief networks, such as purely discrete networks. Expectation Propagation approximates the belief states with expectations, such as means and variances, giving it much wider scope. Expectation Propagation also extends belief propagation in the opposite direction\u2014propagating richer belief states which incorporate correlations between variables. \nThis framework is demonstrated in a variety of statistical models using synthetic and real-world data. On Gaussian mixture problems, Expectation Propagation is found, for the same amount of computation, to be convincingly better than rival approximation techniques: Monte Carlo, Laplace's method, and variational Bayes. For pattern recognition, Expectation Propagation provides an algorithm for training Bayes Point Machine classifiers that is faster and more accurate than any previously known. The resulting classifiers outperform Support Vector Machines on several standard datasets, in addition to having a comparable training time. Expectation Propagation can also be used to choose an appropriate feature set for classification, via Bayesian model selection.

The significance of the variance equation is illustrated by examples which duplicate, simplify, or extend earlier results in this field. The Duality Principle relating stochastic estimation and deterministic control problems plays an important role in the proof of theoretical results.

A similar fraction (6 of 33) of the articles in the 1988 volume of Psychometrika include simulations; comparable proportions could be expected in other journals at the boundary of theoretical statistics and social/psychological applications. Due in part to the complexity of the problems tackled today and in part to the availability of cheap, powerful computing\u2014by no means independent influences\u2014simulation and Monte Carlo methods have become both necessary and practical tools for statisticians and applied workers in quantitative areas of education and psychology. Simulation has become popular\u2014not only in the quantitative social sciences, but in all of the mathematical sciences from physics to operations research to number theory\u2014because it is almost always easy to do. This ease of use makes the simulation experimenter vulnerable to two common pitfalls. Selection of the basic source of \"random numbers\" is often passive: Whatever is available in the computer's standard subroutine library is used. However, the fact that a pseudo-random number generator appears in a popular software package or operating system is hardly reason to trust it, as is shown by the infamous RANDU generator, once popular on IBM mainframes and PDP mini-computers, and by the generators burned into RAM on today's PCs. Simulation design and reporting also deserve special care. Some attempt must be made to assess the accuracy of the simulation estimates: One should accurately estimate and report SE (6) as well as 6. In addition, enough detail should be reported that the interested reader can replicate the study and check the results, just as with other experiments. Yet these considerations are also easy to overlook. Brian D. Ripley's Stochastic Simulation is a short, yet ambitious, survey of modern simulation techniques. Three themes run throughout the book. First, one shoud not take basic simulation subroutines for granted, especially on minior microcomputers where they tend to be poor implementations, implementations of poor algorithms, or both. Second, design of experiments, or variance reduction as it is known in this field, deserves greater consideration. Third, modern methods make it possible to simulate and analyze processes that are dependent over time, and using such processes opens the door to new simulation techniques, such as simulated annealing in optimization. Ripley intends this book to be a \"comprehensive guide,\" and it is indeed most accurately described as a researcher's handbook with examples and"

The most dramatic instance of this is the near Shannon-limit performance of \"Turbo Codes\" -- codes whose decoding algorithm is equivalent to loopy belief propagation in a chain-structured Bayesian network. \n \nIn this paper we ask: is there something special about the error-correcting code context, or does loopy propagation work as an approximate inference scheme in a more general setting? We compare the marginals computed using loopy propagation to the exact ones in four Bayesian network architectures, including two real-world networks: ALARM and QMR. We find that the loopy beliefs often converge and when they do, they give a good approximation to the correct marginals. However, on the QMR network, the loopy beliefs oscillated and had no obvious relationship to the correct posteriors. We present some initial investigations into the cause of these oscillations, and show that some simple methods of preventing them lead to the wrong results."

                "text": "A recently developed multiresolution estimation framework offers the possibility of highly efficient statistical analysis, interpolation, and smoothing of extremely large data sets in a multiscale fashion. This framework enjoys a number of advantages not shared by other statistically-based methods. In particular, the algorithms resulting from this framework have complexity that scales only linearly with problem size, yielding constant complexity load per grid point independent of problem size. Furthermore these algorithms directly provide interpolated estimates at multiple resolutions, accompanying error variance statistics of use in assessing resolutionlaccuracy tradeoffs and in detecting statistically significant anomalies, and maximum likelihood estimates of parameters such as spectral power law coefficients. Moreover, the efficiency of these algorithms is completely insensitive to irregularities in the sampling or spatial distribution of measurements and to heterogeneities in measurement errors or model parameters. For these reasons this approach has the potential of being an effective tool in a variety of remote sensing problems. In this paper, we demonstrate a realization of this potential by applying the multiresolution framework to a problem of considerable current interest-the interpolation and statistical analysis of ocean surface data from the TOPEXPOSEIDON altimeter"

The method exploits the structure of conditional probabilities of a target node given the evidence. First, the set of parameters which is relevant to the calculation of the conditional probabilities of the target node is identified. Next, this set is reduced by removing those combinations of the parameters which either contradict the available evidence or are incompatible. Finally, using the canonical components associated with the resulting subset of parameters, the desired conditional probabilities are obtained. In this way, an important saving in the calculations is achieved. The proposed method can also be used to compute exact upper and lower bounds for the conditional probabilities, hence a sensitivity analysis can be easily performed. Examples are used to illustrate the proposed methodology."

The QMR network is a large-scale probabilistic graphical model built on statistical and expert knowledge. Exact probabilistic inference is infeasible in this model for all but a small set of cases.

We improve on Gallager's results by introducing irregular parity-check matrices and a new rigorous analysis of hard-decision decoding of these codes. We also provide efficient methods for finding good irregular structures for such decoding algorithms. Our rigorous analysis based on martingales, our methodology for constructing good irregular codes, and the demonstration that irregular structure improves performance constitute key points of our contribution. We also consider irregular codes under belief propagation. We report the results of experiments testing the efficacy of irregular codes on both binary-symmetric and Gaussian channels. For example, using belief propagation, for rate 1/4 codes on 16000 bits over a binary-symmetric channel, previous low-density parity-check codes can correct up to approximately 16% errors, while our codes correct over 17%. In some cases our results come very close to reported results for turbo codes, suggesting that variations of irregular low density parity-check codes may be able to match or beat turbo code performance."

This approach yields valuable new insights regarding the computation of channel capacities and rate-distortion functions. In particular, it suggests a simple algorithm for computing channel capacity that consists of a mapping from the set of channel input probability vectors into itself such that the sequence of probability vectors generated by successive applications of the mapping converges to the vector that achieves the capacity of the given channel. Analogous algorithms then are provided for computing rate-distortion functions and constrained channel capacities. The algorithms apply both to discrete and to continuous alphabet channels or sources. In addition, a formalization of the theory of channel capacity in the presence of constraints is included.

Our intended application of support theory is to enable proving condition number bounds for preconditioners for symmetric, positive definite systems. One key feature sets our approach apart from most other works: We use support numbers instead of generalized eigenvalues. Although closely related, we believe support numbers are more convenient to work with algebraically. \nThis paper provides the theoretical foundation of support theory and describes a set of analytical tools and techniques. For example, we present a new theorem for bounding support numbers (generalized eigenvalues) where the matrices have a known factorization (not necessarily square or triangular). This result generalizes earlier results based on graph theory. We demonstrate the utility of this approach by a simple example: block Jacobi preconditioning on a model problem. Also, our analysis of a new class of preconditioners, maximum-weight basis preconditioners, in [E. G. Boman, D. Chen, B. Hendrickson, and S. Toledo, Numer.

In many situations, one can solve this system efficiently using a Krylov subspace method, such as the conjugate gradient (CG) algorithm. Computing the estimation error variances is a more intricate task. It is difficult because the error variances are the diagonal elements of a matrix expression involving the inverse of a given matrix. This paper presents a method for using the conjugate search directions generated by the CG algorithm to obtain a convergent approximation to the estimation error variances. The algorithm for computing the error variances falls out naturally from a new estimation-theoretic interpretation of the CG algorithm. This paper discusses this interpretation and convergence issues and presents numerical examples. The examples include a 105-dimensional estimation problem from oceanography."

In such an analysis, basically the relation between the network's output and every single one of its parameters is established. This relation is known to be a simple mathematical function, expressing the network's output as a quotient of two linear functions in a parameter under study. We present a method for computationally eecient sensitivity analysis. Our method requires a single outward propagation in a junction tree for establishing the mathematical functions for the network's output in terms of all its parameters, in addition to a full propagation for processing evidence. Conversely, our method provides for establishing the mathematical functions for all possible outputs in terms of a single parameter under study, also by means of a single outward propagation."

For memoryless binary-input continuous-output additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels and sum-product decoders, we use a Gaussian approximation for message densities under density evolution to simplify the analysis of the decoding algorithm. We convert the infinite-dimensional problem of iteratively calculating message densities, which is needed to find the exact threshold, to a one-dimensional problem of updating the means of the Gaussian densities. This simplification not only allows us to calculate the threshold quickly and to understand the behavior of the decoder better, but also makes it easier to design good irregular LDPC codes for AWGN channels. For various regular LDPC codes we have examined, thresholds can be estimated within 0.1 dB of the exact value. For rates between 0.5 and 0.9, codes designed using the Gaussian approximation perform within 0.02 dB of the best performing codes found so far by using density evolution when the maximum variable degree is 10. We show that by using the Gaussian approximation, we can visualize the sum-product decoding algorithm. We also show that the optimization of degree distributions can be understood and done graphically using the visualization."

C), which are shown to be derived as special cases of the method with suitable choices of variables. In Sec. D, an improved treatment is explained for the three-dimensional simple cubic Ising lattice. This approximation is found to agree with the rigorous expansion of the partition function up to the fourth moment by Kirkwood's moment method, so far as the disordered state is concerned. In Sec. E the general formula for the entropy is given. In Sec. H an improved treatment of the face-centered lattice (Ising model) is given."

The backward-forward model is devoted to the simultaneous solution of a collection of interrelated sequential problems based on the independent computation of a cost-to-arrive function and a cost-to-go function. Several extremization and nonextremization problems illustrate the applicability of the proposed models."

Despite several theoretical advances in our understanding of loopy belief propagation, to our knowledge, the only problem that has been solved using loopy belief propagation is error-correcting decoding on Gaussian channels. We propose a new representation for the two-dimensional phase unwrapping problem, and we show that loopy belief propagation produces results that are superior to existing techniques. This is an important result, since many imaging techniques, including magnetic resonance imaging and interfer-ometric synthetic aperture radar, produce phase-wrapped images. Interestingly, the graph that we use has a very large number of very short cycles, supporting evidence that a large minimum cycle length is not needed for excellent results using belief propagation."

It is very similar to the fully factorized version of the Boyen-Koller (BK) algorithm, but instead of doing an exact update at every step followed by marginalisation (projection), it always works with factored distributions. Hence it can be applied to models for which the exact update step is intractable. We show that FF is equivalent to (one iteration of) loopy belief propagation (LBP) on the original DBN, and that BK is equivalent (to one iteration of) LBP on a DBN where we cluster some of the nodes. We then show empirically that by iterating more than once, LBP can improve on the accuracy of both FF and BK. We compare these algorithms on two real-world DBNs: the first is a model of a water treatment plant, and the second is a coupled HMM, used to model freeway traffic."

(1993) and an algorithm that has been well known in the artificial intelligence community for a decade, but which is relatively unknown to information theorists: Pearl's (1982) belief propagation algorithm. We see that if Pearl's algorithm is applied to the \"belief network\" of a parallel concatenation of two or more codes, the turbo decoding algorithm immediately results. Unfortunately, however, this belief diagram has loops, and Pearl only proved that his algorithm works when there are no loops, so an explanation of the experimental performance of turbo decoding is still lacking. However, we also show that Pearl's algorithm can be used to routinely derive previously known iterative, but suboptimal, decoding algorithms for a number of other error-control systems, including Gallager's (1962) low-density parity-check codes, serially concatenated codes, and product codes. Thus, belief propagation provides a very attractive general methodology for devising low-complexity iterative decoding algorithms for hybrid coded systems."

Transmitting at rates below this capacity, a randomly chosen element of the given ensemble will achieve an arbitrarily small target probability of error with a probability that approaches one exponentially fast in the length of the code. (By concatenating with an appropriate outer code one can achieve a probability of error that approaches zero exponentially fast in the length of the code with arbitrarily small loss in rate.) Conversely, transmitting at rates above this capacity the probability of error is bounded away from zero by a strictly positive constant which is independent of the length of the code and of the number of iterations performed. Our results are based on the observation that the concentration of the performance of the decoder around its average performance, as observed by Luby et al. in the case of a binary-symmetric channel and a binary message-passing algorithm, is a general phenomenon. For the particularly important case of belief-propagation decoders, we provide an effective algorithm to determine the corresponding capacity to any desired degree of accuracy. The ideas presented in this paper are broadly applicable and extensions of the general method to low-density parity-check codes over larger alphabets, turbo codes, and other concatenated coding schemes are outlined."

To improve the mean field approximation in such cases, we employ mixture models as posterior approximations, where each mixture component is a factorized distribution.

These networks consist of several users communicating to one another in the presence of arbitrary interference and noise. The presence of many senders necessitates a tradeoff in the achievable information transmission rates. The goal is the characterization of the capacity region consisting of all achievable rates. The focus is on broadcast, multiple access, relay, and other channels for which the recent theory is relativdy well developed. A discussion of the Gaussian version of these channels demonstrates the concreteness of the encoding and decoding necessary to achieve optimal information flow. We also offer speculations about the form of a general theory of information flow in networks."

This paper presents a methodology for analytic computation of sensitivity values in Bayesian network models. Sensitivity values are partial derivatives of output probabilities with respect to parameters being varied in the sensitivity analysis. They measure the impact of small changes in a network parameter on a target probability value or distribution. Sensitivity values can be used to focus knowledge elicitation effort on those parameters having the most impact on outputs of concern. Analytic sensitivity values are computed for an example and compared to sensitivity analysis by direct variation of parameters. >"

The typical minimum distance of these codes increases linearly with block length for a fixed rate and fixed j . When used with maximum likelihood decoding on a sufficiently quiet binary-input symmetric channel, the typical probability of decoding error decreases exponentially with block length for a fixed rate and fixed j . A simple but nonoptimum decoding scheme operating directly from the channel a posteriori probabilities is described. Both the equipment complexity and the data-handling capacity in bits per second of this decoder increase approximately linearly with block length. For j > 3 and a sufficiently low rate, the probability of error using this decoder on a binary symmetric channel is shown to decrease at least exponentially with a root of the block length. Some experimental results show that the actual probability of decoding error is much smaller than this theoretical bound."

What began more than sixty years ago as a modest proposal that a mathematician and an economist write a short paper together blossomed, in 1944, when Princeton University Press published \"Theory of Games and Economic Behavior.\" In it, John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern conceived a groundbreaking mathematical theory of economic and social organization, based on a theory of games of strategy. Not only would this revolutionize economics, but the entirely new field of scientific inquiry it yielded--game theory--has since been widely used to analyze a host of real-world phenomena from arms races to optimal policy choices of presidential candidates, from vaccination policy to major league baseball salary negotiations. And it is today established throughout both the social sciences and a wide range of other sciences."

                "text": "Dear Sir, We have read with interest the case report entitled 'Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma presenting as an isolated temporal soft tissue swelling' by Benson-Mitchell et al. (1996), but feel their report needs comment. The diagnosis of primary lymphoma in this case is very controversial, partially because its existence as a pathological entity can be questioned. The major controversy regarding this case lies in the difficulty of knowing whether it is a primary lesion, or an occult lymphoma with an initial manifestation in the soft tissue of temporal region, or a secondary from a lymphoma elsewhere. It is very likely to be the latter based on the nature of this disease. Furthermore, the case was insufficiently investigated, and not followed up long enough to substantiate the diagnosis. In the last few years, there have been detailed studies of the natural history and treatment of localized Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of unfavourable histology (as this case). As a result, the role of surgery in the management of these cases has been sharply modified. Since malignant lymphoma is by nature a systemic disease, metastasizes haemotogenously, and chemoand radio-sensitive, surgery appears to be contra-indicated and should be used only after failure of chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy. This combined approach has been shown to be effective in localized aggressive lymphomas in improving disease free survival and overall survival (Miller and Jones, 1983; Connors et al., 1987)."
