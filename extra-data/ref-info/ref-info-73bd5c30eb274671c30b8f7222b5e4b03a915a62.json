The introduction of an energy to minimize leads to a drastic reduction of these parameters. The authors prove that the most simple segmentation tool, the \u201cregion merging\u201d algorithm, made according to the simplest energy, is enough to compute a local energy minimum belonging to a compact class and to achieve the job of most of the tools mentioned above. The authors explain why \u201cmerging\u201d in a variational framework leads to a fast multiscale, multichannel algorithm, with a pyramidal structure. The obtained algorithm is $O(n\\ln n)$, where n is the number of pixels of the picture. This fast algorithm is applied to make grey level and texture segmentation and experimental results are shown."

We construct an objective function that, when minimized, yields a partitioning of the image into regions where the pixel values in each band of each region are described by a polynomial surface plus noise. The polynomial orders and their coefficients are determined by the algorithm. The minimization is difficult because (1) it involves a search over a very large space and (2) there is extensive computation required at each stage of the search. To address the first of these problems we use a region-merging minimization algorithm. To address the second we use an incremental polynomial regression that uses computations from the previous stage to compute results in the current stage, resulting in a significant speed up over the non-incremental technique. The segmentation result obtained is suboptimal in general but of high quality. Results on real images are shown.<<ETX>>"

The two conventional methods of image segmentation, region-based segmentation and boundary finding, often suffer from a variety of limitations. We propose a method which endeavors to integrate the two approaches in an effort to form a unified approach that is robust to noise and poor initialization. Our approach uses Green's theorem to derive the boundary of a homogeneous region-classified area in the image and integrates this with a grey-level-gradient-based boundary finder. This combines the perceptual notions of edge/shape information with gray level homogeneity.<<ETX>>"

From an input color image, the algorithm determines the number of materials in the scene and labels each pixel according to the corresponding material. This segmentation is useful for many visual tasks including 3-D inspection and 3-D object recognition. The segmentation algorithm is based on a detailed analysis of the physics underlying color image formation and may be applied to images of a wide range of materials and surface textures. An initial edge detection on the intensity image is used to guide the segmentation process and to ensure accurate localization of region boundaries. The algorithm is based on the computation of local image features and can be mapped effectively onto high-performance parallel hardware. Issues related to illumination and sensors are addressed. Experimental results obtained for several images are presented. >"

The model is a joint probability distribution for the array of pixel gray levels and an array of labels. In boundary finding, the labels are binary, zero, or one, representing the absence or presence of boundary elements. In partitioning, the label values are generic: two labels are the same when the corresponding scene locations are considered to belong to the same region. The distribution incorporates a measure of disparity between certain spatial features of block pairs of pixel gray levels, using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov nonparametric measures of difference between the distributions of these features. The number of model parameters is minimized by forbidding label configurations, which are assigned probability zero. The maximum a posteriori estimator of boundary placements and partitionings is examined. The forbidden states introduce constraints into the calculation of these configurations. Stochastic relaxation methods are extended to accommodate constrained optimization. >"

Data aggregation is performed via model recovery in terms of variable-order bivariate polynomials using iterative regression. All the recovered models are candidates for the final description of the data. Selection of the models is achieved through a maximization of the quadratic Boolean problem. The procedure can be adapted to prefer certain kinds of descriptions (one which describes more data points, or has smaller error, or has a lower order model). A fast optimization procedure for model selection is discussed. The approach combines model extraction and model selection in a dynamic way. Partial recovery of the models is followed by the optimization (selection) procedure where only the best models are allowed to develop further. The results are comparable with the results obtained when using the selection module only after all the models are fully recovered, while the computational complexity is significantly reduced.

FRAME combines attractive aspects of two important themes in texture modeling: multi-channel filtering and Markov random field (MRF) modeling. It incorporates the responses of a set of well selected filters into the distribution over a random field and hence has a much stronger descriptive ability than the traditional MRF models. Furthermore, it interprets and clarifies many previous concepts and methods for texture analysis and synthesis from a unified point of view. Algorithms are proposed for probability inference, stochastic simulation and filter selection. Experiments on a variety of textures are described to illustrate our theory and to show the performance of our algorithms. These experiments demonstrate that many textures previously considered as different categories can be modeled and synthesized in a common framework."

The success of the approach depends on the definition of a comprehensive set of goals for the computation of edge points. These goals must be precise enough to delimit the desired behavior of the detector while making minimal assumptions about the form of the solution. We define detection and localization criteria for a class of edges, and present mathematical forms for these criteria as functionals on the operator impulse response. A third criterion is then added to ensure that the detector has only one response to a single edge. We use the criteria in numerical optimization to derive detectors for several common image features, including step edges. On specializing the analysis to step edges, we find that there is a natural uncertainty principle between detection and localization performance, which are the two main goals. With this principle we derive a single operator shape which is optimal at any scale. The optimal detector has a simple approximate implementation in which edges are marked at maxima in gradient magnitude of a Gaussian-smoothed image. We extend this simple detector using operators of several widths to cope with different signal-to-noise ratios in the image. We present a general method, called feature synthesis, for the fine-to-coarse integration of information from operators at different scales. Finally we show that step edge detector performance improves considerably as the operator point spread function is extended along the edge."

In computer vision, a fundamental problem is to appropriately decompose the domain R of a function g (x,y) of two variables. This problem starts by describing the physical situation which produces images: assume that a three-dimensional world is observed by an eye or camera from some point P and that g1(rho) represents the intensity of the light in this world approaching the point sub 1 from a direction rho. If one has a lens at P focusing this light on a retina or a film-in both cases a plane domain R in which we may introduce coordinates x, y then let g(x,y) be the strength of the light signal striking R at a point with coordinates (x,y); g(x,y) is essentially the same as sub 1 (rho) -possibly after a simple transformation given by the geometry of the imaging syste. The function g(x,y) defined on the plane domain R will be called an image. What sort of function is g? The light reflected off the surfaces Si of various solid objects O sub i visible from P will strike the domain R in various open subsets R sub i. When one object O1 is partially in front of another object O2 as seen from P, but some of object O2 appears as the background to the sides of O1, then the open sets R1 and R2 will have a common boundary (the 'edge' of object O1 in the image defined on R) and one usually expects the image g(x,y) to be discontinuous along this boundary.

This consists of a model for generating the shapes of animate objects which gives a formalism for solving the inverse problem of object recognition. We model all objects at three levels of complexity: (i) the primitives, (ii) the mid-grained shapes, which are deformations of the primitives, and (iii) objects constructed by using a grammar to join mid-grained shapes together. The deformations of the primitives can be characterized by principal component analysis or modal analysis. When doing recognition the representations of these objects are obtained in a bottom-up manner from their silhouettes by a novel method for skeleton extraction and part segmentation based on deformable circles. These representations are then matched to a database of prototypical objects to obtain a set of candidate interpretations. These interpretations are verified in a top-down process. The system is demonstrated to be stable in the presence of noise, the absence of parts, the presence of additional parts, and considerable variations in articulation and viewpoint. Finally, we describe how such a representation scheme can be automatically learnt from examples."

It represents color images as fields of 3D vectors, from which we extract region and boundary information. The first problem we face is one of secondary imaging effects that makes image color different from surface color. We demonstrate a simple but effective polarization based technique that corrects for these effects. We then propose a systematic approach of scalarizing color, that allows us to augment classical image processing tools and concepts for multi-dimensional color signals."

Pixel gray levels and the presence and orientation of edges are viewed as states of atoms or molecules in a lattice-like physical system. The assignment of an energy function in the physical system determines its Gibbs distribution. Because of the Gibbs distribution, Markov random field (MRF) equivalence, this assignment also determines an MRF image model. The energy function is a more convenient and natural mechanism for embodying picture attributes than are the local characteristics of the MRF. For a range of degradation mechanisms, including blurring, nonlinear deformations, and multiplicative or additive noise, the posterior distribution is an MRF with a structure akin to the image model. By the analogy, the posterior distribution defines another (imaginary) physical system. Gradual temperature reduction in the physical system isolates low energy states (``annealing''), or what is the same thing, the most probable states under the Gibbs distribution. The analogous operation under the posterior distribution yields the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the image given the degraded observations. The result is a highly parallel ``relaxation'' algorithm for MAP estimation. We establish convergence properties of the algorithm and we experiment with some simple pictures, for which good restorations are obtained at low signal-to-noise ratios."

Its role in inference is, however, less well known outside of quantum mechanics. It is the aim of this paper to provide a unified approach to the problem of uncertainty in image processing. It is shown that uncertainty can be derived from the fundamental constraints on the process of vision-the requirements for class-defining operations which are both shift-invariant and insensitive to changes in illumination. It is thus shown that uncertainty plays a key role in the language of vision, since it affects the choice of both the alphabet, the elementary signals, and the syntax, the inferential structure, of vision. The report is concluded with a number of practical illustrations of these ideas, taken from such image processing tasks as enhancement, data compression, and segmentation."

To overcome the shortcoming of the most often used model and to extend the reflection model for computer color vision, an examination is made of the light reflection problem using the bidirectional spectral-reflectance distribution function (BSRDF) to specify both incident- and reflected-beam geometries. It is shown that the product form can still be retained for a polychromatic light source under two lighting conditions: the light source is collimated; or the spectral factor and the geometric factor can be separated for both the light source and the BSRDF of the surface. The reflection model is then applied to the formulation of a neutral-interface-reflection model, which is tested experimentally. The results show the adequacy of this type of model for surfaces of some material compositions, e.g. plastics, plant leaves, painted surfaces, orange peels, and some glossy cloth, but not for others, e.g. colored paper and some ceramics. >"
