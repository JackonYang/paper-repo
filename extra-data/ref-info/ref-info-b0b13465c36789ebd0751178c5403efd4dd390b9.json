                "text": "In the central nervous system the visual pathway from retina to striate cortex provides an opportunity to observe and compare single unit responses at several distinct levels. Patterns of light stimuli most effective in influencing units at one level may no longer be the most effective at the next. From differences in responses at successive stages in the pathway one may hope to gain some understanding of the part each stage plays in visual perception. By shining small spots of light on the light-adapted cat retina Kuffler (1953) showed that ganglion cells have concentric receptive fields, with an 'on' centre and an 'off ' periphery, or vice versa. The 'on' and 'off' areas within a receptive field were found to be mutually antagonistic, and a spot restricted to the centre of the field was more effective than one covering the whole receptive field (Barlow, FitzHugh & Kuffler, 1957). In the freely moving lightadapted cat it was found that the great majority of cortical cells studied gave little or no response to light stimuli covering most of the animal's visual field, whereas small spots shone in a restricted retinal region often evoked brisk responses (Hubel, 1959). A moving spot of light often produced stronger responses than a stationary one, and sometimes a moving spot gave more activation for one direction than for the opposite. The present investigation, made in acute preparations, includes a study of receptive fields of cells in the cat's striate cortex. Receptive fields of the cells considered in this paper were divided into separate excitatory and inhibitory ('on' and 'off') areas. In this respect they resembled retinal ganglion-cell receptive fields. However, the shape and arrangement of excitatory and inhibitory areas differed strikingly from the concentric pattern found in retinal ganglion cells. An attempt was made to correlate responses to moving stimuli"

                "text": "A cross-section of any vertebrate retina shows a complex pattern in which many types of cells are interconnected. The functions of very few of these cell types are known in any detail. The rods and cones almost certainly absorb the light quanta and are responsible for the initiation of the train of events which culminates in the nerve impulse patterns of the ganglion cells whose axons form the optic nerve. This pat tern of nerve impulses is modified by the intensity, shape, and duration of the illumination falling on the retina. In a few types of vertebrate eyes it is also certain that the color of the stimulating light must modify the response patterns of different ganglion cells in a differential fashion. This is a requirement in any system of color vision, and it is fairly certain from behavioral experiments that these animals are able to distinguish colors. Many species of fish apparently can be trained to recognize colors. For this reason the fish retina is an appropriate place to find out how color information is encoded for transmission along the optic nerve. The response patterns of single ganglion cells of the vertebrate retina have been the subject of extensive study since Hartline's successful isolation of the ganglion cells of the frog retina. These response patterns were classified by Hartl ine (1938) into \"on ,\" \"off,\" and \"on-off ' ' types according to the temporal relationship of the discharge to the illumination. These descriptive terms have been generally accepted by subsequent investigators and are in wide usage today. The response patterns of ganglion cells of a wide variety of other vertebrates have been examined by subsequent investigators. This work has indicated that the discharge patterns are basically similar. The \"on-off ' ' type is most frequently seen and is looked on as playing the dominant role in the functional organization.

Most units responded either feebly or not at all to stimulation of the retina with diffuse light, but gave brisk responses to stationary or moving restricted spots of light. Responses to moving spots often varied with the direction of movement. It was clear that such responses must be the result of complex integrative mechanisms. The present study was undertaken to find out whether similar responses occur in retinal ganglion cells or cells of the dorsal lateral geniculate body. Lateral geniculate units have not previously been studied with restricted light stimulation, and although the cat's retinal ganglion cell has been extensively investigated by Kuffler and his co-workers (Kuffler, 1953; iKuffler, FitzHugh & Barlow, 1957), responses to moving spots were not examined. Thus it has not been possible to say whether the complex activity of cortical units originates in the cortex itself, or at lower levels. Methods for stereotaxic depth recordings in the unanaesthetized unrestrained animal were developed in order to make cortical and depth studies under similar conditions. These techniques make it possible to record from single units from virtually any part of the brain of the freely moving animal."

                "text": "THE DISCHARGES carried in the optic nerve fibers contain all the information which the central nervous system receives from the retina. A correct interpretation of discharge patterns therefore constitutes an important step in the analysis of visual events. Further, investigations of nervous activity arising in the eye reveal many aspects of the functional organization of the neural elements within the retina itself. Following studies of discharges in the optic nerve of the eel\u2019s eye by Adrian and Matthews (2,3), Hartline and his colleagues described the discharge pattern in the eye of the Limulus in a series of important and lucid papers (for a summary see 20). In the Limulus the relationship between the stimulus to the primary receptor cell and the nerve discharges proved relatively simple, apparently because the connection between sense cell and nerve fiber was a direct one. Thus, when stimulation is confined to one receptor the discharge in a single Limulus nerve fiber will provide a good indication of excitatory events which take place as a result of photochemical processes. Discharges last for the duration of illumination and their frequency is a measure of stimulus strength. Lately, however, it was shown by Hartline et al. (22) that inhibitory interactions may be revealed when several receptors are excited. On the whole, the Limulus preparation shows many features which are similar to other simple sense organs, for instance, stretch receptors. In the latter, however, instead of photochemical events, stretch-deformation acts as the adequate stimulus on sensory terminals and is translated into a characteristic discharge pattern. The discharge from the cold-blooded vertebrate retina (mainly frogs) proved much more complex. Hartline found three main types when recording from single optic nerve fibers: (i) \u201con\u201d discharges, similar to those in the Limulus, firing for the duration of the light stimulus, (ii) \u201coff\u201d discharges appearing when a light stimulus was withdrawn, and (iii) \u2018con-off\u201d discharges, a combination of the former two, with activity confined mainly to onset and cessation of illumination. The mammalian discharge patterns were studied in a number of species by Granit and his co-workers in the course of their extensive work on the physiology of the visual system (summaries in 13, 15). On the whole, they did not observe any fundamental differences between frog and mammalian discharge types (see later)."

The drop in threshold was rather small compared to that found in human dark adaptation, and the final threshold reached was not nearly as low as one would expect in an eye adapted for nocturnal vision. Pirenne (1954) has emphasized that there is a big discrepancy (a factor of 103-106) between the lowest threshold obtained by electro-physiological methods and the much lower thresholds found by psychophysical methods in humans (Hecht, Shlaer & Pirenne, 1942). In addition, the existence of a random maintained discharge from retinal ganglion cells (Kuffler, FitzHugh & Barlow, 1957) raises some doubts about the relative parts played by the retina and the central nervous system in determining thresholds. We therefore set out to measure the absolute threshold of the large type of ganglion cell (Rushton, 1949) isolated by metallic micro-electrodes of the type used by Granit & Svaetichin (1939). The opportunity was taken of following threshold through the period of dark adaptation, and some observations of the Purkinje shift were made."

                "text": "Nervous activity has been recorded from the unopened eye of decerebrate cats. Recordings were made with metal electrodes or with small micropipettes from ganglion cells or nerve fibers. Continuous maintained discharges were seen in all ganglion cells during steady illumination of their receptive fields, as well as in complete darkness. Possible artefacts, such as electrode pressure, abnormal circulation, anesthetic, and several other factors have been excluded as the source of the maintained discharge. Visual stimuli are therefore transmitted by modulating the ever present background activity. Discharge frequencies were measured following changes of retinal illumination. No consistent patterns of frequency change were found. The maintained discharge frequency may be permanently increased or decreased, or may remain practically unchanged by altering the steady level of illumination. In addition, there were often transient frequency changes during the first 5 to 10 minutes after changing illumination, before a final steady rate was established. A statistical analysis of the impulse intervals of the maintained discharge showed: (a) the intervals were distributed according to the gamma distribution (Pearson's type III), (b) the first serial correlation coefficient of the intervals was between \u20130.10 and \u20130.24, with a mean value of \u20130.17, which is significantly different from zero, (c) the higher order serial correlation coefficients were not significantly different from zero. Thus the firing probability at any time depends on the times of occurrence of the two preceding impulses only, and in such a way as to indicate that each impulse is followed by a transient depression of excitability that outlasts the following impulse. The possible sites at which spontaneous or maintained activity may originate in the retina are discussed."

                "text": "The monkey, Macaca mulatta, was chosen as the experimental animal for the investigation of the physiological mechanisms of color vision for two reasons: there is excellent behavioral evidence that the rhesus monkey has color vision (this is not true for some of the animals which have been used in similar investigations); furthermore, its color vision system is undoubtedly very similar to, if not identical with, that of man. There is good evidence (Walls, 1942) that color vision systems have evolved several separate times, once in the insects, again in fish, reptiles, and birds, and still again within the primate order. If this is correct, it would be little more than a coincidence ff the way in which information about the wavelength of light is encoded in the visual system of monkey and man were the same as the manner in which it is accomplished in fish or birds. In any case, if one is interested in relating the ways in which various neural elements respond to different wavelengths of light under various conditions to the manner in which these lights are perceived, one cannot go wrong in studying an animal as similar as possible to man, for virtually all of the behavioral results from color discrimination have been obtained on the human observer. The macaque lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), from which most of the recordings have been obtained, consists of six layers of cells separated by fiber layers. These cells receive connections from the axons of the ganglion cells of the retina and are thus the fourth-order neurons in the visual pathway. Anatomical studies (Glees and Le Gros Clark, 1941) have given little evidence for interconnections at this level; the types of responses recorded here may well be essentially the same as one would obtain from ganglion cells in the retina. However, the highly laminated structure of the LGN, in which the optic projection from each eye splits three ways, presents the possibility of some clues being present as to the nature of the organization of the visual system in the differential responses of cells in the various laminae. For this, as well as for certain technical reasons, the L G N rather than the retina was chosen as the recording site."

During passage of the border of light and dark across the site of recording, no abrupt change occurred in the response amplitude.4. Illumination by monochromatic light whose wave-length was changing continuously through the visible spectrum produced various response curves from different regions of the same retina. The result appeared to confirm Svaetichin and Motokawa et al., but details could not be compared due to the difference in experimental conditions.5.
