Real-time high-level systems perform poorly in clutter and initialisation for most high-level systems is either performed manually or by a separate module. This paper presents a new technique to combine low- and high-level information in a consistent probabilistic framework, using the statistical technique of importance sampling combined with the Condensation algorithm. The general framework, which we term Icondensation, is described, and a hand tracker is demonstrated which combines colour blob-tracking with a contour model. The resulting tracker is robust to rapid motion, heavy clutter and hand-coloured distractors, and re-initialises automatically. The system runs comfortably in real time on an entry-level desktop workstation."

Shapes areapproximated by polygonswherethe number of sides is related to the physical features of a shape class ratherthan any particular shape. A method of \u2018seeding\u2019 the polygonal approxima-tionisgivenwhere\u2018seeds\u2019 areautomaticallyextracted fromasetofdata. Mul-tiple models are built using polygons with different numbers of sides to al-low for feature occlusion. Principal component analysis (PCA) is performedon vector representations of the sides of the polygons which are normalisedby the total perimeter. This removes the need for normalisation of scale andtranslationas required in thePointDistributionModel [16]. A \u2018\ufb01t score\u2019 met-ricisde\ufb01nedwhich givesan indicationof howwellagivenshape\ufb01tsamodel. 1 Introduction There has been much work carried out on the extraction and classi\ufb01cation of non-rigidshapes from image sequences. In this paper a new method of classifying images automat-ically from an image sequence is proposed. This method is applied in the monitoring ofcattle movement to identifya particularnon-rigidobject in a scene (a cow in ourexample)and gain knowledge about the way in which this object changes with time.Kass et al [11] use an active shape model (snake) in which an energy function is min-imisedtoextractanobjectfromascene. TerzopoulosandSzeliski[15]havemadesomere-\ufb01nementstothistechniquewiththeinclusionofKalman\ufb01ltertechniques(Kalmansnakes).Blake et al [3] have further re\ufb01ned the technique by adding \u2018templates\u2019to this process toincorporate a search for a speci\ufb01c shape. In recent years theadvantage of such model-based approaches has been shown where prior informationabout a class of shapes is usedin extraction and classi\ufb01cation. The point distributionmodel (PDM) described by Cooteset al [16] is a useful way of describing a class of non-rigid shapeswhere a shape class isdescribed by a \ufb01xed number of points. A model is built from a group of shapes \ufb01tted withthis\ufb01xed number of \u2018reference points\u2019 and principalcomponent analysis (PCA) is used toextract \u2018modesof variation\u2019fromthedataset. Members ofashapeclass aredescribed withreference to an eigenspace where the axes are the eigenvectors produced from the princi-pal componentanalysis. A \u2018valid\u2019shape isconstructedby takingan area inthiseigenspacecentred around the mean shape (origin) and bounded by maximum deviations along eachprincipalaxes whichare related totheeigenvaluesproduced by PCA and thusthevariancewithinthe data set. PDMs rely on accurate positioningof pointsand can only describe ac-curately shape classes which deform in a linear fashion which can result in invalid shapesbeing included in the model.There havebeen a numberof methodsproposedforpoint\ufb01ttingaroundapre-extractedcontour [1, 2] which involve \ufb01nding a number of reference points (points of high curva-ture,extreme pointsetc) and addingextrapointsspaced evenlyroundthecontoursuch thatthe contour may be approximated by a spline. Hill et al [8] have proposed a new schemewhereby a contour is approximated by an arbitrary number of straight lines as de\ufb01ned bythe critical point detection algorithm described by Zhu and Chirlian [19].

Probabilistic mechanisms are attractive because they handle fusion of information, especially temporal fusion, in a principled manner. Exemplars are selected representatives of raw training data, used here to represent probabilistic mixture distributions of object configurations. Their use avoids tedious hand-construction of object models and problems with changes of topology. Using exemplars in place of a parameterized model poses several challenges, addressed here with what we call the \"Metric Mixture\" (M/sup 2/) approach. The M/sup 2/ model has several valuable properties. Principally, it provides alternatives to standard learning algorithms by allowing the use of metrics that are not embedded in a vector space. Secondly, it uses a noise model that is learned from training data. Lastly, it eliminates any need for an assumption of probabilistic pixelwise independence. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the M/sup 2/ model in two domains tracking walking people using chamfer distances on binary edge images and tracking mouth movements by means of a shuffle distance."

This paper demonstrates how dynamic filtering can be used in combination with a modal-based flexible shape model to track an articulated non-rigid body in motion. The results show the method being used to track the silhouette of a walking pedestrian in real time. The active shape model used was generated automatically from real image data and incorporates variability in shape due to orientation as well as object flexibility. A Kalman filter is used to control spatial scale for feature search over successive frames. Iterative refinement allows accurate contour localisation where feasible. The shape model incorporates knowledge of the likely shape of the contour and speeds up tracking by reducing the number of system parameters. A further increase in speed is obtained by filtering the shape parameters independently.<<ETX>>"

In fact this technique can reduce the curse of dimensionality in other situations too. This paper describes how to use partitioned sampling on articulated objects, obtaining results that would be impossible with standard sampling methods. Because partitioned sampling is the statistical analogue of a hierarchical search, it makes sense to use it on articulated objects, since links at the base of the object can be localised before moving on to search for subsequent links."

Kalman filtering is inadequate because it is based on Gaussian densities which, being unimo dal, cannot represent simultaneous alternative hypotheses. The Condensation algorithm uses \u201cfactored sampling\u201d, previously applied to the interpretation of static images, in which the probability distribution of possible interpretations is represented by a randomly generated set. Condensation uses learned dynamical models, together with visual observations, to propagate the random set over time. The result is highly robust tracking of agile motion.

This model is based on the finite element method, but decouples the degrees of freedom by breaking down object motion into rigid and nonrigid vibration or deformation modes. The result is an accurate representation for both rigid and nonrigid motion that has greatly reduced dimensionality, capturing the intuition that nonrigid motion is normally coherent and not chaotic. Because of the small number of parameters involved, this representation is used to obtain accurate overstrained estimates of both rigid and nonrigid global motion. It is also shown that these estimates can be integrated over time by use of an extended Kalman filter, resulting in stable and accurate estimates of both three-dimensional shape and three-dimensional velocity. The formulation is then extended to include constrained nonrigid motion. Examples of tracking single nonrigid objects and multiple constrained objects are presented. >"

Next is the notion that humans exist in a physical universe, as a consequence of this, a large part of human motion can be modeled and predicted with the laws of physics. Finally there is the notion that humans utilize muscles to actively shape purposeful motion. We employ a recursive framework for real-time, 3D tracking of human motion that enables pixel-level, probabilistic processes to take advantage of the contextual knowledge encoded in the higher-level models, including models of dynamic constraints on human motion. We show that models of purposeful action arise naturally from this framework, and further, that those models can be used to improve the perception of human motion. Results are shown that demonstrate automatic discovery of features in this new feature space."

Statistically based interaction behaviour models are acquired automatically from the observation of interacting humans. Interaction with a virtual human is achieved using the model together with a stochastic tracking algorithm.

As a function of constraint length the performance of optimal convolutional codes is shown to be superior to that of block codes of the same length, the relative improvement increasing with rate.
