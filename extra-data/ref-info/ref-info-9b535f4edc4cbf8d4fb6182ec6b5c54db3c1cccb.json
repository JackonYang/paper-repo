We divide detection into visual selection and final classification, concentrating on the former: drastically reducing the number of candidate regions that require further, usually more intensive, processing, but with a minimum of computation and missed detections. Bottom-up processing is based on local groupings of edge fragments constrained by loose geometrical relationships. They have no a priori semantic or geometric interpretation. The role of training is to select special groupings that are moderately likely at certain places on the object but rare in the background. We show that the statistics in both populations are stable. The candidate regions are those that contain global arrangements of several local groupings. Whereas our model was not conceived to explain brain functions, it does cohere with evidence about the functions of neurons in V1 and V2, such as responses to coarse or incomplete patterns (e.g., illusory contours) and to scale and translation invariance in IT. Finally, the algorithm is applied to face and symbol detection."

                "text": "We explore a new approach to shape recognition based on a virtually infinite family of binary features (queries) of the image data, designed to accommodate prior information about shape invariance and regularity. Each query corresponds to a spatial arrangement of several local topographic codes (or tags), which are in themselves too primitive and common to be informative about shape. All the discriminating power derives from relative angles and distances among the tags. The important attributes of the queries are a natural partial ordering corresponding to increasing structure and complexity; semi-invariance, meaning that most shapes of a given class will answer the same way to two queries that are successive in the ordering; and stability, since the queries are not based on distinguished points and substructures. No classifier based on the full feature set can be evaluated, and it is impossible to determine a priori which arrangements are informative. Our approach is to select informative features and build tree classifiers at the same time by inductive learning. In effect, each tree provides an approximation to the full posterior where the features chosen depend on the branch that is traversed. Due to the number and nature of the queries, standard decision tree construction based on a fixed-length feature vector is not feasible. Instead we entertain only a small random sample of queries at each node, constrain their complexity to increase with tree depth, and grow multiple trees. The terminal nodes are labeled by estimates of the corresponding posterior distribution over shape classes. An image is classified by sending it down every tree and aggregating the resulting distributions. The method is applied to classifying handwritten digits and synthetic linear and nonlinear deformations of three hundred symbols. State-of-the-art error rates are achieved on the National Institute of Standards and Technology database of digits. The principal goal of the experiments on symbols is to analyze invariance, generalization error and related issues, and a comparison with artificial neural networks methods is presented in this context.

Briefly, the filter is applied at each location in G, and has an direction (horizontal, vertical, and two diagonals) and a contrast (positive or negative), yielding eight \u201ctypes\u201d denoted by \u03be = 1, . . . , 8. For example, in the case of a horizontal edge \u201cat\u201d (u, v), the absolute difference |I (u, v) \u2212 I (u, v + 1)| is compared with a threshold, with the differences |I (u, v)\u2212 I (u\u2032, v\u2032)| for the nearest neighbors (u\u2032, v\u2032) of (u, v) and with the differences |I (u, v+1)\u2212 I (u\u2032, v\u2032)| for the nearest neighbors (u\u2032, v\u2032) of (u, v + 1); it has positive contrast if I (u, v)> I (u, v + 1). The definitions of the other filters are analogous. The principal motivation for using comparisons of intensity differences is to gain a measure of photometric invariance. One major difficulty in detecting faces is the variation in the appearance of faces due to the vagaries of lighting; see for example the discussion in Ullman (1996). In order to diminish the variation, methods such as those based on neural networks usually require preprocessing (Rowley, 1999), for instance subtracting a linear component from the grey level map followed by histogram equalization (Sung and Poggio, 1998), which can be costly. Instead, the information we extract from the greylevels are comparisons of intensity differences, which are invariant to linear transformations of the greyscale. In Fig. 7 we show three versions of a training face together with the detected edges. There is an one elementary test X = X (I ) for each location (u, v), each filter type \u03be and each \u201ctolerance\u201d \u03b7 = 1, 2, . . . , 10. Then X = 1 if there is an edge of type \u03be at any location along a line of length \u03b7 centered at (u, v) and orthogonal to the filter direction; otherwise X = 0. Thus, for example, in the case of a positive, horizontal type at location (u, v) and tolerance \u03b7= 3, the test X = 1 if there is an horizontal edge with positive contrast at at least one of the locations {(u, v \u2212 1), (u, v), (u, v + 1)}; see Fleuret (2000) for more details."

Objects are represented through flexible star-type planar arrangements of binary local features which are in turn star-type planar arrangements of oriented edges. Candidate locations are detected over a range of scales and other deformations, using a generalized Hough transform. The flexibility of the arrangements provides the required invariance. Training involves selecting a small number of stable local features from a predefined pool, which are well localized on registered examples of the object. Training therefore requires only small data sets. The parallel architecture is constructed so that the Hough transform associated with any object can be implemented without creating or modifying any connections. The different object representations are learned and stored in a central module. When one of these representations is evoked, it primes the appropriate layers in the network so that the corresponding Hough transform is computed. Analogies between the different layers in the network and those in the visual system are discussed. Furthermore, the model can be used to explain certain experiments on visual selection reported in the literature."

In the standard version, knowledge previously collected about faces is used for finding the landmarks in the first frame. In a second version, the system is able to track the face without any prior knowledge about faces and is thus applicable to other object classes. By using Gabor filters as visual features, and by both avoiding limiting assumptions and many parameters our tracking tool is simple and easy to use. As a first application the tracking results are used to estimate the pose of a face."

The technique models the distribution of human face patterns by means of a few view-based \"face\" and \"nonface\" model clusters. At each image location, a difference feature vector is computed between the local image pattern and the distribution-based model. A trained classifier determines, based on the difference feature vector measurements, whether or not a human face exists at the current image location. We show empirically that the distance metric we adopt for computing difference feature vectors, and the \"nonface\" clusters we include in our distribution-based model, are both critical for the success of our system."

Examples of this ubiquitous problem in computer vision arise in tasks involving hand-eye coordination (such as assembling or sorting), inspection tasks, gauging operations, and in navigation and localization of mobile robots. This book describes an extended series of experiments into the role of geometry in the critical area of object recognition. It provides precise definitions of the recognition and localization problems, describes the methods used to address them, analyzes the solutions to these problems, and addresses the implications of this analysis.The solution to problems of object recognition are of fundamental importance in many real applications and versions of the techniques described here are already being used in industrial settings. Although a number of questions remain to be solved, the authors provide a valuable framework for understanding both the strengths and limitations of using object shape to guide recognition.W. Eric L.

A retinally connected neural network examines small windows of an image and decides whether each window contains a face. The system arbitrates between multiple networks to improve performance over a single network. We use a bootstrap algorithm for training the networks, which adds false detections into the training set as training progresses. This eliminates the difficult task of manually selecting non-face training examples, which must be chosen to span the entire space of non-face images. Comparisons with other state-of-the-art face detection systems are presented; our system has better performance in terms of detection and false-positive rates."

Each module utilizes one of the cues of human face, such as color, geometric property, motion, depth and etc.. Facial region is obtained by fusion of detected parameters result from each module, and the result is surely robust than that of using any single module. As an actual preliminary implementation, we constructed a face detection system using color module and geometric module. Although only two modules are realized in our system, the conceptual structure of the proposed multi-module method is through to be an efficient solution to the problem of face detection. Multi-module method can not only improve the robustness of detection, but also make the development of new applications, especially face detection systems an easy task, which only need to combine the extra modules with other pre-existing modules. Experimental results show that faces in complex background can be extracted efficiently with multi-module method."

Vapnik and his team (AT&T Bell Labs., 1985) that can be seen as a new method for training polynomial, neural network, or Radial Basis Functions classifiers. The decision surfaces are found by solving a linearly constrained quadratic programming problem. This optimization problem is challenging because the quadratic form is completely dense and the memory requirements grow with the square of the number of data points. We present a decomposition algorithm that guarantees global optimality, and can be used to train SVM's over very large data sets. The main idea behind the decomposition is the iterative solution of sub-problems and the evaluation of optimality conditions which are used both to generate improved iterative values, and also establish the stopping criteria for the algorithm. We present experimental results of our implementation of SVM, and demonstrate the feasibility of our approach on a face detection problem that involves a data set of 50,000 data points."

Our approach is related to recent work in active vision on \"where to look next\" and motivated by the \"divide-and-conquer\" strategy of parlour games. We choose \"tests\" (matched filters for short road segments) one at a time in order to remove as much uncertainty as possible about the \"true hypothesis\" (road position) given the results of the previous tests. The tests are chosen online based on a statistical model for the joint distribution of tests and hypotheses. The problem of minimizing uncertainty (measured by entropy) is formulated in simple and explicit analytical terms. At each iteration new image data are examined and a new entropy minimization problem is solved (exactly), resulting in a new image location to inspect, and so forth. We report experiments using panchromatic SPOT satellite imagery with a ground resolution of ten meters."

The feature of interest, an eye for example, is described by a parameterized template. An energy function is defined which links edges, peaks, and valleys in the image intensity to corresponding properties of the template. The template then interacts dynamically with the image by altering its parameter values to minimize the energy function, thereby deforming itself to find the best fit. The final parametr values can be used as descriptors for the feature. We illustrate this method by showing deformable templates detecting eyes and mouths in real images. We demonstrate their ability for tracking features."

This principle consists of two parts. The first is the maximum entropy principle for feature binding (or fusion): for a given set of observed feature statistics, a distribution can be built to bind these feature statistics together by maximizing the entropy over all distributions that reproduce them. The second part is the minimum entropy principle for feature selection: among all plausible sets of feature statistics, we choose the set whose maximum entropy distribution has the minimum entropy. Computational and inferential issues in both parts are addressed; in particular, a feature pursuit procedure is proposed for approximately selecting the optimal set of features. The minimax entropy principle is then corrected by considering the sample variation in the observed feature statistics, and an information criterion for feature pursuit is derived. The minimax entropy principle is applied to texture modeling, where a novel Markov random field (MRF) model, called FRAME (filter, random field, and minimax entropy), is derived, and encouraging results are obtained in experiments on a variety of texture images. The relationship between our theory and the mechanisms of neural computation is also discussed."

We show that if m O(W/\u220a log N/\u220a) random examples can be loaded on a feedforward network of linear threshold functions with N nodes and W weights, so that at least a fraction 1 \u220a/2 of the examples are correctly classified, then one has confidence approaching certainty that the network will correctly classify a fraction 1 \u220a of future test examples drawn from the same distribution. Conversely, for fully-connected feedforward nets with one hidden layer, any learning algorithm using fewer than (W/\u220a) random training examples will, for some distributions of examples consistent with an appropriate weight choice, fail at least some fixed fraction of the time to find a weight choice that will correctly classify more than a 1 \u220a fraction of the future test examples."
