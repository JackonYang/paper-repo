Measures of match which are suitable for this purpose are discussed, as are methods for pruning the search for a match. The mathematics necessary to convert a set of matchings into a workable camera model are given, along with calculations which use this model and a pair of image points to locate the corresponding scene point. Methods are included to detect some types of unmatchable target areas in the original data and for detecting when a supposed match is invalid. Region growing techniques are di9 for extend matching areas into regions of constant parallax and for delimiting uniform regions in an image. Also, two algorithms are presented to show some of the ways in which these techniques can be combined to perform useful tasks in the processing of stereo images."

An analytic camera model is used to predict the location and appearance of landmarks in the image, generating a projection for an assumed viewpoint. Correspondence is achieved by adjusting the parameters of the camera model until the appearances of the landmarks optimally match a symbolic description extracted from the image. \n \nThe matching of image and map features is performed rapidly by a new technique, called \"chamfer matching\", that compares the shapes of two collections of shape fragments, at a cost proportional to linear dimension, rather than area. These two techniques permit the matching of spatially extensive features on the basis of shape, which reduces the risk of ambiguous matches and the dependence on viewing conditions inherent in conventional image based correlation matching."

Two techniques are presented for scene reconstruction. The first, or multiple view method, utilizes the combined information from bulk correlation and three or more stereo images to construct three-dimensional edge features or structures. The structure is obtained by projecting into space a piecewise-linear representation of intensity edges obtained from one of the images. The second technique utilizes a narrow angle pair (2-3 degrees) of images and symbolic correlation to ensure matching reliability and efficiency in the construction of edge depth maps of scenes. A new technique of dynamic smoothing of edge contours is presented which permits accurate triangulation at narrow viewing angles, while preserving the integrity of sharp corners. Also, two new techniques are presented for piecewise approximation of 3-D and 2-D digital contours with circular arcs."

The matching is a specification of the geometrical disparity between the images and may be used to partially reconstruct the three-dimensional structure of the scene. Sets of candidate matching points are selected independently in each image. These points are the locations of small, distinct features which are likely to be detectable in both images. An initial network of possible matches between the two sets of candidates is constructed. Each possible match specifies a possible disparity of a candidate point in a selected reference image. An initial estimate of the probability of each possible disparity is made, based on the similarity of subimages surrounding the points. These estimates are iteratively improved by a relaxation labeling technique making use of the local continuity property of disparity that is a consequence of the continuity of real world surfaces. The algorithm is effective for binocular parallax, motion parallax, and object motion. It quickly converges to good estimates of disparity, which reflect the spatial organization of the scene."

Automatic navigation using visible light or radar images requires exact alignment of such images with digital terrain models. In addition, automatic classification of terrain, using satellite imagery, requires such alignment to deal correctly with the effects of varying sun angle and surface slope. Even inspection techniques for certain industrial parts may be improved by this means.\nWe achieve the required alignment by matching the real image with a synthetic image obtained from a surface model and known positions of the light sources. The synthetic image intensity is calculated using the reflectance map, a convenient way of describing surface reflection as a function of surface gradient. We illustrate the technique using LANDSAT images and digital terrain models."

Current research programs based on the processing of side-looking radar imagery show that spatial alignment of the various parts of the image must be highly accurate if noise in the difference picture is to be reduced to acceptably low levels. Typically, the spatial alignment accuracy must be better than one-fourth of the diameter of the smallest resolvable feature in the imagery, and this often requires several hundred degrees of freedom in the performance of the map warp for images that are of the order of 107picture cells (pixels) in size. Gray scale rectification of conjugate sampling points is less difficult, requiring typically only 10 to 20 percent as many degrees of freedom. Point by point adjustment for differences in mean transparency and contrast is employed. Recently developed equipment provides a continuous pipeline processing capability. With this equipment, each picture element of the second image is transformed with four degrees of freedom (two spatial and two gray scale). The digital correlator is capable of processing 4\u00d7105six-bit picture elements per second when used in conjunction with a CDC 1700 computer."

It builds a three-dimensional model of the task domain and uses hypothesized two-dimensional views of the model to label images. It currently achieves less than 20% error by area when labeling real-world (city of Pittsburgh) photographs with a knowledge base of over fifty objects. In addition, the system can determine the angle of view around the city with approximately 40 degrees of error. The labeling technique used by ARGOS is called Locus search. Locus is a non-backtracking graph search technique in which a beam of near-miss alternatives around the best path are extended in parallel through the graph. After the graph has been searched in breadth-first order, the beam of possibilities is examined in reverse order to extract a near-optimal path. This path defines a labeling of the image and is only sub-optimal because of the pruning heuristics used in the beam creation. This thesis formulates image understanding as a problem of search; shows how Locus search can be used to label images; describes the many sources of knowledge used in the interpretation; shows how knowledge represented as a network can be used to constrain the search; explores extensions to the use of knowledge; and presents the experimental results of ARGOS. Its main contributions are the demonstration that Locus search can be used for image understanding and the exploration of issues involved in this use."

It would appear at this time that we are still, to a large extent, using statistical methods developed prior to the advent of the digital computer and that these are now just transposed bodily onto a digital computer to perform the calculations. In this paper we attempt to demonstrate that there exists a class of techniques more suitably oriented toward the capabilities of the digital computer than are conventional analytic statistical techniques. We maintain that these techniques are capable of considering details in social sciences data, that is, relating the individuals described in the data."
