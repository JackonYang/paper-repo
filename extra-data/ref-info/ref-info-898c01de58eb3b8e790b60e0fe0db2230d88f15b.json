From this point of view, this form of learning is closely related to classical approximation techniques, such as generalized splines and regularization theory. A theory is reported that shows the equivalence between regularization and a class of three-layer networks called regularization networks or hyper basis functions. These networks are not only equivalent to generalized splines but are also closely related to the classical radial basis functions used for interpolation tasks and to several pattern recognition and neural network algorithms. They also have an interesting interpretation in terms of prototypes that are synthesized and optimally combined during the learning stage."

The strong theoretical foundation of regularization networks provides us with a better understanding of why they work and how to best choose a specific network and parameters for a given problem. Classical regularization theory can be extended in order to improve the quality of learning performed by Hyper Basis Functions. For example the centers of the basis functions and the norm weights can be optimized. Many Radial Basis Functions often used for function interpolation are provably Hyper Basis Functions. 1."

Learning as approximation and learning as hypersurface reconstruction are discussed. Two extensions of the regularization approach are presented, along with the approach's corrections to splines, regularization, Bayes formulation, and clustering. The theory of regularization networks is generalized to a formulation that includes task-dependent clustering and dimensionality reduction. Applications of regularization networks are discussed. >"

We consider training such networks in a completely supervised manner, but abandon this approach in favor of a more computationally efficient hybrid learning method which combines self-organized and supervised learning. Our networks learn faster than backpropagation for two reasons: the local representations ensure that only a few units respond to any given input, thus reducing computational overhead, and the hybrid learning rules are linear rather than nonlinear, thus leading to faster convergence. Unlike many existing methods for data analysis, our network architecture and learning rules are truly adaptive and are thus appropriate for real-time use."

As a result of the weight adjustments, internal \u2018hidden\u2019 units which are not part of the input or output come to represent important features of the task domain, and the regularities in the task are captured by the interactions of these units.

In particular, we show that arbitrary decision regions can be arbitrarily well approximated by continuous feedforward neural networks with only a single internal, hidden layer and any continuous sigmoidal nonlinearity.

Instead of calculating a weighted sum this unit calculates a weighted product, where each input is raised to a power determined by a variable weight. Such a unit can learn an arbitrary polynomial term, which would then feed into higher level standard summing units. We show how learning operates with product units, provide examples to show their efficiency for various types of problems, and argue that they naturally extend the family of theoretical feedforward net structures. There is a plausible neurobiological interpretation for one interesting configuration of product and summing units."

Inspired by Albus's CMAC model, the algorithms learn orders of magnitude more rapidly than typical implementations of back propagation, while often achieving comparable qualities of generalization. Furthermore, unlike most traditional function approximation methods, the algorithms are well suited for use in real time adaptive signal processing. Unlike simpler adaptive systems, such as linear predictive coding, the adaptive linear combiner, and the Kalman filter, the new algorithms are capable of efficiently capturing the structure of complicated non-linear systems. As an illustration, the algorithm is applied to the prediction of a chaotic timeseries."

Suppose that some data source provides samples consisting of n-dimensional feature-vectors, but that this data all happens to lie on an m-dimensional surface embedded in the n-dimensional feature space. Then occurrences of data can be more concisely described by specifying an m-dimensional location of the embedded surface than by reciting all n components of the feature vector. The recording of data in such a way is known as dimensionality-reduction. A method is presented for performing dimensionality-reduction in a wide class of situations for which an assumption of linearity need not be made about the underlying constraint surface. The method takes advantage of self-organizing properties of connectionist networks of simple computing elements. The authors present a scheme for representing the values of continuous (scalar) variables in subsets of units. >"

                "text": "The backpropagation learning algorithm for neural networks is developed into a formalism for nonlinear signal processing. We illustrate the method by selecting two common topics in signal processing, prediction and system modelling, and show that nonlinear applications can be handled extremely well by using neural networks. The formalism is a natural, nonlinear extension of the linear Least Mean Squares algorithm commonly used in adaptive signal processing. Simulations are presented that document the additional performance achieved by using nonlinear neural networks. First, we demonstrate that the formalism may be used to predict points in a highly chaotic time series with orders of magnitude increase in accuracy over conventional methods including the Linear Predictive Method and the Gabor-Volterra-Weiner Polynomial Method. Deterministic chaos is thought to be involved in many physical situations including the onset of turbulence in fluids, chemical reactions and plasma physics. Secondly, we demonstrate the use of the formalism in nonlinear system modelling by providing a graphic example in which it is clear that the neural network has accurately modelled the nonlinear transfer function. It is interesting to note that the formalism provides explicit, analytic, global, approximations to the nonlinear maps underlying the various time series. Furthermore, the neural net more\u00a0\u00bb seems to be extremely parsimonious in its requirements for data points from the time series. We show that the neural net is able to perform well because it globally approximates the relevant maps by performing a kind of generalized mode decomposition of the maps. 24 refs., 13 figs. \u00ab\u00a0less"

First, there is the problem of variable illumination, which can be addressed by working with relatively stable features such as intensity edges rather than the raw intensity images1,2. Second, there is the problem of the initially unknown pose of the object relative to the viewer. In one approach to this problem, a hypothesis is first made about the viewpoint, then the appearance of a model object from such a viewpoint is computed and compared with the actual image3\u20137. Such recognition schemes generally employ 3-D models of objects, but the automatic learning of 3-D models is itself a difficult problem8,9. To address this problem in computational vision, we have developed a scheme, based on the theory of approximation of multivariate functions, that learns from a small set of perspective views a function mapping any viewpoint to a standard view. A network equivalent to this scheme will thus 'recognize' the object on which it was trained from any viewpoint."

Chebyshev in the last century, and the entire theory of uniform approxima tion is strongly connected with his name. By making use of his ideas, the theories of best uniform approximation by rational functions and by polynomials were developed over the years in an almost unified framework. The difference between linear and rational approximation and its implications first became apparent in the 1960's. At roughly the same time other approaches to nonlinear approximation were also developed. The use of new tools, such as nonlinear functional analysis and topological methods, showed that linearization is not sufficient for a complete treatment of nonlinear families. In particular, the application of global analysis and the consideration of flows on the family of approximating functions intro duced ideas which were previously unknown in approximation theory. These were and still are important in many branches of analysis. On the other hand, methods developed for nonlinear approximation prob lems can often be successfully applied to problems which belong to or arise from linear approximation. An important example is the solution of moment problems via rational approximation. Best quadrature formulae or the search for best linear spaces often leads to the consideration of spline functions with free nodes. The most famous problem of this kind, namely best interpolation by poly nomials, is treated in the appendix of this book.\""

The model it describes can aid in understanding human memory and learning, and a system based on it sheds light on outstanding problems in philosophy and artificial intelligence. Applications of the memory are expected to be found in the creation of adaptive systems for signal processing, speech, vision, motor control, and (in general) robots.

These techniques lead to meaningful results, provided that solutions belong to suitable compact sets. Often some additional constraints on the shape or the behavior of the possible solutions are available. This note discusses which of these constraints can be embedded in the classic theory of regularization and how, in order to improve the quality of the recovered solution. Connections with mathematical programming techniques are also discussed. As a conclusion, regularization of early vision problems may be improved by the use of some constraints on the shape of the solution (such as monotonicity and upper and lower bounds), when available."

Recognition results compare well with those obtained using backpropagation and a vector-quantized hidden Markov model on the same problem. A computationally efficient method of exactly solving linear networks in a noniterative fashion is also described. The method was applied to classification of vowels into 20 classes using three different types of input analysis and varying numbers of radial basis functions. The three types of input vectors consisted of linear-prediction-coding cepstral coefficient; formant tracks with frequency, amplitude, and bandwidth information; and bark-scaled formant tracks. All input analyses were supplemented with duration information. The best test results were obtained using the cepstral coefficients and 170 or more radial basis functions.<<ETX>>"

The memory representations for pronunciations are learned by practice and are shared among many processing units. The performance of NETtalk has some similarities with observed human performance. (i) The learning follows a power law. (ii) The more words the network learns, the better it is at generalizing and correctly pronouncing new words, (iii) The performance of the network degrades very slowly as connections in the network are damaged: no single link or processing unit is essential. (iv) Relearning after damage is much faster than learning during the original training. (v) Distributed or spaced practice is more effective for long-term retention than massed practice. Network models can be constructed that have the same performance and learning characteristics on a particular task, but differ completely at the levels of synaptic strengths and single-unit responses. However, hierarchical clustering techniques applied to NETtalk reveal that these different networks have similar internal representations of letter-to-sound correspondences within groups of processing units. This suggests that invariant internal representations may be found in assemblies of neurons intermediate in size between highly localized and completely distributed representations."

Specific topics in early vision and their regularization are then analyzed rigorously, characterizing existence, uniqueness, and stability of solutions. A fundamental difficulty that arises in almost every vision problem is scale, that is, the resolution at which to operate. Methods that have been proposed to deal with the problem include scale-space techniques that consider the behavior of the result across a continuum of scales. From the point of view of regulation theory, the concept of scale is related quite directly to the regularization parameter lambda . It suggested that methods used to obtained the optimal value of lambda may provide, either directly or after suitable modification, the optimal scale associated with the specific instance of certain problems. >"

The key limitation of existing techniques is the very large randomly generated code books which must be stored, and the computational complexity of the associated encoding procedures. The quantization operation is decomposed into its rudimentary structural components. This leads to a simple and elegant approach to derive analytical properties of optimal quantizers. Some useful properties of quantizers and algorithmic approaches are given, which are relevant to the complexity of both storage and processing in the encoding operation. Highly disordered quantizers, which have been designed using a clustering algorithm, are considered. Finally, lattice quantizers are examined which circumvent the need for a code book by using a highly structured code based on lattices. The code vectors are algorithmically generated in a simple manner rather than stored in a code book, and fast algorithms perform the encoding algorithm with negligible complexity."

                "text": "The main purpose of this paper is to describe a process for partitioning an N-dimensional population into k sets on the basis of a sample. The process, which is called 'k-means,' appears to give partitions which are reasonably efficient in the sense of within-class variance. That is, if p is the probability mass function for the population, S = {S1, S2, * *, Sk} is a partition of EN, and ui, i = 1, 2, * , k, is the conditional mean of p over the set Si, then W2(S) = ff=ISi f z u42 dp(z) tends to be low for the partitions S generated by the method. We say 'tends to be low,' primarily because of intuitive considerations, corroborated to some extent by mathematical analysis and practical computational experience. Also, the k-means procedure is easily programmed and is computationally economical, so that it is feasible to process very large samples on a digital computer. Possible applications include methods for similarity grouping, nonlinear prediction, approximating multivariate distributions, and nonparametric tests for independence among several variables. In addition to suggesting practical classification methods, the study of k-means has proved to be theoretically interesting. The k-means concept represents a generalization of the ordinary sample mean, and one is naturally led to study the pertinent asymptotic behavior, the object being to establish some sort of law of large numbers for the k-means. This problem is sufficiently interesting, in fact, for us to devote a good portion of this paper to it. The k-means are defined in section 2.1, and the main results which have been obtained on the asymptotic behavior are given there. The rest of section 2 is devoted to the proofs of these results. Section 3 describes several specific possible applications, and reports some preliminary results from computer experiments conducted to explore the possibilities inherent in the k-means idea. The extension to general metric spaces is indicated briefly in section 4. The original point of departure for the work described here was a series of problems in optimal classification (MacQueen [9]) which represented special"

It is shown that for objects with sharp edges as well as with smooth bounding contours, the set of possible images of a given object is embedded in a linear space spanned by a small number of views. For objects with sharp edges, the linear combination representation is exact. For objects with smooth boundaries, it is an approximation that often holds over a wide range of viewing angles. Rigid transformations (with or without scaling) can be distinguished from more general linear transformations of the object by testing certain constraints placed on the coefficients of the linear combinations. Three alternative methods of determining the transformation that matches a model to a given image are proposed. >"

Employing the radial basis function\u03d5:R+\u2192R, means thats is from the linear space spanned by the functions\n$$\\{ \\varphi (\\left\\| {x - x_i } \\right\\|_2 ):x \\in R^n :i = 1,2,...,m\\} ,$$\n except that low-order polynomials are sometimes added and further conditions imposed ons that take up the extra degrees of freedom. Micchelli [6] shows that for some choices of\u03d5 these conditions uniquely defines. Now, however, the more basic question of the suitability of the spaces is considered. Sufficient conditions are given for members of the linear space to converge locally uniformly to a prescribed continuous function on a bounded domain, as the data points {xi:i=1,2,...} become dense. For the case\u03d5(r)=r they are found to hold when n is odd but not whenn is even."

The computational complexity of the implementation has been a drawback of MRFs. In this paper we derive deterministic approximations to MRFs models. All the theoretical results are obtained in the framework of the mean field theory from statistical mechanics. Because we use MRFs models the mean field equations lead to parallel and iterative algorithms. One of the considered models for image reconstruction is shown to give in a natural way the graduate non-convexity algorithm proposed by Blake and Zisserman."

A mathematical framework for comparing the two models is developed, and the capacity of each model is investigated. The capacity of the SDM can be increased independent of the dimension of the stored vectors, whereas the Hopfield capacity is limited to a fraction of this dimension. The stored information is proportional to the number of connections, and it is shown that this proportionality constant is the same for the SDM, the Hopfield model, and higher-order models. The models are also compared in their ability to store and recall temporal sequences of patterns. The SDM also includes time delays so that contextual information can be used to recover sequences. A generalization of the SDM allows storage of correlated patterns."

The algorithm, which resembles a new lightness algorithm recently proposed by Land, is approximately equivalent to filtering the image through a center-surround receptive field in individual chromatic channels. The synthesizing technique, optimal linear estimation, requires only one assumption, that the operator that transforms input into output is linear. This assumption is true for a certain class of early vision algorithms that may therefore be synthesized in a similar way from examples. Other methods of synthesizing algorithms from examples, or \"learning,\" such as back-propagation, do not yield a significantly better lightness algorithm."

                "text": "SummarySmoothing splines are well known to provide nice curves which smooth discrete, noisy data. We obtain a practical, effective method for estimating the optimum amount of smoothing from the data. Derivatives can be estimated from the data by differentiating the resulting (nearly) optimally smoothed spline.We consider the modelyi(ti)+\u03b5i,i=1, 2, ...,n,ti\u2208[0, 1], whereg\u2208W2(m)={f:f,f\u2032, ...,f(m\u22121) abs. cont.,f(m)\u2208\u21122[0,1]}, and the {\u03b5i} are random errors withE\u03b5i=0,E\u03b5i\u03b5j=\u03c32\u03b4ij. The error variance \u03c32 may be unknown. As an estimate ofg we take the solutiongn, \u03bb to the problem: Findf\u2208W2(m) to minimize\n$$\\frac{1}{n}\\sum\\limits_{j = 1}^n {(f(t_j ) - y_j )^2 + \\lambda \\int\\limits_0^1 {(f^{(m)} (u))^2 du} }$$\n. The functiongn, \u03bb is a smoothing polynomial spline of degree 2m\u22121. The parameter \u03bb controls the tradeoff between the \u201croughness\u201d of the solution, as measured by\n$$\\int\\limits_0^1 {[f^{(m)} (u)]^2 du}$$\n, and the infidelity to the data as measured by\n$$\\frac{1}{n}\\sum\\limits_{j = 1}^n {(f(t_j ) - y_j )^2 }$$\n, and so governs the average square errorR(\u03bb; g)=R(\u03bb) defined by\n$$R(\\lambda ) = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum\\limits_{j = 1}^n {(g_{n,\\lambda } (t_j ) - g(t_j ))^2 }$$\n. We provide an estimate\n$$\\hat \\lambda$$\n, called the generalized cross-validation estimate, for the minimizer ofR(\u03bb). The estimate\n$$\\hat \\lambda$$\n is the minimizer ofV(\u03bb) defined by\n$$V(\\lambda ) = \\frac{1}{n}\\parallel (I - A(\\lambda ))y\\parallel ^2 /\\left[ {\\frac{1}{n}{\\text{Trace(}}I - A(\\lambda ))} \\right]^2$$\n, wherey=(y1, ...,yn)t andA(\u03bb) is then\u00d7n matrix satisfying(gn, \u03bb (t1), ...,gn, \u03bb (tn))t=A (\u03bb) y. We prove that there exist a sequence of minimizers\n$$\\tilde \\lambda = \\tilde \\lambda (n)$$\n ofEV(\u03bb), such that as the (regular) mesh{ti}i=1n becomes finer,\n$$\\mathop {\\lim }\\limits_{n \\to \\infty } ER(\\tilde \\lambda )/\\mathop {\\min }\\limits_\\lambda ER(\\lambda ) \\downarrow 1$$\n. A Monte Carlo experiment with several smoothg's was tried withm=2,n=50 and several values of \u03c32, and typical values of\n$$R(\\hat \\lambda )/\\mathop {\\min }\\limits_\\lambda R(\\lambda )$$\n were found to be in the range 1.01\u20131.4. The derivativeg\u2032 ofg can be estimated by\n$$g'_{n,\\hat \\lambda } (t)$$\n. In the Monte Carlo examples tried, the minimizer of\n$$R_D (\\lambda ) = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum\\limits_{j = 1}^n {(g'_{n,\\lambda } (t_j ) - } g'(t_j ))$$\n tended to be close to the minimizer ofR(\u03bb), so that\n$$\\hat \\lambda$$\n was also a good value of the smoothing parameter for estimating the derivative."

Pixel gray levels and the presence and orientation of edges are viewed as states of atoms or molecules in a lattice-like physical system. The assignment of an energy function in the physical system determines its Gibbs distribution. Because of the Gibbs distribution, Markov random field (MRF) equivalence, this assignment also determines an MRF image model. The energy function is a more convenient and natural mechanism for embodying picture attributes than are the local characteristics of the MRF. For a range of degradation mechanisms, including blurring, nonlinear deformations, and multiplicative or additive noise, the posterior distribution is an MRF with a structure akin to the image model. By the analogy, the posterior distribution defines another (imaginary) physical system. Gradual temperature reduction in the physical system isolates low energy states (``annealing''), or what is the same thing, the most probable states under the Gibbs distribution. The analogous operation under the posterior distribution yields the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the image given the degraded observations. The result is a highly parallel ``relaxation'' algorithm for MAP estimation. We establish convergence properties of the algorithm and we experiment with some simple pictures, for which good restorations are obtained at low signal-to-noise ratios."

This problem is relevant not only to photographic surveying1 but also to binocular vision2, where the non-visual information available to the observer about the orientation and focal length of each eye is much less accurate than the optical information supplied by the retinal images themselves. The problem also arises in monocular perception of motion3, where the two projections represent views which are separated in time as well as space. As Marr and Poggio4 have noted, the fusing of two images to produce a three-dimensional percept involves two distinct processes: the establishment of a 1:1 correspondence between image points in the two views\u2014the \u2018correspondence problem\u2019\u2014and the use of the associated disparities for determining the distances of visible elements in the scene.

Convenient representation formulas are given, as also a practical multivariate extension of the Peano kernel theorem.

Levin has shown that if tilde{P}'_{M}(x) is an unnormalized form of this measure, and P(x) is any computable probability measure on strings, x , then \\tilde{P}'_{M}\\geqCP(x) where C is a constant independent of x . The corresponding result for the normalized form of this measure, P'_{M} , is directly derivable from Willis' probability measures on nonuniversal machines. If the conditional probabilities of P'_{M} are used to approximate those of P , then the expected value of the total squared error in these conditional probabilities is bounded by -(1/2) \\ln C . With this error criterion, and when used as the basis of a universal gambling scheme, P'_{M} is superior to Cover's measure b\\ast . When H\\ast\\equiv -\\log_{2} P'_{M} is used to define the entropy of a rmite sequence, the equation H\\ast(x,y)= H\\ast(x)+H^{\\ast}_{x}(y) holds exactly, in contrast to Chaitin's entropy definition, which has a nonvanishing error term in this equation."

By moving its arm through a small, representative sample of the 1 billion possible joint configurations, MURPHY learns the relationships, backwards and forwards, between the positions of its joints and the state of its visual field. MURPHY can use its internal model in the forward direction to \"envision\" sequences of actions for planning purposes, such as in grabbing a visually presented object, or in the reverse direction to \"imitate\", with its arm, autonomous activity in its visual field. Furthermore, by taking explicit advantage of continuity in the mappings between visual space and joint space, MURPHY is able to learn non-linear mappings with only a single layer of modifiable weights."

We propose a theoretical model, called the motion coherence tlieory, that gives a possible explanation for these effects (Yuille and Grzywacz, 1988a,b). In this framework, the aperture problem can also be thought of as a problem of coherence and given a similar explanation. We propose the concept of a velocity field dcfined everywhere in the image, even where there is no explicit motion information available. Through a cost function, tlie model imposes smoothness on the velocity field in a more general way than previous theories. In this paper, we provide a de- tailed theoretical analysis of the motion coherence theory. We discuss its relations with previous theories and show that some of t1ic.m arc approximations to it. A sccorid pa- per (Grzywacz, Smith, and Yuillc, 1088) provides exten- sions and cletnilcd comparisons to psychophysical plienom- cna. Tlic theory applies to both short-range and long- range motion. It places them in the same computational framework aiid provides a way to define interactions be- twcr:11 the two 1)roccsses."

Let, furthermore, lP stand for the space of real sequences with the series of pth powers of the absolute values convergent. Similarly let LP denote the space of real measurable functions in the interval (0, 1) which are summable to the pth power, while C shall mean the space of real continuous functions in the same interval. In all these spaces a distance function is assumed to be defined as usual. t L2 is equivalent to the real Hilbert space t. The spaces EmP, IP and LP are metric only if p > 1, but we shall consider them also for positive values of p O). A general theorem of Banach and Mazur ([1], p. 187) states that any separable metric space (5 may be imbedded isometrically in the space C. Furthermore, as a special case of a well known theorem of Urysohn, any such space (E may be imbedded topologically in t. Isometric imbeddability of (E in '& is, however, a much more restricted property of (B. The chief purpose of this paper is to point out the intimate relationship between the problem of isometric imbedding and the concept of positive definite functions, if this concept is properly enlarged. As a first approach to this connection we consider here isometric imbedding in Hilbert space only. It turns out that the possibility of imbedding$ in 6& is very easily expressible in terms of the elementary function e-t2 and the concept of positive definite functions (Theorem 1).

A mathematical model is formulated which is shown to predict both the qualitative features and the quantitative details observed experimentally in planar, multijoint arm movements. Coordination is modeled mathematically by defining an objective function, a measure of performance for any possible movement. The unique trajectory which yields the best performance is determined using dynamic optimization theory. In the work presented here, the objective function is the square of the magnitude of jerk (rate of change of acceleration) of the hand integrated over the entire movement. This is equivalent to assuming that a major goal of motor coordination is the production of the smoothest possible movement of the hand. Experimental observations of human subjects performing voluntary unconstrained movements in a horizontal plane are presented. They confirm the following predictions of the mathematical model: unconstrained point-to-point motions are approximately straight with bell-shaped tangential velocity profiles; curved motions (through an intermediate point or around an obstacle) have portions of low curvature joined by portions of high curvature; at points of high curvature, the tangential velocity is reduced; the durations of the low-curvature portions are approximately equal. The theoretical analysis is based solely on the kinematics of movement independent of the dynamics of the musculoskeletal system and is successful only when formulated in terms of the motion of the hand in extracorporal space. The implications with respect to movement organization are discussed."
