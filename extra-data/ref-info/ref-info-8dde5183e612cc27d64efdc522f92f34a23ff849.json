The problem of contour detection is reduced to the problem of finding a minimal-cost path in a weighted graph. A figure of merit takes into account the properties of the contour, and graph searching techniques are used to find the contours which minimize the given figure of merit. Because of the global approach, this method has great flexibility. Some experimental results are given, which show how information about the shape of the object to be detected can be incorporated in the figure of merit, thus allowing the extraction of contours from noisy pictures and the separation of touching objects.

The recognition process is conceived as a process of continuously refined verification of the hypothesized descriptions of objects. We use conceptual identification of objects during the recognition process as soon as we can; we equip these concepts with meanings in the three-dimensional world. We present several concrete examples as a demonstration of the capabilities of our program."

These include enhancements which depict hitherto unrecognized surface alteration and allow analysis of ore-controlling fractures distribution in a regional context. ERTS has likewise provided observational data containing previously unrecognized surface anomalies in large oil-producing basins which correlate closely with known oil fields. These observational data offer promise of providing new and powerful techniques for oil exploration, especially if further work using more sophisticated enhancement-processing proves capable of emphasizing the anomalies. ERTS is showing a better-than-anticipated potential for producing accurate small-scale (large-area) geologic maps, often containing details that were previously not recorded on similar regional maps. The maps produced from ERTS imagery can be prepared more effectively than previously possible, mainly because of the synoptic, multispectral, and repetitive character of ERTS data. ERTS has also provided extensive information on possible geologic hazards. Many new fractures have been identified in several regions of the Pacific Coast seismic belt that have histories of recent earthquakes. This has obvious implications for engineering projects such as dams, aqueducts, and transportation routes. In the mid-continent area, ERTS data have been used to predict zones of rooffall danger in a working coal mine from newly discovered lineations (probably fractures) used as indicators of hazards."
