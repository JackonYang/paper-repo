These new findings attain significance from the fact that neurophysiological research in the past has been based predominantly on cell recordings obtained during fixation tasks, under the assumption that these data would be useful in predicting responses in more general situations. We describe a hierarchical model of visual memory that reconciles the two differing experimental results mentioned above by predicting neural responses in both fixating and free-viewing conditions. The model dynamically combines input-driven bottom-up signals with expectation-driven top-down signals to achieve optimal estimation of current state using a Kalman filter based framework. The architecture of the model posits a role for the reciprocal connections between adjoining visual cortical areas in determining neural response properties."

                "text": "We perceive the visual world as a unitary whole, yet one of the guiding principles of nearly a half century of neurophysiological research since the early recordings by Hartline (1938) has been that the visual system consists of neurons that are driven by stimulation within small discrete portions of the total visual field. These classical receptive fields (CRFs) have been mapped with the excitatory responses evoked by a flashed or moving stimulus, usually a spot or bar of light. Most of the visual neurons, in turn, are organized in a series of maps of the visual field, at least 10 of which exist in the visual cortex in primates as well as additional topographic representations in the lateral geniculate body, pulvinar and optic tectum (Allman 1977, Newsome & Allman 1980, Allman & Kaas 1984). It has been widely assumed that perceptual functions that require the integration of inputs over large portions of the visual field must be either collective properties of arrays of neurons representing the visual field, or features of those neurons at the highest processing levels in the visual system, such as the cells in inferotemporal or posterior parietal cortex that typically possess very large receptive fields and do not appear to be organized in visuotopic maps. These assumptions have been based on the results of the many studies in which receptive fields were mapped with conventional stimuli, presented one at a time, against a featureless background. However, unlike the neurophysiologist's tangent screen, the natural visual scene is rich in features, and there is a growing body of evidence that in many visual neurons stimuli presented outside the CRF strongly and selectively influence neural responses to stimuli presented within the CRF. These results suggest obvious mechanisms for local-global comparisons within visuotopically organized structures. Such broad and specific surround mechanisms could participate in many functions that require the integration of inputs over wide regions of the visual space such as the perceptual constancies, the segregation of figure from ground, and depth perception through motion parallax. In the first section of this paper, we trace the historical development of the evidence of response selectivity for visual stimuli presented beyond the CRF; in the second, examine the anatomical pathways that sub serve these far-reaching surround mechanisms; and in the third, explore the possible relationships between these mechanisms and perception."

In these cells an increase in stimulus length beyond an optimal value leads to a rapid decline in response. This decline has been attributed to an intracortical inhibitory input1 which may be driven by layer VI cells with very long receptive fields3. It is now clear, however, that cells in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN), exhibit a degree of length tuning similar to that of cortical 'hypercomplex cells'4,5, suggesting that this response property could be generated subcortically. Alternatively, as the dLGN receives a massive corticofugal projection from layer VI cells in the visual cortex6, it is possible that this input has a function in generating length tuning in the dLGN. We have investigated this issue by comparing the length tuning of dLGN cells with and without corticofugal feedback. The data show that corticofugal feedback makes a highly significant contribution to the length tuning of dLGN cells. This raises the possibility that length tuning is an emergent property of the geniculo-cortical loop."

Saccades are known to be ballistic: the pattern of muscle activation for foveating a prespecified target location is computed prior to the movement and visual feedback is precluded. Despite these distinctive properties, there has been no general model of the saccadic targeting strategy employed by the human visual system during visual search in natural scenes. This paper proposes a model for saccadic targeting that uses iconic scene representations derived from oriented spatial filters at multiple scales. Visual search proceeds in a coarse-to-fine fashion with the largest scale filter responses being compared first. The model was empirically tested by comparing its performance with actual eye movement data from human subjects in a natural visual search task; preliminary results indicate substantial agreement between eye movements predicted by the model and those recorded from human subjects."

One method of verification is multivariate time-series prediction: a good model could predict the near-future activity of its inputs, much as a good scientific theory predicts future data. Such a predicting model would require copious top-down connections to compare the predictions with the input. That feedback could improve the model's performance in two ways: by biasing internal activity toward expected patterns, and by generating specific error signals if the predictions fail. A proof-of-concept model-an event-driven, computationally efficient layered network, incorporating \"cortical\" features like all-excitatory synapses and local inhibition--was constructed to make near-future predictions of a simple, moving stimulus. After unsupervised learning, the network contained units not only tuned to obvious features of the stimulus like contour orientation and motion, but also to contour discontinuity (\"end-stopping\") and illusory contours."

(London) 160, 106-154; (1968) J. Physiol. (London) 195, 215-243] using qualitative analyses based on simple geometric visual targets. Over the past 30 years, it has become common to consider the properties of these neurons by attempting to make formal descriptions of these transformations they execute on the visual image. Most such models have their roots in linear-systems approaches pioneered in the retina by C. Enroth-Cugell and J. R. Robson [(1966) J. Physiol. (London) 187, 517-552], but it is clear that purely linear models of cortical neurons are inadequate. We present two related models: one designed to account for the responses of simple cells in primary visual cortex (V1) and one designed to account for the responses of pattern direction selective cells in MT (or V5), an extrastriate visual area thought to be involved in the analysis of visual motion. These models share a common structure that operates in the same way on different kinds of input, and instantiate the widely held view that computational strategies are similar throughout the cerebral cortex. Implementations of these models for Macintosh microcomputers are available and can be used to explore the models' properties."

A variety of ana\u00ad tomical and physiological approaches have been employed to analyze the organization of thc visual pathway between the retina and striate cortex (VI ) and the transformations of visual information that occur at each stage (see Hubel & Wiesel 1977, Stone 1 983, Shapley & Lennie 1985). The growth in understanding of the retinostriate pathway has been accompanied by increasing interest in visual processing in the expanse of extrastriate cortex beyond V I . Studies of extrastriate cortex in many spec\u00ad ies showed that it comprises a mosaic of visual areas that can be dis\u00ad tinguished by several anatomical and physiological criteria (reviewed by Kaas 1 978, Zeki 1 978, Cowey 1979, Van Essen 1 979, 1985, Wagor et al 1980, Tusa et al 1 98 1) . The literature in this field is large, and we do not attempt to review all relevant studies. Rather, we concern ourselves with three recent devel\u00ad opments that have yielded insight into information processing and flow within extrastriate cortex. The first of these is the convergence of ana tom-"

It is proposed that this impressive performance depends in part on a fast learning process that uses relatively few examples and that occurs at an early processing stage in the visual pathway. This hypothesis is given support by the demonstration that it is possible to synthesize, from a small number of examples of a given task, a simple network that attains the required performance level. Psychophysical experiments agree with some of the key predictions of the model. In particular, fast stimulus-specific learning is found to take place in the human visual system, and this learning does not transfer between two slightly different hyperacuity tasks."

The response to an optimally oriented stimulus of both simple and complex cells in the cat's striate visual cortex (area 17) can be suppressed by the superposition of an orthogonally oriented drifting grating. This effect is referred to as cross-orientation suppression. We have examined the spatial organization and tuning characteristics of this suppressive effect with the use of extracellular recording techniques. 2. For a total of 75 neurons, we have measured the size of each cell's excitatory receptive field by use of rectangular patches of drifting sinusoidal gratings presented at the optimal orientation and spatial frequency. The length and width of these grating patches are varied independently. Receptive-field length and width are determined from the dimensions of the smallest grating patch required to elicit a maximal response. 3. The extent of the area from which cross-orientation suppression originates has been measured in an analogous manner. Each neuron is excited by a patch of drifting grating the same size as the receptive field. The response to this stimulus is modulated by a superimposed patch of grating having an orthogonal orientation. After selecting the spatial frequency that produces maximal suppression, the response of each cell is examined as a function of the length and width of the orthogonal (suppressive) grating patch. Results from 29 cells show that the dimensions of the orthogonal grating patch required to elicit maximal suppression are similar to, or smaller than, the dimensions of the excitatory receptive field. Thus cross-orientation suppression originates from within the receptive field. 4. For some cells the spatial frequency tuning of the suppressive effect is much broader than the spatial frequency tuning for excitation. In these cases it is possible to find a spatial frequency that produces suppression but not excitation. With the use of a suppressive stimulus having this spatial frequency, we examined the strength of suppression as a function of orientation for 11 cells. These tests show that suppression occurs at all orientations, including the preferred orientation for excitation. In some cases, suppression is somewhat stronger at the preferred orientation for excitation than at any other orientation. 5. For 12 cells we varied the relative spatial phase between the optimally oriented and orthogonal gratings. In all cases the magnitude of suppression is largely independent of the relative spatial phase. 6. For three binocular cells we examined whether the suppressive effect of a grating oriented orthogonal to the optimum could be mediated dichoptically.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

One approach to understanding such response properties of visual neurons has been to consider their relationship to the statistical structure of natural images in terms of efficient coding7\u201312. Along these lines, a number of studies have attempted to train unsupervised learning algorithms on natural images in the hope of developing receptive fields with similar properties13\u201318, but none has succeeded in producing a full set that spans the image space and contains all three of the above properties. Here we investigate the proposal8,12 that a coding strategy that maximizes sparseness is sufficient to account for these properties. We show that a learning algorithm that attempts to find sparse linear codes for natural scenes will develop a complete family of localized, oriented, bandpass receptive fields, similar to those found in the primary visual cortex. The resulting sparse image code provides a more efficient representation for later stages of processing because it possesses a higher degree of statistical independence among its outputs."

To examine the selectivity of cells in V4 for stimulus form, we quantitatively measured the responses of 322 cells to bars varying in length, width, orientation, and polarity of contrast, and sinusoidal gratings varying in spatial frequency, phase, orientation, and overall size. All of the cells recorded in V4 were located on the lower portion of the prelunate gyrus. Receptive fields were located almost exclusively within the representation of the central 5 degrees of the lower visual field, and receptive field size, in linear dimension, was 4-7 times greater than that in the corresponding representation of striate cortex (V1). Nearly all receptive fields consisted of overlapping dark and light zones, like \"classic\" complex fields in V1, but the relative strengths of the dark and light zones often differed. A few cells responded exclusively to light or dark stimuli. Many cells in V4 were selective for stimulus orientation, and a few were selective for direction of motion as well. Although the median orientation bandwidth of the orientation-selective cells (52 degrees) was wider than that reported for oriented cells in V1, approximately 8% of the oriented cells had bandwidths of less than 30 degrees, which is nearly as narrow as the most narrowly tuned cells in V1. The proportion of cells selective for direction of motion (13%) was not markedly different from that reported in V1. The large majority of V4 cells were tuned to the length and width of bars, and the \"shape\" of the optimal bar varied from cell to cell, as has been reported for cells in the dorsolateral visual area (DL) of the owl monkey, a possible homologue of V4 in the macaque. Preferred lengths and widths varied independently from approximately 0.05 to 6 degrees, with the smallest preferred bars about the size of the smallest receptive fields in V1 and the largest preferred bars larger than any fields in V1. The relationship between the size of the optimal bar and the size of the receptive field varied from cell to cell. Some cells, for example, responded best to bars much narrower or shorter than the field, whereas other cells responded best to bars that filled (but did not extend beyond) the excitatory field in the length, width, or both dimensions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

The possibility of temporal encoding in the spike trains of single neurons recorded in the temporal lobe visual cortical areas of rhesus macaques was analyzed with the use of principal component and information theory analyses of smoothed spike trains. The neurons analyzed had responses selective for faces. 2. Provided that a correction was applied to earlier methods of principal component analysis used for neuronal spike trains, it was shown that the first principal component provides by a great extent the most information, with the second and third adding only small proportions (on average 18.8 and 8.4%, respectively). 3. It was shown that the magnitude of the second and higher principal components is even smaller if the spike train analysis is started after the onset of the neuronal response, instead of before the neuronal response has started. This suggests that variations in response latency are at least a part of what is reflected by the second and higher principal components. 4. The first principal component was correlated with the mean firing rate of the neurons. The second and higher principal components reflected at least partly the onset properties of the neuronal responses, such as response latency differences between the stimuli. 5. A considerable proportion of the information available from principal components 1-3 is available in the firing rate of the neuron. 6. Periods of the firing rate of as little as 50 or even 20 ms are sufficient to give a reasonable estimate of the firing rate of the neuron. 7. Information theory analysis showed that in short epochs (e.g., 50 ms) the information available from the firing rate can be as high, on average, as 84.4% of that available from the firing rate calculated over 400 ms, and 52.0% of that available from principal components 1-3 in the 400-ms period. It was also found that 44.0% of the information calculated from the first three principal components is available in the firing rates calculated over epochs as short as 20 ms. 8. More information was available near the start of the neuronal response, and the information available from short epochs became less later in the neuronal response. 9. Taken together, these analyses provide evidence that a short period of firing taken close to the start of the neuronal response provides a reasonable proportion of the total information that would be available if a long period of neuronal firing (e.g., 400 ms) were utilized to extract it, even if temporal encoding were used.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

A model is proposed in which the feedback pathways serve to modify afferent sensory stimuli in ways that enhance and complete sensory input patterns, suppress irrelevant features, and generate quasi-sensory patterns when afferent stimulation is weak or absent. Such inversion of sensory coding and feature extraction can be achieved by optimization processes in which scalar responses derived from high-level neural analyzers are used as cost functions to modify the filter properties of more peripheral sensory relays. An optimization algorithm, Alopex, which is used in the model, is readily implemented with known neural circuitry. The functioning of the system is investigated by computer simulations."

The degree of involvement is not known and must be studied and quantified in animal models. It is possible to identify those parts of the central nervous system necessary for visual perception. Once these areas have been identified, their sensitivity to irradiation can be studied more precisely. Visual responses of area 18 neurons were studied in the awake, behaving monkey. Cells were divided into six different classes on the basis of their stimulus preferences and spatial characteristics. Orientation cells were sensitive to the orientation of elongated stimuli. Color cells had nonoriented receptive fields with spatially coextensive opponent color inputs. Direction cells preferred moving stimuli, giving the greatest response to movement in some direction and no response or inhibition to movement in the opposite direction. Spot cells preferred a properly positioned small spot of light and responded equally well to all directions of stimulus movement. Border cells responded best to a stimulus that filled an excitatory region without encroaching on a powerful suppressive flank. Lightinhibited cells had high maintained spontaneous activity that was reduced or abolished by light."

It would be astonishing if such a structure did not profoundly modify the response patterns of fibres coming into it. In the cat's visual cortex, the receptive field arrangements of single cells suggest that there is indeed a degree of complexity far exceeding anything yet seen at lower levels in the visual system. In a previous paper we described receptive fields of single cortical cells, observing responses to spots of light shone on one or both retinas (Hubel & Wiesel, 1959). In the present work this method is used to examine receptive fields of a more complex type (Part I) and to make additional observations on binocular interaction (Part II). This approach is necessary in order to understand the behaviour of individual cells, but it fails to deal with the problem of the relationship of one cell to its neighbours. In the past, the technique of recording evoked slow waves has been used with great success in studies of functional anatomy. It was employed by Talbot & Marshall (1941) and by Thompson, Woolsey & Talbot (1950) for mapping out the visual cortex in the rabbit, cat, and monkey. Daniel & Whitteiidge (1959) have recently extended this work in the primate. Most of our present knowledge of retinotopic projections, binocular overlap, and the second visual area is based on these investigations. Yet the method of evoked potentials is valuable mainly for detecting behaviour common to large populations of neighbouring cells; it cannot differentiate functionally between areas of cortex smaller than about 1 mm2. To overcome this difficulty a method has in recent years been developed for studying cells separately or in small groups during long micro-electrode penetrations through nervous tissue. Responses are correlated with cell location by reconstructing the electrode tracks from histological material. These techniques have been applied to"

This strategy can be used for resolving computational problems arising in the domains of stereopsis, directed visual attention, and the perception of moving images. In each of these situations, some means of dynamically controlling how retinal outputs map onto higher-level targets is desirable--in order to achieve binocular fusion, to allow shifts of the focus of attention, and to prevent blurring of moving images. The proposed solution involves what we term \"shifter circuits,\" which allow for dynamic shifts in the relative alignment of input and output arrays without loss of local spatial relationships. The shifts are produced in increments along a succession of relay stages that are linked by diverging excitatory inputs. The direction of shift is controlled at each stage by inhibitory neurons that selectively suppress appropriate sets of ascending inputs. The shifter hypothesis is consistent with available anatomical and physiological evidence on the organization of the primate visual pathway, and it offers a sensible explanation for a variety of otherwise puzzling facts, such as the plethora of cells in the geniculorecipient layers of V1."

In the cat striate cortex, layer 4 is the main recipient of input from the lateral geniculate nucleus, yet the cells in that layer possess several receptive field properties that are distinct from the geniculate input, including orientation specificity, binocularity, directionality and end-inhibition, the last of which allows cells to respond to edges of a restricted length1\u20134. These properties could be generated by connections within the layer, by its input from the claustrum5 or by the massive projection that layer 4 receives from layer 6 (refs 6\u20139). In the present study, we attempted to determine the functional role of the layer 6 to layer 4 projection by reversible inactivation of layer 6 using the inhibitory transmitter \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA). After inactivating layer 6, cells in layer 4 lost end-inhibition. Cells in layer 2+3, which receive their principal input from layer 4, were similarly affected. The elimination of end-inhibition was specific, other receptive field properties, such as direction selectivity or orientation specificity, remaining intact."

The size of the image is systematically related to the location of maximal activity, which is as expected because the earliest visual areas are spatially organized1\u20135. These results were only evident, however, when imagery conditions were compared to a non-imagery baseline in which the same auditory cues were presented (and hence the stimuli were controlled); when a resting baseline was used (and hence brain activation was uncontrolled), imagery activation was obscured because of activation in visual cortex during the baseline condition. These findings resolve a debate in the literature about whether imagery activates early visual cortex6\u201311 and indicate that visual mental imagery involves 'depictive' representations, not solely language-like descriptions12\u201314. Moreover, the fact that stored visual information can affect processing in even the earliest visual areas suggests that knowledge can fundamentally bias what one sees."

We report here on (1) a summary of the layout of cortical areas associated with vision and with other modalities, (2) a computerized database for storing and representing large amounts of information on connectivity patterns, and (3) the application of these data to the analysis of hierarchical organization of the cerebral cortex. Our analysis concentrates on the visual system, which includes 25 neocortical areas that are predominantly or exclusively visual in function, plus an additional 7 areas that we regard as visual-association areas on the basis of their extensive visual inputs. A total of 305 connections among these 32 visual and visual-association areas have been reported. This represents 31% of the possible number of pathways if each area were connected with all others. The actual degree of connectivity is likely to be closer to 40%. The great majority of pathways involve reciprocal connections between areas. There are also extensive connections with cortical areas outside the visual system proper, including the somatosensory cortex, as well as neocortical, transitional, and archicortical regions in the temporal and frontal lobes. In the somatosensory/motor system, there are 62 identified pathways linking 13 cortical areas, suggesting an overall connectivity of about 40%. Based on the laminar patterns of connections between areas, we propose a hierarchy of visual areas and of somatosensory/motor areas that is more comprehensive than those suggested in other recent studies. The current version of the visual hierarchy includes 10 levels of cortical processing. Altogether, it contains 14 levels if one includes the retina and lateral geniculate nucleus at the bottom as well as the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus at the top. Within this hierarchy, there are multiple, intertwined processing streams, which, at a low level, are related to the compartmental organization of areas V1 and V2 and, at a high level, are related to the distinction between processing centers in the temporal and parietal lobes. However, there are some pathways and relationships (about 10% of the total) whose descriptions do not fit cleanly into this hierarchical scheme for one reason or another. In most instances, though, it is unclear whether these represent genuine exceptions to a strict hierarchy rather than inaccuracies or uncertainities in the reported assignment."

Recent psychophysical evidence supports the notion that some aspects of binocular rivalry bear functional similarities to other bistable percepts. We build a model based on the hypothesis (Logothetis & Schall, 1989; Leopold & Logothetis, 1996; Logothetis, Leopold, & Sheinberg, 1996) that alternation can be generated by competition between top-down cortical explanations for the inputs, rather than by direct competition between the inputs. Recent neurophysiological evidence shows that some binocular neurons are modulated with the changing percept; others are not, even if they are selective between the stimuli presented to the eyes.

In a scheme due to Gabor, an image is represented in terms of localized symmetrical and antisymmetrical elementary signals. Both measured receptive fields and measured spatial frequency tuning curves conform closely to the functional form of Gabor elementary signals. It is argued that the visual cortex representation corresponds closely to the Gabor scheme owing to its advantages in treating the subsequent problem of pattern recognition."

The circuit explains the intracellular responses to pulse stimulation in terms of the interactions between three basic populations of neurons, and reveals the following features of cortical processing that are important to computational theories of neocortex. First, inhibition and excitation are not separable events. Activation of the cortex inevitably sets in motion a sequence of excitation and inhibition in every neuron. Second, the thalamic input does not provide the major excitation arriving at any neuron. Instead the intracortical excitatory connections provide most of the excitation. Third, the time evolution of excitation and inhibition is far longer than the synaptic delays of the circuits involved. This means that cortical processing cannot rely on precise timing between individual synaptic inputs."

The first mechanism averages an apparition over a group, and in the treatment of this mechanism it is suggested that scansion plays a significant part. The second mechanism reduces an apparition to a standard selected from among its many legitimate presentations. The former mechanism is exemplified by the recognition of chords regardless of pitch and shapes regardless of size. The latter is exemplified here only in the reflexive mechanism translating apparitions to the fovea. Both are extensions to contemporaneous functions of the knowing of universals heretofore treated by the authors only with respect to sequence in time."

It is shown that even a single developing cell of a layered network exhibits a remarkable set of optimization properties that are closely related to issues in statistics, theoretical physics, adaptive signal processing, the formation of knowledge representation in artificial intelligence, and information theory. The network studied is based on the visual system. These results are used to infer an information-theoretic principle that can be applied to the network as a whole, rather than a single cell. The organizing principle proposed is that the network connections develop in such a way as to maximize the amount of information that is preserved when signals are transformed at each processing stage, subject to certain constraints. The operation of this principle is illustrated for some simple cases.<<ETX>>"

                "text": "1. Recordings were made from single neurones, or small clusters of cells, in five prestriate visual areas of rhesus monkey cortex. The cells were studied for their binocularity, as well as for their orientational, motion and colour preferences. In all, 1500 cells were studied, 250 cells for each of the areas V2, V3, V3A and the motion area of the posterior bank of the superior temporal sulcus, and 500 cells for V4. All the cells referred to in this study can be placed in one prestriate area or another unambiguously. 2. The great majority of cells in all areas were binocularly driven, without monocular preferences. Within each area, there were cells that either preferred binocular stimulation markedly, or were responsive to binocular stimulation only. The ocular interaction histograms for all areas are remarkably similar when tested at a fixed disparity. 3. Over 70% of the cells in areas V2, V3 and V3A were selective for orientation. The receptive fields of cells were larger in V3 and V3A than in V2. By contrast, less than 50% of the cells in V4 and the motion area of the superior temporal sulcus were orientation selective. 4. Directionally selective cells were found in all areas. But they were present in small numbers (less than 15%) in areas V2, V3, V3A and V4. By contrast, 90% of the cells in the motion area of the superior temporal sulcus were directionally selective. 5. 8% of the cells in V2 had opponent colour properties. Cells with such properties were not found in V3, V3A or in the motion area of the superior temporal sulcus. By contrast, 54% of the cells in the V4 complex had opponent colour properties. 6. It is argued that despite its uniformity in cytoarchitectural appearance and in ocular interaction patterns, there is a functional division of labour within the prestriate cortex. Evidence for this is seen not only in the different concentrations of functional cell types in distinct areas of the prestriate cortex, but also in the differential anatomical and callosal connexions of each area."

The striate cortex was studied in lightly anaesthetized macaque and spider monkeys by recording extracellularly from single units and stimulating the retinas with spots or patterns of light. Most cells can be categorized as simple, complex, or hypercomplex, with response properties very similar to those previously described in the cat. On the average, however, receptive fields are smaller, and there is a greater sensitivity to changes in stimulus orientation. A small proportion of the cells are colour coded."

This method is based on activity-dependent intrinsic signals and does not use voltage-sensitive dyes. Images of the living monkey striate (VI) and extrastriate (V2) visual cortex, taken during visual stimulation, were analyzed to yield maps of the distribution of cells with various functional properties. The cytochrome oxidase--rich blobs of V1 and the stripes of V2 were imaged in the living brain. In V2, no ocular dominance organization was seen, while regions of poor orientation tuning colocalized to every other cytochrome oxidase stripe. The orientation tuning of other regions of V2 appeared organized as modules that are larger and more uniform than those in V1."

The theory predicts a type of population coding that represents an extension of schemes such as look-up tables."

In this way responses to complex stimulus patterns evoking good, poor, and midrange responses could be compared across the cell population. 2. Cells exhibiting both good and poor initial discrimination between head views were found at short and long latencies; there was no correlation of any of the temporal response parameters measured with cell response latency. 3. The time course of the population response to the most effective stimuli showed a rapid increase to a peak firing rate (onset to peak, rise time, 58 ms) that was on average 115 spikes/s above spontaneous activity (S/A), followed by slower decay (decay time, 93 ms) to a maintained discharge rate (15% of the peak rate above S/A). 4. Discrimination between responses to different head views exhibited by the population showed a sharp rise and reached highly significant levels within 25 ms after the population's response onset. 5. On average, activity in a single neuron (the Average Cell) rises to 44% of its peak response rate within 5 ms of the response onset. 6. The Average Cell also showed exceptionally fast discrimination between views, significant within 5 ms of response onset. 7. It is argued that the fast rise in firing rate, followed by a decay to a lower rate and the very fast emergence of discrimination are features of pattern processing present in real neural systems that are lacking in many processing models based on artificial networks of neuronlike elements, particularly those where discrimination relies on top-down and/or lateral competitive inhibition. 8. It is concluded that the only way to account for the rapid discrimination is to consider a coding system in which the first spike from multiple sources is used to transmit information between stages of processing."

The generative model is assumed to be implemented in cortical feedback pathways while the feedforward pathways implement an approximate inverse model to facilitate the estimation of current state. Using the above framework, we derive models for invariant recognition, motion estimation, and stereopsis, and present preliminary simulation results demonstrating recognition of objects in the presence of translations, rotations and scale changes."

The concluding chapter describes an autonomous system that builds from experience an internal model of the world and bases its operation on that internal model. Close attention is paid to the engineering of the memory, including comparisons to ordinary computer memories. \nSparse Distributed Memory provides an overall perspective on neural systems. The model it describes can aid in understanding human memory and learning, and a system based on it sheds light on outstanding problems in philosophy and artificial intelligence. Applications of the memory are expected to be found in the creation of adaptive systems for signal processing, speech, vision, motor control, and (in general) robots. Perhaps the most exciting aspect of the memory, in its implications for research in neural networks, is that its realization with neuronlike components resembles the cortex of the cerebellum. \nPentti Kanerva is a scientist at the Research Institute for Advanced Computer Science at the NASA Ames Research Center and a visiting scholar at the Stanford Center for the Study of Language and Information.

At time scales of approximately 1/3 of a second, orienting movements of the body play a crucial role in cognition and form a useful computational level \u2013 more abstract than that used to capture natural phenomena but less abstract than what is traditionally used to study high-level cognitive processes such as reasoning. At this \u201cembodiment level,\u201d the constraints of the physical system determine the nature of cognitive operations. The key synergy is that at time scales of about 1/3 of a second, the natural sequentiality of body movements can be matched to the natural computational economies of sequential decision systems through a system of implicit reference called deictic in which pointing movements are used to bind objects in the world to cognitive programs. This target article focuses on how deictic bindings make it possible to perform natural tasks. Deictic computation provides a mechanism for representing the essential features that link external sensory data with internal cognitive programs and motor actions. One of the central features of cognition, working memory, can be related to moment-by-moment dispositions of body features such as eye movements and hand movements."

One fruitful approach is to build a parameterized stochastic generative model, independent draws from which are likely to produce the patterns. For all but the simplest generative models, each pattern can be generated in exponentially many ways. It is thus intractable to adjust the parameters to maximize the probability of the observed patterns. We describe a way of finessing this combinatorial explosion by maximizing an easily computed lower bound on the probability of the observations. Our method can be viewed as a form of hierarchical self-supervised learning that may relate to the function of bottom-up and top-down cortical processing pathways."

In standard conditions the background was a two-dimensional (2D) noise pattern, the bar moved at optimal speed, and its contrast level was adjusted to yield 50% of the maximum response. Neuronal responses to the moving bar were suppressed when the background moved at the same speed or faster than the bar. The direction of motion of the bar had little influence. This suppressive effect was equally strong in all three experimental samples. The suppressive effect of the moving background was uniformly distributed among the cortical population, being equally strong in all layers, in all parts of the visual field representation, and for different categories of cortical cells. The suppressive effect of the moving background depended little on the structure of the background or on the speed of the bar. The suppression increased with decreasing contrast of the bar. Many (80%) cortical cells and all geniculate neurons responded to the movement of the 2D noise on its own. Most of these cells responded to isolated features (\"grains\") in the pattern rather than to movement of the whole pattern. There was no difference in strength of suppression between cortical neurons responsive and unresponsive to the moving 2D noise. The possible origins of this suppressive influence of moving backgrounds and its significance for the processing of visual scenes, more complicated than a single stimulus, are discussed."

                "text": "Lecture Notes for the MSc/DTC module. The brain is a complex computing machine which has evolved to give the ttest output to a given input. Neural computation has as goal to describe the function of the nervous system in mathematical and computational terms. By analysing or simulating the resulting equations, one can better understand its function, research how changes in parameters would eect the function, and try to mimic the nervous system in hardware or software implementations. Neural Computation is a bit like physics, that has been successful in describing numerous physical phenomena. However, approaches developed in those elds not always work for neural computation, because: 1. Physical systems are best studied in reduced, simplied circumstances, but the nervous system is hard to study in isolation. Neurons require a narrow range of operating conditions (temperature, oxygen, presence of other neurons, ion concentrations, ...) under which they work as they should. These conditions are hard to reproduce outside the body. Secondly, the neurons form a highly interconnected network. The function of the nervous systems depends on this connectivity and interaction, by trying to isolate the components, you are likely to alter the function. 2. It is not clear how much detail one needs to describe the computations in the brain. In these lectures we shall see various description levels. 3. Neural signals and neural connectivity are hard to measure, especially, if disturbance and damage to the nervous system is to be kept minimal. Perhaps Neural Computation has more in common with trying to gure out how a complicated machine, such as a computer or car works. Knowledge of the basic physics helps, but is not sucient. Luckily there are factors which perhaps make understanding the brain easier than understanding an arbitrary complicated machine: 1. There is a high degree of conservation across species. This means that animal studies can be used to gain information about the human brain. Furthermore, study of, say, the visual system might help to understand the auditory system. 2. The nervous system is able to develop by combining on one hand a only limited amount of genetic information and, on the other hand, the input it receives. Therefore it might be possible to nd the organising principles and develop a brain from there. This would be easier than guring out the complete 'wiring diagram'. 3. The nervous system is exible and robust, neurons die everyday. This stands \u2026"

We investigate the empirical evidence for this further and argue that filters can produce 'interesting' output distributions simply because natural images have variable local intensity variance. If the proposed filters have zero DC, then the probability distribution of filter outputs (and hence the output Kurtosis) is well predicted simply from these effects of variable local variance. This suggests that finding filters with high output Kurtosis does not necessarily signal interesting image structure. It is then argued that finding filters that maximize output Kurtosis generates filters that are incompatible with observed physiology. In particular the optimal difference-of-Gaussian (DOG) filter should have the smallest possible scale, an on-centre off-surround cell should have a negative DC, and that the ratio of centre width to surround width should approach unity. This is incompatible with the physiology. Further, it is also predicted that oriented filters should always be oriented in the vertical direction, and of all the filters tested, the filter with the highest output Kurtosis has the lowest signal-to-noise ratio (the filter is simply the difference of two neighbouring pixels). Whilst these observations are not incompatible with the brain using a sparse representation, it does argue that little significance should be placed on finding filters with highly Kurtotic output distributions. It is therefore argued that other constraints are required in order to understand the development of visual receptive fields."

Theoretical and experimental results have shown that these models provide an extremely rich framework for representing both processes which are intrinsically multiscale, e.g., 1/f processes, as well as 1D Markov processes and 2D Markov random fields. Moreover, efficient optimal estimation algorithms have been developed for these models by exploiting their scale-recursive structure. The authors exploit this structure in order to develop a computationally efficient and parallelizable algorithm for likelihood calculation. They illustrate one possible application to texture discrimination and demonstrate that likelihood-based methods using the algorithm achieve performance comparable to that of Gaussian Markov random field based techniques, which in general are prohibitively complex computationally."

Each lter from this class maintains robust optimal estimates of the input process's hidden state by allowing the measurement covariance matrix to be a non-linear function of the prediction errors. This endows the lter with the ability to reject outliers in the input stream. Simultaneously, the lter also learns an internal model of input dynamics by adapting its measurement and state transition matrices using two additional Kalman lter-based adaptation rules. We present experimental results demonstrating the eecacy of such lters in mediating appearance-based segmentation and recognition of objects and image sequences in the presence of varying degrees of occlusion, clutter, and noise."

The operation is such as to minimize reconstruction error, both for individual patterns, and over the entire training set. A key difference from networks which perform principal components analysis, or one of its variants, is the ability to converge to non-orthogonal weight values. We discuss the network's operation in relation to the twin goals of maximizing information transfer and minimizing code entropy, and show how the assignment of prior probabilities to network outputs can help to reduce entropy. We present results from two binary coding problems, and from experiments with image coding."

The problem considered is that of a rigid body undergoing unknown rotational and translational motion. The measurement data consists of a sequence of noisy image coordinates of two or more object correspondence points. By modeling the object dynamics as a function of time, estimates of the model parameters (including motion parameters) can be extracted from the data using recursive and/or batch techniques. This permits a desired degree of smoothing to be achieved through the use of an arbitrarily large number of images. Some assumptions regarding object structure are presently made. Results are presented for a recursive estimation procedure: the case considered here is that of a sequence of one dimensional images of a two dimensional object. Thus, the object moves in one transverse dimension, and in depth, preserving the fundamental ambiguity of the central projection image model (loss of depth information). An iterated extended Kalman filter is used for the recursive solution. Noise levels of 5-10 percent of the object image size are used. Approximate Cramer-Rao lower bounds are derived for the model parameter estimates as a function of object trajectory and noise level. This approach may be of use in situations where it is difficult to resolve large numbers of object match points, but relatively long sequences of images (10 to 20 or more) are available."

Often the parameters used in these networks need to be learned from examples. Unfortunately, estimating the parameters via exact probabilistic calculations (i.e, the EM-algorithm) is intractable even for networks with fairly small numbers of hidden units. We propose to avoid the infeasibility of the E step by bounding likelihoods instead of computing them exactly. We introduce extended and complementary representations for these networks and show that the estimation of the network parameters can be made fast (reduced to quadratic optimization) by performing the estimation in either of the alternative domains. The complementary networks can be used for continuous density estimation as well."

One of the major reasons why speech models, based on Markov chains, have not been developed until recently was the lack of a method for optimizing the parameters of the Markov model to match observed signal patterns. Such a method was proposed in the late 1960's and was immediately applied to speech processing in several research institutions. Continued refinements in the theory and implementation of Markov modelling techniques have greatly enhanced the method, leading to a wide range of applications of these models. It is the purpose of this tutorial paper to give an introduction to the theory of Markov models, and to illustrate how they have been applied to problems in speech recognition."

Unlike the hard k-means clustering algorithm and the soft mixture model, each of which assumes that a single hidden event generates each data point, a multiple cause model accounts for observed data by combining assertions from many hidden causes, each of which can pertain to varying degree to any subset of the observable dimensions. We employ an objective function and iterative gradient descent learning algorithm resembling the conventional mixture model. A crucial issue is the mixing function for combining beliefs from different cluster centers in order to generate data predictions whose errors are minimized both during recognition and learning. The mixing function constitutes a prior assumption about underlying structural regularities of the data domain; we demonstrate a weakness inherent to the popular weighted sum followed by sigmoid squashing, and offer alternative forms of the nonlinearity for two types of data domain. Results are presented demonstrating the algorithm's ability successfully to discover coherent multiple causal representations in several experimental data sets."

                "text": "We had previously shown that regularization principles lead to approximation schemes that are equivalent to networks with one layer of hidden units, called regularization networks. In particular, standard smoothness functionals lead to a subclass of regularization networks, the well known radial basis functions approximation schemes. This paper shows that regularization networks encompass a much broader range of approximation schemes, including many of the popular general additive models and some of the neural networks. In particular, we introduce new classes of smoothness functionals that lead to different classes of basis functions. Additive splines as well as some tensor product splines can be obtained from appropriate classes of smoothness functionals. Furthermore, the same generalization that extends radial basis functions (RBF) to hyper basis functions (HBF) also leads from additive models to ridge approximation models, containing as special cases Breiman's hinge functions, some forms of projection pursuit regression, and several types of neural networks. We propose to use the term generalized regularization networks for this broad class of approximation schemes that follow from an extension of regularization. In the probabilistic interpretation of regularization, the different classes of basis functions correspond to different classes of prior probabilities on the approximating function spaces, and therefore to different types of smoothness assumptions. In summary, different multilayer networks with one hidden layer, which we collectively call generalized regularization networks, correspond to different classes of priors and associated smoothness functionals in a classical regularization principle. Three broad classes are (1) radial basis functions that can be generalized to hyper basis functions, (2) some tensor product splines, and (3) additive splines that can be generalized to schemes of the type of ridge approximation, hinge functions, and several perceptron-like neural networks with one hidden layer."

In particular multiscale signal representations lead naturally to pyramidal or tree-like data structures in which each level in the tree corresponds to a particular scale of representation. A class of multiscale dynamic models evolving on dyadic trees is introduced. The main focus of this paper is on the description, analysis, and application of an extremely efficient optimal estimation algorithm for this class of models. This algorithm consists of a fine-to-coarse filtering sweep, followed by a coarse-to-fine smoothing step, corresponding to the dyadic tree generalization of Kalman filtering and Rauch-Tung-Striebel smoothing. The Kalman filtering sweep consists of the recursive application of three steps: a measurement update step, a fine-to-coarse prediction step, and a fusion step. We illustrate the use of our methodology for the fusion of multiresolution data and for the efficient solution of \"fractal regularizations\" of ill-posed signal and image processing problems encountered. >"

The primary goal of an unsupervised learning procedure is to optimize the quality of a system's internal representation. In this thesis, we present a general framework for describing unsupervised learning procedures based on the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle. The MDL principle states that the best model is one that minimizes the summed description length of the model and the data with respect to the model. Applying this approach to the unsupervised learning problem makes explicit a key trade off between the accuracy of a representation (i.e., how concise a description of the input may be generated from it) and its succinctness (i.e., how compactly the representation itself can be described). \nViewing existing unsupervised learning procedures in terms of the framework exposes their implicit assumptions about the type of structure assumed to underlie the data. While these existing algorithms typically minimize the data description using a fixed length representation, we use the framework to derive a class of objective functions for training self-supervised neural networks, where the goal is to minimize the description length of the representation simultaneously with that of the data. Formulating a description of the representation forces assumptions about the structure of the data to be made explicit, which in turn leads to a particular network configuration as well as an objective function that can be used to optimize the network parameters. We describe three new learning algorithms derived in this manner from the MDL framework. Each algorithm embodies a different scheme for describing the internal representation, and is therefore suited to a range of datasets based on the structure underlying the data. Simulations demonstrate the applicability of these algorithms on some simple computational vision tasks."

In this paper they present a detailed system-theoretic analysis of this filter and of the new scale-recursive Riccati equation associated with it. While this analysis is similar in spirit to that for standard Kalman filters, the structure of the dyadic tree leads to several significant differences. In particular, the structure of the Kalman filter error dynamics leads to the formulation of an ML version of the filtering equation and to a corresponding smoothing algorithm based on triangularizing the Hamiltonian for the smoothing problem. In addition, the notion of stability for dynamics requires some care as do the concepts of reachability and observability. Using these system-theoretic constructs, the stability and steady-state behavior of the fine-to-coarse Kalman filter and its Riccati equation are analysed. >"

These transforms are conjoint spatial/spectral representations, which provide a complete image description in terms of locally windowed 2-D spectral coordinates embedded within global 2-D spatial coordinates. In the present neural network approach, based on interlaminar interactions involving two layers with fixed weights and one layer with adjustable weights, the network finds coefficients for complete conjoint 2-D Gabor transforms without restrictive conditions. In wavelet expansions based on a biologically inspired log-polar ensemble of dilations, rotations, and translations of a single underlying 2-D Gabor wavelet template, image compression is illustrated with ratios up to 20:1. Also demonstrated is image segmentation based on the clustering of coefficients in the complete 2-D Gabor transform. >"

Simple versions of this approach include penalizing the sum of the squares of the weights or penalizing the number of nonzero weights. We propose a more complicated penalty term in which the distribution of weight values is modeled as a mixture of multiple gaussians. A set of weights is simple if the weights have high probability density under the mixture model. This can be achieved by clustering the weights into subsets with the weights in each cluster having very similar values. Since we do not know the appropriate means or variances of the clusters in advance, we allow the parameters of the mixture model to adapt at the same time as the network learns. Simulations on two different problems demonstrate that this complexity term is more effective than previous complexity terms."

The solution of this \"variance equation\" completely specifies the optimal filter for either finite or infinite smoothing intervals and stationary or nonstationary statistics. The variance equation is closely related to the Hamiltonian (canonical) differential equations of the calculus of variations. Analytic solutions are available in some cases. The significance of the variance equation is illustrated by examples which duplicate, simplify, or extend earlier results in this field. The Duality Principle relating stochastic estimation and deterministic control problems plays an important role in the proof of theoretical results. In several examples, the estimation problem and its dual are discussed side-by-side. Properties of the variance equation are of great interest in the theory of adaptive systems. Some aspects of this are considered briefly."

Such a frane nay be established by tracking the movements of objects in the local environment of the robot and using the data so obtained to deduce the motion of the observer. In a marine context, where currents make it impossible to hold a vehicle stationary for any extended period, it is important to track the vehicle and object motion continuously in real time. In this paper the problem of establishing a stationary reference frame using noisy, specular, intermittent sonar data is discussed and a computational method for its solution is presented. The nethod has been tested by computer simulation in a two dimensional context and an evaluation of its performance is given. The solution presented is not restricted to marine vehicles but is especially effective for land-based vehicles, where operating conditions are less severe."

Journal of Symbolic Logic Written by two experts in the field, this is the only comprehensive and unified treatment of the central ideas and their applications of Kolmogorov complexity. The book presents a thorough treatment of the subject with a wide range of illustrative applications. Such applications include the randomness of finite objects or infinite sequences, Martin-Loef tests for randomness, information theory, computational learning theory, the complexity of algorithms, and the thermodynamics of computing. It will be ideal for advanced undergraduate students, graduate students, and researchers in computer science, mathematics, cognitive sciences, philosophy, artificial intelligence, statistics, and physics. The book is self-contained in that it contains the basic requirements from mathematics and computer science. Included are also numerous problem sets, comments, source references, and hints to solutions of problems. New topics in this edition include Omega numbers, KolmogorovLoveland randomness, universal learning, communication complexity, Kolmogorov's random graphs, time-limited universal distribution, Shannon information and others."

                "text": "art remains most strongly associated with painting, and the Southwest holds a particular beginning point in Native art history with the introduction of painting by Dorothy Dunn in the 1930s and the \u201cSouthwest studio\u201d style that was its outgrowth. From interventionist forms of artistic assimilation such as Dunn\u2019s, new generations of painters emerged, first following then later breaking with the \u201cstudio\u201d style guidelines and prescriptions. Among the earliest painters to rise to prominence was Joe Herrera (b. 1923), who drew from his Cochiti and San Ildefonso roots, especially the influence of his mother, Tonita Pena, a self-taught watercolorist. Herrera wed his own tribal traditions with those of the Studio School and the Euro-American modernists of the 1950s to create a powerful synthesis in form and popular reception. By the 1960s, the melding of political claims with art genres ushered in an activist consciousness that found artistic expression in the establishment of the IAIA in Santa Fe. The consideration and assertion of an American Indian identity as integral to the artwork is both politicized and legitimated by artists and art consumers who deem the notion important to modern art forms created and sold today. Within the contemporary art market, the representation of a recognizable style that reflects a specific geographical location is one way to localize Southwestern art. For example, Shonto Begay ( Din\u00e9) is a postimpressionistic painter whose work often centers on the subject of contemporary Din\u00e9 reality, such as his depictions of the family-centered drive from the reservation in Arizona to the off-reservation town of Gallup, New Mexico. This school of \u201cDin\u00e9 realism\u201d is unique to the Southwestern Indian art market.

They are used in applications in Chapter 2. I expect to cover Chapters 2-5 plus portions of 6 and 7. You are encouraged to read ahead. In lectures I will not be able to cover every topic and example in Ross, and conversely, I may cover some topics/examples in lectures that are not treated in Ross.

Pol and Gasparini (2009) matrix was composed of characters developed from other authors, e.g., Clark (1994). Furthermore, Clark (2011) expanded on Pol and Gasparini (2009) matrix with four additional characters (258\u2013262). This study further expands on this matrix with the addition of 1 character (char. 263) describing the position of the choana relative to the suborbital fenestra, and the connection between choana and palatal fenestra. Also, characters 258 and 200 were amended to include more specific information concerning the palatines contact with other elements, size and sculpturing.

In these experiments, subjects were given the primary task of remembering an image, but they were also informed that changes might be introduced in the image as they examine it. They were asked to press a button when they detected a change. During a given trial, parts of the image was changed during certain saccades. Surprisingly, the subjects were remarkably unaware of such prominent changes as the addition or deletion of objects and changes in color. The remarkable insensitivity of human subjects to changes in the image during \u201cfree viewing\u201d might appear to contradict the present model since, after all, a change in the image from a previous fixation should introduce a large residual and hence direct the subject\u2019s attention to it.6 Recent experiments in our laboratory (Ballard, Hayhoe, Pook, & Rao, in press) and in McConkie\u2019s laboratory (Irwin, McConkie, Carlson-Radvansky, & Currie, 1994) in fact do corroborate this expectation: Subjects do indeed become aware of the changes if the object that was subject to a change was relevant to the task at hand. For example, Ballard et al. (in press) report an increase in fixation time of subjects whenever task-relevant changes are introduced during the course of a block copying task. In addition, neurophysiological experiments by Miller et al. (1991) indicate that responses in IT neurons in the monkey are attenuated according to whether the presented stimulus matches a previously memorized object, yielding large responses (residuals) during mismatches and response suppression (small residuals) during matches."

The model proposed in this paper avoids the pitfalls of steepest descent relaxation algorithms by employing prediction weights V and approximate inverse models (as given by W) in the feed forward pathway that allow rapid (though perhaps crude and not always correct) one-shot estimates of static stimuli that are further refined by the state estimation algorithm if necessary. Inverse models also playa crucial role in the forward/inverse optics model of [Kawato et ai., 1993] and in the Helmholtz machine [Dayan et aI."
