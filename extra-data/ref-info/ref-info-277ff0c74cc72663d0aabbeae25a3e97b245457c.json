For small s this is a considerable improvement over the best previously known algorithm that needs time and space 0(mn). If the editing sequence is not required, the space complexity of our algorithm reduces to 0(s).

Tree pattern matching is an interesting special problem which occurs as a crucial step m a number of programmmg tasks, for instance, design of interpreters for nonprocedural programming languages, automatic implementations of abstract data types, code optimization m compilers, symbohc computation, context searching in structure editors, and automatic theorem provmg. As with the sorting problem, the variations in requirements and resources for each application seem to preclude a uniform, umversal solution to the tree-pattern-matching problem. Instead, a collection of well-analyzed techmques, from which specific applications may be selected and adapted, should be sought. Five new techniques for tree pattern matching are presented, analyzed for time and space complexity, and compared with previously known methods. Particularly important are applications where the same patterns are matched against many subjects and where a subject may be modified incrementally Therefore, methods which spend some tune preprocessmg patterns in order to improve the actual matching time are included"

Given a text of length n, a pattern of length m and an integer k, we present parallel and serial algorithms for finding all occurrences of the pattern in the text with at most k differences. The first part of the parallel algorithm consists of analysis of the pattern and takes 0 (log m ) time using m 2 processors. The rest of the algorithm consists of handling the text. The text han1.

Our results show that the expression of the lambda cIII gene is subject to specific requirements. Tests of a set of cIII-lacZ gene and operon fusions reveal that a sequence upstream of the cIII ribosome binding site is needed for cIII translation. The sequence contains an inefficient RNase III processing site. Furthermore, expression of cIII is drastically reduced in cells lacking RNase III. We have isolated a phage carrying a mutation (r1), which lies in the upstream sequence, that leads to a reduction in cIII translation and inactivates the RNase III processing site. The r1 mutant is nevertheless still dependent on RNase III for cIII translation; r1 reduces cIII translation by a factor of 3 in wild-type cells and by a factor of approximately equal to 30 in an RNase III mutant host. We propose that RNase III stimulates cIII translation by binding to the upstream sequence and thereby exposing the cIII ribosome binding site. This stimulation does not involve RNA cleavage. Consistent with this hypothesis is our finding that, in vitro, unprocessed cIII mRNA is translated, whereas RNase III-cleaved cIII mRNA is not."
