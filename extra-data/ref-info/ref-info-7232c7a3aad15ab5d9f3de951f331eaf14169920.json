The recognition and localization process is structured as the development and pruning of a tree of consistent hypotheses about pairings between contact points and object surfaces. In this paper, we deal with polyhedral objects constrained to lie on a known plane, i.e., having three degrees of positioning freedom relative to the sensors.

                "text": "Computational theories of structure-from-motion and stereo vision only specify the computation of three-dimensional surface information at special points in the image. Yet the visual perception is clearly of complete surfaces. To account for this a computational theory of the interpolation of surfaces from visual information is presented. The problem is constrained by the fact that the surface must agree with the information from stereo or motion correspondence, and not vary radically between these points. Using the image irradiance equation, an explicit form of this surface consistency constraint can be derived. To determine which of two possible surfaces is more consistent with the surface consistency constraint, one must be able to compare the two surfaces. To do this, a functional from the space of possible functions to the real numbers is required. In this way, the surface most consistent with the visual information will be that which minimizes the functional. To ensure that the functional has a unique minimal surface, conditions on the form of the functional are derived. In particular, if the functional is a complete semi-norm that satisfies the parallelogram law, or the space of functions is a semi-Hilbert space and the functional is a semi-inner product, then there is a unique (to within possibly an element of the null space of the functional) surface that is most consistent with the visual information. It can be shown, based on the above conditions plus a condition of rotational symmetry, that there is a vector space of possible functionals that measure surface consistency, this vector space being spanned by the functional of quadratic variation and the functional of square Laplacian. Arguments based on the null spaces of the respective functionals are used to justify the choice of the quadratic variation as the optimal functional. Possible refinements to the theory, concerning the role of discontinuities in depth and the effects of applying the interpolation process to scenes containing more than one object, are discussed."

In the proposed recognition method, an object is recognized as a pile of two-dimensional slices, namely, a pile of plane closed curves. Each curve (i.e., contour) is described as the distribution pattern of unit-vectors, called the unit-vector distribution (UVD). The proposed recognition method using UVD functions is as follows. 1) Given the a priori information about the contours of objects to be grasped, the UVD's of their contours are calculated and memorized. These are called the original patterns (OP's). 2) Then a sampled UVD is formed from real tactile data and called the data pattern (DP). 3) The DP is compared with the memorized patterns (MP's), which are obtained by blurring the corresponding OP, so as to make it easier to single out the best fitted OP. 4) Finally, the contour is regenerated in the hand coordinate system by using the UVD of the singled out pattern. An experiment using a trial sensor and a model hand has shown the effectiveness of the proposed method in the recognition of several kinds of objects having cylindrical and prismatic contours."

In the learning phase, a scene containing a single object is shown one at a time. The range data of a scene are obtained by a range finder. The description of each scene is built in terms of properties of regions and relations between them. This description is stored as an object model. In the recognition phase, an unknown scene is described in the same way as in the learning phase. Then the description is matched to the object models so that the stacked objects are recognized sequentially. Efficient matching is achieved by a combination of data-driven and model-driven search processes. Experimental results for blocks and machine parts are shown."

With the increasing demand for 3-D spatial information for tasks of passive navigation [7,12], automatic surveillance [9], aerial cartography [10,13], and inspection in industrial automation, the importance of effective stereo analysis has been made quite clear. A particular challenge is to provide reliable and accurate depth data for input to object or terrain modelling systems (such as [5]. This paper describes an algorithm for such stereo sensing It uses an edge-based line-by-line stereo correlation scheme, and appears to be fast, robust, and parallel implementable. The processing consists of extracting edge descriptions for a stereo pair of images, linking these edges to their nearest neighbors to obtain the edge connectivity structure, correlating the edge descriptions on the basis of local edge properties, then cooperatively removmg those edge correspondences determined to be in error - those which violate the connectivity structure of the two images.

The approach is to use three-dimensional models of the objects to find them in range data. The matching strategy starts with a distinctive edge feature, such as the edge at the end of a cylindrical part, and then \"grows\" a match by add ing compatible features one at a time. (The order of features to be considered is predetermined by an interactive, off-line, feature-selection process.) Once a sufficient number of com patible features has been detected to allow a hypothesis to be formed, the verification procedure evaluates it by comparing the measured range data with data predicted according to the hypothesis. When all the objects in the scene have been hy pothesized and verified in this manner, a configuration- understanding procedure determines which objects are on top of others by analyzing the patterns of range data predicted from all the hypotheses. We also present experimental results of the system's performance in recognizing and locating castings in a bin."

Equations are derived to relate the mean and variance of both the intensity and the range data to the physical properties of the target and the parameters of the sensor. Experimental results that verify these equations are given. Adaptive data smoothing and normalization procedures are presented. These procedures reduce photon noise and correct the intensity data for inverse square-law effects. The resulting intensity data give the product of the diffuse surface reflectance and the cosine of the angle of incidence for each picture element in the scene. Simple procedures are given for finding outlines of occluding objects, obtaining normal views of obliquely sensed planar surfaces, and extracting the images of horizontal surface regions from a scene. These procedures demonstrate the advantages of having registered reflectance and range data for scene analysis."

The idea of photometric stereo is to vary the direction of incident illumination between successive images, while holding the viewing direction constant. It is shown that this provides sufficient information to determine surface orientation at each image point. Since the imaging geometry is not changed, the correspondence between image points is known a priori. The technique is photometric because it uses the radiance values recorded at a single image location, in successive views, rather than the relative positions of displaced features. Photometric stereo is used in computer-based image understanding. It can be applied in two ways. First, it is a general technique for deter-mining surface orientation at each image point. Second, it is a technique for determining object points that have a particular surface orientation. These applications are illustrated using synthesized examples."

The mechanical hand of the future will be able to roll a screw between its fingers and sense, by touch, which end is which. This paper describes a step toward such a manipulator, an imaging tactile sensor with hundreds of pressure sensors in a space the size of a fingertip. The sensor was designed as part of a tendon-actuated mechan ical finger, similar in size and range of motion to a human index finger (Hillis 1981). As a demonstration, the device was programmed to distinguish among several commonly used fastening devices\u2014nuts, bolts, flat washers, lock washers, dowel pins, cotter pins, and set screws\u2014by touching them with the finger and analyzing the tactile image. This paper describes how the tactile sensor array was constructed and how it works. The simple pattern- recognition techniques used in the demonstration program are also outlined. The final section notes some promising directions for future research."

Two basic tools are employed: the photometric stereo method and the extended Gaussian image. The photometric stereo method generates the surface normal distribution of a scene. The extended Gaussian image allows us to determine the attitude of the object based on the normal distribution. visual analysis of an image consists of two stages. The first stage segments the image into regions and determines the target region.The photometric stereo system provides the surface normal distribution of the scene. The sytem segments the scene into isolated regions using ghe surface normal distribution rathan than the brightness distribuiton. The second stage determines the object attitude and position by comparing the surface normal distribution with the extended-Gaussian-image. Fingers, with LED sensor, mounted on the PUMA arm can successfully pick an object from a pile based on the information from the vision part. (Author)"

The idea of photometric stereo is to vary the direction of the incident illumination between successive views while holding the viewing direction constant. This provides enough information to determine surface orientation at each picture element. Traditional stereo techniques determine range by relating two images of an object viewed from different directions. If the correspondence between picture elements is known, then distance to the object can be calculated by triangulation. Unfortunately, it is difficult to determine this correspondence. In photometric stereo, the imaging geometry does not change. Therefore, the correspondence between picture elements is known a priori. This stereo technique is photometric because it uses the intensity values recorded at a single picture element, in successive views, rather than the relative positions of features."

                "text": "Recently, Marr & Poggio (1979) presented a theory of human stereo vision. An implementation of that theory is presented, and consists of five steps. (i) The left and right images are each filtered with masks of four sizes that increase with eccentricity; the shape of these masks is given by delta 2G, the Laplacian of a Gaussian function. (ii) Zero crossings in the filtered images are found along horizontal scan lines. (iii) For each mask size, matching takes place between zero crossings of the same sign and roughly the same orientation in the two images, for a range of disparities up to about the width of the mask's central region. Within this disparity range, it can be shown that false targets pose only a simple problem. (iv) The output of the wide masks can control vergence movements, thus causing small masks to come into correspondence. In this way, the matching process gradually moves from dealing with large disparities at a low resolution to dealing with small disparities at a high resolution. (v) When a correspondence is achieved, it is stored in a dynamic buffer, called the 2 1/2-dimensional sketch. To support the adequacy of the Marr-Poggio model of human stereo vision, the implementation was tested on a wide range of stereograms from the human stereopsis literature. The performance of the implementation is illustrated and compared with human perception. Also statistical assumptions made by Marr & Poggio are supported by comparison with statistics found in practice. Finally, the process of implementing the theory has led to the clarification and refinement of a number of details within the theory; these are discussed in detail."

We describe a device that is at once a special-purpose parallel computer and a high-resolution tactile array sen sor. The passive substrates of earlier tactile sensors have been replaced with a custom-designed very large scale in tegration (VLSI) device that performs transduction, tactile image processing, and communication. Forces are trans duced using a conductive plastic technique in conjunction with metal electrodes on the surface of an integrated cir cuit. An array of processors implemented within the inte grated circuit perform parallel two-dimensional convolu tions between programmable filtering masks and a binary tactile image. Data are then read from the array serially, so they can be transmitted to a control computer. A 6 x 3 array sensor with 1 mm2 tactile cells has been designed and tested. It is fully functional. In preparation for constructing large sensor arrays with hundreds of elements, the possibility of constructing defect tolerant tactile cells was explored. Analyses based on the Poisson model indicate that working arrays with 1,000 functional cells are possible if computing elements are rep licated within each tactile cell. Experiments on a 3 x 3 array sensor with redundant pairs of computing elements suggest that large tactile sensing arrays are within reach."

The approach presented here is based on characterizing the position and orientation of an object as a single point in a configuration space, in which each coordinate represents a degree of freedom in the position or orientation of the object. The configurations forbidden to this object, due to the presence of other objects, can then be characterized as regions in the configuration space, called configuration space obstacles.

                "text": "A smooth opaque object produces an image in which brightness varies spatially even if the object is illuminated evenly and is covered by a surface material with uniform optical properties. Photometric methods relate image irradiance to object shape and surface material using physical models of the way surfaces reflect light. A reflectance map allows image irradiance to be written as a function of surface orientation, for a given surface material and light source distribution. Shape from shading algorithms use a reflectance map to analyze what is seen. The development of photometric methods for determining shape from shading is discussed, beginning with examples from lunar astronomy. The results presented delineate shape information that can be determined from geometric measurements at object boundaries from shape information that can be determined from intensity measurements over sections of smooth surface. Recent work of Ikeuchi and Horn is presented which relaxes the requirement that the image irradiance equation be satisfied exactly. Instead, the image irradiance equation specifies one constraint that is combined with another constraint derived from general surface smoothness criteria. Shape from shading is expressed as a constrained minimization problem. Another method uses multiple images in a technique called photometric stereo. In photometric stereo, the illumination is varied between successive images while the viewing direction remains constant. Multiple images obtained in this way provide enough information to determine surface orientation at each image point, without smoothness assumptions."

It presents a compact relational structure representation derived by generalizing the properties of objects. Objects are described by means of surface primitives (basic descriptive elements) and relations between the primitives. The essence of the representation is the use of a single primitive to describe all identical parts. The representation involves abstracting properties of individual scene elements. Similarly, relations between parts of objects that hold for particular instances of the objects are generalized to ensure that they will be valid for all instances. Common primitives and relations are shared both within and across models. This leads to a compact representation that has many desirable properties. A computer implementation of a version of the representation has been developed. It is used to illustrate the descriptive power of the representation. A recognition system has been developed that takes advantage of the representation in its operation. It is described elsewhere (Shneier (1977), Shneier (1978))."

The data consist of the mass spectrum and the empirical formula of an organic chemical compound. The hypotheses which are produced describe molecular structures which are plausible explanations of the data. The hypotheses are generated systematically within the program's theory of chemical stability and within limiting constraints which are inferred from the data by heuristic rules. The program excludes hypotheses inconsistent with the data and lists its candidate explanatory hypotheses in order of decreasing plausibility. The computer program is heuristic in that it searches for plausible hypotheses in a small subset of the total hypothesis space according to heuristic rules learned from chemists. (Author)"
