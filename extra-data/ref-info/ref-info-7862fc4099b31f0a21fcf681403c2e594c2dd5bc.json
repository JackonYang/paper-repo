The algorithms which will be examined are the spatial gray level dependence method (SGLDM), the gray level run length method (GLRLM), the gray level difference method (GLDM), and the power spectral method (PSM). The evaluation procedure employed does not depend on the set of features used with each algorithm or the pattern recognition scheme. Rather, what is examined is the amount of texturecontext information contained in the spatial gray level dependence matrices, the gray level run length matrices, the gray level difference density functions, and the power spectrum. The comparison will be performed in two steps. First, only Markov generated textures will be considered. The Markov textures employed are similar to the ones used by perceptual psychologist B. Julesz in his investigations of human texture perception. These Markov textures provide a convenient mechanism for generating certain example texture pairs which are important in the analysis process. In the second part of the analysis the results obtained by considering only Markov textures will be extended to all textures which can be represented by translation stationary random fields of order two. This generalization clearly includes a much broader class of textures than Markovian ones. The results obtained indicate that the SGLDM is the most powerful algorithm of the four considered, and that the GLDM is more powerful than the PSM."

This paper describes extensions of this algorithm in the areas of texture simulation and lighting models. The parametrization of a patch defines a coordinate system which is used as a key for mapping patterns onto the surface. The intensity of the pattern at each picture element is computed as a weighted average of regions of the pattern definition function. The shape and size of this weighting function are chosen using digital signal processing theory. The patch rendering algorithm allows accurate computation of the surface normal to the patch at each picture element, permitting the simulation of mirror reflections. The amount of light coming from a given direction is modeled in a similar manner to the texture mapping and then added to the intensity obtained from the texture mapping. Several examples of images synthesized using these new techniques are included."

They are not so realistic, however, that they would fool many people into believing they are real. One problem is that the surfaces tend to look artificial due to their extreme smoothness. What is needed is a means of simulating the surface irregularities that are on real surfaces. In 1973 Ed Catmull introduced the idea of using the parameter values of parametrically defined surfaces to index into a texture definition function which scales the intensity of the reflected light. By tying the texture pattern to the parameter values, the texture is guaranteed to rotate and move with the object. This is good for showing patterns painted on the surface, but attempts to simulate rough surfaces in this way are unconvincing. This paper presents a method of using a texturing function to perform a small perturbation on the direction of the surface normal before using it in the intensity calculations. This process yields images with realistic looking surface wrinkles without the need to model each wrinkle as a separate surface element. Several samples of images made with this technique are included."

An optimal recipe for classifying such patterns is described. It combines the use of an orthonormal expansion for the logarithm of probability functions, with the generation of a joint probability distribution from lower-order marginals. The unwieldy nature of the optimal recipe leads to the consideration of dependence represented by a Markov chain and a two-dimensional analog called a Markov mesh. The Markov chain has a \"reflecting\" property in that the r th order nonstationary chain implies that a point depends on its r nearest neighbors on each side. By scanning along a grid-filling curve so that the 2r neighbors of a point are geometrically close to it, certain spatial dependencies are obtained. The grid-filling curves are sequences of functions which have Hilbert \"space-filling\" curves as their limit. This simple approach does not provide for many of the spatial dependencies that should be considered. A novel extension of Markov chain methods into two dimensions leads to the Markov mesh which economically takes care of a much larger class of spatial dependencies. Likelihood ratio classification based on Markov chain and Markov mesh assumptions requires the estimation of a much smaller number of parameters than the general case. The development presented in this paper is new and need not be restricted to binary variables."

                "text": "An introduction is given to a theory of early visual information processing. The theory has been implemented, and examples are given of images at various stages of analysis. It is argued that the first step of consequence is to compute a primitive but rich description of the grey-level changes present in an image. The description is expressed in a vocabulary of kinds of intensity change (EDGE, SHADING-EDGE, EXTENDED-EDGE, LINE, BLOB etc.). Modifying parameters are bound to the elements in the description, specifying their POSITION, ORIENTATION, TERMINATION points, CONTRAST, SIZE and FUZZINESS. This description is obtained from the intensity array by fixed techniques, and it is called the primal sketch. For most images, the primal sketch is large and unwieldy. The second important step in visual information processing is to group its contents in a way that is appropriate for later recognition. From our ability to interpret drawings with little semantic content, one may infer the presence in our perceptual equipment of symbolic processes that can define \"place-tokens\" in an image in various ways, and can group them according to certain rules. Homomorphic techniques fail to account for many of these grouping phenomena, whose explanations require mechanisms of construction rather than mechanisms of detection. The necessary grouping of elements in the primal sketch may be achieved by a mechanism that has available the processes inferred from above, together with the ability to select items by first order discriminations acting on the elements' parameters. Only occasionally do these mechanisms use downward-flowing information about the contents of the particular image being processed. It is argued that \"non-attentive\" vision is in practice implemented by these grouping operations and first order discriminations acting on the primal sketch. The class of computations so obtained differs slightly from the class of second order operations on the intensity array. The extraction of a form from the primal sketch using these techniques amounts to the separation of figure from ground. It is concluded that most of the separation can be carried out by using techniques that do not depend upon the particular image in question. Therefore, figure-ground separation can normally precede the description of the shape of the extracted form. Up to this point, higher-level knowledge and purpose are brought to bear on only a few of the decisions taken during the processing. This relegates the widespread use of downward-flowing information to a later stage than is found in current machine-vision programs, and implies that such knowledge should influence the control of, rather than interfering with, the actual data-processing that is taking place lower down."

This paper describes some easily computable textural features based on gray-tone spatial dependancies, and illustrates their application in category-identification tasks of three different kinds of image data: photomicrographs of five kinds of sandstones, 1:20 000 panchromatic aerial photographs of eight land-use categories, and Earth Resources Technology Satellite (ERTS) multispecial imagery containing seven land-use categories. We use two kinds of decision rules: one for which the decision regions are convex polyhedra (a piecewise linear decision rule), and one for which the decision regions are rectangular parallelpipeds (a min-max decision rule). In each experiment the data set was divided into two parts, a training set and a test set. Test set identification accuracy is 89 percent for the photomicrographs, 82 percent for the aerial photographic imagery, and 83 percent for the satellite imagery. These results indicate that the easily computable textural features probably have a general applicability for a wide variety of image-classification applications."

Usually the procedure is to perform some inverse mapping from the area of the pixel onto the surface texture. It is difficult to do this correctly. There is an alternate approach where the texture surface is transformed as a 2-D image until it conforms to a projection of a polygon placed arbitrarily in 3-space. The great advantage of this approach is that the 2-D transformation can be decomposed into two simple transforms, one in horizontal and the other in vertical scanline order. horizontal scanline order, Sophisticated light calculation is also time consuming and difficult to calculate correctly on projected polygons. Instead of calculating the lighting based on the position of the polygon, lights, and eye, the lights and eye can be transformed to a corresponding position for a unit square which we can consider to be a canonical polygon. After this canonical polygon is correctly textured and shaded it can be easily conformed to the projection of the 3-D surface."

The system facilitates the generation, manipulation and display of highly detailed data with the aid of interactive devices and a video interface to a standard color TV monitor. The system enables the animator to create a variety of objects (including texture) and to specify the necessary transformations for animation sequences. A run length processing technique combined with a brute force Z-buffer algorithm has been newly designed and implemented that can handle the intersection of several million faces, lines and points. This makes possible a full range of visual cues to simulate fire, smoke, water and complex 3-D texture such as grass, hair and bark. Basic concepts and approaches are described. The display algorithm and the procedure model to generate texture are presented and the implications of the system for computer animation are discussed. Extensions to the system are outlined which include a unique graphics display processor currently under construction that includes a partial implementation of the display algorithm in hardware."

We approximated in computational form six basic textural features, namely, coarseness, contrast, directionality, line-likeness, regularity, and roughness. In comparison with psychological measurements for human subjects, the computational measures gave good correspondences in rank correlation of 16 typical texture patterns. Similarity measurements using these features were attempted. The discrepancies between human vision and computerized techniques that we encountered in this study indicate fundamental problems in digital analysis of textures. Some of them could be overcome by analyzing their causes and using more sophisticated techniques."

The model of the alloy assumes that the structure of the lattice is fixed and that interactions exist between first neighbors and second neighbors only. In most of the calculations detailed consideration is given to an array consisting of five unit cells on an edge (five hundred sites) with periodic boundary conditions. The long-range order and short-range order for first and second neighbors has been computed above and below the Curie Point. Using the conventional energy parameter VAA n + VBB n _ (r ) v = \u2014 V n n 2 AB v for n neighbors it is found that \u2014 = \u20140.25 and v, = 8l6 cal/mole gives the V l best agreement with experiments on Cu_Au.

My contribution to a conference at Sheffield in 1973 aimed, at least in part, to supply such a review and forms the basis of this monograph; but in these prefatory remarks I must still make clear what I decided to discuss, and what I have omitted. Broadly speaking, the coverage is that included in seminars and lectures I have given on this theme since 1969. We may divide problems of spatial pattern (in contrast with complete random chaos) into (i) detecting departures from randomness, Oi) analysing such departures when detected, for example, in relation to some stochastic model and (iii) special problems which require separate consideration; for example, sophisticated problems of pattern recognition in specific fields, such as the computer reading of handwriting or recognition of chromosomes."

The effects of instructional set and order of slant and shape judgments were studied in interaction with four patterns differing in regularity of texture. Judgments of slant and shape were made by the same Ss for all patterns at 20\u00b0, 45\u00b0, 60\u00b0slant for slant judgments and 0\u00b0, 20\u00b0, 45\u00b0, 60\u00b0 for width judgments. There were three instructional groups. Within each group one half of the Ss made slant judgments first, the other half shape judgments first. For all patterns, accurate perception of the slant of patterned material resulted in increased compensation in width judgments. Apparent width was found to be a function of pattern and also subject to instructional manipulation."

The model system is a simple cubic lattice the sites of which are occupied either by A or B particles. There is a nearest neighbor interaction favoring segregation into an A rich and a B rich phase at low temperatures, T less than T/sub c/. Starting from a random configuration, T much greater than T/sub c/, the system is quenched to and evolves at a temperature T less than T/sub c/. The evolution takes place through exchanges between A and B atoms on nearest neighbor sites. The probability of such an exchange is assumed proportional to e/sup -..beta delta..U/ (1 + e/sup -..beta delta..U/)/sup -1/ where ..beta.. = (k/sub B/T)/sup -1/ and ..delta..U is the change in energy resulting from the exchange. In the simulations either a 30 x 30 x 30 or a 50 x 50 x 50 lattice is used with various fractions of the sites occupied by A particles. The evolution of the Fourier transform of the spherically averaged structure function S(k,t), the energy, and the cluster distribution were computed. Comparison is made with variousmore\u00a0\u00bb theories of this process and with some experiments. It is found in particular that the results disagree with the predictions of the linearized Cahn-Hilliard theory of spinodal decomposition. The qualitative form of the results appear to be unaffected if the change in the positions of the atoms takes place via a vacancy mechanism rather than through direct exchanges.\u00ab\u00a0less"

Ross. This is a lively text that covers the basic ideas of probability theory including those needed in statistics. Theoretical concepts are introduced via interesting concrete examples. In 394 I will begin my lectures with the basics of probability theory in Chapter 2. However, your first assignment is to review Chapter 1, which treats elementary counting methods. They are used in applications in Chapter 2. I expect to cover Chapters 2-5 plus portions of 6 and 7. You are encouraged to read ahead. In lectures I will not be able to cover every topic and example in Ross, and conversely, I may cover some topics/examples in lectures that are not treated in Ross. You will be responsible for all material in my lectures, assigned reading, and homework, including supplementary handouts if any."
