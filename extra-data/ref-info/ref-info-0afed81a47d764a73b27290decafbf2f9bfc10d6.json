We examine geometric constraints on stereo correspondence and describe progress toward formulation from first principles of an evaluation function for selection of the best among alternative correspondences. Within a surface interpretation, conditions on correspondence of edges and surface intervals are shown. These conditions are useful with wide angle stereo and provide particularly tight constraints for narrow angle stereo. We invoke the general assumption that edge and surface orientations are not related to observer position. We are combining these general constraints with ongoing work in scene modeling of known regularities which include distributions with respect to the gravity vector (horizontal and vertical edges and surfaces), parallelism and alignment with local coordinate systems, and orthogonal corners. We will use them to calculate a likelihood measure for correspondences."

                "text": "We have developed a new stereo algorithm that goes beyond edge-based and area-based approaches by using an image description that is richer than attributes of edges or pixel-brightness values. The algorithm also incorporates several stereo cues that have previously been neglected in the computer vision literature. \nAny stereo algorithm must have at its core a basic and robust mechanism for establishing correspondence between two images. We use linear spatial filters at a range of scales and orientations that are similar to those known to exist in the visual cortex. Filter responses at a given point characterize the local image patch, providing a more concise representation than traditional correlation-based techniques. A simple similarity measure, motivated by robust statistics, serves as a basis for establishing correspondence between image patches in two views. From initial horizontal and vertical disparity estimates, additional information can be recovered about a scene. The viewing geometry, along with the locations of depth discontinuities and occluded regions, all can be recovered and used to iteratively refine the disparity estimates. \nOrientation and spatial frequency disparities can be related geometrically to the slant and tilt of surfaces in a scene. These cues have traditionally been regarded as noise when determining point correspondences. We have developed two new algorithms for recovering local surface orientation based on orientation and spatial frequency disparities: (1) a least squares algorithm based on measurements of corresponding line segments, and (2) a method that makes use of filter responses directly. The second method has also been shown to account for some previously unexplained psychophysical observations by Tyler and Sutter, and von der Heydt. \nIn primary visual cortex of both macaque monkey and cat, inputs from the two eyes are segregated into alternating zones known as ocular dominance bands. If the striking differences in the overall arrangements of these inputs reflect important differences in the basic rules governing cortical ocular dominance, then this poses a problem for attempts to formulate general principles of visual cortical organization. We have formulated and tested a single computational model that accurately predicts the quite dissimilar ocular dominance pattern in cat and monkey. This model also generalizes to predict the ocular dominance pattern in three-eyed frogs, supporting the notion that the overall pattern of ocular dominance is governed by a common set of rules."

Particularly important is the problem of finding binocular parallax, which involves matching patterns of the left and right visual fields. Stereo pictures of familiar objects or line drawings preclude the separation of interacting cues, and thus this pattern-matching process is difficult to investigate. More insight into the process can be gained by using unfamiliar picture material devoid of all cues except binocular parallax. To this end, artificial stereo picture pairs were generated on a digital computer. When viewed monocularly, they appear completely random, but if viewed binocularly, certain correlated point domains are seen in depth. By introducing distortions in this material and testing for perception of depth, it is possible to show that pattern-matching of corresponding points of the left and right visual fields can be achieved by first combining the two fields and then searching for patterns in the fused field. By this technique, some interesting properties of this fused binocular field are revealed, and a simple analog model is derived. The interaction between the monocular and binocular fields is also describea. A number of stereo images that demonstrate these and other findings are presented."

The framework differs from previous work in that it emphasizes the combination of a large collection of independent measurements. Partial derivatives of images smoothed with a few different-sized Gaussian filters are suggested as suitable measurements. A specific computation is shown based on a stochastic image model to reliably establish whether or not two points correspond, provided that the signal to correspondence noise ratio in the images to be matched exceeds two. The computation has been applied to artificial and natural images with encouraging results. (Author)"

                "text": "This classic work on cyclopean perception has influenced a generation of vision researchers, cognitive scientists, and neuroscientists and has inspired artists, designers, and computer graphics pioneers. In Foundations of Cyclopean Perception (first published in 1971 and unavailable for years), Bela Julesz traced the visual information flow in the brain, analyzing how the brain combines separate images received from the two eyes to produce depth perception. Julesz developed novel tools to do this: random-dot stereograms and cinematograms, generated by early digital computers at Bell Labs. These images, when viewed with the special glasses that came with the book, revealed complex, three-dimensional surfaces; this mode of visual stimulus became a paradigm for research in vision and perception. This reprint edition includes all 48 color random-dot designs from the original, as well as the special 3-D glasses required to view them.Foundations of Cyclopean Perception has had a profound impact on the vision studies community. It was chosen as one of the one hundred most influential works in cognitive science in a poll conducted by the University of Minnesota's Center for Cognitive Sciences. Many copies are \"permanently borrowed\" from college libraries; used copies are sought after online. Now, with this facsimile of the 1971 edition, the book is available again to cognitive scientists, neuroscientists, vision researchers, artists, and designers."
