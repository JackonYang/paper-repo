Documents often contain tables in order to communicate densely packed, multi-dimensional information. Tables do this by employing layout patterns to efficiently indicate fields and records in two-dimensional form.Their rich combination of formatting and content present difficulties for traditional language modeling techniques, however. This paper presents the use of conditional random fields (CRFs) for table extraction, and compares them with hidden Markov models (HMMs). Unlike HMMs, CRFs support the use of many rich and overlapping layout and language features, and as a result, they perform significantly better. We show experimental results on plain-text government statistical reports in which tables are located with 92% F1, and their constituent lines are classified into 12 table-related categories with 94% accuracy. We also discuss future work on undirected graphical models for segmenting columns, finding cells, and classifying them as data cells or label cells."

In this paper we describe a general solution to the problem of recognizing the structure of a detected table region. First hierarchial clustering is used to identify columns and then spatial and lexical criteria to classify headers. We also address the problem of evaluating table structure recognition. Our model is based on a directed acyclic attribute graph, or table DAG. We describe a new paradigm, 'random graph probing,' for comparing the results returned by the recognition system and the representation created during ground-truthing. Probing is in fact a general concept that could be applied to other document recognition tasks and perhaps even other computer vision problems as well."

The scope of the approach is to recognize tables contained in PDF documents as a 2-dimensional grid on a Cartesian plane and extract them as a set of cells equipped by 2-dimensional coordinates. Experiments, carried out on a dataset composed of tables contained in documents coming from different domains, shows that the approach is well performing in recognizing table cells.The approach aims at improving PDF document annotation and information extraction by providing an output that can be further processed for understanding table and document contents."

While everyone seems to know what a table is, a precise, analytical definition of \u201ctabularity\u201d remains elusive because some bureaucratic forms, multicolumn text layouts, and schematic drawings share many characteristics of tables. There are significant differences between typeset tables, electronic files designed for display of tables, and tables in symbolic form intended for information retrieval. Most past research has addressed the extraction of low-level geometric information from raster images of tables scanned from printed documents, although there is growing interest in the processing of tables in electronic form as well. Recent research on table composition and table analysis has improved our understanding of the distinction between the logical and physical structures of tables, and has led to improved formalisms for modeling tables. This review, which is structured in terms of generalized paradigms for table processing, indicates that progress on half-a-dozen specific research issues would open the door to using existing paper and electronic tables for database update, tabular browsing, structured information retrieval through graphical and audio interfaces, multimedia table editing, and platform-independent display."

                "text": "In this paper, we consider the table understanding task and present a catalogue of particular issues that arise when the tables are those found on the web. In addition, we consider what happens when processes commonly associated with web pages are applied to those bearing tables. 1 Table Understanding and the Web The ubiquity of tables, and their ability to describe relational information in a compact and immediate manner make them attractive targets for automated understanding. Recent research into the automatic location, recognition and understanding of tables has demonstrated the viability of integrating automated table processing systems into larger knowledge management applications ([8]). However, table understanding is still a relatively novel research area, one whose definition and terminology are still not fixed. It is useful to break the task down into some subtasks, and to consider them in turn with respect to the understanding of tables delivered on the web. Generally, table processing can be conceptualized as consisting of table location; table recognition; functional and structural analysis; and finally interpretation the extraction of meaningful and unambiguously structured information ([4]). We concentrate on the first two tasks in the following. location table location is the processes of spotting tables in documents. Traditionally, this task comes in two basic forms document image sourced tables ([7], [3]) and electronic text sourced tables including HTML ([1]). The problem is extended to include the spotting of tables in other document encodings such as postscript, pdf, rtf, word, etc. In general, when considering tables on the web, the appropriate HTML tags are exploited (TABLE, TH, TD, etc.). However, this is where we come to the first two distinguishing points. the presence of the TABLE tag in an HTML document does not necessarily indicate the presence of a table ([1] suggest less than 30 % of HTML TABLEs are real tables in one particular domain). there are many other ways in which tables may be presented in web delivered documents plain text (PRE), images, mixtures of table specific tags (TABLE, etc.) and tags used within the table for their functionality in terms of placing text spatially (PRE, LI, etc.) see Figure 1 for an example of such complexities. The first point requires the creation of accurate classification technology. Given any TABLE node in the HTML, the classifier must accept or reject it. Such a classifier may be built either via hand crafted rules ([1]) or using a machine learning approach. Experiments suggest that a machine learning approach using a naive bayse classifier ([9]) based on a feature set describing the set of tags below the potential TABLE node in the document tree produces adequate results. Locating tables encoded in other formats requires technology from other areas. For example, images of tables may be processed by techniques from the document image field ([2]), pre-formatted tables (using the PRE) tag may be processed using plain text table methods ([5]). However, the classification problem extends to these cases and individual classifiers must be constructed to make decisions about document elements of each type. The remaining outstanding issues relate to the mixture of encoding types (e.g. tables built out of TABLE nodes and pre-formatted elements), as well as the mixture of encoding purposes (e.g. the use of the HTML TABLE to encode surrounding text as well as an embedded table). Figure 1. A web page using a mixture of HTML tables (on the left) and images of tables (on the right). recognition table recognition is the task of segmenting the original description of the table into a relative spatial description. In general this task is required when the input is low-level, such as a document image or an electronic text. Clearly, if such tables are found on a web page, the same process is required. Again, given certain assumptions, we can take the marked up tables in a web page to be the logical spatial table. However, there are certain issues that need to be understood in order to account for certain variations: internal cell structure though tags like TH and TD may be assumed to delimit a single cell in the table, there are cases where other non-table tags are used to provide internal structure in such a way as to associate the cell\u2019s contents with those of other cells. A solution would be required to apply a certain amount of recursive processing working into the structure and building a unified abstract table. split cells in order to gain more control over the distribution of the text in a cell, authors occasionally split the text and place it in two or more adjacent cells. This problem may be accommodated by exploiting linguistic process as described in [6] where the content of the cell can be used to indicate continuity, if any, to other cells. errors spanning errors occur when the COLSPAN or ROWSPAN values are not correctly calculated. There are two cases. In the first the cell spans beyond the border of the intended table giving the cell incorrect coordinates. In the second, the span of the cell does not communicate the correct meaning of the cell. For example, a cell that is intended to span three cells below it spans only one leading to ambiguity. The first type of problem may be repaired by some form of normalization, whereas the second requires intelligent processing in order to distinguish the following two cases:"

We propose the Description and Modification of Segmentation (DMOS) method, which is made of a new grammatical language (Enhanced Position Formalism\u2014EPF) and an associated parser able to deal with noise. From an EPF description of a kind of document structure, a new recognition system is produced by compilation. This method has been successfully used to produce recognition systems on musical scores, mathematical formulae and even tennis courts in videos. This DMOS generic method separates knowledge from program. Therefore, for a same kind of document like table structures, it is possible to define with EPF, more or less specific descriptions to produce more or less specific recognition systems. For example, we have been able to produce a general recognition system of table structures. It can recognize the hierarchical organization \nof a table made with rulings, whatever the number/size of column/rows and the deep of the hierarchy contents in it, as soon as the document has a not too bad quality (no missing rulings for example). We will present the way the description is done using EPF to be general enough to recognize very different table organizations. With the same DMOS generic method, we have also been able to easily define a specific recognition system of the table structure of quite damaged military forms of the 19th century. This specific description was necessary to compensate some missing informations concerning the table structure of those military forms, due to a very bad quality or hidden part of the table. This system has been successfully validated on 88,745 images, showing that this DMOS generic method can be used at an industrial level."

Table understanding on the web has many potential applications including web mining, knowledge management, and web content summarization and delivery to narrow-bandwidth devices. Although in HTML documents tables are generally marked as ?table? elements, a ?table? element does not necessarily indicate the presence of a genuine relational table. Thus the important first step in table understanding in the web domain is the detection of the genuine tables. In our earlier work we designed a basic rule-based algorithm to detect genuine tables in major news and corporate home pages as part of a web content filtering system. In this paper we investigate a machine learning based approach that is trainable and thus can be automatically generalized to including any domain. Various features reflecting the layout as well as content characteristics of tables are explored. The system is tested on a large database which consists of 1, 393 HTML files collected from hundreds of different web sites from various domains and contains over 10,000 leaf ?table? elements. Experiments were conducted using the cross validation method. The machine learning based approach outperformed the rule-based system and achieved an F-measure of 95.88%."

T-Recs works on the output of commercial OCR systems that provide the word bounding box geometry together with the text itself (e.g. Xerox ScanWorX). While T-Recs performs well on a number of document categories, business letters still remained a challenging domain because the T-Recs location heuristics are mislead by their header or footer resulting in a low recognition precision. Business letters such as invoices are a very interesting domain for industrial applications due to the large amount of documents to be analyzed and the importance of the data carried within their tables. Hence, we developed a more restrictive approach which is implemented in the T-Recs++ prototype. This paper describes the ideas of the T-Recs++ location and also proposes a quality evaluation measure that reflects the bottom-up strategy of either T-Recs or T-Recs++. Finally, some results comparing both systems on a collection of business letters are given."

We put forward a flexible representation scheme for complex tables, based on a clear distinction between the physical layout of a table and its logical structure. Relying on this scheme, we develop a new method for the detection and the extraction of tables by an analysis of the graphic lines. To deal with tables that lack all or most of the graphic marks, one must focus on the regularities of the text elements alone. We propose such a method, based on a multi-level analysis of the layout of text components on a page. A general graph representation of the relative positions of blocks of text is exploited."

More specifically, we exploit the structural information in a document to identify tables and their component fields and let the users query based on these fields. Our empirical results have demonstrated that heuristic method based table extraction and component tagging can be performed effectively and efficiently. Moreover, our experiments in retrieval using the TINTIN system have strongly indicated that such structural decomposition can facilitate better representation of user\u2019s information needs and hence more effective retrieval of tables."

Lines and tables are among the most frequent graphic, non-textual entities in documents and their detection is directly related to the OCR performance as well as to the document layout description. We propose a workflow for table detection that comprises three distinct steps: (i) image pre-processing; (ii) horizontal and vertical line detection and (iii) table detection. The efficiency of the proposed method is demonstrated by using a performance evaluation scheme which considers a great variety of documents such as forms, newspapers/magazines, scientific journals, tickets/bank cheques, certificates and handwritten documents."

Based on the definition of form signature, we have proposed a similarity measure that is insensitive to translation, scaling, moderate skew (<5/spl deg/) and variations in the geometrical proportions of the form layout. This similarity measure also has a good tolerance to line detection errors. We have developed a prototype form retrieval system which has been tested on a database containing 100 different kinds of forms."

Today, quite a large number of different approaches facing these tasks have been described in literature or are available as part of commercial OCR systems that claim to deal with tables on the scanned documents and to treat them accordingly.\n However, the problem of detecting tables is not yet solved at all. Different approaches have different strengths and weak points. Some fail in certain situations or layouts where others perform better. How shall one know, which approach or system is the best for his specific job? The answer to this question raises the demand for an objective comparison of different approaches which address the same task of spotting tables and recognizing their structure.\n This paper describes our approach towards establishing a complete and publicly available, hence open environment for the benchmarking of table spotting and structural analysis. We provide free access to the ground truthing tool and evaluation mechanism described in this paper, describe the ideas behind and we also provide ground truth for the 547 documents of the UNLV and UW-3 datasets that contain tables.\n In addition, we applied the quality measures to the results that were generated by the T-Recs system which we developed some years ago and which we started to further advance since a few months."

A table offers a preeminent clue in text mining because it contains meaningful data displayed in rows and columns. However, tables are used on the Internet for both knowledge structuring and document design. Therefore, we were interested in determining whether or not a table has meaningfulness that is related to the structural information provided at the abstraction level of the table head. Accordingly, we: 1) investigated the types of tables present in HTML documents, 2) established the features that distinguished meaningful tables from others, 3) constructed a training data set using the established features after having filtered any obvious decorative tables, and 4) constructed a classification model using a decision tree. Based on these features, we set up heuristics for table head extraction from meaningful tables, and obtained an F-measure of 95.0 percent in distinguishing meaningful tables from decorative tables and an accuracy of 82.1 percent in extracting the table head from the meaningful tables."

In order to process these texts correctly and extract the information contained within the tables, it is important to identify the presence and structure of tables. In this paper, we present a new approach that learns to recognize tables in free text, including the boundary, rows and columns of tables. When tested on Wall Street Journal news documents, our learning approach outperforms a deterministic table recognition algorithm that identifies table recognition algorithm that identifies tables based on a fixed set of conditions. Our learning approach is also more flexible and easily adaptable to texts in different domains with different table characteristics."

In this paper we report a very simple but extremely powerful approach to detect tables present in document pages. The algorithm relies on the observation that the tables have distinct columns which implies that gaps between the fields are substantially larger than the gaps between the words in text lines. This deceptively simple observation has led to the design of a simple but powerful table detection system with low computation cost. Moreover, mathematical foundation of the approach is also established including formation of a regular expression for ease of implementation."

                "text": "Tables are ubiquitous in digital libraries. In scientific documents, tables are widely used to present experimental results or statistical data in a condensed fashion. However, current search engines do not support table search. The difficulty of automatic extracting tables from un-tagged documents, the lack of a universal table metadata specification, and the limitation of the existing ranking schemes make table search problem challenging. In this paper, we describe TableSeer, a search engine for tables. TableSeer crawls digital libraries, detects tables from documents, extracts tables metadata, indexes and ranks tables, and provides a user-friendly search interface. We propose an extensive set of medium-independent metadata for tables that scientists and other users can adopt for representing table information. In addition, we devise a novel page box-cutting method to improve the performance of the table detection. Given a query, TableSeer ranks the matched tables using an innovative ranking algorithm - TableRank. TableRank rates each \u20edquery, table\u2102 pair with a tailored vector space model and a specific term weighting scheme. Overall, TableSeer eliminates the burden of manually extract table data from digital libraries and enables users to automatically examine tables. We demonstrate the value of TableSeer with empirical studies on scientific documents."

We propose three different classifications for published tables, and develop methods to detect these tables and correctly identify their respective rows and columns.

Table, a ubiquitous document component, becomes an important information source. Accurately detecting the table boundary plays a crucial role for many applications, e.g., the increasing demand on the table data search. Rather than converting PDFs to image or HTML and then processing with other techniques (e.g., OCR), extracting and analyzing texts from PDFs directly is easy and accurate. However, text extraction tools face a common problem: text sequence error. In this paper, we propose two algorithms to recover the sequence of extracted sparse lines, which improve the table content collection. The experimental results show the comparison of the performance of both algorithms, and demonstrate the effectiveness of text sequence recovering for the table boundary detection."

Several document analysis tasks require merging or splitting certain document elements to form others. The suitability of the commonly used precision and recall for such division/aggregation tasks is arguable, since their underlying assumption is that the granularity of the items at input is the same as at output. We propose a new pair of evaluation metrics that better suit document analysis\u2019 needs and show their application to several table tasks. In the process, we present a number of robust table location algorithms with which we draw a road-map for creating Hidden Markov Models for the task."

In these tables, textual data are presented in record lines made up of fixed-width fields. Tables often do not rely on line-art (ruled lines) to delimit fields, and in this way differ crucially from fixed forms. Our system performs these steps: copes with multiple tables per page; identifies records within tables; segments records into fields; and recognizes characters within fields, constrained by field-specific contextual knowledge. Obstacles to good performance on tables include small print, tight line-spacing, poor-quality text (such as photocopies), and line-art or background patterns that touch the text. Precise skew-correction and pitch-estimation, and high-performance OCR using neural nets proved crucial in overcoming these obstacles. The most significant technical advances in this work appear to be algorithms for identifying and segmenting records with known layout, and integration of these algorithms with a graphical user interface (GUI) for defining new layouts. This GUI has been ergonomically designed to make efficient and intuitive use of exemplary images, so that the skill and manual effort required to retarget the system to new table layouts are held to a minimum. The system has been applied in this way to more than 400 distinct tabular layouts. During the last three years the system has read over fifty million records with high accuracy."

Each cell of a table is arranged regularly in two dimensions and is represented by a row-column pair. Even in the absence of ruled lines, its coordinates are explicitly found. Thus, it is assumed that an arrangement of textblocks defines the table structure, which is an arrangement of rows and columns, and ruled lines make clear their relationship. This process is composed of two procedures: the expansion of cell bounding boxes and the assignment of row-column numbers to each edge. It is shown that the method can be applied to partially ruled tables with some experimental results.<<ETX>>"

Decision making is more transparent in formal model based approaches (e.g. grammar based) but these approaches are less flexible than informal ones. We propose an intermediate level of formalization, defining strategies as a sequence of basic graph transformations that correspond to recognition operations (e.g. classification, segmentation). Transformations are parameterized by logical types and decision functions, which together define structure models and executable strategies for interpreting input graphs. We provide an overview of our first attempt at this intermediate level of formalization, the Recognition Strategy Language (RSL). As a proof of concept, we reimplement two informally specified table recognition strategies from the literature in RSL. The RSL implementations capture descriptions of the formerly implicit table structure models, and automatically capture all decision making."

This component automates extraction of the Wang Notation for the column header of a table. Using column-header specific rules for XY cutting we convert the geometric structure of the column header to a linear string denoting cell attributes and directions of cuts. The string representation is parsed by a context-free grammar and the parse tree is further processed to produce an abstract data-type representation (the Wang notation tree) of each column category. Experiments were carried out to evaluate this scheme on the original and edited column headers of Excel tables drawn from a collection of 200 used in our earlier work. The transformed headers were obtained by editing the original column headers to conform to the format targeted by our grammar. Forty-four original headers and their reformatted versions were submitted as input to our software system. Our grammar was able to parse and the extract Wang notation tree for all the edited headers, but for only four of the original headers. We suggest extensions to our table grammar that would enable processing a larger fraction of headers without manual editing."

In this paper, we firstpropose a general representation of table form documentbased on XML, which contains both structure and layoutinformation. Next, we present structure analysis systembased on graph grammar which represents document structureknowledge. As the relation between adjacent fields intable form documents become two dimensional, two dimensionalnotation is necessary to denote structural knowledge.Therefore, we adopt two dimensional graph grammar to denotethem. By using grammar notation, we can easily modifyand keep consistency of it, as the rules are relatively simple.Another advantage of using grammar notation is that,it can be used for generating documents only from logicalstructure. Experimental results have shown that the systemsuccessfully analyzed several kinds of table forms."

We start by defining table. Then we describe the steps involved in extracting information from tables and analyse table-related research to place the contribution of different authors, find the paths research is following, and identify issues that are still unsolved. We then analyse current approaches to evaluating table processing algorithms and propose two new metrics for the task of segmenting cells/columns/rows. We proceed to design our own end-to-end method, where there is a higher interaction between different steps; we indicate how back loops in the usual order of the steps can reduce the possibility of errors and contribute to solving previously unsolved problems. Finally, we explore how the actual interpretation of the table not only allows inferring the accuracy of the overall extraction process but also contributes to actually improving its quality. In order to do so, we believe interpretation has to consider context-specific knowledge; we explore how the addition of this knowledge can be made in a plug-in/out manner, such that the overall method will maintain its operability in different contexts."

This graph is subsequently rewritten using a set of rules designed for and based on apriori document knowledge and general formatting conventions. The resulting graph provides both logical and layout views of the document content."

The method is based on the automatic detection of the most discriminant regions at the image level, to be used by a distance-based classifier. Experiments included multi-page form images and the results suggest that a very high accuracy can be achieved when identifying previously known types of forms, even when unpredictable fill-in data and significant noise from the scanning process appear on the test images. Likewise, it is shown that the probability that an unknown type of document is not rejected is very low. The presented technique could also be applied to other kinds of documents."

A generic model is designed to support the different stages of tabular composition, including the editing of logical structure, the specification of layout structure, and the formatting of concrete tables. The model separates table's logical structure from its layout structure, which consists of tabular topology and typographic style. The notion of an abstract table, which describes the logical relationships among tabular items, is formally defined and a set of logical operations is proposed to manipulate tables based on these logical relationships. An abstract table can be visualized through a layout structure specified by a set of topological rules, which determine the relative placement of tabular items in two dimensions, and a set of style rules, which determine the final appearance of different items. The absolute placement of a concrete table can be automatically generated by applying a layout specification to an abstract line. An NP-complete problem arises in the formatting process that uses automatic line breaking and determines the physical dimension of a table to satisfy user-specified size constraints. An algorithm has been designed to solve the formatting problem in polynomial time for typical tables. Based on the tabular model, a prototype tabular composition system has been implemented in a UNIX, X Windows environment. This prototype provides an interactive interface to edit the logical structure, the topology and the styles of tables. It allows us to manipulate tables based on the logical relationships tabular items, regardless of where the items are placed in the layout structure, and capable of presenting a table in different topologies and styles so that we can select a high-quality layout structure."

Observations perform feature measurements and data lookup, transformations alter or restructure data, and inferences generate and test hypotheses.

This paper focuses on cell recognition in low quality form images. The recognition method has two features to achieve robustness in cell recognition. One is grid representation using several types of intersection and the terminal points of the frame lines. The other is the recursive modification of the representation. A new representation is created according to the determination of the breaks in the line and the hypothesized location of the missed intersections by using the previous representation. The modification is processed recursively until the representation has perfect consistency and all form cells are detected. In an experiment using 1565 form samples, all cells in 1538 samples (98.3% of 1565 samples) were recognized correctly by this method."

BDR deals with regions directly, in contrast with other previous methods.

The straight line is often one of the basic elements of the layers making up a document. The detection of these segments is often disturbed by the superposition of different layers in the same area. Therefore we developed a segment extractor, which processes masked areas, discontinuities and even curvatures. After showing in our previous work, the interest of such a system in binary image analysis, our aim was to show the method could be generalized to grey level images, by taking into account pixel luminosity as one of the parameters. The Kalman filter method combined with an adequate control scheme, allows the pooling of local observations, when their position, width and luminosity are coherent. The proposed model gives an interesting scheme to manage drawings masking each other (eg. cross-lines)."

We begin, as we do in our previous algorithm, finding and validating each detected table candidates. We proceed to compute a set of probability measurements for each of the table entities. The computation of the probability measurements takes into consideration tables, table text separators and table neighboring text blocks. Then, an iterative updating method is used to optimize the page segmentation probability to obtain the final result. This new algorithm shows a great improvement over our previous algorithm. The training and testing data set for the algorithm include 1, 125 document pages having 518 table entities and a total of 10, 934 cell entities. Compared with our previous work, it raised the accuracy rate to 95.67% from 90.32% and to 97.05% from 92.04%."

We show: a) how to integrate different document structure finders into the HMM; b) that transition probabilities should vary along the chain to embed general knowledge axioms of our field, c) some emission energies can be selectively ignored, and d) emission and transition probabilities can be weighed differently. We conclude these changes increase the expressiveness and usability of HMMs in our field."

Although the FAXOCR system for specified forms is used practically, the performance to unspecified forms is not enough, because of the effect of noise on the faxed forms during the facsimile transmission. The final target of this study is to construct a practical FAXOCR system for unspecified forms. As the first stage, an identification method for unspecified faxed forms is proposed in this paper. In our approach, character separation and position adjustment are performed in the Hough-Space as pre-processing. Then the form identification is carried out by using vote histogram in the Hough-space. The performance of the proposed technique is verified experimentally by using actual faxed forms."
