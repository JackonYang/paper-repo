                "text": "The problem of learning using connectionist networks, in which network connection strengths are modified systematically so that the response of the network increasingly approximates the desired response can be structured as an optimization problem. The widely used back propagation method of connectionist learning [19, 21, 18] is set in the context of nonlinear optimization. In this framework, the issues of stability, convergence and parallelism are considered. As a form of gradient descent with fixed step size, back propagation is known to be unstable, which is illustrated using Rosenbrock's function. This is contrasted with stable methods which involve a line search in the gradient direction. The convergence criterion for connectionist problems involving binary functions is discussed relative to the behavior of gradient descent in the vicinity of local minima. A minimax criterion is compared with the least squares criterion. The contribution of the momentum term [19, 18] to more rapid convergence is interpreted relative to the geometry of the weight space. It is shown that in plateau regions of relatively constant gradient, the momentum term acts to increase the step size by a factor of 1/1-\u03bc, where \u03bc is the momentum term. In valley regions with steep sides, the momentum constant acts to focus the search direction toward the local minimum by averaging oscillations in the gradient.

This paper describes further research on the learning procedure. We start by describing the units, the way they are connected, the learning procedure, and the extension to iterative nets. We then give an example in which a network learns a set of filters that enable it to discriminate formant-like patterns in the presence of noise. The speed of learning is strongly dependent on the shape of the surface formed by the error measure in weight space . We give examples of the shape of the error surface for a typical task and illustrate how an acceleration method speeds up descent in weight space. The main drawback of the learning procedure is the way it scales as the size of the task and the network increases. We give some preliminary results on scaling and show how the magnitude of the optimal weight changes depends on the fan-in of the units. Additional results illustrate the effects on learning speed of the amount of interaction between the weights. A variation of the learning procedure that back-propagates desired state information rather than error gradients is developed and compared with the standard procedure. Finally, we discuss the relationship between our iterative networks and the analog networks described by Hopefield and Tank (Hopfield 85). The learning procedure can discover appropriate weights in their kind of network, as well as determine an optimal schedule for varying the nonlinearity of the units during a search."
