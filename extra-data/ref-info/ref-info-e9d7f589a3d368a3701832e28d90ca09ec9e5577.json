Rather than focusing on local features and their consistencies in the image data, our approach aims at extracting the global impression of an image. We treat image segmentation as a graph partitioning problem and propose a novel global criterion, the normalized cut, for segmenting the graph. The normalized cut criterion measures both the total dissimilarity between the different groups as well as the total similarity within the groups. We show that an efficient computational technique based on a generalized eigenvalue problem can be used to optimize this criterion. We have applied this approach to segmenting static images and found results very encouraging."

Classification systems that can model human performance, or that use robust image matching methods, often make use of similarity judgments that are non-metric; but when the triangle inequality is not obeyed, most existing pattern recognition techniques are not applicable. We note that exemplar-based (or nearest-neighbor) methods can be applied naturally when using a wide class of non-metric similarity functions. The key issue, however, is to find methods for choosing good representatives of a class that accurately characterize it. We show that existing condensing techniques for finding class representatives are ill-suited to deal with non-metric dataspaces. We then focus on developing techniques for solving this problem, emphasizing two points: First, we show that the distance between two images is not a good measure of how well one image can represent another in non-metric spaces. Instead, we use the vector correlation between the distances from each image to other previously seen images. Second, we show that in non-metric spaces, boundary points are less significant for capturing the structure of a class than they are in Euclidean spaces. We suggest that atypical points may be more important in describing classes. We demonstrate the importance of these ideas to learning that generalizes"

Yet, the bulk of the existing work assumes that the scene contains only a single moving object. The more realistic case where an unknown number of objects move in the scene has received little attention, especially for its theoretical treatment. We present a new method for separating and recovering the motion and shape of multiple independently moving objects in a sequence of images. The method does not require prior knowledge of the number of objects, nor is dependent on any grouping of features into an object at the image level. For this purpose, we introduce a mathematical construct of object shapes, called the shape interaction matrix, which is invariant to both the object motions and the selection of coordinate systems. This invariant structure is computable solely from the observed trajectories of image features without grouping them into individual objects. Once the structure is computed, it allows for segmenting features into objects by the process of transforming it into a canonical form, as well as recovering the shape and motion of each object.<<ETX>>"
