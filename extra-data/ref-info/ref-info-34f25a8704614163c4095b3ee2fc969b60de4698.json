                "text": "Improving Neural Networks with Dropout Nitish Srivastava Master of Science Graduate Department of Computer Science University of Toronto 2013 Deep neural nets with a huge number of parameters are very powerful machine learning systems. However, overfitting is a serious problem in such networks. Large networks are also slow to use, making it difficult to deal with overfitting by combining many different large neural nets at test time. Dropout is a technique for addressing this problem. The key idea is to randomly drop units (along with their connections) from a neural network during training. This prevents the units from co-adapting too much. Dropping units creates thinned networks during training. The number of possible thinned networks is exponential in the number of units in the network. At test time all possible thinned networks are combined using an approximate model averaging procedure. Dropout training followed by this approximate model combination significantly reduces overfitting and gives major improvements over other regularization methods. In this work, we describe models that improve the performance of neural networks using dropout, often obtaining state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets."

It is, in principle, an excellent dataset for unsupervised training of deep generative models, but previous researchers who have tried this have found it dicult to learn a good set of lters from the images. We show how to train a multi-layer generative model that learns to extract meaningful features which resemble those found in the human visual cortex. Using a novel parallelization algorithm to distribute the work among multiple machines connected on a network, we show how training such a model can be done in reasonable time. A second problematic aspect of the tiny images dataset is that there are no reliable class labels which makes it hard to use for object recognition experiments. We created two sets of reliable labels. The CIFAR-10 set has 6000 examples of each of 10 classes and the CIFAR-100 set has 600 examples of each of 100 non-overlapping classes. Using these labels, we show that object recognition is signicantly improved by pre-training a layer of features on a large set of unlabeled tiny images."

Dropout training (Hinton et al., 2012) does this by randomly dropping out (zeroing) hidden units and input features during training of neural networks. However, repeatedly sampling a random subset of input features makes training much slower. Based on an examination of the implied objective function of dropout training, we show how to do fast dropout training by sampling from or integrating a Gaussian approximation, instead of doing Monte Carlo optimization of this objective. This approximation, justified by the central limit theorem and empirical evidence, gives an order of magnitude speedup and more stability. We show how to do fast dropout training for classification, regression, and multilayer neural networks. Beyond dropout, our technique is extended to integrate out other types of noise and small image transformations."

On the test data, we achieved top-1 and top-5 error rates of 37.5% and 17.0%, respectively, which is considerably better than the previous state-of-the-art. The neural network, which has 60 million parameters and 650,000 neurons, consists of five convolutional layers, some of which are followed by max-pooling layers, and three fully connected layers with a final 1000-way softmax. To make training faster, we used non-saturating neurons and a very efficient GPU implementation of the convolution operation. To reduce overfitting in the fully connected layers we employed a recently developed regularization method called \"dropout\" that proved to be very effective. We also entered a variant of this model in the ILSVRC-2012 competition and achieved a winning top-5 test error rate of 15.3%, compared to 26.2% achieved by the second-best entry."

Using complementary priors, we derive a fast, greedy algorithm that can learn deep, directed belief networks one layer at a time, provided the top two layers form an undirected associative memory. The fast, greedy algorithm is used to initialize a slower learning procedure that fine-tunes the weights using a contrastive version of the wake-sleep algorithm. After fine-tuning, a network with three hidden layers forms a very good generative model of the joint distribution of handwritten digit images and their labels. This generative model gives better digit classification than the best discriminative learning algorithms. The low-dimensional manifolds on which the digits lie are modeled by long ravines in the free-energy landscape of the top-level associative memory, and it is easy to explore these ravines by using the directed connections to display what the associative memory has in mind."

Ideally, this is achieved by training on very large (infinite) training data sets that capture all variations in the data distribution. In the case of finite training data, an effective solution is to extend the training set with artificially created examples--which, however, is also computationally costly. We propose to corrupt training examples with noise from known distributions within the exponential family and present a novel learning algorithm, called marginalized corrupted features (MCF), that trains robust predictors by minimizing the expected value of the loss function under the corrupting distribution-- essentially learning with infinitely many (corrupted) training examples. We show empirically on a variety of data sets that MCF classifiers can be trained efficiently, may generalize substantially better to test data, and are more robust to feature deletion at test time."

Simple versions of this approach include penalizing the sum of the squares of the weights or penalizing the number of nonzero weights. We propose a more complicated penalty term in which the distribution of weight values is modeled as a mixture of multiple gaussians. A set of weights is simple if the weights have high probability density under the mixture model. This can be achieved by clustering the weights into subsets with the weights in each cluster having very similar values. Since we do not know the appropriate means or variances of the clusters in advance, we allow the parameters of the mixture model to adapt at the same time as the network learns. Simulations on two different problems demonstrate that this complexity term is more effective than previous complexity terms."

We also establish a connection to AdaGrad, an online learning algorithm, and find that a close relative of AdaGrad operates by repeatedly solving linear dropout-regularized problems. By casting dropout as regularization, we develop a natural semi-supervised algorithm that uses unlabeled data to create a better adaptive regularizer.

Data-dependent expectations are estimated using a variational approximation that tends to focus on a single mode, and dataindependent expectations are approximated using persistent Markov chains. The use of two quite different techniques for estimating the two types of expectation that enter into the gradient of the log-likelihood makes it practical to learn Boltzmann machines with multiple hidden layers and millions of parameters. The learning can be made more efficient by using a layer-by-layer \u201cpre-training\u201d phase that allows variational inference to be initialized with a single bottomup pass. We present results on the MNIST and NORB datasets showing that deep Boltzmann machines learn good generative models and perform well on handwritten digit and visual object recognition tasks."

This book demonstrates how Bayesian methods allow complex neural network models to be used without fear of the \"overfitting\" that can occur with traditional training methods. Insight into the nature of these complex Bayesian models is provided by a theoretical investigation of the priors over functions that underlie them. A practical implementation of Bayesian neural network learning using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods is also described, and software for it is freely available over the Internet. Presupposing only basic knowledge of probability and statistics, this book should be of interest to researchers in statistics, engineering, and artificial intelligence."

The resulting algorithm is a straightforward variation on the stacking of ordinary autoencoders. It is however shown on a benchmark of classification problems to yield significantly lower classification error, thus bridging the performance gap with deep belief networks (DBN), and in several cases surpassing it. Higher level representations learnt in this purely unsupervised fashion also help boost the performance of subsequent SVM classifiers. Qualitative experiments show that, contrary to ordinary autoencoders, denoising autoencoders are able to learn Gabor-like edge detectors from natural image patches and larger stroke detectors from digit images. This work clearly establishes the value of using a denoising criterion as a tractable unsupervised objective to guide the learning of useful higher level representations."

However, the first-layer Gaussian-Bernoulli Restricted Boltzmann Machine (GRBM) has an important limitation, shared with mixtures of diagonal-covariance Gaussians: GRBMs treat different components of the acoustic input vector as conditionally independent given the hidden state. The mean-covariance restricted Boltzmann machine (mcRBM), first introduced for modeling natural images, is a much more representationally efficient and powerful way of modeling the covariance structure of speech data. Every configuration of the precision units of the mcRBM specifies a different precision matrix for the conditional distribution over the acoustic space. In this work, we use the mcRBM to learn features of speech data that serve as input into a standard DBN. The mcRBM features combined with DBNs allow us to achieve a phone error rate of 20.5%, which is superior to all published results on speaker-independent TIMIT to date."

We show that better phone recognition on the TIMIT dataset can be achieved by replacing Gaussian mixture models by deep neural networks that contain many layers of features and a very large number of parameters. These networks are first pre-trained as a multi-layer generative model of a window of spectral feature vectors without making use of any discriminative information. Once the generative pre-training has designed the features, we perform discriminative fine-tuning using backpropagation to adjust the features slightly to make them better at predicting a probability distribution over the states of monophone hidden Markov models."

Unfortunately, this tuning is often a \"black art\" requiring expert experience, rules of thumb, or sometimes brute-force search. There is therefore great appeal for automatic approaches that can optimize the performance of any given learning algorithm to the problem at hand. In this work, we consider this problem through the framework of Bayesian optimization, in which a learning algorithm's generalization performance is modeled as a sample from a Gaussian process (GP). We show that certain choices for the nature of the GP, such as the type of kernel and the treatment of its hyperparameters, can play a crucial role in obtaining a good optimizer that can achieve expertlevel performance. We describe new algorithms that take into account the variable cost (duration) of learning algorithm experiments and that can leverage the presence of multiple cores for parallel experimentation. We show that these proposed algorithms improve on previous automatic procedures and can reach or surpass human expert-level optimization for many algorithms including latent Dirichlet allocation, structured SVMs and convolutional neural networks."

This paper describes a set of concrete bestpractices that document analysis researchers can use toget good results with neural networks. The mostimportant practice is getting a training set as large aspossible: we expand the training set by adding a newform of distorted data. The next most important practiceis that convolutional neural networks are better suited forvisual document tasks than fully connected networks. Wepropose that a simple \"do-it-yourself\" implementation ofconvolution with a flexible architecture is suitable formany visual document problems. This simpleconvolutional neural network does not require complexmethods, such as momentum, weight decay, structure-dependentlearning rates, averaging layers, tangent prop,or even finely-tuning the architecture. The end result is avery simple yet general architecture which can yieldstate-of-the-art performance for document analysis. Weillustrate our claims on the MNIST set of English digitimages."

This assumption is unrealistic in many real-world situations where machine learning techniques are used. We focus on the case where features of a binary classification problem, which were available during the training phase, are either deleted or become corrupted during the classification phase. We prepare for the worst by assuming that the subset of deleted and corrupted features is controlled by an adversary, and may vary from instance to instance. We design and analyze two novel learning algorithms that anticipate the actions of the adversary and account for them when training a classifier. Our first technique formulates the learning problem as a linear program. We discuss how the particular structure of this program can be exploited for computational efficiency and we prove statistical bounds on the risk of the resulting classifier. Our second technique addresses the robust learning problem by combining a modified version of the Perceptron algorithm with an online-to-batch conversion technique, and also comes with statistical generalization guarantees. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with a set of experiments."

Related problems like document character recognition have been widely studied by computer vision and machine learning researchers and are virtually solved for practical applications like reading handwritten digits. Reliably recognizing characters in more complex scenes like photographs, however, is far more difficult: the best existing methods lag well behind human performance on the same tasks. In this paper we attack the problem of recognizing digits in a real application using unsupervised feature learning methods: reading house numbers from street level photos. To this end, we introduce a new benchmark dataset for research use containing over 600,000 labeled digits cropped from Street View images. We then demonstrate the difficulty of recognizing these digits when the problem is approached with hand-designed features. Finally, we employ variants of two recently proposed unsupervised feature learning methods and find that they are convincingly superior on our benchmarks."

We introduce and motivate a new training principle for unsupervised learning of a representation based on the idea of making the learned representations robust to partial corruption of the input pattern. This approach can be used to train autoencoders, and these denoising autoencoders can be stacked to initialize deep architectures. The algorithm can be motivated from a manifold learning and information theoretic perspective or from a generative model perspective. Comparative experiments clearly show the surprising advantage of corrupting the input of autoencoders on a pattern classification benchmark suite."

This is particularly important in domains with nonstationary feature distributions or with input sensor failures. A common approach to achieving such robustness is to introduce regularization which spreads the weight more evenly between the features. However, this strategy is very generic, and cannot induce robustness specifically tailored to the classification task at hand. In this work, we introduce a new algorithm for avoiding single feature over-weighting by analyzing robustness using a game theoretic formalization. We develop classifiers which are optimally resilient to deletion of features in a minimax sense, and show how to construct such classifiers using quadratic programming. We illustrate the applicability of our methods on spam filtering and handwritten digit recognition tasks, where feature deletion is indeed a realistic noise model."

Most systems use only one stage of feature extraction in which the filters are hard-wired, or two stages where the filters in one or both stages are learned in supervised or unsupervised mode. This paper addresses three questions: 1. How does the non-linearities that follow the filter banks influence the recognition accuracy? 2. does learning the filter banks in an unsupervised or supervised manner improve the performance over random filters or hardwired filters? 3. Is there any advantage to using an architecture with two stages of feature extraction, rather than one? We show that using non-linearities that include rectification and local contrast normalization is the single most important ingredient for good accuracy on object recognition benchmarks. We show that two stages of feature extraction yield better accuracy than one. Most surprisingly, we show that a two-stage system with random filters can yield almost 63% recognition rate on Caltech-101, provided that the proper non-linearities and pooling layers are used. Finally, we show that with supervised refinement, the system achieves state-of-the-art performance on NORB dataset (5.6%) and unsupervised pre-training followed by supervised refinement produces good accuracy on Caltech-101 (\u226b 65%), and the lowest known error rate on the undistorted, unprocessed MNIST dataset (0.53%)."

Recently, they have attained record accuracy on standard benchmark tasks of sentiment analysis across different text domains. SDAs learn robust data representations by reconstruction, recovering original features from data that are artificially corrupted with noise. In this paper, we propose marginalized SDA (mSDA) that addresses two crucial limitations of SDAs: high computational cost and lack of scalability to high-dimensional features. In contrast to SDAs, our approach of mSDA marginalizes noise and thus does not require stochastic gradient descent or other optimization algorithms to learn parameters--in fact, they are computed in closed-form. Consequently, mSDA, which can be implemented in only 20 lines of MATLAB\u2122, significantly speeds up SDAs by two orders of magnitude. Furthermore, the representations learnt by mSDA are as effective as the traditional SDAs, attaining almost identical accuracies in benchmark tasks."

Such models are usually fitted to data by finding a MAP estimate of the model parameters, a procedure that can be performed efficiently even on very large datasets. However, unless the regularization parameters are tuned carefully, this approach is prone to overfitting because it finds a single point estimate of the parameters. In this paper we present a fully Bayesian treatment of the Probabilistic Matrix Factorization (PMF) model in which model capacity is controlled automatically by integrating over all model parameters and hyperparameters. We show that Bayesian PMF models can be efficiently trained using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods by applying them to the Netflix dataset, which consists of over 100 million movie ratings. The resulting models achieve significantly higher prediction accuracy than PMF models trained using MAP estimation."

The 'lasso' minimizes the residual sum of squares subject to the sum of the absolute value of the coefficients being less than a constant. Because of the nature of this constraint it tends to produce some coefficients that are exactly 0 and hence gives interpretable models. Our simulation studies suggest that the lasso enjoys some of the favourable properties of both subset selection and ridge regression. It produces interpretable models like subset selection and exhibits the stability of ridge regression. There is also an interesting relationship with recent work in adaptive function estimation by Donoho and Johnstone. The lasso idea is quite general and can be applied in a variety of statistical models: extensions to generalized regression models and tree-based models are briefly described."

First, we study classification accuracy as a function of the image signature dimensionality and the training set size. We show experimentally that the larger the training set, the higher the impact of the dimensionality on the accuracy. In other words, high-dimensional signatures are important to obtain state-of-the-art results on large datasets. Second, we tackle the problem of data compression on very large signatures (on the order of 105 dimensions) using two lossy compression strategies: a dimensionality reduction technique known as the hash kernel and an encoding technique based on product quantizers. We explain how the gain in storage can be traded against a loss in accuracy and/or an increase in CPU cost. We report results on two large databases \u2014 ImageNet and a dataset of lM Flickr images \u2014 showing that we can reduce the storage of our signatures by a factor 64 to 128 with little loss in accuracy. Integrating the decompression in the classifier learning yields an efficient and scalable training algorithm. On ILSVRC2010 we report a 74.3% accuracy at top-5, which corresponds to a 2.5% absolute improvement with respect to the state-of-the-art. On a subset of 10K classes of ImageNet we report a top-1 accuracy of 16.7%, a relative improvement of 160% with respect to the state-of-the-art."

An important goal in understanding this phenomenon is to infer a 'splicing code' that predicts how splicing is regulated in different cell types by features derived from RNA, DNA and epigenetic modifiers.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe formulate the assembly of a splicing code as a problem of statistical inference and introduce a Bayesian method that uses an adaptively selected number of hidden variables to combine subgroups of features into a network, allows different tissues to share feature subgroups and uses a Gibbs sampler to hedge predictions and ascertain the statistical significance of identified features.\n\n\nRESULTS\nUsing data for 3665 cassette exons, 1014 RNA features and 4 tissue types derived from 27 mouse tissues (http://genes.toronto.edu/wasp), we benchmarked several methods. Our method outperforms all others, and achieves relative improvements of 52% in splicing code quality and up to 22% in classification error, compared with the state of the art. Novel combinations of regulatory features and novel combinations of tissues that share feature subgroups were identified using our method.\n\n\nCONTACT\nfrey@psi.toronto.edu\n\n\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION\nSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online."

Here we show that sex is responsible for the existence of separate genetic effects on fitness and, more generally, for the existence of a hierarchy of genetic evolutionary modules. Using the tools developed in the process, we also demonstrate that in terms of their fitness effects, separation and fusion of genes are associated with the increase and decrease of the recombination rate between them, respectively. Implications for sex and evolution theory are discussed."
