They propose a model that administrators can employ that minimizes bias. In a similar vein, the next chapter, by Jeffery Braden and Sandra Fradd, suggests ways that administrators can anticipate difficulties and intervene before such referrals are necessary. William Tikunoff, in the eighth chapter, focuses on instructional leadership. He discusses the characteristics of an effective principal and targets specific areas, such as effective time management. The final chapter, by Beatrice Ward, addresses the greatest resource of any educational institution: the teachers. She describes the clinical approach to teacher development and how it can be implemented. Overall, this book fills a need for basic, factual information about legal requirements, program types, and effective instructional and leadership strategies with respect to the LEP population. Furthermore, it provides guidance on the complex issue of special education for LEP students, particularly the referral process. An additional chapter exploring different models for assessment and program design for these students would have provided depth and balance. Although there is necessarily some overlap between the chapters, it is reinforcing, not repetitive. In addition to being extremely useful to administrators, this book would be of value to school personnel such as psychologists, special education consultants, LEP consultants, instructors-in short, for anyone committed to the design and delivery of effective instructional programs for LEP students."

Simulated annealing (e.g. Kirkpatrick et alo 1983, Bridle & Moore 1984, Ackley et al. 1985) is a stochastic computational technique for finding optimal solutions to combinatorial problems for which the combinatorial explosion phenomenon rules out the possibility of systematically examining each alternative. It is currently being applied to the practical problem of optimizing the physical design of computer circuitry, and to the theoretical problems of resolving patterns of auditory and visual stimulation into meaningful arrangements of phonemes and three-dimensional objects. Grammatical parsing -resolving unanalysed linear sequences of words into meaningful grammatical structures -can be regarded as a perception problem logically analogous to those just cited, and simulated annealing holds great promise as a parsing technique."
