A generative model represents the configuration of multiple object parts with respect to an object coordinate system; these parts in turn generate image features. The complexity of the model in the number of features is low, meaning our model is much more efficient to train than comparative methods. Moreover, a variational approximation is introduced that allows learning to be orders of magnitude faster than previous approaches while incorporating many more features. This results in both accuracy and localization improvements. Our model has been carefully tested on standard datasets; we compare with a number of recent template models. In particular, we demonstrate state-of-the-art results for detection and localization."

To tie these ideas together we compute multiple segmentations of each image and then: (i) learn the object classes; and (ii) choose the correct segmentations.

By adopting sparse kernel methods and Bayesian model selection and data association, the proposed model identifies the most relevant sets of local features for recognizing object classes, achieves performance comparable to the fully supervised setting, and consistently outperforms existing methods for image classification."

We introduce LOCUS (learning object classes with unsupervised segmentation) which uses a generative probabilistic model to combine bottom-up cues of color and edge with top-down cues of shape and pose. A key aspect of this model is that the object appearance is allowed to vary from image to image, allowing for significant within-class variation. By iteratively updating the belief in the object's position, size, segmentation and pose, LOCUS avoids making hard decisions about any of these quantities and so allows for each to be refined at any stage. We show that LOCUS successfully learns an object class model from unlabeled images, whilst also giving segmentation accuracies that rival existing supervised methods. Finally, we demonstrate simultaneous recognition and segmentation in novel images using the learned models for a number of object classes, as well as unsupervised object discovery and tracking in video."

Objects are modeled as flexible constellations of parts. A probabilistic representation is used for all aspects of the object: shape, appearance, occlusion and relative scale. An entropy-based feature detector is used to select regions and their scale within the image. In learning the parameters of the scale-invariant object model are estimated. This is done using expectation-maximization in a maximum-likelihood setting. In recognition, this model is used in a Bayesian manner to classify images. The flexible nature of the model is demonstrated by excellent results over a range of datasets including geometrically constrained classes (e.g. faces, cars) and flexible objects (such as animals)."

The first step of our method consists of clustering local scale-invariant descriptors to characterize object class appearance. Next, we train on the groups, and perform feature selection to determine the most discriminative parts. We use local regions to realize robust and sparse part and texture selection invariant to changes in scale, orientation and affine deformation and, as a result, we avoid image normalization in both training and prediction phases. We train our object models without requiring image parts to be labeled or objects to be separated from the background. Moreover, our method continues to work well when images have cluttered background and occluded objects. We evaluate our method on seven recently proposed datasets, and quantitatively compare the effect of different types of local regions and feature selection criteria on object recognition. Our experiments show that local invariant descriptors are an appropriate representation for many different object classes. Our results also confirm the importance of appearance-based discriminative feature selection."

The model is a sparse representation of the object, and consists of a star topology configuration of parts modeling the output of a variety of feature detectors. The optimal choice of feature types (whose repertoire includes interest points, curves and regions) is made automatically. In recognition, the model may be applied efficiently in an exhaustive manner, bypassing the need for feature detectors, to give the globally optimal match within a query image. The approach is demonstrated on a wide variety of categories, and delivers both successful classification and localization of the object within the image."

Following a common consensus in the field, we do not assume that a figure- ground segmentation is available prior to recognition. However, in contrast to most standard approaches for object class recognition, our approach automati- cally segments the object as a result of the categorization. This combination of recognition and segmentation into one process is made pos- sible by our use of an Implicit Shape Model, which integrates both into a common probabilistic framework. In addition to the recognition and segmentation result, it also generates a per-pixel confidence measure specifying the area that supports a hypothesis and how much it can be trusted. We use this confidence to derive a nat- ural extension of the approach to handle multiple objects in a scene and resolve ambiguities between overlapping hypotheses with a novel MDL-based criterion. In addition, we present an extensive evaluation of our method on a standard dataset for car detection and compare its performance to existing methods from the literature. Our results show that the proposed method significantly outper- forms previously published methods while needing one order of magnitude less training examples. Finally, we present results for articulated objects, which show that the proposed method can categorize and segment unfamiliar objects in differ- ent articulations and with widely varying texture patterns, even under significant partial occlusion."

In order to improve performance, recent methods have begun to incorporate top-down cues, or object information, into segmentation. In this paper, we propose an approach to utilizing category-based information in segmentation, through a formulation as an image labelling problem. Our approach exploits bottom-up image cues to create an over-segmented representation of an image. The segments are then merged by assigning labels that correspond to the object category. The model is trained on a database of images, and is designed to be modular: it learns a number of image contexts, which simplify training and extend the range of object classes and image database size that the system can handle. The learning method estimates model parameters by maximizing a lower bound of the data likelihood. We examine performance on three real-world image databases, and compare our system to a standard classifier and other conditional random field approaches, as well as a bottom-up segmentation method."

Rather than focusing on local features and their consistencies in the image data, our approach aims at extracting the global impression of an image. We treat image segmentation as a graph partitioning problem and propose a novel global criterion, the normalized cut, for segmenting the graph. The normalized cut criterion measures both the total dissimilarity between the different groups as well as the total similarity within the groups. We show that an efficient computational technique based on a generalized eigenvalue problem can be used to optimize this criterion. We have applied this approach to segmenting static images and found results very encouraging."

Our Layout Consistent Random Field (LayoutCRF) model then imposes asymmetric local spatial constraints on these labels to ensure the consistent layout of parts whilst allowing for object deformation. Arbitrary occlusions of the object are handled by avoiding the assumption that the whole object is visible. The resulting system is both efficient to train and to apply to novel images, due to a novel annealed layout-consistent expansion move algorithm paired with a randomised decision tree classifier. We apply our technique to images of cars and faces and demonstrate state-of-the-art detection and segmentation performance even in the presence of partial occlusion."

The features are invariant to image scale and rotation, and are shown to provide robust matching across a substantial range of affine distortion, change in 3D viewpoint, addition of noise, and change in illumination. The features are highly distinctive, in the sense that a single feature can be correctly matched with high probability against a large database of features from many images. This paper also describes an approach to using these features for object recognition. The recognition proceeds by matching individual features to a database of features from known objects using a fast nearest-neighbor algorithm, followed by a Hough transform to identify clusters belonging to a single object, and finally performing verification through least-squares solution for consistent pose parameters. This approach to recognition can robustly identify objects among clutter and occlusion while achieving near real-time performance."

While impressive achievements have been made in pattern classification problems such as handwritten character recognition, face detection, speaker identification, and prediction of gene function, it is even more exciting that researchers are on the verge of introducing systems that can perform large-scale combinatorial analyses of data, decomposing the data into interacting components. For example, computational methods for automatic scene analysis are now emerging in the computer vision community. These methods decompose an input image into its constituent objects, lighting conditions, motion patterns, etc. Two of the main challenges are finding effective representations and models in specific applications and finding efficient algorithms for inference and learning in these models. In this paper, we advocate the use of graph-based probability models and their associated inference and learning algorithms. We review exact techniques and various approximate, computationally efficient techniques, including iterated conditional modes, the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm, Gibbs sampling, the mean field method, variational techniques, structured variational techniques and the sum-product algorithm (\"loopy\" belief propagation). We describe how each technique can be applied in a vision model of multiple, occluding objects and contrast the behaviors and performances of the techniques using a unifying cost function, free energy."

Scale Saliency is a novel method for measuring the saliency of image regions and selecting optimal scales for their analysis. The model underlying the algorithm deems image regions salient if they are simultaneously unpredictable in some feature-space and over scale. The algorithm possesses a number of attractive properties: invariance to planar rotation, scaling, intensity shifts and translation; robustness to noise, changes in viewpoint, and intensity scalings. Moreover, the approach offers a more general model of feature saliency compared with conventional ones, such as those based on kernel convolution, for example wavelet analysis, since such techniques define saliency and scale only with respect to a particular set of basis morphologies. Finally, we present a generalised version of the original algorithm which is invariant to affine transformations."

This process provides accurate delineation of object boundaries that cannot be achieved by either the top-down or bottom-up approach alone. The top-down approach uses object representation learned from examples to detect an object in a given input image and provide an approximation to its figure-ground segmentation. The bottom-up approach uses image-based criteria to define coherent groups of pixels that are likely to belong together to either the figure or the background part. The combination provides a final segmentation that draws on the relative merits of both approaches: The result is as close as possible to the top-down approximation, but is also constrained by the bottom-up process to be consistent with significant image discontinuities. We construct a global cost function that represents these top-down and bottom-up requirements. We then show how the global minimum of this function can be efficiently found by applying the sum-product algorithm. This algorithm also provides a confidence map that can be used to identify image regions where additional top-down or bottom-up information may further improve the segmentation. Our experiments show that the results derived from the algorithm are superior to results given by a pure top-down or pure bottom-up approach. The scheme has broad applicability, enabling the combined use of a range of existing bottom-up and top-down segmentations."

This difficulty has lead to recent top-down segmentation algorithms that are based on class-specific image information. Despite the success of top-down algorithms, they often give coarse segmentations that can be significantly refined using low-level cues. This raises the question of how to combine both top-down and bottom-up cues in a principled manner.In this paper we approach this problem using supervised learning. Given a training set of ground truth segmentations we train a fragment-based segmentation algorithm which takes into account both bottom-up and top-down cues simultaneously, in contrast to most existing algorithms which train top-down and bottom-up modules separately. We formulate the problem in the framework of Conditional Random Fields (CRF) and derive a feature induction algorithm for CRF, which allows us to efficiently search over thousands of candidate fragments. Whereas pure top-down algorithms often require hundreds of fragments, our simultaneous learning procedure yields algorithms with a handful of fragments that are combined with low-level cues to efficiently compute high quality segmentations."

The major restriction is that the energy function's smoothness term must only involve pairs of pixels. We propose two algorithms that use graph cuts to compute a local minimum even when very large moves are allowed. The first move we consider is an /spl alpha/-/spl beta/-swap: for a pair of labels /spl alpha/,/spl beta/, this move exchanges the labels between an arbitrary set of pixels labeled a and another arbitrary set labeled /spl beta/. Our first algorithm generates a labeling such that there is no swap move that decreases the energy. The second move we consider is an /spl alpha/-expansion: for a label a, this move assigns an arbitrary set of pixels the label /spl alpha/. Our second algorithm, which requires the smoothness term to be a metric, generates a labeling such that there is no expansion move that decreases the energy. Moreover, this solution is within a known factor of the global minimum. We experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on image restoration, stereo and motion."

Conditional training is even more difficult, because the partition function depends not only on the parameters, but also on the observed input, requiring repeated inference over each training example. An appealing idea for such models is to independently train a local undirected classifier over each clique, afterwards combining the learned weights into a single global model. In this paper, we show that this piecewise method can be justified as minimizing a new family of upper bounds on the log partition function. On three natural-language data sets, piecewise training is more accurate than pseudolikelihood, and often performs comparably to global training using belief propagation."
