                "text": "We present a new approach for modeling multi-modal data sets, focusing on the specific case of segmented images with associated text. Learning the joint distribution of image regions and words has many applications. We consider in detail predicting words associated with whole images (auto-annotation) and corresponding to particular image regions (region naming). Auto-annotation might help organize and access large collections of images. Region naming is a model of object recognition as a process of translating image regions to words, much as one might translate from one language to another. Learning the relationships between image regions and semantic correlates (words) is an interesting example of multi-modal data mining, particularly because it is typically hard to apply data mining techniques to collections of images. We develop a number of models for the joint distribution of image regions and words, including several which explicitly learn the correspondence between regions and words. We study multi-modal and correspondence extensions to Hofmann's hierarchical clustering/aspect model, a translation model adapted from statistical machine translation (Brown et al.), and a multi-modal extension to mixture of latent Dirichlet allocation (MoM-LDA). All models are assessed using a large collection of annotated images of real scenes. We study in depth the difficult problem of measuring performance. For the annotation task, we look at prediction performance on held out data. We present three alternative measures, oriented toward different types of task. Measuring the performance of correspondence methods is harder, because one must determine whether a word has been placed on the right region of an image. We can use annotation performance as a proxy measure, but accurate measurement requires hand labeled data, and thus must occur on a smaller scale. We show results using both an annotation proxy, and manually labeled data."

Firstly, images are segmented into regions, which are classified into region types using a variety of features. A mapping between region types and keywords supplied with the images, is then learned, using a method based around EM. This process is analogous with learning a lexicon from an aligned bitext. For the implementation we describe, these words are nouns taken from a large vocabulary. On a large test set, the method can predict numerous words with high accuracy. Simple methods identify words that cannot be predicted well. We show how to cluster words that individually are difficult to predict into clusters that can be predicted well -- for example, we cannot predict the distinction between train and locomotive using the current set of features, but we can predict the underlying concept. The method is trained on a substantial collection of images. Extensive experimental results illustrate the strengths and weaknesses of the approach."

In our approach, each image in the database is segmented to region; associated with homogenous color, texture, and shape features. By exploiting regional statistical information in each image and employing a vector quantization method, a uniform and sparse region-based representation is achieved. With this representation a probabilistic model based on statistical-hidden-class assumptions of the image database is obtained, to which expectation-maximization (EM) technique is applied to analyze semantic concepts hidden in the database. An elaborated retrieval algorithm is designed to support the probabilistic model. The semantic similarity is measured through integrating the posterior probabilities of the transformed query image, as well as a constructed negative example, to the discovered semantic concepts. The proposed approach has a solid statistical foundation and the experimental evaluations on a database of 10,000 general-purposed images demonstrate its promise of the effectiveness."

Following a common consensus in the field, we do not assume that a figure- ground segmentation is available prior to recognition. However, in contrast to most standard approaches for object class recognition, our approach automati- cally segments the object as a result of the categorization. This combination of recognition and segmentation into one process is made pos- sible by our use of an Implicit Shape Model, which integrates both into a common probabilistic framework. In addition to the recognition and segmentation result, it also generates a per-pixel confidence measure specifying the area that supports a hypothesis and how much it can be trusted. We use this confidence to derive a nat- ural extension of the approach to handle multiple objects in a scene and resolve ambiguities between overlapping hypotheses with a novel MDL-based criterion. In addition, we present an extensive evaluation of our method on a standard dataset for car detection and compare its performance to existing methods from the literature. Our results show that the proposed method significantly outper- forms previously published methods while needing one order of magnitude less training examples. Finally, we present results for articulated objects, which show that the proposed method can categorize and segment unfamiliar objects in differ- ent articulations and with widely varying texture patterns, even under significant partial occlusion."

Objects are modeled as flexible constellations of parts. A probabilistic representation is used for all aspects of the object: shape, appearance, occlusion and relative scale. An entropy-based feature detector is used to select regions and their scale within the image. In learning the parameters of the scale-invariant object model are estimated. This is done using expectation-maximization in a maximum-likelihood setting. In recognition, this model is used in a Bayesian manner to classify images. The flexible nature of the model is demonstrated by excellent results over a range of datasets including geometrically constrained classes (e.g. faces, cars) and flexible objects (such as animals)."

The object is represented by a set of viewpoint invariant region descriptors so that recognition can proceed successfully despite changes in viewpoint, illumination and partial occlusion. The temporal continuity of the video within a shot is used to track the regions in order to reject unstable regions and reduce the effects of noise in the descriptors. The analogy with text retrieval is in the implementation where matches on descriptors are pre-computed (using vector quantization), and inverted file systems and document rankings are used. The result is that retrieved is immediate, returning a ranked list of key frames/shots in the manner of Google. The method is illustrated for matching in two full length feature films."

                "text": "In this paper we describe the first stage of a new learning system for object detection and recognition. For our system we propose Boosting (5) as the underlying learning technique. This allows the use of very diverse sets of visual features in the learning process within a com- mon framework: Boosting \u2014 together with a weak hypotheses finder \u2014 may choose very inhomogeneous features as most relevant for combina- tion into a final hypothesis. As another advantage the weak hypotheses finder may search the weak hypotheses space without explicit calculation of all available hypotheses, reducing computation time. This contrasts the related work of Agarwal and Roth (1) where Winnow was used as learning algorithm and all weak hypotheses were calculated explicitly. In our first empirical evaluation we use four types of local descriptors: two basic ones consisting of a set of grayvalues and intensity moments and two high level descriptors: moment invariants (8) and SIFTs (12). The descriptors are calculated from local patches detected by an inter- est point operator. The weak hypotheses finder selects one of the local patches and one type of local descriptor and efficiently searches for the most discriminative similarity threshold. This differs from other work on Boosting for object recognition where simple rectangular hypotheses (22) or complex classifiers (20) have been used. In relatively simple images, where the objects are prominent, our approach yields results comparable to the state-of-the-art (3). But we also obtain very good results on more complex images, where the objects are located in arbitrary positions, poses, and scales in the images. These results indicate that our flexible approach, which also allows the inclusion of features from segmented re- gions and even spatial relationships, leads us a significant step towards generic object recognition."

We focus on a particular type of model where objects are represented as flexible constellations of rigid parts (features). The variability within a class is represented by a joint probability density function (pdf) on the shape of the constellation and the output of part detectors. In a first stage, the method automatically identifies distinctive parts in the training set by applying a clustering algorithm to patterns selected by an interest operator. It then learns the statistical shape model using expectation maximization. The method achieves very good classification results on human faces and rear views of cars."

This bag of keypoints method is based on vector quantization of affine invariant descriptors of image patches. We propose and compare two alternative implementations using different classifiers: Naive Bayes and SVM. The main advantages of the method are that it is simple, computationally efficient and intrinsically invariant. We present results for simultaneously classifying seven semantic visual categories. These results clearly demonstrate that the method is robust to background clutter and produces good categorization accuracy even without exploiting geometric information."

This work is distinguished by three key contributions. The first is the introduction of a new image representation called the \"integral image\" which allows the features used by our detector to be computed very quickly. The second is a learning algorithm, based on AdaBoost, which selects a small number of critical visual features from a larger set and yields extremely efficient classifiers. The third contribution is a method for combining increasingly more complex classifiers in a \"cascade\" which allows background regions of the image to be quickly discarded while spending more computation on promising object-like regions. The cascade can be viewed as an object specific focus-of-attention mechanism which unlike previous approaches provides statistical guarantees that discarded regions are unlikely to contain the object of interest. In the domain of face detection the system yields detection rates comparable to the best previous systems. Used in real-time applications, the detector runs at 15 frames per second without resorting to image differencing or skin color detection."

In contrast to the latter method which stems from linear algebra and performs a Singular Value Decomposition of co-occurrence tables, the proposed technique uses a generative latent class model to perform a probabilistic mixture decomposition. This results in a more principled approach with a solid foundation in statistical inference. More precisely, we propose to make use of a temperature controlled version of the Expectation Maximization algorithm for model fitting, which has shown excellent performance in practice. Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis has many applications, most prominently in information retrieval, natural language processing, machine learning from text, and in related areas. The paper presents perplexity results for different types of text and linguistic data collections and discusses an application in automated document indexing. The experiments indicate substantial and consistent improvements of the probabilistic method over standard Latent Semantic Analysis."

Users are not interested any longer in retrieving visually similar content, but they expect retrieval systems to also find documents with similar semantic content. Bridging the gap between low-level features and semantic content is a challenging task necessary for future retrieval systems. Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) was successfully introduced to efficiently index text documents by detecting synonyms and the polysemy of words. We have successfully proposed an adaptation of LSA to model video content for object retrieval and semantic content estimation. Following this idea we now present a new model composed of multiple LSA\u2019s (M-LSA) to better represent the video content. In the experimental section, we make a comparison of LSA and M-LSA on two problems, namely object retrieval and semantic content estimation."

The features are invariant to image scaling, translation, and rotation, and partially invariant to illumination changes and affine or 3D projection. These features share similar properties with neurons in inferior temporal cortex that are used for object recognition in primate vision. Features are efficiently detected through a staged filtering approach that identifies stable points in scale space. Image keys are created that allow for local geometric deformations by representing blurred image gradients in multiple orientation planes and at multiple scales. The keys are used as input to a nearest neighbor indexing method that identifies candidate object matches. Final verification of each match is achieved by finding a low residual least squares solution for the unknown model parameters. Experimental results show that robust object recognition can be achieved in cluttered partially occluded images with a computation time of under 2 seconds."

We assume that the number of mixture components is unknown a priori and is to be inferred from the data. In this setting it is natural to consider sets of Dirichlet processes, one for each group, where the well-known clustering property of the Dirichlet process provides a nonparametric prior for the number of mixture components within each group. Given our desire to tie the mixture models in the various groups, we consider a hierarchical model, specifically one in which the base measure for the child Dirichlet processes is itself distributed according to a Dirichlet process. Such a base measure being discrete, the child Dirichlet processes necessarily share atoms. Thus, as desired, the mixture models in the different groups necessarily share mixture components. We discuss representations of hierarchical Dirichlet processes in terms of a stick-breaking process, and a generalization of the Chinese restaurant process that we refer to as the \u201cChinese restaurant franchise.\u201d We present Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms for posterior inference in hierarchical Dirichlet process mixtures and describe applications to problems in information retrieval and text modeling."

In contrast in the case of widely separated views, methods have generally been restricted to two or three views.In this paper we investigate the problem of establishing relative viewpoints given a large number of images where no ordering information is provided. A typical application would be where images are obtained from different sources or at different times: both the viewpoint (position, orientation, scale) and lighting conditions may vary significantly over the data set.Such a problem is not fundamentally amenable to exhaustive pair wise and triplet wide baseline matching because this would be prohibitively expensive as the number of views increases. Instead, we investiate how a combination of image invariants, covariants, and multiple view relations can be used in concord to enable efficient multiple view matching. The result is a matching algorithm which is linear in the number of views.The methods are illustrated on several real image data sets. The output enables an image based technique for navigating in a 3D scene, moving from one image to whichever image is the next most appropriate."

Using this method, we have developed the first algorithm that can reliably detect human faces with out-of-plane rotation and the first algorithm that can reliably detect passenger cars over a wide range of viewpoints."

A new set of image elements that are put into correspondence, the so called extremal regions, is introduced. Extremal regions possess highly desirable properties: the set is closed under 1. continuous (and thus projective) transformation of image coordinates and 2. monotonic transformation of image intensities. An efficient (near linear complexity) and practically fast detection algorithm (near frame rate) is presented for an affinely-invariant stable subset of extremal regions, the maximally stable extremal regions (MSER). A new robust similarity measure for establishing tentative correspondences is proposed. The robustness ensures that invariants from multiple measurement regions (regions obtained by invariant constructions from extremal regions), some that are significantly larger (and hence discriminative) than the MSERs, may be used to establish tentative correspondences. The high utility of MSERs, multiple measurement regions and the robust metric is demonstrated in wide-baseline experiments on image pairs from both indoor and outdoor scenes. Significant change of scale (3.5\u00d7), illumination conditions, out-of-plane rotation, occlusion , locally anisotropic scale change and 3D translation of the viewpoint are all present in the test problems. Good estimates of epipolar geometry (average distance from corresponding points to the epipolar line below 0.09 of the inter-pixel distance) are obtained."

Our method can deal with significant affine transformations including large scale changes. Such transformations introduce significant changes in the point location as well as in the scale and the shape of the neighbourhood of an interest point. Our approach allows to solve for these problems simultaneously. It is based on three key ideas : 1) The second moment matrix computed in a point can be used to normalize a region in an affine invariant way (skew and stretch). 2) The scale of the local structure is indicated by local extrema of normalized derivatives over scale. 3) An affine-adapted Harris detector determines the location of interest points. A multi-scale version of this detector is used for initialization. An iterative algorithm then modifies location, scale and neighbourhood of each point and converges to affine invariant points. For matching and recognition, the image is characterized by a set of affine invariant points; the affine transformation associated with each point allows the computation of an affine invariant descriptor which is also invariant to affine illumination changes. A quantitative comparison of our detector with existing ones shows a significant improvement in the presence of large affine deformations. Experimental results for wide baseline matching show an excellent performance in the presence of large perspective transformations including significant scale changes. Results for recognition are very good for a database with more than 5000 images."

The results on the index of resolvability demonstrate the statistical effectiveness of the minimum description-length principle as a method of inference. The minimum complexity estimator converges to true density nearly as fast as an estimator based on prior knowledge of the true subclass of densities. Interpretations and basic properties of minimum complexity estimators are discussed. Some regression and classification problems that can be examined from the minimum description-length framework are considered. >"
