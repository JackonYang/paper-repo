This paper attempts to define these features, and describes a prototype system which satisfies the design objectives. The system has two stages. In the first stage, document image segmentation is carried out using three basic features and also knowledge of document layout rules. Furthermore, projection profiles of a text line are employed to extract a wide variety of characters. In the second stage, multifont character recognition is performed using feature vectors which represent stroke complexity, direction, connectivity and relative location of individual characters. A prototype system combining these two stages is described. The system consists of three special hardware units each connected with the one host computer. Recognition experiments with the prototype system are conducted for a range of printed documents. It is confirmed that the method proposed here is capable of reading different types of printed documents containing text lines and charts at an accuracy rate of 95 to 97 percent."
