For signals such as natural images that admit such sparse representations, it is now well established that these models are well suited to restoration tasks. In this context, learning the dictionary amounts to solving a large-scale matrix factorization problem, which can be done efficiently with classical optimization tools. The same approach has also been used for learning features from data for other purposes, e.g., image classification, but tuning the dictionary in a supervised way for these tasks has proven to be more difficult. In this paper, we present a general formulation for supervised dictionary learning adapted to a wide variety of tasks, and present an efficient algorithm for solving the corresponding optimization problem. Experiments on handwritten digit classification, digital art identification, nonlinear inverse image problems, and compressed sensing demonstrate that our approach is effective in large-scale settings, and is well suited to supervised and semi-supervised classification, as well as regression tasks for data that admit sparse representations."

We propose an objective function consisting of two components: entropy rate of a random walk on a graph and a discriminative term. Dictionary learning is achieved by finding a graph topology which maximizes the objective function. By exploiting the monotonicity and submodularity properties of the objective function and the matroid constraint, we present a highly efficient greedy-based optimization algorithm. It is more than an order of magnitude faster than several recently proposed dictionary learning approaches. Moreover, the greedy algorithm gives a near-optimal solution with a (1/2)-approximation bound. Our approach yields dictionaries having the property that feature points from the same class have very similar sparse codes. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms several recently proposed dictionary learning techniques for face, action and object category recognition."

Informally, the quantized representation retains as much information as possible for classifying the feature vector correctly. We derive an alternating minimization procedure for simultaneously learning codebooks in the Euclidean feature space and in the simplex of posterior class distributions. The resulting quantizer can be used to encode unlabeled points outside the training set and to predict their posterior class distributions, and has an elegant interpretation in terms of lossless source coding. The proposed method is validated on synthetic and real data sets and is applied to two diverse problems: learning discriminative visual vocabularies for bag-of-features image classification and image segmentation."

The supervised dictionary training is performed via back-projection, by minimizing the training error of classifying the image level features, which are extracted by max pooling over the sparse codes within a spatial pyramid. Such a max pooling procedure across multiple spatial scales offer the model translation invariant properties, similar to the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Experiments show that our supervised dictionary improves the performance of the proposed model significantly over the unsupervised dictionary, leading to state-of-the-art performance on diverse image databases. Further more, our supervised model targets learning linear features, implying its great potential in handling large scale datasets in real applications."

In this paper, a maximum margin method is proposed for MIML which directly exploits the connections between instances and labels.

Since this representation is typically constructed using unsupervised clustering, the resulting visual words may not capture the desired information. Recent work has explored the construction of discriminative visual codebooks that explicitly consider object category information. However, since the codebook generation process is still disconnected from that of classifier training, the set of resulting visual words, while individually discriminative, may not be those best suited for the classifier. This paper proposes a novel optimization framework that unifies codebook generation with classifier training. In our approach, each image feature is encoded by a sequence of ldquovisual bitsrdquo optimized for each category. An image, which can contain objects from multiple categories, is represented using aggregates of visual bits for each category. Classifiers associated with different categories determine how well a given image corresponds to each category. Based on the performance of these classifiers on the training data, we augment the visual words by generating additional bits. The classifiers are then updated to incorporate the new representation. These two phases are repeated until the desired performance is achieved. Experiments compare our approach to standard clustering-based methods and with state-of-the-art discriminative visual codebook generation. The significant improvements over previous techniques clearly demonstrate the value of unifying representation and classification into a single optimization framework."

The desired patches need to satisfy two requirements: 1) to be representative, they need to occur frequently enough in the visual world; 2) to be discriminative, they need to be different enough from the rest of the visual world. The patches could correspond to parts, objects, \"visual phrases\", etc. but are not restricted to be any one of them. We pose this as an unsupervised discriminative clustering problem on a huge dataset of image patches. We use an iterative procedure which alternates between clustering and training discriminative classifiers, while applying careful cross-validation at each step to prevent overfitting. The paper experimentally demonstrates the effectiveness of discriminative patches as an unsupervised mid-level visual representation, suggesting that it could be used in place of visual words for many tasks. Furthermore, discriminative patches can also be used in a supervised regime, such as scene classification, where they demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on the MIT Indoor-67 dataset."

Large numbers of descriptors and large codebooks are needed for good results and this becomes slow using k-means. We introduce Extremely Randomized Clustering Forests - ensembles of randomly created clustering trees - and show that these provide more accurate results, much faster training and testing and good resistance to background clutter in several state-of-the-art image classification tasks."

In the last decade, discriminative learning approaches have proven effective in detecting rigid objects, achieving very low false positives rates. The field has also seen a resurgence of part-based recognition methods, with impressive results on highly articulated, diverse object categories. In this paper we propose a discriminative learning approach for detection that is inspired by part-based recognition approaches. Our method, Multiple Component Learning (mcl), automatically learns individual component classifiers and combines these into an overall classifier. Unlike previous methods, which rely on either fairly restricted part models or labeled part data, mcl learns powerful component classifiers in a weakly supervised manner, where object labels are provided but part labels are not. The basis of mcl lies in learning a set classifier; we achieve this by combining boosting with weakly supervised learning, specifically the Multiple Instance Learning framework (mil). mcl is general, and we demonstrate results on a range of data from computer audition and computer vision. In particular, mcl outperforms all existing methods on the challenging INRIA pedestrian detection dataset, and unlike methods that are not part-based, mcl is quite robust to occlusions."

This paper presents a simple but effective coding scheme called Locality-constrained Linear Coding (LLC) in place of the VQ coding in traditional SPM. LLC utilizes the locality constraints to project each descriptor into its local-coordinate system, and the projected coordinates are integrated by max pooling to generate the final representation. With linear classifier, the proposed approach performs remarkably better than the traditional nonlinear SPM, achieving state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks. Compared with the sparse coding strategy [22], the objective function used by LLC has an analytical solution. In addition, the paper proposes a fast approximated LLC method by first performing a K-nearest-neighbor search and then solving a constrained least square fitting problem, bearing computational complexity of O(M + K2). Hence even with very large codebooks, our system can still process multiple frames per second. This efficiency significantly adds to the practical values of LLC for real applications."

Large numbers of descriptors and large codebooks are required for good results and this becomes slow using k-means. We introduce Extremely Randomized Clustering Forests-ensembles of randomly created clustering trees-and show that they provide more accurate results, much faster training and testing, and good resistance to background clutter. Second, an efficient image classification method is proposed. It combines ERC-Forests and saliency maps very closely with the extraction of image information. For a given image, a classifier builds a saliency map online and uses it to classify the image. We show in several state-of-the-art image classification tasks that this method can speed up the classification process enormously. Finally, we show that the proposed ERC-Forests can also be used very successfully for learning distance between images. The distance computation algorithm consists of learning the characteristic differences between local descriptors sampled from pairs of same or different objects. These differences are vector quantized by ERC-Forests and the similarity measure is computed from this quantization. The similarity measure has been evaluated on four very different datasets and always outperforms the state-of-the-art competitive approaches."

Using complementary priors, we derive a fast, greedy algorithm that can learn deep, directed belief networks one layer at a time, provided the top two layers form an undirected associative memory. The fast, greedy algorithm is used to initialize a slower learning procedure that fine-tunes the weights using a contrastive version of the wake-sleep algorithm. After fine-tuning, a network with three hidden layers forms a very good generative model of the joint distribution of handwritten digit images and their labels. This generative model gives better digit classification than the best discriminative learning algorithms. The low-dimensional manifolds on which the digits lie are modeled by long ravines in the free-energy landscape of the top-level associative memory, and it is easy to explore these ravines by using the directed connections to display what the associative memory has in mind."

So far, much work has been conducted in solving multiple instance classification and multiple instance regression problems, where supervised training patterns are given as bags and each bag consists of some instances. But the research on unsupervised multiple instance clustering is still limited. This paper formulates a novel Maximum Margin Multiple Instance Clustering (M3IC) problem for the multiple instance clustering task. To avoid solving a nonconvex optimization problem directly, M3IC is further relaxed, which enables an efficient optimization solution with a combination of Constrained Concave-Convex Procedure (CCCP) and the Cutting Plane method. Furthermore, this paper analyzes some important properties of the proposed method and the relationship between the proposed method and some other related ones. An extensive set of empirical results demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method against existing research for both effectiveness and efficiency."

Compact and yet discriminative appearance-based object class models are automatically learned from a set of training images. The method is simple and extremely fast, making it suitable for many applications such as semantic image retrieval, Web search, and interactive image editing. It classifies a region according to the proportions of different visual words (clusters in feature space). The specific visual words and the typical proportions in each object are learned from a segmented training set. The main contribution of this paper is twofold: i) an optimally compact visual dictionary is learned by pair-wise merging of visual words from an initially large dictionary. The final visual words are described by GMMs. ii) A novel statistical measure of discrimination is proposed which is optimized by each merge operation. High classification accuracy is demonstrated for nine object classes on photographs of real objects viewed under general lighting conditions, poses and viewpoints. The set of test images used for validation comprise: i) photographs acquired by us, ii) images from the Web and iii) images from the recently released Pascal dataset. The proposed algorithm performs well on both texture-rich objects (e.g. grass, sky, trees) and structure-rich ones (e.g. cars, bikes, planes)"

Our new representation combines the benefits of spatial pyramid representation using nonlinear feature coding and latent Support Vector Machine (LSVM) to train a set of Latent Pyramidal Regions (LPR). Each of our LPRs captures a discriminative characteristic of the scenes and is trained by searching over all possible sub-windows of the images in a latent SVM training procedure. Each LPR is represented in a spatial pyramid and uses non-linear locality constraint coding for learning both shape and texture patterns of the scene. The final response of the LPRs form a single feature vector which we call the LPR representation and can be used for the classification task. We tested our proposed scene representation model in three datasets which contain a variety of scene categories (15-Scenes, UIUC-Sports and MIT-indoor). Our LPR representation obtains state-of-the-art results on all these datasets which shows that it can simultaneously model the global and local scene characteristics in a single framework and is general enough to be used for both indoor and outdoor scene classification."

Codebooks are usually constructed by using a method such as k-means to cluster the descriptor vectors of patches sampled either densely ('textons') or sparsely ('bags of features' based on key-points or salience measures) from a set of training images. This works well for texture analysis in homogeneous images, but the images that arise in natural object recognition tasks have far less uniform statistics. We show that for dense sampling, k-means over-adapts to this, clustering centres almost exclusively around the densest few regions in descriptor space and thus failing to code other informative regions. This gives suboptimal codes that are no better than using randomly selected centres. We describe a scalable acceptance-radius based clusterer that generates better codebooks and study its performance on several image classification tasks. We also show that dense representations outperform equivalent keypoint based ones on these tasks and that SVM or mutual information based feature selection starting from a dense codebook further improves the performance."

However, most popular visual descriptors are histograms of image measurements. It has been shown that the Histogram Intersection Kernel (HIK) is more effective than the Euclidean distance in supervised learning tasks with histogram features. In this paper, we demonstrate that HIK can also be used in an unsupervised manner to significantly improve the generation of visual codebooks. We propose a histogram kernel k-means algorithm which is easy to implement and runs almost as fast as k-means. The HIK codebook has consistently higher recognition accuracy over k-means codebooks by 2\u20134%. In addition, we propose a one-class SVM formulation to create more effective visual code words which can achieve even higher accuracy. The proposed method has established new state-of-the-art performance numbers for 3 popular benchmark datasets on object and scene recognition. In addition, we show that the standard k-median clustering method can be used for visual codebook generation and can act as a compromise between HIK and k-means approaches."

Examples include locality-constrained linear encoding [23], improved Fisher encoding [17], super vector encoding [27], and kernel codebook encoding [20]. While several authors have reported very good results on the challenging PASCAL VOC classification data by means of these new techniques, differences in the feature computation and learning algorithms, missing details in the description of the methods, and different tuning of the various components, make it impossible to compare directly these methods and hard to reproduce the results reported. This paper addresses these shortcomings by carrying out a rigorous evaluation of these new techniques by: (1) fixing the other elements of the pipeline (features, learning, tuning); (2) disclosing all the implementation details, and (3) identifying both those aspects of each method which are particularly important to achieve good performance, and those aspects which are less critical. This allows a consistent comparative analysis of these encoding methods. Several conclusions drawn from our analysis cannot be inferred from the original publications."

Our system is able to represent highly variable object classes and achieves state-of-the-art results in the PASCAL object detection challenges. While deformable part models have become quite popular, their value had not been demonstrated on difficult benchmarks such as the PASCAL data sets. Our system relies on new methods for discriminative training with partially labeled data. We combine a margin-sensitive approach for data-mining hard negative examples with a formalism we call latent SVM. A latent SVM is a reformulation of MI--SVM in terms of latent variables. A latent SVM is semiconvex, and the training problem becomes convex once latent information is specified for the positive examples. This leads to an iterative training algorithm that alternates between fixing latent values for positive examples and optimizing the latent SVM objective function."

Our approach represents a scene as a collection of region models (\u201cparts\u201d) arranged in a reconfigurable pattern. We partition an image into a predefined set of regions and use a latent variable to specify which region model is assigned to each image region. In our current implementation we use a bag of words representation to capture the appearance of an image region. The resulting method generalizes a spatial bag of words approach that relies on a fixed model for the bag of words in each image region. Our models can be trained using both generative and discriminative methods. In the generative setting we use the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to estimate model parameters from a collection of images with category labels. In the discriminative setting we use a latent structural SVM (LSSVM). We note that LSSVMs can be very sensitive to initialization and demonstrate that generative training with EM provides a good initialization for discriminative training with LSSVM."

However, existing maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) schemes can make the prediction model learning independent of latent topic discovery and result in an unbalanced prediction rule for scene classification. This paper presents a joint max-margin and max-likelihood learning method for upstream scene understanding models, in which latent topic discovery and prediction model estimation are closely coupled and well-balanced. The optimization problem is efficiently solved with a variational EM procedure, which iteratively solves an online loss-augmented SVM. We demonstrate the advantages of the large-margin approach on both an 8-category sports dataset and the 67-class MIT indoor scene dataset for scene categorization."

We address this problem using deformable part-based models (DPM's) with latent SVM training [6]. These models have been introduced for fully supervised training of object detectors, but we demonstrate that they are also capable of more open-ended learning of latent structure for such tasks as scene recognition and weakly supervised object localization. For scene recognition, DPM's can capture recurring visual elements and salient objects; in combination with standard global image features, they obtain state-of-the-art results on the MIT 67-category indoor scene dataset. For weakly supervised object localization, optimization over latent DPM parameters can discover the spatial extent of objects in cluttered training images without ground-truth bounding boxes. The resulting method outperforms a recent state-of-the-art weakly supervised object localization approach on the PASCAL-07 dataset."

For high level visual tasks, such low-level image representations are potentially not enough. In this paper, we propose a high-level image representation, called the Object Bank, where an image is represented as a scale-invariant response map of a large number of pre-trained generic object detectors, blind to the testing dataset or visual task. Leveraging on the Object Bank representation, superior performances on high level visual recognition tasks can be achieved with simple off-the-shelf classifiers such as logistic regression and linear SVM. Sparsity algorithms make our representation more efficient and scalable for large scene datasets, and reveal semantically meaningful feature patterns."

However, existing techniques restrict these properties to categorical labels (for example, a person is \u2018smiling\u2019 or not, a scene is \u2018dry\u2019 or not), and thus fail to capture more general semantic relationships. We propose to model relative attributes. Given training data stating how object/scene categories relate according to different attributes, we learn a ranking function per attribute. The learned ranking functions predict the relative strength of each property in novel images. We then build a generative model over the joint space of attribute ranking outputs, and propose a novel form of zero-shot learning in which the supervisor relates the unseen object category to previously seen objects via attributes (for example, \u2018bears are furrier than giraffes\u2019). We further show how the proposed relative attributes enable richer textual descriptions for new images, which in practice are more precise for human interpretation. We demonstrate the approach on datasets of faces and natural scenes, and show its clear advantages over traditional binary attribute prediction for these new tasks."

Unlike most of previous approaches which typically decompose a multiclass problem into multiple independent binary classification tasks, our notion of margin yields a direct method for training multiclass predictors. By using the dual of the optimization problem we are able to incorporate kernels with a compact set of constraints and decompose the dual problem into multiple optimization problems of reduced size. We describe an efficient fixed-point algorithm for solving the reduced optimization problems and prove its convergence. We then discuss technical details that yield significant running time improvements for large datasets. Finally, we describe various experiments with our approach comparing it to previously studied kernel-based methods. Our experiments indicate that for multiclass problems we attain state-of-the-art accuracy."

SPMSM is based on a recent image representation on a semantic probability simplex, which is now augmented with a rough encoding of spatial information. A connection between the semantic simplex and a Riemmanian manifold is established, so as to equip the architecture with a similarity measure that respects the manifold structure of the semantic space. It is then argued that the closed-form geodesic distance between two manifold points is a natural measure of similarity between images. This leads to a conditionally positive definite kernel that can be used with any SVM classifier. An approximation of the geodesic distance reveals connections to the well-known Bhattacharyya kernel, and is explored to derive an explicit feature embedding for this kernel, by simple square-rooting. This enables a low-complexity SVM implementation, using a linear SVM on the embedded features. Several experiments are reported, comparing SPMSM to state-of-the-art recognition methods. SPMSM is shown to achieve the best recognition rates in the literature for two large datasets (MIT Indoor and SUN) and rates equivalent or superior to the state-of-the-art on a number of smaller datasets. In all cases, the resulting SVM also has much smaller dimensionality and requires much fewer support vectors than previous classifiers. This guarantees much smaller complexity and suggests improved generalization beyond the datasets considered."

A large dataset comprising stereo image pairs of 50 uniform-colored toys under 36 azimuths, 9 elevations, and 6 lighting conditions was collected (for a total of 194,400 individual images). The objects were 10 instances of 5 generic categories: four-legged animals, human figures, airplanes, trucks, and cars. Five instances of each category were used for training, and the other five for testing. Low-resolution grayscale images of the objects with various amounts of variability and surrounding clutter were used for training and testing. Nearest neighbor methods, support vector machines, and convolutional networks, operating on raw pixels or on PCA-derived features were tested. Test error rates for unseen object instances placed on uniform backgrounds were around 13% for SVM and 7% for convolutional nets. On a segmentation/recognition task with highly cluttered images, SVM proved impractical, while convolutional nets yielded 16/7% error. A real-time version of the system was implemented that can detect and classify objects in natural scenes at around 10 frames per second."

The descriptor is the output of a large number of weakly trained object category classifiers on the image. The trained categories are selected from an ontology of visual concepts, but the intention is not to encode an explicit decomposition of the scene. Rather, we accept that existing object category classifiers often encode not the category per se but ancillary image characteristics; and that these ancillary characteristics can combine to represent visual classes unrelated to the constituent categories' semantic meanings. \n \nThe advantage of this descriptor is that it allows object-category queries to be made against image databases using efficient classifiers (efficient at test time) such as linear support vector machines, and allows these queries to be for novel categories. Even when the representation is reduced to 200 bytes per image, classification accuracy on object category recognition is comparable with the state of the art (36% versus 42%), but at orders of magnitude lower computational cost."

In this paper, we present a hierarchical ROI dictionary for spatial pooling, to beyond the widely used spatial pyramid in image classification literature. By utilizing the compositionality among ROIs, it captures rich spatial statistics via an efficient pooling algorithm in deep hierarchy. On this basis, we further employ partial least squares analysis to learn a more compact and discriminative image representation. The experimental results demonstrate superiority of the proposed hierarchical pooling method relative to spatial pyramid, on three benchmark datasets for image classification."

Orientation histograms, such as those in SIFT [16] and HOG [3], are the most successful and popular features for visual object and scene recognition. We highlight the kernel view of orientation histograms, and show that they are equivalent to a certain type of match kernels over image patches. This novel view allows us to design a family of kernel descriptors which provide a unified and principled framework to turn pixel attributes (gradient, color, local binary pattern, etc.) into compact patch-level features. In particular, we introduce three types of match kernels to measure similarities between image patches, and construct compact low-dimensional kernel descriptors from these match kernels using kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) [23]. Kernel descriptors are easy to design and can turn any type of pixel attribute into patch-level features. They outperform carefully tuned and sophisticated features including SIFT and deep belief networks. We report superior performance on standard image classification benchmarks: Scene-15, Caltech-101, CIFAR10 and CIFAR10-ImageNet."

This technique works by partitioning the image into increasingly fine sub-regions and computing histograms of local features found inside each sub-region. The resulting \"spatial pyramid\" is a simple and computationally efficient extension of an orderless bag-of-features image representation, and it shows significantly improved performance on challenging scene categorization tasks. Specifically, our proposed method exceeds the state of the art on the Caltech-101 database and achieves high accuracy on a large database of fifteen natural scene categories. The spatial pyramid framework also offers insights into the success of several recently proposed image descriptions, including Torralba\u2019s \"gist\" and Lowe\u2019s SIFT descriptors."

CENTRIST satisfies these properties and suits the place and scene recognition task. It is a holistic representation and has strong generalizability for category recognition. CENTRIST mainly encodes the structural properties within an image and suppresses detailed textural information. Our experiments demonstrate that CENTRIST outperforms the current state of the art in several place and scene recognition data sets, compared with other descriptors such as SIFT and Gist. Besides, it is easy to implement and evaluates extremely fast."

We postulate two criteria (1) It should be easy to find a poselet given an input image (2) it should be easy to localize the 3D configuration of the person conditioned on the detection of a poselet. To permit this we have built a new dataset, H3D, of annotations of humans in 2D photographs with 3D joint information, inferred using anthropometric constraints. This enables us to implement a data-driven search procedure for finding poselets that are tightly clustered in both 3D joint configuration space as well as 2D image appearance. The algorithm discovers poselets that correspond to frontal and profile faces, pedestrians, head and shoulder views, among others. Each poselet provides examples for training a linear SVM classifier which can then be run over the image in a multiscale scanning mode. The outputs of these poselet detectors can be thought of as an intermediate layer of nodes, on top of which one can run a second layer of classification or regression. We show how this permits detection and localization of torsos or keypoints such as left shoulder, nose, etc. Experimental results show that we obtain state of the art performance on people detection in the PASCAL VOC 2007 challenge, among other datasets. We are making publicly available both the H3D dataset as well as the poselet parameters for use by other researchers."

Doing so allows us not only to name familiar objects, but also: to report unusual aspects of a familiar object (\u201cspotty dog\u201d, not just \u201cdog\u201d); to say something about unfamiliar objects (\u201chairy and four-legged\u201d, not just \u201cunknown\u201d); and to learn how to recognize new objects with few or no visual examples. Rather than focusing on identity assignment, we make inferring attributes the core problem of recognition. These attributes can be semantic (\u201cspotty\u201d) or discriminative (\u201cdogs have it but sheep do not\u201d). Learning attributes presents a major new challenge: generalization across object categories, not just across instances within a category. In this paper, we also introduce a novel feature selection method for learning attributes that generalize well across categories.

However, the detailed annotation of cancer cells is often an ambiguous and challenging task. In this paper, we propose a new learning method, multiple clustered instance learning (MCIL), to classify, segment and cluster cancer cells in colon histopathology images. The proposed MCIL method simultaneously performs image-level classification (cancer vs. non-cancer image), pixel-level segmentation (cancer vs. non-cancer tissue), and patch-level clustering (cancer subclasses). We embed the clustering concept into the multiple instance learning (MIL) setting and derive a principled solution to perform the above three tasks in an integrated framework. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of MCIL in analyzing colon cancers."

We define an event in a static image as a human activity taking place in a specific environment. In this paper, we use a number of sport games such as snow boarding, rock climbing or badminton to demonstrate event classification. Our goal is to classify the event in the image as well as to provide a number of semantic labels to the objects and scene environment within the image. For example, given a rowing scene, our algorithm recognizes the event as rowing by classifying the environment as a lake and recognizing the critical objects in the image as athletes, rowing boat, water, etc. We achieve this integrative and holistic recognition through a generative graphical model. We have assembled a highly challenging database of 8 widely varied sport events. We show that our system is capable of classifying these event classes at 73.4% accuracy. While each component of the model contributes to the final recognition, using scene or objects alone cannot achieve this performance."

The procedure is based on a very low dimensional representation of the scene, that we term the Spatial Envelope. We propose a set of perceptual dimensions (naturalness, openness, roughness, expansion, ruggedness) that represent the dominant spatial structure of a scene. Then, we show that these dimensions may be reliably estimated using spectral and coarsely localized information. The model generates a multidimensional space in which scenes sharing membership in semantic categories (e.g., streets, highways, coasts) are projected closed together. The performance of the spatial envelope model shows that specific information about object shape or identity is not a requirement for scene categorization and that modeling a holistic representation of the scene informs about its probable semantic category."

Most scene recognition models that work well for outdoor scenes perform poorly in the indoor domain. The main difficulty is that while some indoor scenes (e.g. corridors) can be well characterized by global spatial properties, others (e.g, bookstores) are better characterized by the objects they contain. More generally, to address the indoor scenes recognition problem we need a model that can exploit local and global discriminative information. In this paper we propose a prototype based model that can successfully combine both sources of information. To test our approach we created a dataset of 67 indoor scenes categories (the largest available) covering a wide range of domains. The results show that our approach can significantly outperform a state of the art classifier for the task."
