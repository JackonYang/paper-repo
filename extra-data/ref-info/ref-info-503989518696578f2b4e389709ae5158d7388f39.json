Yet, the visual perception is clearly of complete surfaces, and this perception is consistent for different observers. Since mathematically the class of surfaces which could pass through the known boundary points provided by the stereo system is infinite and contains widely varying surfaces, the visual system must incorporate some additional constraints besides the known points in order to compute the complete surface. Using the image irradiance equation, we derive the surface consistency constraint, informally referred to as no news is good news. The constraint implies that the surface must agree with the information from stereo or motion correspondence. and not vary radically between these points. An explicit form of this surface consistency constraint is derived, by relating the probability of a zero-crossing in a region of the image to the variation in the local surface orientation of the surface, provided that the surface albedo and the illumination are roughly constant."

Yet the visual perception is clearly of complete surfaces. To account for this a computational theory of the interpolation of surfaces from visual information is presented. The problem is constrained by the fact that the surface must agree with the information from stereo or motion correspondence, and not vary radically between these points. Using the image irradiance equation, an explicit form of this surface consistency constraint can be derived. To determine which of two possible surfaces is more consistent with the surface consistency constraint, one must be able to compare the two surfaces. To do this, a functional from the space of possible functions to the real numbers is required. In this way, the surface most consistent with the visual information will be that which minimizes the functional. To ensure that the functional has a unique minimal surface, conditions on the form of the functional are derived. In particular, if the functional is a complete semi-norm that satisfies the parallelogram law, or the space of functions is a semi-Hilbert space and the functional is a semi-inner product, then there is a unique (to within possibly an element of the null space of the functional) surface that is most consistent with the visual information. It can be shown, based on the above conditions plus a condition of rotational symmetry, that there is a vector space of possible functionals that measure surface consistency, this vector space being spanned by the functional of quadratic variation and the functional of square Laplacian. Arguments based on the null spaces of the respective functionals are used to justify the choice of the quadratic variation as the optimal functional. Possible refinements to the theory, concerning the role of discontinuities in depth and the effects of applying the interpolation process to scenes containing more than one object, are discussed."

Support for this idea comes from three sources: the obvious utility of intrinsic characteristics for higher-level scene analysis; the apparent ability of humans to determine these characteristics, regardless of viewing conditions or familiarity with the scene; and a theoretical argument that such a description is obtainable, by a noncognitive and nonpurposive process, at least, for simple scene domains. The central problem in recovering intrinsic scene characteristics is that the information is confounded in the original light-intensity image: a single intensity value encodes all the characteristics of the corresponding scene point.

                "text": "An introduction is given to a theory of early visual information processing. The theory has been implemented, and examples are given of images at various stages of analysis. It is argued that the first step of consequence is to compute a primitive but rich description of the grey-level changes present in an image. The description is expressed in a vocabulary of kinds of intensity change (EDGE, SHADING-EDGE, EXTENDED-EDGE, LINE, BLOB etc.). Modifying parameters are bound to the elements in the description, specifying their POSITION, ORIENTATION, TERMINATION points, CONTRAST, SIZE and FUZZINESS. This description is obtained from the intensity array by fixed techniques, and it is called the primal sketch. For most images, the primal sketch is large and unwieldy. The second important step in visual information processing is to group its contents in a way that is appropriate for later recognition. From our ability to interpret drawings with little semantic content, one may infer the presence in our perceptual equipment of symbolic processes that can define \"place-tokens\" in an image in various ways, and can group them according to certain rules. Homomorphic techniques fail to account for many of these grouping phenomena, whose explanations require mechanisms of construction rather than mechanisms of detection. The necessary grouping of elements in the primal sketch may be achieved by a mechanism that has available the processes inferred from above, together with the ability to select items by first order discriminations acting on the elements' parameters. Only occasionally do these mechanisms use downward-flowing information about the contents of the particular image being processed. It is argued that \"non-attentive\" vision is in practice implemented by these grouping operations and first order discriminations acting on the primal sketch. The class of computations so obtained differs slightly from the class of second order operations on the intensity array. The extraction of a form from the primal sketch using these techniques amounts to the separation of figure from ground. It is concluded that most of the separation can be carried out by using techniques that do not depend upon the particular image in question. Therefore, figure-ground separation can normally precede the description of the shape of the extracted form. Up to this point, higher-level knowledge and purpose are brought to bear on only a few of the decisions taken during the processing. This relegates the widespread use of downward-flowing information to a later stage than is found in current machine-vision programs, and implies that such knowledge should influence the control of, rather than interfering with, the actual data-processing that is taking place lower down."

Therefore, implicit in the perceptual analysis of occluding contour must lie various assumptions about the viewed surfaces. The assumptions that seem most natural are (a) that the distinction between convex and concave segments reflects real properties of the viewed surface; and (b) that contiguous portions of contour arise from contiguous parts of the viewed surface \u2013 i. e. there are no invisible obscuring edges. It is proved that, for smooth surfaces, these assumptions are essentially equivalent to assuming that the viewed surface is a generalized cone. Methods are defined for finding the axis of such a cone, and for segmenting a surface constructed of several cones into its components, whose axes can then be found separately. These methods provide one link between an uninterpreted figure extracted from an image, and the 3-D representation theory of Marr & Nishihara (1977)."

In this paper, we apply this approach to the problem of representing three-dimensional shapes for the purpose of recognition. 1. Three criteria, accessibility, scope and uniqueness, and stability and sensitivity, are presented for judging the usefulness of a representation for shape recognition. 2. Three aspects of a representation\u2019s design are considered, (i) the representation\u2019s coordinate system, (ii) its primitives, which are the primary units of shape information used in the representation, and (iii) the organization the representation imposes on the information in its descriptions. 3. In terms of these design issues and the criteria presented, a shape representation for recognition should: (i) use an object-centred coordinate system, (ii) include volumetric primitives of varied sizes, and (iii) have a modular organization. A representation based on a shape\u2019s natural axes (for example the axes identified by a stick figure) follows directly from these choices. 4. The basic process for deriving a shape description in this representation must involve: (i) a means for identifying the natural axes of a shape in its image and (ii) a mechanism for transforming viewer-centred axis specifications to specifications in an object-centred coordinate system. 5. Shape recognition involves: (i) a collection of stored shape descriptions, and (ii) various indexes into the collection that allow a newly derived description to be associated with an appropriate stored description. The most important of these indexes allows shape recognition to proceed conservatively from the general to the specific based on the specificity of the information available from the image. 6. New constraints supplied by a conservative recognition process can be used to extract more information from the image. A relaxation process for carrying out this constraint analysis is described."

Workable schemes able to perform certain tasks performed by the visual system have been constructed and used as vehicles for investigating the problems faced by the visual system and its methods for solving them.Two major problems are treated: first, the correspondence problem, which concerns the identification of image elements that represent the same object at different times, thereby maintaining the perceptual identity of the object in motion or in change. The second problem is the three-dimensional interpretation of the changing image once a correspondence has been established.The author's computational approach to visual theory makes the work unique, and it should be of interest to psychologists working in visual perception and readers interested in cognitive studies in general, as well as computer scientists interested in machine vision, theoretical neurophysiologists, and philosophers of science."

                "text": "An algorithm is proposed for solving the stereoscopic matching problem. The algorithm consists of five steps: (1) Each image is filtered at different orientations with bar masks of four sizes that increase with eccentricity; the equivalent filters are one or two octaves wide. (2) Zero-crossings in the filtered images, which roughly correspond to edges, are localized. Positions of the ends of lines and edges are also found. (3) For each mask orientation and size, matching takes place between pairs of zero-crossings or terminations of the same sign in the two images, for a range of disparities up to about the width of the mask\u2019s central region. (4) Wide masks can control vergence movements, thus causing small masks to come into correspondence. (5) When a correspondence is achieved, it is stored in a dynamic buffer, called the 2\u00bd-D sketch. It is shown that this proposal provides a theoretical framework for most existing psychophysical and neurophysiological data about stereopsis. Several critical experimental predictions are also made, for instance about the size of Panum\u2019s area under various conditions. The results of such experiments would tell us whether, for example, co-operativity is necessary for the matching process."

                "text": "Recently, Marr & Poggio (1979) presented a theory of human stereo vision. An implementation of that theory is presented, and consists of five steps. (i) The left and right images are each filtered with masks of four sizes that increase with eccentricity; the shape of these masks is given by delta 2G, the Laplacian of a Gaussian function. (ii) Zero crossings in the filtered images are found along horizontal scan lines. (iii) For each mask size, matching takes place between zero crossings of the same sign and roughly the same orientation in the two images, for a range of disparities up to about the width of the mask's central region. Within this disparity range, it can be shown that false targets pose only a simple problem. (iv) The output of the wide masks can control vergence movements, thus causing small masks to come into correspondence. In this way, the matching process gradually moves from dealing with large disparities at a low resolution to dealing with small disparities at a high resolution. (v) When a correspondence is achieved, it is stored in a dynamic buffer, called the 2 1/2-dimensional sketch. To support the adequacy of the Marr-Poggio model of human stereo vision, the implementation was tested on a wide range of stereograms from the human stereopsis literature. The performance of the implementation is illustrated and compared with human perception. Also statistical assumptions made by Marr & Poggio are supported by comparison with statistics found in practice. Finally, the process of implementing the theory has led to the clarification and refinement of a number of details within the theory; these are discussed in detail."

                "text": "A theory of edge detection is presented. The analysis proceeds in two parts. (1) Intensity changes, which occur in a natural image over a wide range of scales, are detected separately at different scales. An appropriate filter for this purpose at a given scale is found to be the second derivative of a Gaussian, and it is shown that, provided some simple conditions are satisfied, these primary filters need not be orientation-dependent. Thus, intensity changes at a given scale are best detected by finding the zero values of \u22072G(x, y)* I(x, y) for image I, where G(x, y) is a two-dimensional Gaussian distribution and \u22072 is the Laplacian. The intensity changes thus discovered in each of the channels are then represented by oriented primitives called zero-crossing segments, and evidence is given that this representation is complete. (2) Intensity changes in images arise from surface discontinuities or from reflectance or illumination boundaries, and these all have the property that they are spatially localized. Because of this, the zero-crossing segments from the different channels are not independent, and rules are deduced for combining them into a description of the image. This description is called the raw primal sketch. The theory explains several basic psychophysical findings, and the operation of forming oriented zero-crossing segments from the output of centre-surround \u22072G filters acting on the image forms the basis for a physiological model of simple cells (see Marr & Ullman 1979)."

Several laboratory experiments involving perceptual vector analysis and its geometric basis are described. In most of the experiments the visual stimuli consisted of computer-controlled patterns displayed on a televisionlike screen and projected into the eyes of subjects by means of a collimating device that removed parallax as well as the possibility of seeing the screen. A common characteristics of the experiments was that the observer was evidently not free to choose between a Euclidean interpretation of the changing geometry of the figure in the display and a projective interpretation. For example, the observer could not persuade himself that what he was seeing was simply a square growing larger and smaller in the same visual plane; his visual system insisted on telling him that he was seeing a square of constant size approaching and receding. Hence he perceived rigid motion in depth, rotation in a specific slant, bending in depth and so on, paired with the highest possible degree of object constancy. Further experiments were conducted to determine if the principles of perceptual analysis hold true for the more complex paterns of motions encountered in everyday life. These experiments led to the conclusion that during locomotion the components of the human visual environment are interpreted as rigid structures in relative motion."

The proper abstract setting is a Hilbert function space whose reproducing kernel involves no functions more complicated than logarithms and is easily coded. Convenient representation formulas are given, as also a practical multivariate extension of the Peano kernel theorem. Owing to the numerical stability of Cholesky factorization of positive definite symmetric matrices, the whole construction process of a surface spline can be described as a recursive algorithm, the data relative to the various interpolation points being exploited in sequence.R\u00e9sum\u00e9La m\u00e9thode concr\u00e8te d'interpolation par surfaces-spline est \u00e9troitement li\u00e9e au probl\u00e8me classique de la minimisation d'une semi-norme de Soboleff sous des contraintes d'interpolation; la structure intrins\u00e8que des surfaces-spline est d\u00e8s lors celle d'une extension multivari\u00e9e des fonctions-spline naturelles.

Much is known about the impressive effectiveness of binocular disparity. However, the excellent perception of threedimensional form in monocular vision has remained essentially unexplained. It has been proposed that some patterns of stimulation on the retina give rise to three-dimensional experiences, because visual processes differ in the spontaneous organization that results from certain properties of the retinal pattern. Rules of organization are supposed to exist according to which most retinal projections of three-dimensional forms happen to produce three-dimensional percepts and most retinal images of flat forms lead to flat forms in experience also. This view has been held mainly by gestalt psychologists. Another approach to this problem maintains that the projected stimulus patterns are interpreted on the basis of previous experience, either visual"

For a model Poisson equation with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions, a varia- tional principle with penalty is discussed. This principle leads to the solution of the Poisson equation by using functions that do not satisfy the boundary condition. The rate of con- vergence is discussed. 1. Introduction. The finite element method in all of its versions has become the subject of current practical and theoretical study. A particular problem associated with the finite element method has recently attracted considerable interest. Specifically, this problem is the application of variational principles to spaces of functions in which the boundary conditions need not be satisfied. See for example references (1) to (7). In references (5) and (6), this author has studied the penalty method approach to this problem. This approach consists in the use of a \"penalty\" parameter which depends on the smoothness of the original problem. The selection of the penalty parameter is, in some sense, arbitrary. Moreover, the solution of the original problem may be quite sensitive to this parameter. This paper studies the model Poisson problem - Au = f with homogeneous boundary conditions of Dirichlet type. A variational principle for this model problem on spaces of functions not satisfying the boundary conditions is studied and, based on this principle, a variant of the finite element method is given. This new scheme has a rate of convergence that is arbitrarily close to the optimal rate found by using the usual finite element method with elements satisfying the boundary conditions. The analysis also shows that the finite element method with penalty is not overly sensitive to the choice of the penalty parameter. 2. Some Principal Notions. Let Rn be an n-dimensional Euclidian space. For x = (x,, , x.) C R., we define IIxH2 = Jn= x2 and dx = dx ... dxn. Let Q be a bounded domain in Rn with boundary IF C C'. Let Hm(Rn), Hm(Q) and Hm(F), m > 0 m not necessarily an integer, be the fractional Sobolev spaces of order m on Rn, Q and F, respectively. We will designate the respec- tive norms of these Sobolev spaces by | | I- (RnX| ( ) and |HH (r). Recall that Hm(Q) and Hm(T) are sometimes also denoted by W'(Q) and W'(F), respectively, and that H1(Q) = L2(Q) and H0(F) = L2(F). Let the spaces Ho'(Q) be the closure in"

A second constraint is needed. A method for finding the optical flow pattern is presented which assumes that the apparent velocity of the brightness pattern varies smoothly almost everywhere in the image. An iterative implementation is shown which successfully computes the optical flow for a number of synthetic image sequences. The algorithm is robust in that it can handle image sequences that are quantized rather coarsely in space and time. It is also insensitive to quantization of brightness levels and additive noise. Examples are included where the assumption of smoothness is violated at singular points or along lines in the image."

Here we concentrate on objects with specularly reflecting surfaces, since these are of importance in industrial applications. Previous methods, intended for diffusely reflecting surfaces, employed point source illumination, which is quite unsuitable in this case. Instead, we use a distributed light source obtained by uneven illumination of a diffusely reflecting planar surface.

                "text": "As Henri Poincare once remarked, \"solution of a mathematical problem\" is a phrase of indefinite meaning. Pure mathematicians sometimes are satisfied with showing that the non-existence of a solution implies a logical contradiction, while engineers might consider a numerical result as the only reasonable goal. Such one sided views seem to reflect human limitations rather than objective values. In itself mathematics is an indivisible organism uniting theoretical contemplation and active application. This address will deal with a topic in which such a synthesis of theoretical and applied mathematics has become particularly convincing. Since Gauss and W. Thompson, the equivalence between boundary value problems of partial differential equations on the one hand and problems of the calculus of variations on the other hand has been a central point in analysis. At first, the theoretical interest in existence proofs dominated and only much later were practical applications envisaged by two physicists, Lord Rayleigh and Walther Ritz ; they independently conceived the idea of utilizing this equivalence for numerical calculation of the solutions, by substituting for the variational problems simpler approximating extremum problems in which but a finite number of parameters need be determined. Rayleigh, in his classical work\u2014Theory of sound\u2014and in other publications, was the first to use such a procedure. But only the spectacular success of Walther Ritz and its tragic circumstances caught the general interest. In two publications of 1908 and 1909 [39], Ritz, conscious of his imminent death from consumption, gave a masterly account of the theory, and at the same time applied his method to the calculation of the nodal lines of vibrating plates, a problem of classical physics that previously had not been satisfactorily treated. Thus methods emerged which could not fail to attract engineers and physicists; after all, the minimum principles of mechanics are more suggestive than the differential equations. Great successes in applications were soon followed by further progress in the understanding of the theoretical background, and such progress in turn must result in advantages for the applications."

                "text": "Stroboscopic presentation of a moving object can be interpolated by our visual system into the perception of continuous motion. The precision of this interpolation process has been explored by measuring the vernier discrimination threshold for targets displayed stroboscopically at a sequence of stations. The vernier targets, moving at constant velocity, were presented either with a spatial offset or with a temporal offset or with both. The main results are: (1) vernier acuity for spatial offset is rather invariant over a wide range of velocities and separations between the stations (see Westheimer & McKee 1975); (2) vernier acuity for temporal offset depends on spatial separation and velocity. At each separation there is an optimal velocity such that the strobe interval is roughly constant at about 30 ms; optimal acuity decreases with increasing separation; (3) blur of the vernier pattern decreases acuity for spatial offsets, but improves acuity for temporal offsets (at high velocities and large separations); (4) a temporal offset exactly compensates the equivalent (at the given velocity) spatial offset only for a small separation and optimal velocity; otherwise the spatial offset dominates. A theoretical analysis of the interpolation problem suggests a computational scheme based on the assumption of constant velocity motion. This assumption reflects a constraint satisfied in normal vision over the short times and small distances normally relevant for the interpolation process. A reasonable implementation of this scheme only requires a set of independent, direction selective spatiotemporal channels, that is receptive fields with the different sizes and temporal properties revealed by psychophysical experiments. It is concluded that sophisticated mechanisms are not required to account for the main properties of vernier acuity with moving targets. It is furthermore suggested that the spatiotemporal channels of human vision may be the interpolation filters themselves. Possible neurophysiological implications are briefly discussed."

In Foundations of Cyclopean Perception (first published in 1971 and unavailable for years), Bela Julesz traced the visual information flow in the brain, analyzing how the brain combines separate images received from the two eyes to produce depth perception. Julesz developed novel tools to do this: random-dot stereograms and cinematograms, generated by early digital computers at Bell Labs. These images, when viewed with the special glasses that came with the book, revealed complex, three-dimensional surfaces; this mode of visual stimulus became a paradigm for research in vision and perception. This reprint edition includes all 48 color random-dot designs from the original, as well as the special 3-D glasses required to view them.Foundations of Cyclopean Perception has had a profound impact on the vision studies community. It was chosen as one of the one hundred most influential works in cognitive science in a poll conducted by the University of Minnesota's Center for Cognitive Sciences. Many copies are \"permanently borrowed\" from college libraries; used copies are sought after online. Now, with this facsimile of the 1971 edition, the book is available again to cognitive scientists, neuroscientists, vision researchers, artists, and designers."

Frequently, processes are needed which reduce ambiguity and noise, and select the best label among several possible choices. Relaxation labeling processes are just such a class of algorithms. They are based on the parallel use of local constraints between labels. This paper develops a theory to characterize the goal of relaxation labeling. The theory is founded on a definition of con-sistency in labelings, extending the notion of constraint satisfaction. In certain restricted circumstances, an explicit functional exists that can be maximized to guide the search for consistent labelings. This functional is used to derive a new relaxation labeling operator. When the restrictions are not satisfied, the theory relies on variational cal-culus. It is shown that the problem of finding consistent labelings is equivalent to solving a variational inequality. A procedure nearly identical to the relaxation operator derived under restricted circum-stances serves in the more general setting. Further, a local convergence result is established for this operator. The standard relaxation labeling formulas are shown to approximate our new operator, which leads us to conjecture that successful applications of the standard methods are explainable by the theory developed here. Observations about con-vergence and generalizations to higher order compatibility relations are described."

Two incoherent point sources of light give rise to a double\u2010peaked light distribution whose trough is 26% below the adjoining peaks when the sources are separated by the Rayleigh limit of resolution, but the dip has vanished when the separation is 80% of the Rayleigh limit. Diffraction theory, however, places no restriction on the precision with which any single source can be localized. No paradox is therefore involved in having a point\u2010spread function with half\u2010width one minute of arc and, at the same time, a localization threshold of a few seconds of arc, although the need for a sophisticated processing mechanism to achieve such low hyperacuity thresholds is emphasized."

                "text": "theory for ASM. In the following we characterize the ASM preconditioner B by three parameters: C0 , \u03c1(E) , and \u03c9 , which enter via assumptions on the subspaces Vi and the bilinear forms ai(\u00b7, \u00b7) (the approximate local problems). Assumption 14.6 (stable decomposition) There exists a constant C0 > 0 such that every u \u2208 V admits a decomposition u = \u2211N i=0 ui with ui \u2208 Vi such that N \u2211 i=0 ai(ui, ui) \u2264 C 0 a(u, u) (14.29) Assumption 14.7 (strengthened Cauchy-Schwarz inequality) For i, j = 1 . . . N , let Ei,j = Ej,i \u2208 [0, 1] be defined by the inequalities |a(ui, uj)| \u2264 Ei,j a(ui, ui) a(uj, uj) \u2200 ui \u2208 Vi, uj \u2208 Vj (14.30) By \u03c1(E) we denote the spectral radius of the symmetric matrix E = (Ei,j) \u2208 RN\u00d7N . The particular assumption is that we have a nontrivial bound for \u03c1(E) to our disposal. Note that due to Ei,j \u2264 1 (Cauchy-Schwarz inequality), the trivial bound \u03c1(E) = \u2225E\u22252 \u2264 \u221a \u2225E\u22251 \u2225E\u2225\u221e \u2264 N always holds; for particular Schwarz methods one usually aims at bounds for \u03c1(E) which are independent of N . Ed. 2011 Iterative Solution of Large Linear Systems 14.2 Additive Schwarz methods (ASM) 159 Assumption 14.8 (local stability) There exists \u03c9 > 0 such that for all i = 1 . . . N : a(ui, ui) \u2264 \u03c9 ai(ui, ui) \u2200 ui \u2208 Vi (14.31) Remark 14.9 The space V0 is not included in the definition of E ; as we will see below, this space is allowed to play a special role. Ei,j = 0 implies that the spaces Vi and Vj are orthogonal (in the a(\u00b7, \u00b7) inner product). We will see below that small \u03c1(E) is desirable. We will also see below that a small C0 is desirable. The parameter \u03c9 represents a one-sided measure of the approximation properties of the approximate solvers ai . If the local solver is of (exact) Galerkin type, i.e, ai(u, v) \u2261 a(u, v) for u, v \u2208 Vi , then \u03c9 = 1 . However, this does not necessarily imply that Assumptions 14.6 and 14.7 are satisfied. Lemma 14.10 (P. L. Lions) Let PASM be defined by (14.23) resp. (14.24). Then, under Assumption 14.6, (i) PASM : V \u2192 V is a bijection, and a(u, u) \u2264 C 0 a(PASM u, u) \u2200 u \u2208 V (14.32) (ii) Characterization of b(u, u) : b(u, u) = a(P\u22121 ASM u, u) = min { N \u2211 i=0 ai(ui, ui) : u = N \u2211 i=0 ui, ui \u2208 Vi } (14.33) Proof: We make use of the fundamental identity (14.27) and Cauchy-Schwarz inequalites. Proof of (i): Let u \u2208 V and u = \u2211 i ui be a decomposition of the type guaranteed by Assumption 14.6. Then: a(u, u) = a(u, \u2211 i ui) = \u2211 i a(u, ui) = \u2211 i ai(Pi u, ui) \u2264 \u2211 i \u221a ai(Pi u, Pi u) ai(ui, ui) = \u2211 i \u221a a(u, Pi u) ai(ui, ui) \u2264 \u221a\u2211 i a(u, Pi u) \u221a\u2211 i ai(ui, ui) = \u221a a(u, PASM u) \u221a\u2211 i ai(ui, ui) \u2264 \u221a a(u, PASM u)C0 \u221a a(u, u) This implies the estimate (14.32). In particular, it follows that PASM is injective, because with (14.32), PASM u = 0 implies a(u, u) = 0 , hence u = 0 . Due to finite dimension, we conclude that PASM is bijective. Proof of (ii): We first show that the minimum on the right-hand side of (14.33) cannot be smaller than a(P\u22121 ASM u, u) . To this end, we consider an arbitrary decomposition u = \u2211 i ui with ui \u2208 Vi and estimate a(P\u22121 ASM u, u) = \u2211 i a(P \u22121 ASM u, ui) = \u2211 i ai(PiP \u22121 ASM u, ui) \u2264 \u221a\u2211 i ai(PiP \u22121 ASM u, PiP \u22121 ASM u) \u221a\u2211 i ai(ui, ui) = \u221a\u2211 i a(P \u22121 ASM u, PiP \u22121 ASM u) \u221a\u2211 i ai(ui, ui) = \u221a a(P\u22121 ASM u, u) \u221a\u2211 i ai(ui, ui) In order to see that a(P\u22121 ASM u, u) is indeed the minimum of the right-hand side of (14.33), we define ui = PiP \u22121 ASM u . Obviously, ui \u2208 Vi and \u2211 i ui = u . Furthermore, \u2211 i ai(ui, ui) = \u2211 i ai(PiP \u22121 ASM u, PiP \u22121 ASM u) = \u2211 i a(P \u22121 ASM u, PiP \u22121 ASM u) = a(P\u22121 ASM u, \u2211 i PiP \u22121 ASM u) = a(P \u22121 ASM u, u) This concludes the proof. Iterative Solution of Large Linear Systems Ed. 2011 160 14 SUBSTRUCTURING METHODS The matrix P \u2032 ASM = B \u22121A from (14.23) is the matrix representation of the operator PASM . Since PASM is self-adjoint in the A -inner product (see Lemma 14.2), we can estimate the smallest and the largest eigenvalue of B\u22121A by: \u03bbmin(B \u22121A) = inf 0 \u0338=u \u2208V a(PASM u, u) a(u, u) , \u03bbmax(B \u22121A) = sup 0 \u0338=u \u2208V a(PASM u, u) a(u, u) (14.34) Lemma 14.10, (i) in conjunction with Assumption 14.6 readily yields \u03bbmin(B \u22121A) \u2265 1 C 0 An upper bound for \u03bbmax(B \u22121A) is obtained with the help of the following lemma. Lemma 14.11 Under Assumptions 14.7 and 14.8 we have \u2225Pi\u2225A \u2264 \u03c9, i = 0 . . . N (14.35) a(PASM u, u) \u2264 \u03c9 (1 + \u03c1(E)) a(u, u) for all u \u2208 V (14.36) Proof: Again we make use of identity (14.27). We start with the proof of (14.35): From Assumption 14.8, (14.31) we infer for all u \u2208 V : \u2225Pi u\u22252A = a(Pi u, Pi u) \u2264 \u03c9 ai(Pi u, Pi u) = \u03c9 a(u, Pi u) \u2264 \u03c9 \u2225u\u2225A \u2225Pi u\u2225A which implies (14.35). For the proof of (14.36), we observe that the space V0 is assumed to play a special role. We define"

The crux of the matter is that convenient representation forpiulas can be obtained by resorting to convolutions or to Fourier transforms of distributions."

Since tensor calculus is an indispensable prerequisite when dealing with the theory of elasticity in a modern way, the first part of the book consists in an introduction into this subject. In the second part, the physical foundations of the theory of elasticity are given, including nonlinearities. The excursion into the field of geometric and physical nonlinearities is done in order to prepare the reader for further advances into the most recent developments of the theory. The book itself, in the remainder, is restricted to linear problems only. The third part of the book deals with the mathematical theory of linear elasticity in full extent. Curvilinear problems, two- and three-dimensional problems are included. Stress has been put on working out a systematic approach to the solutions of all kinds of stress states, not neglecting triaxial problems. Also, energy methods have been dealt with, taking into account the generalization and extension of these methods by Rudiger and Reiss ner. The fourth and last part of the book consists in an application of the general methods, as outlined in part 3, to special structures like plates and shells, thus giving hopefully something of interest to the practising engineer.\""

This is a method of direct photography, based upon collimated beams of light reflected from plane mirrors mounted on tightly fitting contact lenses. The records show that the eyes exhibit relatively rapid and accurate motions of vergence when fixating alternately a near and a far test object. There is no evidence for a systematic discrepancy between the extent of vergence and the geometrical location of the test object. It is concluded that when fusion is maintained, the images of a fixation object are brought to corresponding areas of the retina to an accuracy of about two minutes of arc. This finding is consistent with the reported sizes of Panum\u2019s area and the region of optimal visual resolution."

                "text": "Eye movements may be described in terms of two components: conjugate and disjunctive. A pure conjugate eye movement is one in which the two eyes move in a parallel fashion, while in a disjunctive movement changes occur in the orientation of one eye with respect to the other. A typical situation calling for a disjunctive movement is the change in binocular observation from a far to a near target, when the fixation lines of the two eyes have to converge. Recordings of eye movement responses to the presentation of targets requiring convergence show the movements to be slow compared with their reaction time (Westheimer &AMitchell, 1956). In this respect they differ from the most commonly occurring conjugate eye movements, the saccadic movements. It is clear now that saccadic eye movements are not guided, in that no adjustments in response to visual clues are made during the movement (Westheimer, 1954). The time characteristics of disjunctive movements, on the other hand, would theoretically allow correction of movements during their course on the basis of visual information. That the elements for such a control system exist is evidenced by the following two facts: (1) the sensory system on which such a control system would depend is capable of making very fine discriminations-retinal disparities of less than a minute of arc can be detected-and (2) the muscular system is quite fast and capable of making fine gradations in response. The experiments reported in this paper fall into two groups. Those describing the eye movement responses to simple types of convergence stimuli are given in Part I, and those in which responses are studied to special stimulus situations designed to elucidate the properties of the control mechanism for disjunctive eye movements are contained in Part II."

The book contains a detailed study of basic problems of the theory, such as the problem of existence and regularity of solutions of higher-order elliptic boundary value problems. It also contains a study of spectral properties of operators associated with elliptic boundary value problems. Weyl's law on the asymptotic distribution of eigenvalues is studied in great generality."

A program to solve a chemical reaction problem is not mathematical software, even though the essence of the program might be an algorithm for solving differential equations. The scope of the term is much broader than a pure mathematician's view of mathematics: it includes some aspects of programming languages and computer systems. The scope is also much broader than traditional numerical analysis, for it includes such areas as statistics, symbolic mathematical analysis, and linear programming, which are clearly mathematical in nature."
