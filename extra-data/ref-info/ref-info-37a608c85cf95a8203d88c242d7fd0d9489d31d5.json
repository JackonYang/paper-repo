                "text": "A general and rigorous treatment is given of the photometric method for deriving surface elevation information from a single picture of the surface. In the course of the derivation a brief indication is given of possible photometric function symmetries yielding exact solutions to the problem. It is shown that the photometric properties of the lunar maria are sufficient to produce an exact solution but with an inherent practical difficulty. The resulting equations are then specialized to the case of lunar photography and applied to the Ranger pictures as part of a digital processing procedure. Examples of the resulting elevation maps are given. INTRODUCTION QUANTITATIVE ELEVATION INFORMATION about a surface can be derived from pictures both by stereoscopic and by photometric methods. The second method, which is of interest here, was first suggested by van Diggelen (Ref. 1) in 1951. Extending his original formulation of the problem, it is desired to reconstruct quantitatively the shape of a surface being photographed using the imaging geometry, the facsi mile system transfer characteristics, and the surface photometric properties. A rigorous solution to this problem is presented and the results are applied to the lunar pictures taken by the three Ranger impacting spacecraft. CALCULATION OF ELEVATIONS IN TEl{]vIS OF A LENS-CENTERED COORDINATE SYSTEM The pertinent photometry of extended surfaces can be summarized as follows. For simplicity, it will be assumed that the surface possesses homogenous photometric properties at least over the local area under consideration. The photometric geometry can be com pletely defined in terms of three angles; the incidence angle i (angle between the direction of incident light and the surface normal), the emission angle e (angle between the direction of emitted light and the surface normal), and the phase angle g (angle between the directions of incident and emitted light). This geometry is shown in Figure 1. For uniform collimated illumination of the surface, such as with sunlight, the luminence b can be written b(i, e, g) = poEo\u00a2(i, e, g) (1) where Po is the normal albedo of the surface, Eo is the uniform illumination intensity, and \u00a2 (i, e, g) is the surface photometric function. The normalization of \u00a2 is such that \u00a2(O, 0, 0) = 1. * This paper presents the results of one phase of research conducted at J.P.L., California Institute of Technology, under Contract No. NAS 7-100, sponsored by NASA.
