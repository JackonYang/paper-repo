The features are invariant to image scaling, translation, and rotation, and partially invariant to illumination changes and affine or 3D projection. These features share similar properties with neurons in inferior temporal cortex that are used for object recognition in primate vision. Features are efficiently detected through a staged filtering approach that identifies stable points in scale space. Image keys are created that allow for local geometric deformations by representing blurred image gradients in multiple orientation planes and at multiple scales. The keys are used as input to a nearest neighbor indexing method that identifies candidate object matches. Final verification of each match is achieved by finding a low residual least squares solution for the unknown model parameters. Experimental results show that robust object recognition can be achieved in cluttered partially occluded images with a computation time of under 2 seconds."

Patterns are described in a feature space of which each dimension is a scale and orientation normalized receptive field (a unit composed of normalized Gaussian-based filters). \n \nScale invariance is obtained by automatic selection of an appropriate local scale [Lin98b] and followed by normalisation of the receptive field to the appropriate scale. Orientation invariance is obtained by the determination of the dominant local orientation and by steering the receptive fields to this orientation. \n \nData is represented structurally in a feature space that is designed for the recognition of static object configurations. In this space an image is modeled by the vectorial representation of the receptive field responses at each pixel, forming a surface in the feature space. Recognition is achieved by measuring the distance between the vector of normalized receptive fields responses of an observed neighborhood and the surface point of the image model. \n \nThe power of a scale equivariant feature space is validated by experimental results for point correspondences in images of different scales and the recognition of objects under different view points."

We propose an algorithm which is capable of handling larger changes in viewpoint than classical correlation based techniques. Optimal performance for the algorithm is achieved for textured objects which are locally planar in at least one direction. The algorithm works by computing affinely invariant fourier features from intensity profiles in each image. The intensity profiles are extracted from the image data between randomly selected pairs of image interest points. Using a voting scheme, pairs of interest points are matched across images by comparing vectors of fourier features. Outliers among the matches are rejected in two stages, a fast stage using novel view consistency constraints, and a second, slower stage using RANSAC and fundamental matrix computation. In order to demonstrate the quality of the results, the algorithm is tested on several different image pairs."

On the premise that changes in resolution act as a smoothing equivalent to changes in scale, a scale-space representation of the high-resolution image is produced. Hence the one-to-one classical image matching paradigm becomes one-to-many because the low-resolution image is compared with all the scale-space representations of the high-resolution one. Key to the success of such a process is the proper representation of the features to be matched in scale-space. We show how to extract interest points at variable scales and we devise a method allowing the comparison of two images at two different resolutions. The method comprises the use of photometric- and rotation-invariant descriptors, a geometric model mapping the high-resolution image onto a low-resolution image region, and an image matching strategy based on the robust estimation of this geometric model. Extensive experiments show that our matching method can be used for scale changes up to a factor 6."

While some existing methods for multiresolution registration do consider the way the resolution (scale) affects the image, they often consider the image one scale at a time, using geometric properties within that scale. Others use multiscale information, usually to produce more robust results, but only to register same-magnification images (e.g., stereo). A scale trace is the set of values that a single pixel takes on as magnification decreases and the effective point specifications corresponding increases. As such, scale traces capture information across multiple scales. This paper presents a method that uses correlation of scale traces through multiresolution images to find correspondences between images of the same scene at differing magnifications. Because the method relies solely on the multiscale properties of the images themselves and not on spatial correspondence, it is less sensitive to discrete sampling of potential scale factors. Sample results demonstrate that the method is able to accurately identify both the relative position and relative magnification (scale) of the two images."

Unlike conventional stereo matching approaches we assume no prior knowledge about the relative camera positions and orientations. In fact in our application this is the information we wish to determine from the image feature matches. Features are detected in two or more images and characterised using affine texture invariants. The problem of window effects is explicitly addressed by our method-our feature characterisation is invariant to linear transformations of the image data including rotation, stretch and skew. The feature matching process is optimised for a structure-from-motion application where we wish to ignore unreliable matches at the expense of reducing the number of feature matches."

To measure these two properties quantitatively, we introduce two evaluation criteria: repeatability rate and information content. The quality of the interest points depends on the detector used. In this paper several detectors are compared according to the criteria specified above. We determine which detector gives the best results and show that it satisfies the criteria well."
