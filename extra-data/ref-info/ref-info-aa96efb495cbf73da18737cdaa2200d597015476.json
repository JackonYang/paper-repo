In this paper we demonstrate that specific actions can be recognized in long video sequence by matching shape information extracted from individual frames to stored prototypes representing key frames of the action. The matching algorithm is tolerant to substantial deformation between image and prototype and recognizes qualitatively similar image shapes produced by the body postures. The algorithm is applied to the recognition of specific tennis strokes in up to 2 min long video sequences. Using key-frames within the sequence all (1015) forehand strokes are found with no false positives. The backhand strokes are detected with somewhat lower performance. We conclude that this type of approach to action recognition has large potential for application to automatic video analysis and editing."

Within a Bayesian framework, we define a generative model of image appearance, a robust likelihood function based on image graylevel differences, and a prior probability distribution over pose and joint angles that models how humans move. The posterior probability distribution over model parameters is represented using a discrete set of samples and is propagated over time using particle filtering. The approach extends previous work on parameterized optical flow estimation to exploit a complex 3D articulated motion model. It also extends previous work on human motion tracking by including a perspective camera model, by modeling limb self occlusion, and by recovering 3D motion from a monocular sequence. The explicit posterior probability distribution represents ambiguities due to image matching, model singularities, and perspective projection. The method relies only on a frame-to-frame assumption of brightness constancy and hence is able to track people under changing viewpoints, in grayscale image sequences, and with complex unknown backgrounds."

We introduce the use of a novel mathematical technique, the product of exponential maps and twist motions, and its integration into a differential motion estimation. This results in solving simple linear systems, and enables us to recover robustly the kinematic degrees-of-freedom in noise and complex self occluded configurations. We demonstrate this on several image sequences of people doing articulated full body movements, and visualize the results in re-animating an artificial 3D human model. We are also able to recover and re-animate the famous movements of Eadweard Muybridge's motion studies from the last century. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first computer vision based system that is able to process such challenging footage and recover complex motions with such high accuracy."

In this contribution, we introduce a model-based approach for the recognition of pedestrians. We represent the human body by a 3D-model consisting of cylinders, whereas for modelling the movement of walking we use data from medical motion studies. The estimation of model parameters in consecutive images is done by applying a Kalman filter. Experimental results are shown for synthetic as well as for real image data."

This survey identifies a number of promising applications and provides an overview of recent developments in this domain. The scope of this survey is limited to work on whole-body or hand motion; it does not include work on human faces. The emphasis is on discussing the various methodologies; they are grouped in 2-D approaches with or without explicit shape models and 3-D approaches. Where appropriate, systems are reviewed.

Search algorithms, either deterministic or stochastic, that search such a space without constraint, fall foul of exponential computational complexity. One approach is to introduce constraints: either labelling using markers or colour coding, prior assumptions about motion trajectories or view restrictions. Another is to relax constraints arising from articulation, and track limbs as if their motions were independent. In contrast, we aim for general tracking without special preparation of objects or restrictive assumptions. The principal contribution of the paper is the development of a modified particle filter for search in high dimensional configuration spaces. It uses a continuation principle based on annealing to introduce the influence of narrow peaks in the fitness function, gradually. The new algorithm, termed annealed particle filtering, is shown to be capable of recovering full articulated body motion efficiently."

Probabilistic mechanisms are attractive because they handle fusion of information, especially temporal fusion, in a principled manner. Exemplars are selected representatives of raw training data, used here to represent probabilistic mixture distributions of object configurations. Their use avoids tedious hand-construction of object models and problems with changes of topology. Using exemplars in place of a parameterized model poses several challenges, addressed here with what we call the \"Metric Mixture\" (M/sup 2/) approach. The M/sup 2/ model has several valuable properties. Principally, it provides alternatives to standard learning algorithms by allowing the use of metrics that are not embedded in a vector space. Secondly, it uses a noise model that is learned from training data. Lastly, it eliminates any need for an assumption of probabilistic pixelwise independence. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the M/sup 2/ model in two domains tracking walking people using chamfer distances on binary edge images and tracking mouth movements by means of a shuffle distance."

The theoretical analysis of the approach shows that it relates to the Bayesian framework while providing a practical, fast and efficient solution. The capability of the tracker to handle in real time partial occlusions, significant clutter, and target scale variations, is demonstrated for several image sequences."

We show how to learn a function between paths in the two systems, resolving ambiguities by integrating information over the entire length of a sequence. The basis of this function is a configural and dynamical manifold that summarizes the target system's behaviour. This manifold can be modeled from data with a hidden Markov model having special topological properties that we obtain via entropy minimization. Inference is then a matter of solving for the geodesic on the manifold that best explains the evidence in the cue sequence. We give a closed-form maximum a posteriori solution for geodesics through the learned density space, thereby obtaining optimal paths over the dynamical manifold. These methods give a completely general way to perform inference over time-series; in vision they support analysis, recognition, classification and synthesis of behaviours in linear time. We demonstrate with a prototype that infers 3D from monocular monochromatic sequences (e.g., back-subtractions), without using any articulatory body model. The framework readily accommodates multiple cameras and other sources of evidence such as optical flow or feature tracking."

The shape context describes the coarse arrangement of the shape with respect to a point inside or on the boundary of the shape. We use the shape context as a vector-valued attribute in a bipartite graph matching framework. Our proposed method makes use of a relatively small number of sample points selected from the set of detected edges; no special landmarks or keypoints are necessary. Tolerance and/or invariance to common image transformations are available within our framework. Using examples involving both silhouettes and edge images, we demonstrate how the solution to the graph matching problem provides us with correspondences and a dissimilarity score that can be used for object recognition and similarity-based retrieval."

As a measure of shape equivalence we will use the concept of order structure which in principle can be defined for arbitrary geometric configurations such as points lines and curves. The order structure equivalence of subsets of points and tangent directions of a shape is will be used to establish pointwise correspondence. The finding of correspondence between different views of the same object and different instances of the same object category can be used as a foundation for establishment and recognition of visual categories."
