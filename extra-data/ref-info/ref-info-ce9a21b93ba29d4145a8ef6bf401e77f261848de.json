The network uses the pattern of activation over a set of hidden units from time-step t-1, together with element t, to predict element t+1. When the network is trained with strings from a particular finite-state grammar, it can learn to be a perfect finite-state recognizer for the grammar. Cluster analyses of the hidden-layer patterns of activation showed that they encode prediction-relevant information about the entire path traversed through the network. We illustrate the phases of learning with cluster analyses performed at different points during training."

                "text": "Time is at the heart of many pattern recognition tasks (e.g., speech recognition). However, connectionist learning algorithms to date are not well-suited for dealing with time-varying input patterns. This chapter introduces a specialized connectionist architecture and corresponding specialization of the back-propagation learning algorithm that operates efficiently, both in computational time and space requirements, on temporal sequences. The key feature of the architecture is a layer of selfconnected hidden units that integrate their current value with the new input at each time step to construct a static representation of the temporal input sequence. This architecture avoids two deficiencies found in the back-propagation unfolding-intime procedure (Rumelhart, Hinton, & Williams, 1986) for handing sequence recognition tasks: first, it reduces the difficulty of temporal credit assignment by focusing the back-propagated error signal; second, it eliminates the need for a buffer to hold the input sequence and/or intermediate activity levels. The latter property is due to the fact that during the forward (activation) phase, incremental activity traces can be locally computed that hold all information necessary for back propagation in time. It is argued that this architecture should scale better than conventional recurrent architectures with respect to sequence length. The architecture has been used to implement a temporal version of Rumelhart and McClelland's (1986) verb past-tense model. The hidden units learn to behave something like Rumelhart and McClelland's \"Wickelphones,\" a rich and flexible representation of temporal information."

The physical meaning of content-addressable memory is described by an appropriate phase space flow of the state of a system. A model of such a system is given, based on aspects of neurobiology but readily adapted to integrated circuits. The collective properties of this model produce a content-addressable memory which correctly yields an entire memory from any subpart of sufficient size. The algorithm for the time evolution of the state of the system is based on asynchronous parallel processing. Additional emergent collective properties include some capacity for generalization, familiarity recognition, categorization, error correction, and time sequence retention. The collective properties are only weakly sensitive to details of the modeling or the failure of individual devices."

One approach is to represent time implicitly by its effects on processing rather than explicitly (as in a spatial representation). The current report develops a proposal along these lines first described by Jordan (1986) which involves the use of recurrent links in order to provide networks with a dynamic memory. In this approach, hidden unit patterns are fed back to themselves; the internal representations which develop thus reflect task demands in the context of prior internal states. A set of simulations is reported which range from relatively simple problems (temporal version of XOR) to discovering syntactic/semantic features for words. The networks are able to learn interesting internal representations which incorporate task demands with memory demands; indeed, in this approach the notion of memory is inextricably bound up with task processing. These representations reveal a rich structure, which allows them to be highly context-dependent while also expressing generalizations across classes of items. These representations suggest a method for representing lexical categories and the type/token distinction."

We propose an architecture in which time serves as its own representation, and temporal context is encoded in the state of the nodes. We contrast this with the approach of replicating portions of the architecture to represent time. \n \nAs one example of these ideas, we demonstrate an architecture with capacitive inputs serving as temporal feature detectors in an otherwise standard back propagation model. Experiments involving motion detection and word discrimination serve to illustrate novel features of the system. Finally, we discuss possible extensions of the architecture."

Many of these approaches use restricted architectures or are based on more computationally limited approximations to the full backpropagation-through-time computation. The approach we propose here enjoys the generality of the backpropagation-through-time approach while not suffering from its growing memory requirement in arbitrarily long training sequences. It coincides with an approach suggested in the system identification literature (McBride and Narendra 1965) for tuning the parameters of general dynamical systems. The work of Bachrach (1988) and Mozer (1988) represents special cases of the algorithm presented here, and Robinson and Fallside (1987) have given an alternative description of the full algorithm as well."

However, if one is free to adjust both weights and initial conditions, at least in some cases this problem disappears. Something like this appears to be at the heart of the success of the use of teacher forcing: By using desired values in the net, one is helping to control the initial conditions for the subsequent dynamics. Pineda (1988) has observed a similar need for teacher forcing when"
