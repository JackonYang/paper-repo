Following introductory chapters on kinetic theory, thermodynamics, the Gibbs ensembles, and the thermodynamic limit, later chapters discuss the classical theories of phase transitions, the Ising model, algebraic methods and combinatorial methods for solving the two-dimensional model in zero field, and some applications of the Ising model to biology.

The volume now gives a somewhat exhaustive account of the various ramifications of the subject, which are set out in an attractive manner.

It was then the first text on critical phenomena, a field that has enjoyed great activity for the past twenty years and that still continues to attract much attention. The book is at the level at which a graduate student who has studied condensed matter physics can begin to comprehend the nature of phase transitions, which involve the transformation of one state of matter into another. (A simple example is the melting of a solid to become a liquid.) Such a transformation is termed 'critical' when, after a certain amount of the substance changes phase, the entire bulk virtually instantaneously also makes the transition. A second, updated edition is planned for future publication, but in the mean time this paperback reissue will be useful in teaching the fundamental principles of this extremely interesting subject."

                "text": "THE English translation of the second volume of the valuable work of MM. Mascart and Joubert is a welcome addition to the class, none too large, of really substantial English books on electricity. We have already directed the attention of the readers of NATURE to the first volume of this work; and we took occasion to point out that in their exposition of the subject the authors follow very closely the general methods of Clerk-Maxwell. That they do so is a great advantage for the English student; because it enables him, without breach in the continuity of his studies, to use Mascart and Joubert as a commentary upon Maxwell, who is often by no means easy reading. The French work is also supplementary to Maxwell, for writers avoid as much as possible the purely theoretical side of electrical science, and treat electrical phenomena, more especially in their second volume, as subjects of observation, and? above all, of measurement. This volume, which is now before us, is, in fact, an epitome of all the wisdom in exact electrical measurement which has been gained during a period of extraordinary activity in that field. This period began with the researches of Gauss and Weber; and may perhaps be said to have culminated in the great series of determinations of the absolute units which were made about the time of the Congress of Electricians at Paris in 1884. The prominent part taken by MM. Mascart and Joubert in this work has well fitted them to record with precision the details of the leading methods by which it was accomplished, and it would be hard to refer the student of electrical science to an authority on electrical measurement at once so clear and precise in detail, and, with a few small and evidently accidental exceptions, so manifestly candid and fair, as the second volume of the treatise of Mascart and Joubert.A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism.By E. Mascart J. Joubert. Translated by E. Atkinson. Vol. II. (London: De La Rue and Co., 1888.)"
