Like the recently developed method of \u2018simulated tempering\u2019, the \u2018tempered transition\u2019 method uses a series of distributions that interpolate between the distribution of interest and a distribution for which sampling is easier. The new method has the advantage that it does not require approximate values for the normalizing constants of these distributions, which are needed for simulated tempering, and can be tedious to estimate. Simulated tempering performs a random walk along the series of distributions used. In contrast, the tempered transitions of the new method move systematically from the desired distribution, to the easily-sampled distribution, and back to the desired distribution. This systematic movement avoids the inefficiency of a random walk, an advantage that is unfortunately cancelled by an increase in the number of interpolating distributions required. Because of this, the sampling efficiency of the tempered transition method in simple problems is similar to that of simulated tempering. On more complex distributions, however, simulated tempering and tempered transitions may perform differently. Which is better depends on the ways in which the interpolating distributions are \u2018deceptive\u2019."

Our samplers mix rapidly enough to be usable for problems in which other methods would require eons of computing time. They simulate realizations from a sequence of distributions, allowing the distribution being simulated to vary randomly over time. If the sequence of distributions is well chosen, then the sampler will mix well and produce accurate answers for all the distributions. Even when there is only one distribution of interest, these annealing-like samplers may be the only known way to get a rapidly mixing sampler. These methods are essential for attacking very hard problems, which arise in areas such as statistical genetics. We illustrate the methods wi..."

(1953) is presented along with an exposition of the relevant theory, techniques of application and methods and difficulties of assessing the error in Monte Carlo estimates. Examples of the methods, including the generation of random orthogonal matrices and potential applications of the methods to numerical problems arising in statistics, are discussed. For numerical problems in a large number of dimensions, Monte Carlo methods are often more efficient than conventional numerical methods. However, implementation of the Monte Carlo methods requires sampling from high dimensional probability distributions and this may be very difficult and expensive in analysis and computer time. General methods for sampling from, or estimating expectations with respect to, such distributions are as follows. (i) If possible, factorize the distribution into the product of one-dimensional conditional distributions from which samples may be obtained. (ii) Use importance sampling, which may also be used for variance reduction. That is, in order to evaluate the integral J = X) p(x)dx = Ev(f), where p(x) is a probability density function, instead of obtaining independent samples XI, ..., Xv from p(x) and using the estimate J, = Zf(xi)/N, we instead obtain the sample from a distribution with density q(x) and use the estimate J2 = Y{f(xj)p(x1)}/{q(xj)N}. This may be advantageous if it is easier to sample from q(x) thanp(x), but it is a difficult method to use in a large number of dimensions, since the values of the weights w(xi) = p(x1)/q(xj) for reasonable values of N may all be extremely small, or a few may be extremely large. In estimating the probability of an event A, however, these difficulties may not be as serious since the only values of w(x) which are important are those for which x -A. Since the methods proposed by Trotter & Tukey (1956) for the estimation of conditional expectations require the use of importance sampling, the same difficulties may be encountered in their use. (iii) Use a simulation technique; that is, if it is difficult to sample directly from p(x) or if p(x) is unknown, sample from some distribution q(y) and obtain the sample x values as some function of the corresponding y values. If we want samples from the conditional dis"

Monte Carlo simulation is an effective technique, es- pecially with complex and high-dimensional models. This paper aims to bring to the attention of general statistical audiences of some effective methods originating from theoretical physics and at the same time to ex- plore these methods from a more statistical perspective, through estab- lishing theoretical connections and illustrating their uses with statistical problems. We show that the acceptance ratio method and thermodynamic integration are natural generalizations of importance sampling, which is most familiar to statistical audiences. The former generalizes importance sampling through the use of a single \"bridge\" density and is thus a case of bridge sampling in the sense of Meng and Wong. Thermodynamic integration, which is also known in the numerical analysis literature as Ogata's method for high-dimensional integration, corresponds to the use of infinitely many and continuously connected bridges (and thus a \"path\"). Our path sampling formulation offers more flexibility and thus potential efficiency to thermodynamic integration, and the search of op- timal paths turns out to have close connections with the Jeffreys prior density and the Rao and Hellinger distances between two densities. We provide an informative theoretical example as well as two empirical ex- amples (involving 17- to 70-dimensional integrations) to illustrate the potential and implementation of path sampling. We also discuss some open problems."

The first generation suffered from a severe drawback: the locations of the clusters, or groups of parameters, could essentially become fixed, moving only rarely. Two strategies that have been proposed to create the second generation of Gibbs samplers are integration and appending a second stage to the Gibbs sampler wherein the cluster locations are moved. We show that these same strategies are easily implemented for the sequential importance sampler, and that the first strategy dramatically improves results. As in the case of Gibbs sampling, these strategies are applicable to a much wider class of models. They are shown to provide more uniform importance sampling weights and lead to additional Rao\u2010Blackwellization of estimators."

This article discusses the use of Markov chain splitting, originally developed for the theoretical analysis of general state-space Markov chains, to introduce regeneration into Markov chain samplers. This allows the use of regenerative methods for analyzing the output of these samplers and can provide a useful diagnostic of sampler performance. The approach is applied to several samplers, including certain Metropolis samplers that can be used on their own or in hybrid samplers, and is illustrated in several examples."

Conditions under which the numerical approximation converges almost surely to the true value with the number of Monte Carlo replications, and its numerical accuracy may be assessed reliably, are given. Importance sampling densities are derived from multivariate normal or student approximations to the posterior density. These densities are modified by automatic rescaling along each axis. The concept of relative numerical efficiency is introduced to evaluate the adequacy of a chosen importance sampling density. Applications in two illustrative models are presented.

This method is related to simulated annealing, but here the temperature becomes a dynamic variable, and the system is always kept at equilibrium. We analyse the method on the Random Field Ising Model, and we find a dramatic improvement over conventional Metropolis and cluster methods. We analyse and discuss the conditions under which the method has optimal performances."

This book demonstrates how Bayesian methods allow complex neural network models to be used without fear of the \"overfitting\" that can occur with traditional training methods. Insight into the nature of these complex Bayesian models is provided by a theoretical investigation of the priors over functions that underlie them. A practical implementation of Bayesian neural network learning using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods is also described, and software for it is freely available over the Internet. Presupposing only basic knowledge of probability and statistics, this book should be of interest to researchers in statistics, engineering, and artificial intelligence."

                "text": "One fifth (4 of 20) of the research articles published in the Journal of Educational Statistics in 1988 include simulation studies that justify or illustrate the authors' conclusions. A similar fraction (6 of 33) of the articles in the 1988 volume of Psychometrika include simulations; comparable proportions could be expected in other journals at the boundary of theoretical statistics and social/psychological applications. Due in part to the complexity of the problems tackled today and in part to the availability of cheap, powerful computing\u2014by no means independent influences\u2014simulation and Monte Carlo methods have become both necessary and practical tools for statisticians and applied workers in quantitative areas of education and psychology. Simulation has become popular\u2014not only in the quantitative social sciences, but in all of the mathematical sciences from physics to operations research to number theory\u2014because it is almost always easy to do. This ease of use makes the simulation experimenter vulnerable to two common pitfalls. Selection of the basic source of \"random numbers\" is often passive: Whatever is available in the computer's standard subroutine library is used. However, the fact that a pseudo-random number generator appears in a popular software package or operating system is hardly reason to trust it, as is shown by the infamous RANDU generator, once popular on IBM mainframes and PDP mini-computers, and by the generators burned into RAM on today's PCs. Simulation design and reporting also deserve special care. Some attempt must be made to assess the accuracy of the simulation estimates: One should accurately estimate and report SE (6) as well as 6. In addition, enough detail should be reported that the interested reader can replicate the study and check the results, just as with other experiments. Yet these considerations are also easy to overlook. Brian D. Ripley's Stochastic Simulation is a short, yet ambitious, survey of modern simulation techniques. Three themes run throughout the book. First, one shoud not take basic simulation subroutines for granted, especially on minior microcomputers where they tend to be poor implementations, implementations of poor algorithms, or both. Second, design of experiments, or variance reduction as it is known in this field, deserves greater consideration. Third, modern methods make it possible to simulate and analyze processes that are dependent over time, and using such processes opens the door to new simulation techniques, such as simulated annealing in optimization. Ripley intends this book to be a \"comprehensive guide,\" and it is indeed most accurately described as a researcher's handbook with examples and"
