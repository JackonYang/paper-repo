Of late, there has been increasing interest in building search/index structures for performing similarity search over high-dimensional data, e.g., image databases, document collections, time-series databases, and genome databases. Unfortunately, all known techniques for solving this problem fall prey to the \\curse of dimensionality.\" That is, the data structures scale poorly with data dimensionality; in fact, if the number of dimensions exceeds 10 to 20, searching in k-d trees and related structures involves the inspection of a large fraction of the database, thereby doing no better than brute-force linear search. It has been suggested that since the selection of features and the choice of a distance metric in typical applications is rather heuristic, determining an approximate nearest neighbor should su ce for most practical purposes. In this paper, we examine a novel scheme for approximate similarity search based on hashing. The basic idea is to hash the points Supported by NAVY N00014-96-1-1221 grant and NSF Grant IIS-9811904.

Experimental results also indicate that our scheme scales well even for a relatively large number of dimensions (more than 50)."

Recently, Hamming embedding methods such as spectral hashing have addressed the problem of obtaining compact binary codes optimizing the trade-off between the memory usage and the probability of retrieving the true nearest neighbors. In this paper, we formulate the problem of generating compact signatures as a rate-distortion problem. In the spirit of source coding algorithms, we aim at minimizing the reconstruction error on the squared distances with a constraint on the memory usage. The vectors are ranked based on the distance estimates to the query vector. Experiments on image descriptors show a significant improvement over spectral hashing."

Our measure (CDM) takes into account the local distribution of the vectors and iteratively estimates distance correcting terms. These terms are subsequently used to update an existing distance, thereby modifying the neighborhood structure. Experimental results on the Nister-Stewenius dataset show that our approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art in terms of accuracy. Our efficient search structure for visual word vectors is a two-level scheme using inverted files. The first level partitions the image set into clusters of images. At query time, only a subset of clusters of the second level has to be searched. This method allows fast querying in large sets of images. We evaluate the gain in speed and the loss in accuracy on large datasets (up to 500k images)."

In this paper, we show that the problem of finding a best code for a given dataset is closely related to the problem of graph partitioning and can be shown to be NP hard. By relaxing the original problem, we obtain a spectral method whose solutions are simply a subset of thresholded eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian. By utilizing recent results on convergence of graph Laplacian eigenvectors to the Laplace-Beltrami eigenfunctions of manifolds, we show how to efficiently calculate the code of a novel data-point. Taken together, both learning the code and applying it to a novel point are extremely simple. Our experiments show that our codes outperform the state-of-the art."

We, first, analyze bag-of-features in the framework of approximate nearest neighbor search. This shows the sub-optimality of such a representation for matching descriptors and leads us to derive a more precise representation based on 1) Hamming embedding (HE) and 2) weak geometric consistency constraints (WGC). HE provides binary signatures that refine the matching based on visual words. WGC filters matching descriptors that are not consistent in terms of angle and scale. HE and WGC are integrated within the inverted file and are efficiently exploited for all images, even in the case of very large datasets. Experiments performed on a dataset of one million of images show a significant improvement due to the binary signature and the weak geometric consistency constraints, as well as their efficiency. Estimation of the full geometric transformation, i.e., a re-ranking step on a short list of images, is complementary to our weak geometric consistency constraints and allows to further improve the accuracy."

Recent work has explored ways to embed high-dimensional features or complex distance functions into a low-dimensional Hamming space where items can be efficiently searched. However, existing methods do not apply for high-dimensional kernelized data when the underlying feature embedding for the kernel is unknown. We show how to generalize locality-sensitive hashing to accommodate arbitrary kernel functions, making it possible to preserve the algorithm's sub-linear time similarity search guarantees for a wide class of useful similarity functions. Since a number of successful image-based kernels have unknown or incomputable embeddings, this is especially valuable for image retrieval tasks. We validate our technique on several large-scale datasets, and show that it enables accurate and fast performance for example-based object classification, feature matching, and content-based retrieval."

There are no known exact algorithms for solving these high-dimensional problems that are faster than linear search. Approximate algorithms are known to provide large speedups with only minor loss in accuracy, but many such algorithms have been published with only minimal guidance on selecting an algorithm and its parameters for any given problem. In this paper, we describe a system that answers the question, \u201cWhat is the fastest approximate nearest-neighbor algorithm for my data?\u201d Our system will take any given dataset and desired degree of precision and use these to automatically determine the best algorithm and parameter values. We also describe a new algorithm that applies priority search on hierarchical k-means trees, which we have found to provide the best known performance on many datasets. After testing a range of alternatives, we have found that multiple randomized k-d trees provide the best performance for other datasets. We are releasing public domain code that implements these approaches. This library provides about one order of magnitude improvement in query time over the best previously available software and provides fully automated parameter selection."

In large scale problems, memory becomes a limiting factor - local geometry is stored for each feature detected in each image and requires storage larger than the inverted file and term frequency and inverted document frequency weights together. We propose a novel method for learning discretized local geometry representation based on minimization of average reprojection error in the space of ellipses. The representation requires only 24 bits per feature without drop in performance. Additionally, we show that if the gravity vector assumption is used consistently from the feature description to spatial verification, it improves retrieval performance and decreases the memory footprint. The proposed method outperforms state of the art retrieval algorithms in a standard image retrieval benchmark."

A key component of these approaches is that local regions of images are characterized using high-dimensional descriptors which are then mapped to ldquovisual wordsrdquo selected from a discrete vocabulary.This paper explores techniques to map each visual region to a weighted set of words, allowing the inclusion of features which were lost in the quantization stage of previous systems. The set of visual words is obtained by selecting words based on proximity in descriptor space. We describe how this representation may be incorporated into a standard tf-idf architecture, and how spatial verification is modified in the case of this soft-assignment. We evaluate our method on the standard Oxford Buildings dataset, and introduce a new dataset for evaluation. Our results exceed the current state of the art retrieval performance on these datasets, particularly on queries with poor initial recall where techniques like query expansion suffer. Overall we show that soft-assignment is always beneficial for retrieval with large vocabularies, at a cost of increased storage requirements for the index."

However, the performance of these methods generally degrades as dimensionality increases. Although this phenomenon-known as the \u2018dimensional curse\u2019-is well known, little or no quantitative a.nalysis of the phenomenon is available. In this paper, we provide a detailed analysis of partitioning and clustering techniques for similarity search in HDVSs. We show formally that these methods exhibit linear complexity at high dimensionality, and that existing methods are outperformed on average by a simple sequential scan if the number of dimensions exceeds around 10. Consequently, we come up with an alternative organization based on approximations to make the unavoidable sequential scan as fast as possible. We describe a simple vector approximation scheme, called VA-file, and report on an experimental evaluation of this and of two tree-based index methods (an R*-tree and an X-tree)."

We then propose an approximate representation of bag-of-features obtained by projecting the corresponding histogram onto a set of pre-defined sparse projection functions, producing several image descriptors. Coupled with a proper indexing structure, an image is represented by a few hundred bytes. A distance expectation criterion is then used to rank the images.

We show that under a broad set of conditions (much broader than independent and identically distributed dimensions), as dimensionality increases, the distance to the nearest data point approaches the distance to the farthest data point. To provide a practical perspective, we present empirical results on both real and synthetic data sets that demonstrate that this effect can occur for as few as 10-15 dimensions. \n \nThese results should not be interpreted to mean that high-dimensional indexing is never meaningful; we illustrate this point by identifying some high-dimensional workloads for which this effect does not occur. However, our results do emphasize that the methodology used almost universally in the database literature to evaluate high-dimensional indexing techniques is flawed, and should be modified. In particular, most such techniques proposed in the literature are not evaluated versus simple linear scan, and are evaluated over workloads for which nearest neighbor is not meaningful. Often, even the reported experiments, when analyzed carefully, show that linear scan would outperform the techniques being proposed on the workloads studied in high (10-15) dimensionality!"

The efficiency and quality is exhibited in a live demonstration that recognizes CD-covers from a database of 40000 images of popular music CD\u2019s. The scheme builds upon popular techniques of indexing descriptors extracted from local regions, and is robust to background clutter and occlusion. The local region descriptors are hierarchically quantized in a vocabulary tree. The vocabulary tree allows a larger and more discriminatory vocabulary to be used efficiently, which we show experimentally leads to a dramatic improvement in retrieval quality. The most significant property of the scheme is that the tree directly defines the quantization. The quantization and the indexing are therefore fully integrated, essentially being one and the same. The recognition quality is evaluated through retrieval on a database with ground truth, showing the power of the vocabulary tree approach, going as high as 1 million images."

The user supplies a query object by selecting a region of a query image, and the system returns a ranked list of images that contain the same object, retrieved from a large corpus. We demonstrate the scalability and performance of our system on a dataset of over 1 million images crawled from the photo-sharing site, Flickr [3], using Oxford landmarks as queries. Building an image-feature vocabulary is a major time and performance bottleneck, due to the size of our dataset. To address this problem we compare different scalable methods for building a vocabulary and introduce a novel quantization method based on randomized trees which we show outperforms the current state-of-the-art on an extensive ground-truth. Our experiments show that the quantization has a major effect on retrieval quality. To further improve query performance, we add an efficient spatial verification stage to re-rank the results returned from our bag-of-words model and show that this consistently improves search quality, though by less of a margin when the visual vocabulary is large. We view this work as a promising step towards much larger, \"web-scale \" image corpora."

Methods for efficiently searching this incredibly rich resource are vital for a large number of applications. These include object recognition, computer graphics, personal photo collections, online image search tools. In this paper, our goal is to develop efficient image search and scene matching techniques that are not only fast, but also require very little memory, enabling their use on standard hardware or even on handheld devices. Our approach uses recently developed machine learning techniques to convert the Gist descriptor (a real valued vector that describes orientation energies at different scales and orientations within an image) to a compact binary code, with a few hundred bits per image. Using our scheme, it is possible to perform real-time searches with millions from the Internet using a single large PC and obtain recognition results comparable to the full descriptor. Using our codes on high quality labeled images from the LabelMe database gives surprisingly powerful recognition results using simple nearest neighbor techniques."

We also show that the algorithm finds the exact near neigbhor in O(log n) time for data satisfying certain \"bounded growth\" condition.Unlike earlier schemes, our LSH scheme works directly on points in the Euclidean space without embeddings. Consequently, the resulting query time bound is free of large factors and is simple and easy to implement. Our experiments (on synthetic data sets) show that the our data structure is up to 40 times faster than kd-tree."

We define near-duplicate as images altered with common transformations such as changing contrast, saturation, scaling, cropping, framing, etc. Our system builds a parts-based representation of images using <i>distinctive local descriptors</i> which give high quality matches even under severe transformations. To cope with the large number of features extracted from the images, we employ <i>locality-sensitive hashing</i> to index the local descriptors. This allows us to make approximate similarity queries that only examine a small fraction of the database. Although locality-sensitive hashing has excellent theoretical performance properties, a standard implementation would still be unacceptably slow for this application. We show that, by optimizing layout and access to the index data on disk, we can efficiently query indices containing millions of keypoints. Our system achieves near-perfect accuracy (100% precision at 99.85% recall) on the tests presented in Meng <i>et al.</i> [16], and consistently strong results on our own, significantly more challenging experiments. Query times are interactive even for collections of thousands of images."

Recent advances in computational geometry and machine learning, however, may alleviate the problems in using these methods on large data sets. This volume presents theoretical and practical discussions of nearest-neighbor (NN) methods in machine learning and examines computer vision as an application domain in which the benefit of these advanced methods is often dramatic. It brings together contributions from researchers in theory of computation, machine learning, and computer vision with the goals of bridging the gaps between disciplines and presenting state-of-the-art methods for emerging applications.The contributors focus on the importance of designing algorithms for NN search, and for the related classification, regression, and retrieval tasks, that remain efficient even as the number of points or the dimensionality of the data grows very large. The book begins with two theoretical chapters on computational geometry and then explores ways to make the NN approach practicable in machine learning applications where the dimensionality of the data and the size of the data sets make the naive methods for NN search prohibitively expensive. The final chapters describe successful applications of an NN algorithm, locality-sensitive hashing (LSH), to vision tasks."

Our approach achieves a sublinear complexity on the number of models, maintaining at the same time a high degree of performance for real 3D sensed data that is acquired in largely uncontrolled settings. The key component of our method is to first index surface descriptors computed at salient locations from the scene into the whole model database using the locality sensitive hashing (LSH), a probabilistic approximate nearest neighbor method. Progressively complex geometric constraints are subsequently enforced to further prune the initial candidates and eliminate false correspondences due to inaccuracies in the surface descriptors and the errors of the LSH algorithm. The indexed models are selected based on the MAP rule using posterior probability of the models estimated in the joint 3D-signature space. Experiments with real 3D data employing a large database of vehicles, most of them very similar in shape, containing 1,000,000 features from more than 365 models demonstrate a high degree of performance in the presence of occlusion and obscuration, unmodeled vehicle interiors and part articulations, with an average processing time between 50 and 100 seconds per query"

In this paper we evaluate the search accuracy and complexity of the global GIST descriptor for two applications, for which a local description is usually preferred: same location/object recognition and copy detection. We identify the cases in which a global description can reasonably be used.\n The comparison is performed against a state-of-the-art bag-of-features representation. To evaluate the impact of GIST's spatial grid, we compare GIST with a bag-of-features restricted to the same spatial grid as in GIST.\n Finally, we propose an indexing strategy for global descriptors that optimizes the trade-off between memory usage and precision. Our scheme provides a reasonable accuracy in some widespread application cases together with very high efficiency: In our experiments, querying an image database of 110 million images takes 0.18 second per image on a single machine. For common copyright attacks, this efficiency is obtained without noticeably sacrificing the search accuracy compared with state-of-the-art approaches."

The object is represented by a set of viewpoint invariant region descriptors so that recognition can proceed successfully despite changes in viewpoint, illumination and partial occlusion. The temporal continuity of the video within a shot is used to track the regions in order to reject unstable regions and reduce the effects of noise in the descriptors. The analogy with text retrieval is in the implementation where matches on descriptors are pre-computed (using vector quantization), and inverted file systems and document rankings are used. The result is that retrieved is immediate, returning a ranked list of key frames/shots in the manner of Google. The method is illustrated for matching in two full length feature films."

An important research issue in the field of multimedia databases is the content-based retrieval of similar multimedia objects such as images, text, and videos. However, in contrast to searching data in a relational database, a content-based retrieval requires the search of similar objects as a basic functionality of the database system. Most of the approaches addressing similarity search use a so-called feature transformation that transforms important properties of the multimedia objects into high-dimensional points (feature vectors). Thus, the similarity search is transformed into a search of points in the feature space that are close to a given query point in the high-dimensional feature space. Query processing in high-dimensional spaces has therefore been a very active research area over the last few years. A number of new index structures and algorithms have been proposed. It has been shown that the new index structures considerably improve the performance in querying large multimedia databases. Based on recent tutorials [Berchtold and Keim 1998], in this survey we provide an overview of the current state of the art in querying multimedia databases, describing the index structures and algorithms for an efficient query processing in high-dimensional spaces. We identify the problems of processing queries in high-dimensional space, and we provide an overview of the proposed approaches to overcome these problems."

Using a variety of non-parametric methods, we explore this world with the aid of a large dataset of 79,302,017 images collected from the Internet. Motivated by psychophysical results showing the remarkable tolerance of the human visual system to degradations in image resolution, the images in the dataset are stored as 32 x 32 color images. Each image is loosely labeled with one of the 75,062 non-abstract nouns in English, as listed in the Wordnet lexical database. Hence the image database gives a comprehensive coverage of all object categories and scenes. The semantic information from Wordnet can be used in conjunction with nearest-neighbor methods to perform object classification over a range of semantic levels minimizing the effects of labeling noise. For certain classes that are particularly prevalent in the dataset, such as people, we are able to demonstrate a recognition performance comparable to class-specific Viola-Jones style detectors."

                "text": "New techniques characterized by low computational complexity, great learning capability, and efficient decision methods are highly desirable in order to regulate and classify nondeterministic phenomena and events in the emerging areas of signal, image, and video processing. The reason for this great interest is closely related to intrinsic nondeterministic nature of real phenomena, taking the deterministic hypothesis just as an approximation of the actual behavior. The great interest in the nearest-neighbor methods and the absence of reliable solutions for many nondeterministic problems represent the starting points for the formalization and development of specific approaches and suitable techniques. In this excellent book, the editors deal with the state-of-the-art, current best practices, and some innovative applications of nearest-neighbor methods in learning and vision. In fact, this volume brings together contributions of top-level researchers in theory of computation, machine learning, and computer vision with the goal of closing up the gaps between disciplines and current state-of-the-art methods for emerging applications. Therefore, the audience of this volume consists of researchers, scientists, engineers, professionals, and academics, working not only in this field, but also in any field that could benefit from these powerful methods. This book can be particularly useful to researchers working on the basis set expansion networks. Finally, it is worth noting that all the content is well-written, highly relevant, original, and timely. In order to better appreciate the aforementioned remarks let us briefly introduce the book chapters. Chapter 1 written by the editors introduces the book and its organization. Chapter 2 entitled \u201cNearest-neighbor searching and metric space dimension\u201d is authored by K. L. Clarkson. The content deals with the problem definition and its relationship with the concepts of metric space dimension. The state-of-the-art and the current best practices are proposed and properly discussed. In Chapter 3 entitled \u201cLocality-sensitive hashing using stable distributions,\u201d written by A. Andoni, M. Datar, N. Immorlica, P. Indyk, and V. Mirrokni, novel locality-sensitive hashing technique is described, providing an efficient solution to the randomized nearest-neighbor problem. Chapter 4 is entitled \u201cNew algorithms for efficient high-dimensional nonparametric classification,\u201d authored by T. Liu, A. W. Moore, and A. Gray. It deals with new balltree algorithms that on real-world data sets"

The procedure is based on a very low dimensional representation of the scene, that we term the Spatial Envelope. We propose a set of perceptual dimensions (naturalness, openness, roughness, expansion, ruggedness) that represent the dominant spatial structure of a scene. Then, we show that these dimensions may be reliably estimated using spectral and coarsely localized information. The model generates a multidimensional space in which scenes sharing membership in semantic categories (e.g., streets, highways, coasts) are projected closed together. The performance of the spatial envelope model shows that specific information about object shape or identity is not a requirement for scene categorization and that modeling a holistic representation of the scene informs about its probable semantic category."

A key step in the analysis of gene expression data is the clustering of genes into groups that show similar expression values over a range of conditions. Since only a small subset of the genes participate in any cellular process of interest, by focusing on subsets of genes and conditions, we can lower the noise induced by other genes and conditions \u2014 a co-cluster characterizes such a subset of interest. Cheng and Church [3] introduced an effective measure of co-cluster quality based on mean squared residue. In this paper, we use two similar squared residue measures and propose two fast k-means like co-clustering algorithms corresponding to the two residue measures. Our algorithms discover k row clusters and l column clusters simultaneously while monotonically decreasing the respective squared residues. Our co-clustering algorithms inherit the simplicity, efficiency and wide applicability of the k-means algorithm. Minimizing the residues may also be formulated as trace optimization problems that allow us to obtain a spectral relaxation that we use for a principled initialization for our iterative algorithms. We further enhance our algorithms by an incremental local search strategy that helps avoid empty clusters and escape poor local minima. We illustrate co-clustering results on a yeast cell cycle dataset and a human B-cell lymphoma dataset. Our experiments show that our co-clustering algorithms are efficient and are able to discover coherent co-clusters."
