A natural extension to this technique would be to utilize MDL to choose which encoding scheme is appropriate for a given problem. 2.4.2 Computer vision Image interpretation is another area to which minimum description length methods have been applied. Leclerc (1989) proposes an MDL technique for partitioning an image into regions."
