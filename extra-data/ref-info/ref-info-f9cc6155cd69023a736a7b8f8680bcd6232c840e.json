The technique is demonstrated by developing a system that locates people in cluttered scenes. The system is structured with four distinct example-based detectors that are trained to separately find the four components of the human body: the head, legs, left arm, and right arm. After ensuring that these components are present in the proper geometric configuration, a second example-based classifier combines the results of the component detectors to classify a pattern as either a \"person\" or a \"nonperson.\" We call this type of hierarchical architecture, in which learning occurs at multiple stages, an adaptive combination of classifiers (ACC). We present results that show that this system performs significantly better than a similar full-body person detector. This suggests that the improvement in performance is due to the component-based approach and the ACC data classification architecture. The algorithm is also more robust than the full-body person detection method in that it is capable of locating partially occluded views of people and people whose body parts have little contrast with the background."

This work is distinguished by three key contributions. The first is the introduction of a new image representation called the \"integral image\" which allows the features used by our detector to be computed very quickly. The second is a learning algorithm, based on AdaBoost, which selects a small number of critical visual features from a larger set and yields extremely efficient classifiers. The third contribution is a method for combining increasingly more complex classifiers in a \"cascade\" which allows background regions of the image to be quickly discarded while spending more computation on promising object-like regions. The cascade can be viewed as an object specific focus-of-attention mechanism which unlike previous approaches provides statistical guarantees that discarded regions are unlikely to contain the object of interest. In the domain of face detection the system yields detection rates comparable to the best previous systems. Used in real-time applications, the detector runs at 15 frames per second without resorting to image differencing or skin color detection."

The system derives much of its power from a representation that describes an object class in terms of an overcomplete dictionary of local, oriented, multiscale intensity differences between adjacent regions, efficiently computable as a Haar wavelet transform. This example-based learning approach implicitly derives a model of an object class by training a support vector machine classifier using a large set of positive and negative examples. We present results on face, people, and car detection tasks using the same architecture. In addition, we quantify how the representation affects detection performance by considering several alternate representations including pixels and principal components. We also describe a real-time application of our person detection system as part of a driver assistance system."

We show how to find people by finding candidate body segments, and then constructing assemblies of segments that are consistent with the constraints on the appearance of a person that result from kinematic properties. Since a reasonable model of a person requires at least nine segments, it is not possible to inspect every group, due to the huge combinatorial complexity.We propose two approaches to this problem. In one, the search can be pruned by using projected versions of a classifier that accepts groups corresponding to people. We describe an efficient projection algorithm for one popular classifier, and demonstrate that our approach can be used to determine whether images of real scenes contain people.The second approach employs a probabilistic framework, so that we can draw samples of assemblies, with probabilities proportional to their likelihood, which allows to draw human-like assemblies more often than the non-person ones. The main performance problem is in segmentation of images, but the overall results of both approaches on real images of people are encouraging."

The three novel contributions of the paper are : (1) Accumulation of probabilities of detection over a sequence. This allows to obtain a coherent detection over time as well as independence from thresholds. (2) Prediction of the detection parameters which are position, scale and pose. This guarantees the accuracy of accumulation as well as a continuous detection. (3) The way pose is represented. The representation is based on the combination of two detectors, one for frontal views and one for profiles. Face detection is fully automatic and is based on the method developed by Schneiderman [13]. It uses local histograms of wavelet coefficients represented with respect to a coordinate frame fixed to the object. A probability of detection is obtained for each image position, several scales and the two detectors. The probabilities of detection are propagated over time using a Condensation filter and factored sampling. Prediction is based on a zero order model for position, scale and \"pose\"; update uses the probability maps produced by the detection routine. Experiments show a clear improvement over frame-based detection results."

The main difficulties are the large appearance variations caused by action, clothing, illumination, viewpoint and scale. Our goal is to find people in static video frames using learned models of both the appearance of body parts (head, limbs, hands), and of the geometry of their assemblies. We build on Forsyth & Fleck's general 'body plan' methodology and Felzenszwalb & Huttenlocher's dynamic programming approach for efficiently assembling candidate parts into 'pictorial structures'. However we replace the rather simple part detectors used in these works with dedicated detectors learned for each body part using SupportVector Machines (SVMs) or RelevanceVector Machines (RVMs). We are not aware of any previous work using SVMs to learn articulated body plans, however they have been used to detect both whole pedestrians and combinations of rigidly positioned subimages (typically, upper body, arms, and legs) in street scenes, under a wide range of illumination, pose and clothing variations. RVMs are SVM-like classifiers that offer a well-founded probabilistic interpretation and improved sparsity for reduced computation. We demonstrate their benefits experimentally in a series of results showing great promise for learning detectors in more general situations."

Moving people are modeled with the assumption that, while configuration can vary quite substantially from frame to frame, appearance does not. This leads to an algorithm that firstly builds a model of the appearance of the body of each individual by clustering candidate body segments, and then uses this model to find all individuals in each frame. Unusually, the tracker does not rely on a model of human dynamics to identify possible instances of people; such models are unreliable, because human motion is fast and large accelerations are common. We show our tracking algorithm can be interpreted as a loopy inference procedure on an underlying Bayes net. Experiments on video of real scenes demonstrate that this tracker can (a) count distinct individuals; (b) identify and track them; (c) recover when it loses track, for example, if individuals are occluded or briefly leave the view; (d) identify the configuration of the body largely correctly; and (e) is not dependent on particular models of human motion."

In the first step, contour features are used in a hierarchical template matching approach to efficiently \"lock\" onto candidate solutions. Shape matching is based on Distance Transforms. By capturing the objects shape variability by means of a template hierarchy and using a combined coarse-to-fine approach in shape and parameter space, this method achieves very large speed-ups compared to a brute-force method. We have measured gains of several orders of magnitude. The second step utilizes the richer set of intensity features in a pattern classification approach to verify the candidate solutions (i.e. using Radial Basis Functions). We present experimental results on pedestrian detection off-line and on-board our Urban Traffic Assistant vehicle and discuss the challenges that lie ahead."

This is done using expectation-maximization in a maximum-likelihood setting. In recognition, this model is used in a Bayesian manner to classify images.

Psychophysical experiments have shown the importance of local context in the face detection process. In this paper we investigate the role of local context for face detection algorithms.

However, these approaches fail when these factors are too strong, due to the limited repeatability and discriminative power of the features. As additional shortcomings, the objects need to be rigid and only their approximate location is found. We present a novel Object Recognition approach which overcomes these limitations. An initial set of feature correspondences is first generated. The method anchors on it and then gradually explores the surrounding area, trying to construct more and more matching features, increasingly farther from the initial ones. The resulting process covers the object with matches, and simultaneously separates the correct matches from the wrong ones. Hence, recognition and segmentation are achieved at the same time. Only very few correct initial matches suffice for reliable recognition. The experimental results demonstrate the stronger power of the presented method in dealing with extensive clutter, dominant occlusion, large scale and viewpoint changes. Moreover non-rigid deformations are explicitly taken into account, and the approximative contours of the object are produced. The approach can extend any viewpoint invariant feature extractor."

To cope with these problems we represent the 3D human body as a graphical model in which the relationships between the body parts are represented by conditional probability distributions. We formulate the pose estimation problem as one of probabilistic inference over a graphical model where the random variables correspond to the individual limb parameters (position and orientation). Because the limbs are described by 6-dimensional vectors encoding pose in 3-space, discretization is impractical and the random variables in our model must be continuous-valued. To approximate belief propagation in such a graph we exploit a recently introduced generalization of the particle filter. This framework facilitates the automatic initialization of the body-model from low level cues and is robust to occlusion of body parts and scene clutter."

The features are invariant to image scaling, translation, and rotation, and partially invariant to illumination changes and affine or 3D projection. These features share similar properties with neurons in inferior temporal cortex that are used for object recognition in primate vision. Features are efficiently detected through a staged filtering approach that identifies stable points in scale space. Image keys are created that allow for local geometric deformations by representing blurred image gradients in multiple orientation planes and at multiple scales. The keys are used as input to a nearest neighbor indexing method that identifies candidate object matches. Final verification of each match is achieved by finding a low residual least squares solution for the unknown model parameters. Experimental results show that robust object recognition can be achieved in cluttered partially occluded images with a computation time of under 2 seconds."

We present a simple method for image description based on histograms of qualitative shape indexes computed from the combination of triplets of sampled locations and gradient directions in the image. We demonstrate that this method indeed is able to capture variation within classes of objects and we apply it to the problem of recognizing four different categories from a large database. Using our descriptor on the whole image, containing varying degrees of background clutter, we obtain results for two of the objects that are superior to the best results published so far for this database. By cropping images manually we demonstrate that our method has a potential to handle also the other objects when supplied with an algorithm for searching the image. We argue that our method, based on qualitative image properties, capture the large range of variation that is typically encountered within an object class. This means that our method can be used on substantially larger patches of images than existing methods based on simpler criteria for evaluating image similarity."

The object representation consists of an association of frame regions. These regions provide exemplars of the object\u2019s possible visual appearances.Two ideas are developed: (i) associating regions within a single shot to represent a deforming object; (ii) associating regions from the multiple visual aspects of a 3D object, thereby implicitly representing 3D structure. For the association we exploit temporal continuity (tracking) and wide baseline matching of affine covariant regions.In the implementation there are three areas of novelty: First, we describe a method to repair short gaps in tracks. Second, we show how to join tracks across occlusions (where many tracks terminate simultaneously). Third, we develop an affine factorization method that copes with motion degeneracy.We obtain tracks that last throughout the shot, without requiring a 3D reconstruction. The factorization method is used to associate tracks into object-level groups, with common motion. The outcome is that separate parts of an object that are not simultaneously visible (such as the front and back of a car, or the front and side of a face) are associated together. In turn this enables object-level matching and recognition throughout a video.We illustrate the method on the feature film \u201cGroundhog Day.\u201d Examples are given for the retrieval of deforming objects (heads, walking people) and rigid objects (vehicles, locations)."

We focus on the probabilistic tracking of people and learn models of how they appear and move in images. In particular we learn the likelihood of observing various spatial and temporal filter responses corresponding to edges, ridges, and motion differences given a model of the person. Similarly, we learn probability distributions over filter responses for general scenes that define a likelihood of observing the filter responses for arbitrary backgrounds. We then derive a probabilistic model for tracking that exploits the ratio between the likelihood that image pixels corresponding to the foreground (person) were generated by an actual person or by some unknown background. The paper extends previous work on learning image statistics and combines it with Bayesian tracking using particle filtering. By combining multiple image cues, and by using learned likelihood models, we demonstrate improved robustness and accuracy when tracking complex objects such as people in monocular image sequences with cluttered scene and a moving camera."

Often, images are represented using parametric models to characterize (noise-free) image variation, and, additive noise. However, the noise model may be unknown and parametric models may only be valid on individual segments of the image. Consequently, we model noise using a nonparametric kernel density estimation framework and use a locally or globally linear parametric model to represent the noise-free image pattern. This results in a novel, robust, redescending, M- parameter estimator for the above image model which we call the Kernel Maximum Likelihood estimator (KML). We also provide a provably convergent, iterative algorithm for the resultant optimization problem. The estimation framework is empirically validated on synthetic data and applied to the task of range image segmentation."

The representation is an organized collection of grouping hints obtained from a combination of constraints on color and texture and constraints on geometric properties such as the structure of individual parts and the relationships between parts. Body plans can be learned from image data, using established statistical learning techniques. The approach is illustrated with two examples of programs that successfully use body plans for recognition: one example involves determining whether a picture contains a scantily clad human, using a body plan built by hand; the other involves determining whether a picture contains a horse, using a body plan learned from image data. In both cases, the system demonstrates excellent performance on large, uncontrolled test sets and very large and diverse control sets."

Typically an object is represented in terms of a model shape. A new shape is classified as being an instance of the object when the Hausdorff distance between the model and the new shape is small. We show that such object concepts can be seen as halfspaces (linear threshold functions) in a transformed input space. This makes it possible to use a number of standard algorithms to learn object models from training examples. When a good model exists, we are guaranteed to find one that provides (with high probability) a recognition rule that is accurate. Our approach provides a measure which generalizes the Hausdorff distance in a number of interesting ways. To demonstrate our method we trained a system to detect people in images using a single shape model. The learning techniques can be extended to represent objects using multiple model shapes. In this way, we might be able to automatically learn a small set of canonical shapes that characterize the appearance of an object."

                "text": "A new boosting algorithm, called FloatBoost, is proposed to overcome the monotonicity problem of the sequential AdaBoost learning. AdaBoost [1, 2] is a sequential forward search procedure using the greedy selection strategy. The premise oyered by the sequential procedure can be broken-down when the monotonicity assumption, i.e. that when adding a new feature to the current set, the value of the performance criterion does not decrease, is violated. FloatBoost incorporates the idea of Floating Search [3] into AdaBoost to solve the non-monotonicity problem encountered in the sequential search of AdaBoost.We then present a system which learns to detect multi-view faces using FloatBoost. The system uses a coarse-to-fine, simple-to-complex architecture called detector-pyramid. FloatBoost learns the component detectors in the pyramid and yields similar or higher classification accuracy than AdaBoost with a smaller number of weak classifiers. This work leads to the first real-time multi-view face detection system in the world. It runs at 200 ms per image of size 320x240 pixels on a Pentium-III CPU of 700 MHz. A live demo will be shown at the conference."

In other words, it generates coarse segmentation cues, and can hence be seen as preceding further processing, which can then be properly tuned. It is argued that once such information is available, many other processing tasks can become much simpler. Experiments on real imagery demonstrate that the proposed theory gives intuitive results."

There are no user-tuned parameters (other than initialization); all parameters are learned by maximizing the likelihood of the entire image stream. We apply our method to both rigid and non-rigid shape reconstruction, and demonstrate it in challenging cases of occlusion and variable illumination."

                "text": "Recovery of three dimensional (3D) shape and motion of non-static scenes from a monocular video sequence is important for applications like robot navigation and human computer interaction. If every point in the scene randomly moves, it is impossible to recover the non-rigid shapes. In practice, many non-rigid objects, e.g. the human face under various expressions, deform with certain structures. Their shapes can be regarded as a weighted combination of certain shape bases. Shape and motion recovery under such situations has attracted much interest. Previous work on this problem (Bregler, C., Hertzmann, A., and Biermann, H. 2000. In Proc. Int. Conf. Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition; Brand, M. 2001. In Proc. Int. Conf. Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition; Torresani, L., Yang, D., Alexander, G., and Bregler, C. 2001. In Proc. Int. Conf. Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) utilized only orthonormality constraints on the camera rotations (rotation constraints). This paper proves that using only the rotation constraints results in ambiguous and invalid solutions. The ambiguity arises from the fact that the shape bases are not unique. An arbitrary linear transformation of the bases produces another set of eligible bases. To eliminate the ambiguity, we propose a set of novel constraints, basis constraints, which uniquely determine the shape bases. We prove that, under the weak-perspective projection model, enforcing both the basis and the rotation constraints leads to a closed-form solution to the problem of non-rigid shape and motion recovery. The accuracy and robustness of our closed-form solution is evaluated quantitatively on synthetic data and qualitatively on real video sequences."

Each variable has strong statistical dependency with a small number of other variables and negligible dependency with the remaining ones. Such structuring makes it possible to construct a powerful classifier by only representing the stronger dependencies among the variables. In particular, a semi-naive Bayes classifier compactly represents sparseness. A semi-naive Bayes classifier decomposes the input variables into subsets and represents statistical dependency within each subset, while treating the subsets as statistically independent. However, learning the structure of a semi-naive Bayes classifier is known to be NP complete. The high dimensionality of images makes statistical structure learning especially challenging. This paper describes an algorithm that searches for the structure of a semi-naive Bayes classifier in this large space of possible structures. The algorithm seeks to optimize two cost functions: a localized error in the log-likelihood ratio function to restrict the structure and a global classification error to choose the final structure. We use this approach to train detectors for several objects including faces, eyes, ears, telephones, push-carts, and door-handles. These detectors perform robustly with a high detection rate and low false alarm rate in unconstrained settings over a wide range of variation in background scenery and lighting."

Many different descriptors have been proposed in the literature. It is unclear which descriptors are more appropriate and how their performance depends on the interest region detector. The descriptors should be distinctive and at the same time robust to changes in viewing conditions as well as to errors of the detector. Our evaluation uses as criterion recall with respect to precision and is carried out for different image transformations. We compare shape context [Belongie, S, et al., April 2002], steerable filters [Freeman, W and Adelson, E, Setp. 1991], PCA-SIFT [Ke, Y and Sukthankar, R, 2004], differential invariants [Koenderink, J and van Doorn, A, 1987], spin images [Lazebnik, S, et al., 2003], SIFT [Lowe, D. G., 1999], complex filters [Schaffalitzky, F and Zisserman, A, 2002], moment invariants [Van Gool, L, et al., 1996], and cross-correlation for different types of interest regions. We also propose an extension of the SIFT descriptor and show that it outperforms the original method. Furthermore, we observe that the ranking of the descriptors is mostly independent of the interest region detector and that the SIFT-based descriptors perform best. Moments and steerable filters show the best performance among the low dimensional descriptors."

Traditional mean shift based segmentation uses a radially symmetric kernel to estimate local density, which is not optimal in view of the often structured nature of image and more particularly video data. In this paper we present an anisotropic kernel mean shift in which the shape, scale, and orientation of the kernels adapt to the local structure of the image or video. We decompose the anisotropic kernel to provide handles for modifying the segmentation based on simple heuristics. Experimental results show that the anisotropic kernel mean shift outperforms the original mean shift on image and video segmentation in the following aspects: 1) it gets better results on general images and video in a smoothness sense; 2) the segmented results are more consistent with human visual saliency; 3) the algorithm is robust to initial parameters."

Each part is represented using a simple appearance model and the deformable configuration is represented by spring-like connections between pairs of parts. While pictorial structures were introduced a number of years ago, they have not been broadly applied to matching and recognition problems. This has been due in part to the computational difficulty of matching pictorial structures to images. In this paper we present an efficient algorithm for finding the best global match of a pictorial stucture to an image. With this improved algorithm, pictorial structures provide a practical and powerful framework for quantitative descriptions of objects and scenes, and are suitable for many generic image recognition problems. We illustrate the approach using simple models of a person and a car."

Examples include principal component analysis (as used for instance in 'eigen-faces'), independent component analysis, and auto-encoder neural networks. Such methods suffer from a number of restrictions such as the limitation to linear manifolds or the absence of a probablistic representation. In this paper we exploit recent developments in the fields of variational inference and latent variable models to develop a novel and tractable probabilistic approach to modelling manifolds which can handle complex non-linearities. Our framework comprises a mixture of sub-space components in which both the number of components and the effective dimensionality of the subspaces are determined automatically as part of the Bayesian inference procedure. We illustrate our approach using two classical problems: modelling the manifold of face images and modelling the manifolds of hand-written digits."

The state of the art in interactive segmentation is probably represented by the graph cut algorithm of Boykov and Jolly (ICCV 2001). Its underlying model uses both colour and contrast information, together with a strong prior for region coherence. Estimation is performed by solving a graph cut problem for which very efficient algorithms have recently been developed. However the model depends on parameters which must be set by hand and the aim of this work is for those constants to be learned from image data."

In order to allow for large displacements, linearisations in the two data terms are strictly avoided. We present a consistent numerical scheme based on two nested fixed point iterations. By proving that this scheme implements a coarse-to-fine warping strategy, we give a theoretical foundation for warping which has been used on a mainly experimental basis so far. Our evaluation demonstrates that the novel method gives significantly smaller angular errors than previous techniques for optical flow estimation. We show that it is fairly insensitive to parameter variations, and we demonstrate its excellent robustness under noise."

Numerous applications in computer vision can be naturally interpreted as instanciations of this fundamental problem. Recently, a non-iterative discrete approach, tensor voting, has been introduced to solve this problem and has been applied successfully to various applications. As an alternative, we propose a variational formulation of this problem in the continuous setting and derive an iterative algorithm which approximates its solutions. This method and tensor voting are somewhat the differential and integral form of one another. Although iterative methods are slower in general, the strength of the suggested method is that it can easily be applied when the ambient space is not Euclidean, which is important in many applications. The algorithm consists in solving a partial differential equation that performs a special anisotropic diffusion on an implicit representation of the known set of points. This results in connecting isolated neighbouring points. This approach is very simple, mathematically sound, robust and powerful since it handles in a homogeneous way manifolds of arbitrary dimension and topology, embedded in Euclidean or non-Euclidean spaces, with or without border. We shall present this approach and demonstrate both its benefits and shortcomings in two different contexts: (i) data visual analysis, (ii) skin detection in color images."

The result of the groupwise registration is an implicit definition of dense correspondences between all of the images in a set, which can be used to construct statistical models of shape change across the set, avoiding the need for manual annotation of training images. We give examples on two datasets (brains and faces) and show the resulting models of shape and appearance variation. We show results of experiments demonstrating that the groupwise approach gives a more reliable correspondence than pairwise matching alone."

                "text": "A method was recently devised for the recovery of an invariant image from a 3-band colour image. The invariant image, originally 1D greyscale but here derived as a 2D chromaticity, is independent of lighting, and also has shading removed: it forms an intrinsic image that may be used as a guide in recovering colour images that are independent of illumination conditions. Invariance to illuminant colour and intensity means that such images are free of shadows, as well, to a good degree. The method devised finds an intrinsic reflectivity image based on assumptions of Lambertian reflectance, approximately Planckian lighting, and fairly narrowband camera sensors. Nevertheless, the method works well when these assumptions do not hold. A crucial piece of information is the angle for an \u201cinvariant direction\u201d in a log-chromaticity space. To date, we have gleaned this information via a preliminary calibration routine, using the camera involved to capture images of a colour target under different lights. In this paper, we show that we can in fact dispense with the calibration step, by recognizing a simple but important fact: the correct projection is that which minimizes entropy in the resulting invariant image. To show that this must be the case we first consider synthetic images, and then apply the method to real images. We show that not only does a correct shadow-free image emerge, but also that the angle found agrees with that recovered from a calibration. As a result, we can find shadow-free images for images with unknown camera, and the method is applied successfully to remove shadows from unsourced imagery."

Linear dynamic system (LDS) represented by the state-space equation has been proposed to model dynamic texture [12]. LDS can be used to synthesize dynamic texture by sampling the system noise. However, the visual quality of the synthesized dynamic texture using noise-driven LDS is often unsatisfactory. In this paper, we regard the noise-driven LDS as an open-loop control system and analyze its stability through its pole placement. We show that the noise-driven LDS can produce good quality dynamic texture if the LDS is oscillatory. To deal with an LDS not oscillatory, we present a novel approach, called closed-loop LDS (CLDS) where feedback control is introduced into the system. Using the succeeding hidden states as an input reference signal, we design a feedback controller based on the difference between the current state and the reference state. An iterative algorithm is proposed to generate dynamic textures. Experimental results demonstrate that CLDS can produce dynamic texture sequences with promising visual quality."

One drawback of MI, however, is that it is calculated on a pixel by pixel basis, meaning that it takes into account only the relationships between corresponding indi- vidual pixels and not those of each pixel's respective neighborhood. As a result, much of the spatial information inherent in images is not utilized. In this paper, we propose a novel extension to MI called regional mutual information (RMI). This extension efficiently takes neighborhood regions of corresponding pixels into account. We demonstrate the usefulness of RMI by applying it to a real-world problem in the medical domain\u2014 intensity-based 2D-3D registration of X-ray projection images (2D) to a CT image (3D). Using a gold-standard spine image data set, we show that RMI is a more robust similarity meaure for image registration than MI."

A consistent mapping is expected to preserve the integrity of warped structures and not to be dependent on the arbitrary choice of a reference image: the estimated transformation from A to B should be equal to the inverse transformation from B to A. This paper addresses these two issues in the context of a hierarchical parametric modeling of the mapping, based on B-spline functions. The parameters of the model are estimated by minimizing a symmetric form of the standard sum of squared differences criterion. Topology preservation is ensured by constraining the Jacobian of the transformation to remain positive on the whole continuous domain of the image as a non trivial 3-D extension of a previous work [1] dealing with the 2-D case. Results on synthetic and real-world data are shown to illustrate the contribution of preserving topology and using a symmetric similarity function."

We give a simplified analysis of AdaBoost in this setting, and we show how this analysis can be used to find improved parameter settings as well as a refined criterion for training weak hypotheses. We give a specific method for assigning confidences to the predictions of decision trees, a method closely related to one used by Quinlan. This method also suggests a technique for growing decision trees which turns out to be identical to one proposed by Kearns and Mansour. We focus next on how to apply the new boosting algorithms to multiclass classification problems, particularly to the multi-label case in which each example may belong to more than one class. We give two boosting methods for this problem, plus a third method based on output coding. One of these leads to a new method for handling the single-label case which is simpler but as effective as techniques suggested by Freund and Schapire. Finally, we give some experimental results comparing a few of the algorithms discussed in this paper."
