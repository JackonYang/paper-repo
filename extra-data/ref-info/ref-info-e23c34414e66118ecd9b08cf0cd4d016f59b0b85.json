The form of the recurrent neural network is described along with an appropriate parameter estimation procedure. For each frame of acoustic data, the recurrent network generates an estimate of the posterior probability of of the possible phones given the observed acoustic signal. The posteriors are then converted into scaled likelihoods and used as the observation probabilities within a conventional decoding paradigm (e.g., Viterbi decoding). The advantages of using recurrent networks are that they require a small number of parameters and provide a fast decoding capability (relative to conventional, large-vocabulary, HMM systems)3."

A discriminant hidden Markov model (HMM) is defined, and it is shown how a particular MLP with contextual and extra feedback input units can be considered as a general form of such a Markov model. A link between these discriminant HMMs, trained along the Viterbi algorithm, and any other approach based on least mean square minimization of an error function (LMSE) is established. It is shown theoretically and experimentally that the outputs of the MLP (when trained along the LMSE or the entropy criterion) approximate the probability distribution over output classes conditioned on the input, i.e. the maximum a posteriori probabilities. Results of a series of speech recognition experiments are reported. The possibility of embedding MLP into HMM is described. Relations with other recurrent networks are also explained. >"

As a recognition task, the speaker-dependent recognition of the phonemes B, D, and G in varying phonetic contexts was chosen. For comparison, several discrete hidden Markov models (HMM) were trained to perform the same task. Performance evaluation over 1946 testing tokens from three speakers showed that the TDNN achieves a recognition rate of 98.5% correct while the rate obtained by the best of the HMMs was only 93.7%. >"

We describe a procedure for finding E/wij, where E is an error functional of the temporal trajectory of the states of a continuous recurrent network and wij are the weights of that network. Computing these quantities allows one to perform gradient descent in the weights to minimize E. Simulations in which networks are taught to move through limit cycles are shown. This type of recurrent network seems particularly suited for temporally continuous domains, such as signal processing, control, and speech."

We wish to treat the outputs of the network as probabilities of alternatives (e.g. pattern classes), conditioned on the inputs. We look for appropriate output non-linearities and for appropriate criteria for adaptation of the parameters of the network (e.g. weights). We explain two modifications: probability scoring, which is an alternative to squared error minimisation, and a normalised exponential (softmax) multi-input generalisation of the logistic non-linearity. The two modifications together result in quite simple arithmetic, and hardware implementation is not difficult either. The use of radial units (squared distance instead of dot product) immediately before the softmax output stage produces a network which computes posterior distributions over class labels based on an assumption of Gaussian within-class distributions. However the training, which uses cross-class information, can result in better performance at class discrimination than the usual within-class training method, unless the within-class distribution assumptions are actually correct."

Current laboratory systems are capable of transcribing continuous speech from any speaker with average word-error rates between 5% and 10%. If speaker adaptation is allowed, then after 2 or 3 minutes of speech, the error rate will drop well below 5% for most speakers. LVR systems had been limited to dictation applications since the systems were speaker dependent and required words to be spoken with a short pause between them. However, the capability to recognize natural continuous-speech input from any speaker opens up many more applications. As a result, LVR technology appears to be on the brink of widespread deployment across a range of information technology (IT) systems. This article discusses the principles and architecture of current LVR systems and identifies the key issues affecting their future deployment. To illustrate the various points raised, the Cambridge University HTK system is described. This system is a modem design that gives state-of-the-art performance, and it is typical of the current generation of recognition systems."

When the estimation is accurate, network outputs can be treated as probabilities and sum to one. Simple proofs show that Bayesian probabilities are estimated when desired network outputs are 1 of M (one output unity, all others zero) and a squared-error or cross-entropy cost function is used. Results of Monte Carlo simulations performed using multilayer perceptron (MLP) networks trained with backpropagation, radial basis function (RBF) networks, and high-order polynomial networks graphically demonstrate that network outputs provide good estimates of Bayesian probabilities. Estimation accuracy depends on network complexity, the amount of training data, and the degree to which training data reflect true likelihood distributions and a priori class probabilities. Interpretation of network outputs as Bayesian probabilities allows outputs from multiple networks to be combined for higher level decision making, simplifies creation of rejection thresholds, makes it possible to compensate for differences between pattern class probabilities in training and test data, allows outputs to be used to minimize alternative risk functions, and suggests alternative measures of network performance."

The framework is that of a decision maker who consults several experts regarding some events. The experts express their opinions in the form of probability distributions. The decision maker must aggregate the experts' distributions into a single distribution that can be used for decision making. Two classes of aggregation methods are reviewed. When using a supra Bayesian procedure, the decision maker treats the expert opinions as data that may be combined with its own prior distribution via Bayes' rule. When using a linear opinion pool, the decision maker forms a linear combination of the expert opinions. The major feature that makes the aggregation of expert opinions difficult is the high correlation or dependence that typically occurs among these opinions. A theme of this paper is the need for training procedures that result in experts with relatively independent opinions or for aggregation methods that implicitly or explicitly model the dependence among the experts. Analyses are presented that show that m dependent experts are worth the same as k independent experts where k m. In some cases, an exact value for k can be given; in other cases, lower and upper bounds can be placed on k."
