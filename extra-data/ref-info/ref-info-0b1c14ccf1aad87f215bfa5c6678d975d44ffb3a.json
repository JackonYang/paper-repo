An entropy-based criterion for determining an optimum segmentation scale is proposed. A set of features consistent with the scaling model is described. It is used with a neural network to perform a low-resolution segmentation. Also described is a procedure for resolving the ambiguity in the boundary location resulting from the low-resolution segmentation process. This procedure makes use of a set of morphological filters and edges extracted at a higher resolution. The utility and accuracy of the method are demonstrated with a relatively complex example. The major limitation of the method is that the training time of the neural network classifier increases with the number of nodes in the network.<<ETX>>"

In addition, an algorithm is developed for determining the number of statistically distinct regions in an image and estimating the parameters of those regions. Both algorithms use a causal Gaussian autoregressive model to describe the mean, variance, and spatial correlation of the image textures. Together, the algorithms can be used to perform unsupervised texture segmentation. The multiple resolution segmentation algorithm first segments images at coarse resolution and then progresses to finer resolutions until individual pixels are classified. This method results in accurate segmentations and requires significantly less computation than some previously known methods. The field containing the classification of each pixel in the image is modeled as a Markov random field. Segmentation at each resolution is then performed by maximizing the a posteriori probability of this field subject to the resolution constraint. At each resolution, the a posteriori probability is maximized by a deterministic greedy algorithm which iteratively chooses the classification of individual pixels or pixel blocks. The unsupervised parameter estimation algorithm determines both the number of textures and their parameters by minimizing a global criterion based on the AIC information criterion. Clusters corresponding to the individual textures are formed by alternately estimating the cluster parameters and repartitioning the data into those clusters. Concurrently, the number of distinct textures is estimated by combining clusters until a minimum of the criterion is reached. >"

All nine attributes from an event, which is essentially a point in a 9-dimensional attribute space. Sets of such events are computed for different texture classes, and the inductive learning AQ algorithm is used to generate a given class description.

This review paper explains how Gibbs and Markov random field models provide a unifying theme for many contemporary problems in image analysis. Random field models permit the introduction of spatial context into pixel labeling problems, such as segmentation and restoration. Random field models also describe textured images and lead to algorithms for generating textured images, classifying textures and segmenting textured images. In spite of some impressive model-based image restoration and texture segmentation results reported in the literature, a number of fundamental issues remain unexplored, such as the specification of MRF models, modeling noise processes, performance evaluation, parameter estimation, the phase transition phenomenon and the comparative analysis of alternative procedures. The literature of random field models is filled with great promise, but..."

A texture model is a mathematical procedure capable of producing and describing a textured image. We explore the use of Markov random fields as texture models. The binomial model, where each point in the texture has a binomial distribution with parameter controlled by its neighbors and ``number of tries'' equal to the number of gray levels, was taken to be the basic model for the analysis. A method of generating samples from the binomial model is given, followed by a theoretical and practical analysis of the method's convergence. Examples show how the parameters of the Markov random field control the strength and direction of the clustering in the image. The power of the binomial model to produce blurry, sharp, line-like, and blob-like textures is demonstrated. Natural texture samples were digitized and their parameters were estimated under the Markov random field model. A hypothesis test was used for an objective assessment of goodness-of-fit under the Markov random field model. Overall, microtextures fit the model well. The estimated parameters of the natural textures were used as input to the generation procedure. The synthetic microtextures closely resembled their real counterparts, while the regular and inhomogeneous textures did not."

In psychophysiology, multichannel models have been particularly successful in explaining some low-level processing in the visual cortex. The expansion of a function into several frequency channels provides a representation which is intermediate between a spatial and a Fourier representation. The author describes the mathematical properties of such decompositions and introduces the wavelet transform. He reviews the classical multiresolution pyramidal transforms developed in computer vision and shows how they relate to the decomposition of an image into a wavelet orthonormal basis. He discusses the properties of the zero crossings of multifrequency channels. Zero-crossing representations are particularly well adapted for pattern recognition in computer vision. >"

A two stage generate-and-confirm paradigm for detecting all the edge pixels in the scene is used. In the first stage, a directional derivatives approach for determining all potential edge pixels and the direction of the edge is employed. At this stage some of the edge pixels could be spurious, typically caused by either the noise in the image or the microedges inside a texture. In the second stage, each candidate pixel is subjected to two separate tests to confirm whether the edge pixel is a step edge or texture edge. The texture edge is confirmed by a likelihood-ratio test. The likelihood function is computed by fitting a nonsymmetric half-plane random-field model to the texture in a rectangular strip where the dominant direction is perpendicular to the estimated edge direction. Only the edge pixels that pass at least one of the two tests is accepted. The validity of the method is demonstrated by testing four different images. >"

In partitioning, the label values are generic: two labels are the same when the corresponding scene locations are considered to belong to the same region. The distribution incorporates a measure of disparity between certain spatial features of block pairs of pixel gray levels, using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov nonparametric measures of difference between the distributions of these features. The number of model parameters is minimized by forbidding label configurations, which are assigned probability zero. The maximum a posteriori estimator of boundary placements and partitionings is examined. The forbidden states introduce constraints into the calculation of these configurations.

Each of these models is characterized by a set of neighbors, a set of coefficients, and a noise sequence of specified characteristics. We are concerned with two problems: the estimation of the unknown parameters in both SAR and CM models and the choice of an appropriate model from a class of such competing models. Assuming Gaussian-distributed variables, we discuss maximum likelihood (ML) estimation methods. In general, the ML scheme leads to nonlinear optimization problems. To avoid excessive computation, an iterative scheme is given for SAR models, which gives approximate ML estimates in the Gaussian case and reasonably good estimates in some non-Gaussian situations as well. Likewise, for CM models, an easily computable consistent estimate is given. The asymptotic mean-squared error (mse) of this estimate for a four-neighbor CM model is shown tn be substantially less than the mse of the popular coding estimate. Asymptotically consistent decision rules are given for choosing an appropriate SAR or CM model. The usefulness of the estimation scheme and the decision rule for the choice of neighbors is illustrated by using synthetic patterns. Synthetic patterns obeying known SAR and CM models are generated, and the models corresponding to true and several competing neighbor sets are fitted. The estimation scheme yields estimates close to the parameters of the true models, and the decision rule for the choice of neighbors picks up the true model from the class of competing models."

The MRF models used are noncausal; the mean of observation y(s) at position s is written as a linear weighted sum of neighboring observations surrounding s in all directions. The method of least squares is used to obtain estimates of the model parameters. The model is then used with periodic boundary conditions to regenerate the original texture. Results obtained indicate that this method could be used to compress textures with low bit rates."

Suppose also that there are two measurement experiments E1 and E2 that can be performed, and suppose that the outcomes are independent (given ?). Let Ei? denote an independent performance of experiment Ei. Let Pe(E) denote the probability of error resulting from the performance of experiment E. Elashoff [1] gives an example of three experiments E1,E2,E3 such that Pe(E1) < Pe(E2) < Pe(E3), but Pe(E1,E3) < Pe(E1,E2). Toussaint [2] exhibits binary valued experiments satisfying Pe(E1) < Pe(E2) < Pe(E3), such that Pe(E2,E3) < Pe(E1,E3) < Pe(E1,E2). We shall give an example of binary valued experiments E1 and E2 such that Pe(E1) < Pe(E2), but Pe(E2,E2?) < Pe(E1,E2) < Pe(E1,E1?). Thus if one observation is allowed, E1 is the best experiment. If two observations are allowed, then two independent copies of the ``worst'' experiment E2 are preferred. This is true despite the conditional independence of the observations."
