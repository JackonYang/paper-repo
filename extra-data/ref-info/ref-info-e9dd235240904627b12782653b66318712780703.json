Classification performance is compared to the supervised approaches of Vogel & Schiele [19] and Oliva & Torralba [11], and the semi-supervised approach of Fei Fei & Perona [3] using their own datasets and testing protocols. In all cases the combination of (unsupervised) pLSA followed by (supervised) nearest neighbour classification achieves superior results.

We achieve this using generative models from the statistical text literature: probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (pLSA), and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). In text analysis these are used to discover topics in a corpus using the bag-of-words document representation. Here we discover topics as object categories, so that an image containing instances of several categories is modelled as a mixture of topics. The models are applied to images by using a visual analogue of a word, formed by vector quantizing SIFT like region descriptors. We investigate a set of increasingly demanding scenarios, starting with image sets containing only two object categories through to sets containing multiple categories (including airplanes, cars, faces, motorbikes, spotted cats) and background clutter. The object categories sample both intra-class and scale variation, and both the categories and their approximate spatial layout are found without supervision. We also demonstrate classification of unseen images and images containing multiple objects. Performance of the proposed unsupervised method is compared to the semi-supervised approach of [7].1 1This work was sponsored in part by the EU Project CogViSys, the University of Oxford, Shell Oil, and the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency."

This bag of keypoints method is based on vector quantization of affine invariant descriptors of image patches. We propose and compare two alternative implementations using different classifiers: Naive Bayes and SVM. The main advantages of the method are that it is simple, computationally efficient and intrinsically invariant. We present results for simultaneously classifying seven semantic visual categories. These results clearly demonstrate that the method is robust to background clutter and produces good categorization accuracy even without exploiting geometric information."

Our formulation provides answers to three open questions:(l) whether the invariant local features are suitable for scene (rather than object) classification; (2) whether unsupennsed latent space models can be used for feature extraction in the classification task; and (3) whether the latent space formulation can discover visual co-occurrence patterns, motivating novel approaches for image organization and segmentation. Using a 9500-image dataset, our approach is validated on each of these issues. First, we show with extensive experiments on binary and multi-class scene classification tasks, that a bag-of-visterm representation, derived from local invariant descriptors, consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. Second, we show that probabilistic latent semantic analysis (PLSA) generates a compact scene representation, discriminative for accurate classification, and significantly more robust when less training data are available. Third, we have exploited the ability of PLSA to automatically extract visually meaningful aspects, to propose new algorithms for aspect-based image ranking and context-sensitive image segmentation."

This paper presents a large-scale evaluation of an approach that represents images as distributions (signatures or histograms) of features extracted from a sparse set of keypoint locations and learns a Support Vector Machine classifier with kernels based on two effective measures for comparing distributions, the Earth Mover's Distance and the chi-square distance. We first evaluate the performance of our approach with different keypoint detectors and descriptors, as well as different kernels and classifiers. We then conduct a comparative evaluation with several state-of-the-art recognition methods on four texture and five object databases. On most of these databases, our implementation exceeds the best reported results and achieves comparable performance on the rest. Finally, we investigate the influence of background correlations on recognition performance via extensive tests on the PASCAL database, for which ground-truth object localization information is available. Our experiments demonstrate that image representations based on distributions of local features are surprisingly effective for classification of texture and object images under challenging real-world conditions, including significant intra-class variations and substantial background clutter."

Our texture model is based on the statistical distribution of clustered filter responses. However, unlike previous 3D texton representations, we use rotationally invariant filters and cluster in an extremely low dimensional space. Having built a texton dictionary, we present a novel method of classifying a single image without requiring any a priori knowledge about the viewing or illumination conditions under which it was photographed. We argue that using rotationally invariant filters while clustering in such a low dimensional space improves classification performance and demonstrate this claim with results on all 61 textures in the Columbia-Utrecht database. We then proceed to show how texture models can be further extended by compensating for viewpoint changes using weak isotropy.The new clustering and classification methods are compared to those of Leung and Malik (ICCV 1999), Schmid (CVPR 2001) and Cula and Dana (CVPR 2001), which are the current state-of-the-art approaches."

A classifier is then learned for each of these parts, and feature selection is used to determine the most discriminative ones. This approach allows robust pan detection, and it is invariant under scale changes-that is, neither the training images nor the test images have to be normalized. The proposed method is evaluated in car detection tasks with significant variations in viewing conditions, and promising results are demonstrated. Different local regions, classifiers and feature selection methods are quantitatively compared. Our evaluation shows that local invariant descriptors are an appropriate representation for object classes such as cars, and it underlines the importance of feature selection."

The performance of the overall system is critically dependent on the distance measure used in the nearest neighbor search. A distance measure that minimizes the misclassification risk for the 1-nearest neighbor search can be shown to be the probability that a pair of input image measurements belong to different classes. In practice, we model the optimal distance measure using a linear logistic model that combines the discriminative powers of more elementary distance measures associated with a collection of simple to construct feature spaces like color, texture and local shape properties. Furthermore, in order to perform search over large training sets efficiently, the same framework was extended to find hamming distance measures associated with simple discriminators. By combining this discrete distance model with the continuous model, we obtain a hierarchical distance model that is both fast and accurate. Finally, the nearest neighbor search over object part classes was integrated into a whole object detection system and evaluated against an indoor detection task yielding good results."

This may occur when part of an object is hidden behind another part and results in a darker section in the gray level image of the object. The boundary contour of the object must include the boundary of this part which is entirely inside the outline of the object. The curvature scale space (CSS) image of a shape is a multiscale organization of its inflection points as it is smoothed. The CSS-based shape representation method has been selected for MPEG-7 standardization. We study the effects of contour self-intersection on the curvature scale space image. When there is no self-intersection, the CSS image contains several arch shape contours, each related to a concavity or a convexity of the shape. Self intersections create contours with minima as well as maxima in the CSS image. An efficient shape representation method has been introduced in this paper which describes a shape using the maxima as well as the minima of its CSS contours. This is a natural generalization of the conventional method which only includes the maxima of the CSS image contours. The conventional matching algorithm has also been modified to accommodate the new information about the minima. The method has been successfully used in a real world application to find, for an unknown leaf, similar classes from a database of classified leaf images representing different varieties of chrysanthemum. For many classes of leaves, self-intersection is inevitable during the scanning of the image. Therefore the original contributions of this paper is the generalization of the curvature scale space representation to the class of 2-D contours with self-intersection, and its application to the classification of Chrysanthemum leaves."

The epitome of an image is its miniature, condensed version containing the essence of the textural and shape properties of the image. As opposed to previously used simple image models, such as templates or basis functions, the size of the epitome is considerably smaller than the size of the image or object it represents, but the epitome still contains most constitutive elements needed to reconstruct the image. A collection of images often shares an epitome, e.g., when images are a few consecutive frames from a video sequence, or when they are photographs of similar objects. A particular image in a collection is defined by its epitome and a smooth mapping from the epitome to the image pixels. When the epitomic representation is used within a hierarchical generative model, appropriate inference algorithms can be derived to extract the epitome from a single image or a collection of images and at the same time perform various inference tasks, such as image segmentation, motion estimation, object removal and super-resolution."

To demonstrate this idea, it is used to build a new shape descriptor based on shape contexts. After that, we design a dynamic programming based method for shape matching and comparison. We have tested our approach on a variety of shape databases including an articulated shape dataset, MPEG7 CE-Shape-1, Kimia silhouettes, a Swedish leaf database and a human motion silhouette dataset.

Our scale and affine invariant detectors are based on the following recent results: (1) Interest points extracted with the Harris detector can be adapted to affine transformations and give repeatable results (geometrically stable). (2) The characteristic scale of a local structure is indicated by a local extremum over scale of normalized derivatives (the Laplacian). (3) The affine shape of a point neighborhood is estimated based on the second moment matrix.Our scale invariant detector computes a multi-scale representation for the Harris interest point detector and then selects points at which a local measure (the Laplacian) is maximal over scales. This provides a set of distinctive points which are invariant to scale, rotation and translation as well as robust to illumination changes and limited changes of viewpoint. The characteristic scale determines a scale invariant region for each point. We extend the scale invariant detector to affine invariance by estimating the affine shape of a point neighborhood. An iterative algorithm modifies location, scale and neighborhood of each point and converges to affine invariant points. This method can deal with significant affine transformations including large scale changes. The characteristic scale and the affine shape of neighborhood determine an affine invariant region for each point.We present a comparative evaluation of different detectors and show that our approach provides better results than existing methods. The performance of our detector is also confirmed by excellent matching results; the image is described by a set of scale/affine invariant descriptors computed on the regions associated with our points."

The obtained solution gives the best balance of boundary and region properties among all segmentations satisfying the constraints. The topology of our segmentation is unrestricted and both \"object\" and \"background\" segments may consist of several isolated parts. Some experimental results are presented in the context of photo/video editing and medical image segmentation. We also demonstrate an interesting Gestalt example.
