We assume that (a) nervous system activity is usefully represented as the set of simultaneous individual neuron activities in a group of neurons; (b) different memory traces make use of the same synapses; and (c) synapses associate two patterns of neural activity by incrementing synaptic connectivity proportionally to the product of pre- and postsynaptic activity, forming a matrix of synaptic connectivities. We extend this model by (a) introducing positive feedback of a set of neurons onto itself and (b) allowing the individual neurons to saturate. A hybrid model, partly analog and partly binary, arises. The system has certain characteristics reminiscent of analysis by distinctive features. Next, we apply the model to \"categorical perception.\" Finally, we discuss probability learning. The model can predict overshooting, recency data, and probabilities occurring in systems with more than two events with reasonably good accuracy."

The theory provides a single unifying framework within which the neurophysiological, psychological, and sociological properties of living adaptive systems can be understood. Furthermore, the theory offers a new basis for the synthesis of machines possessing adaptive intelligence. The proposed theory is of a heterostatic type. That is to say, it is a theory which assumes that living adaptive systems seek, as their primary goal, a maximal condition (heterostasis) , rather than assuming that the primary goal is a steadystate condition (homeostasis). It is further assumed that the heterostatic nature of animals, including man, derives from the heterostatic nature of neurons. The postulate that the neuron is a heterostat (that is, a maximizer) is a generalization of a more specific postulate, namely, that the neuron is a hedonist. This latter postulate is interpreted strictly in terms of physical variables, yielding the heterostatic neuronal model that is the basis for the detailed development of the theory."

The separate statements have in [act differed more in the language of their expression than in their substance. The major intent of the present paper is to explicate a more precise version of the form of theory involved, and to indicate how it may be usefully applied to a variety of phenomena in\u00b7 volving asso('iative learning. The impetus for a new theoretical model is not generally a new datum which dearly disconfirms existing theory. It is more likely to be the accumulation of a salient pattern of data, separate portions of which may be ade(luately handled by separate existing theories, but which apo pears to invite a more integrated theoretical account. Such, at least, is the better description of the background of the present work. In the sections which follow we will first describe certain data from our laboratories which exemplify the kind of observations which have encouraged the present theorizing. The theory will then be presented in sufficient detail to show how it may be applied to experimental situations involving a variety of Pavlovian conditioning arrangements. Finally, we will briefly discuss the theory in relationship to more conventional approaches."

When built with Hebb synapses (or any other class B or C synapses whose modification depends on the conjunction of activities in two cells) they demand a number of inputs to each cell that agrees well with known anatomy. The number of cells required, for performing tasks of the kind considered as well as the human brain can perform them, is only a small fraction of the number of cells in the brain.

This rule is an iterative procedure for solving a set of linear inequalities. A solution exists if the desired response is a linearly separable function of the stimulus patterns. Nilsson (1965) provides several proofs of convergence, and Minsky and Papert (1969) discuss its limitations as a pattern recognition system."

The assumption of 2 acquisition processes requires the demonstration of an empirical interaction between 2 types of reinforcement contingencies and (a) response classes, (b) reinforcing stimulus classes, or (c) characteristics of the learned behavior itself. The mediation postulates of 2-process theory which argue that CRs are intimately involved in the control of instrumental responding are emphasized, and 2 major lines of evidence that stem uniquely from these postulates are examined : (a) the concurrent development and maintenance of instrumental responses and conditioned reflexes, and (b) the interaction between separately conducted Pavlovian conditioning contingencies and instrumental training contingencies in the control of instrumental behavior. The evidence from concurrent measurement studies provides, at the very best, only weak support for the mediational hypotheses of 2-process theory. In contrast, the evidence from interaction studies shows the strong mediating control of instrumental responses by Pavlovian conditioning procedures, and demonstrates the surprising power of Pavlovian concepts in predicting the outcomes of many kinds of interaction experiments."

Two generations later, the behaviorist movement, motivated partly by the excesses of introspective psychology and partly by imitation of operationalism in physics, succeeded in exorcizing both the language of conscious experience and the study of consciousness and mental states. Ever since, the dominant trend in studies of learning, including the neuro\u00ad physiology of learning, has followed a strict behaviorist line. Reductionist ap\u00ad proaches, such as the measurement of habit strengths and response rates and the tracing of neural circuits, have led to the accumulation of a vast amount of empirical knowledge but little insight into basic mechanisms. Sensory neurophysiology has followed a similar philosophical and methodological program, culminating for some in the extreme position that entire percepts may be represented by the firing of one or a few neurons (3, 69), or that higher order perceptual and cognitive functions are represented in localized anatomical regions. However, the study of how univariate sensory features, or stimulus attributes, differentially affect various anatomical structures ignores the problem of how the organism constructs an integrated, mul\u00ad tivariate, and multidimensional perception of its environment."

An associative memory device, called \" Associatron,\" is proposed. The Associatron stores entities represented by bit patterns in a distributed manner and recalls the whole of any entity from a part of it. If the part is large, the recalled entity will be accurate; on the other hand, if the part is small, the recalled entity will be rather ambiguous. Any number of entities can be stored, but the accuracy of the recalled entity decreases as the number of entities increases. The Associatron is considered to be a simplified model of the neural network and can be constructed as a cellular structure, where each cell is connected to only its neighbor cells and all cells run in parallel. From its mechanisms some properties are derived that are expected to be utilized for human-like information processing. After these properties have been analyzed, an Associatron which deals with entities composed of less than 180 bits is simulated by a computer. Simple examples of its applications for concept formation and game playing are presented and the thinking process by the sequence of associations is described."

The physiological mechanism proposed here for this process posits that at synapses acting according to Hebb's postulate, the receptors for the neurotransmitter are eliminated from the postsynaptic membrane by the transient reversals of the sign of membrane polarization that occur during action potential impulses in the postsynaptic cell. But, since the release of neurotransmitter drives the membrane potential of the synaptic zone towards a level about half-way between the negative-inside resting potential and the positive-inside action potential, it would follow that the membrane patches surrounding the receptors of a synapse whose activity has contributed to setting off the postsynaptic impulse would be spared the full extent of the noxious polarity reversal. This mechanism can account for a neurophysiologically documented example of the operation of Hebb's postulate, namely the plasticity of the connections between fourth- and fifth-order neurons in the visual cortex of cats."

The reports of simulation of cognitive processes include computer models of human behavior in logic problems, deciding on common stock portfolios, and carrying out social interaction.

The framework for such a neuronal model seems to be provided by the features of a novel heterosynaptic interaction in a mammalian sympathetic ganglion. It had been found previously that one synaptic transmitter (the catecholamine dopamine, DA) could produce a specific and enduring enhancement, lasting for at least several hours, of the subsequent responses to another synaptic transmitter (acetylcholine, ACh)1. We have now found that the retention of this DA-induced change can be disrupted by cyclic GMP in a strikingly time-dependent manner that is similar, in principle, to the well known disruptability feature of the memory storage process2,3. Additional evidence indicates that the production and storage of the enduring change initiated by DA are mediated intraneuronally by cyclic AMP. We present here a scheme which outlines the cellular pathways postulated to carry out the sequence of events from \u2018read-in\u2019 through to \u2018read-out\u2019."

Two groups received an aversive US (shock) and two groups received an appetitive US (water to the oral cavity). With parameter estimates for the two-phase model serving as the dependent variables, it was possible to define more precisely the effect of US omission with the intermittent reinforcement schedule. For the aversive preparation, the major effect of intermittent reinforcement was to increase the duration of Phase 1, a phase during which response likelihood remains constant at its initial value. Only a small proportion of subjects reflected the effect of US omission during Phase 2, the \u201clearning\u201d phase, this being a low operator limit following trials on which neither the CR nor the US occurred. The major effect of US omission for the appetitive preparation was in Phase 2, primarily a result of a minority of subjects having a low operator limit following trials on which neither the CR nor the US occurred. Many subjects required separate operators for trials on which the CR did or did not occur. The results were interpreted to pose difficulties for strength theories of conditioning, and the limitation implied for successful application of the Rescorla-Wagner theory are discussed. The implications of the data for response-contingent interpretations and for individual differences are also discussed."

Examples and results of several experimental models for alphanumeric character recognition are presented. The network synthesis problem is then recast in terms of redundant information removal, multivariable curve-fitting and expansion in orthonormal functions. Recognition network structures and the learning process are described from these points of view. The potential component and behavioral advantages to be gained from sequential feedback networks are discussed briefly."

A computer can do, in a sense, only what it is told to do. But even when we do not know how to solve a certain problem, we may program a machine (computer) to Search through some large space of solution attempts. Unfortunately, this usually leads to an enormously inefficient process. With Pattern-Recognition techniques, efficiency can often be improved, by restricting the application of the machine's methods to appropriate problems. Pattern-Recognition, together with Learning, can be used to exploit generalizations based on accumulated experience, further reducing search. By analyzing the situation, using Planning methods, we may obtain a fundamental improvement by replacing the given search with a much smaller, more appropriate exploration. To manage broad classes of problems, machines will need to construct models of their environments, using some scheme for Induction. Wherever appropriate, the discussion is supported by extensive citation of the literature and by descriptions of a few of the most successful heuristic (problem-solving) programs constructed to date."

                "text": "Long-lasting postsynaptic potentials (PSPs) generated by decreases in membrane conductance (permeability) have been reported in many types of neurons. We investigated the possible role of such long-lasting decreases in membrane conductance in the modulation of synaptic transmission in the sympathetic ganglion of the bullfrog. The molecular basis by which such conductance-decrease PSPs are generated was also investigated. Synaptic activation of muscarinic cholinergic receptors on these sympathetic neurons results in the generation of a slow EPSP (excitatory postsynaptic potential), which is accompanied by a decrease in membrane conductance. We found that the conventional \"fast\" EPSPs were increased in amplitude and duration during the iontophoretic application of methacholine, which activates the muscarinic postsynaptic receptors. A similar result was obtained when a noncholinergic conductance-decrease PSP--the late-slow EPSP--was elicited by stimulation of a separate synaptic pathway. The enhancement of fast EPSP amplitude increased the probability of postsynaptic action potential generation, thus increasing the efficacy of impulse transmission across the synapse. Stimulation of one synaptic pathway is therefore capable of increasing the efficacy of synaptic transmission in a second synaptic pathway by a postsynaptic mechanism. Furthermore, this enhancement of synaptic efficacy is long-lasting by virtue of the long duration of the slow PSP. Biochemical and electrophysiological techniques were used to investigate whether cyclic nucleotides are intracellular second messengers mediating the membrane permeability changes underlying slow-PSP generation. Stimulation of the synaptic inputs, which lead to the generation of the slow-PSPs, increased the ganglionic content of both cyclic AMP and cyclic GMP. However, electrophysiological analysis of the actions of these cyclic nucleotides and the actions of agents that affect their metabolism does not provide support for such a second messenger role for either cyclic nucleotide."

                "text": "The hypothesis that cyclic nucleotides are intracellular second messengers mediating the generation of synaptic potentials was studied in the sympathetic ganglia of the bullfrog. Synaptic potentials and the effect of administering cyclic nucleotides and agents which affect cyclic nucleotide metabolism were recorded by the sucrose gap technique. The administration of adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP), guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic GMP), or several of their derivatives produced little or no change in membrane potential. Prostaglandin E1 did not block the generation of postsynaptic potentials. Theophylline produced membrane effects that were different from those associated with postsynaptic potential generation; it also reduced the slow excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) and potentiated the slow inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP). The administration of papaverine, however, reduced both the slow EPSP and the slow IPSP. Although synaptic stimulation increases both cyclic GMP and cyclic AMP in these neurons, these results raise the possibility that these cyclic nucleotides may have functionla roles other than mediation of synaptic potentials."

Repetitive antidromic stimulation of the postsynaptic axon resulted in a reduction in the excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP). The reduction in transmitter release was accompanied by a decrease in the presynaptic spike after-hyperpolarization (AH). Increasing the concentration of extracellular potassium ions also reduced the EPSP and decreased the amplitude of the presynaptic spike AH. The reduction in transmitter release resulting from repetitive postsynaptic impulses is attributed to the accumulation of extracellular potassium ions. It is proposed that the accumulation of extracellular potassium ions resulting from repetitive postsynaptic activity may modulate synaptic transmission and function as an integrative mechanism in the nervous system."

The common modifications of a correlation rule, for example, the introduction of delay in input or output pathways, result in model behavior still not in agreement with experimental data. Moreover, as we argue below, the phenomena actually observed in classical conditioning may perhaps be crucial for sophisticated adaptive behavior. The history of attempts to construct adaptive networks of neuronlike components also suggests that something essential is not preserved by the Hebbian model and its variants. Network approaches to adaptive system design have been notable in their failure to produce learning behavior beyond a rather low level of sophistication. The information processing success of adaptive networks is restricted almost entirely to moderate success in the recognition, processing, and associative storage and retrieval of spatial patterns. There is a conspicuous absence of nontrivial processing of temporal patterns. It may well be true that in the brain some kinds of temporal patterns are processed by being represented spatially, as, for example, suggested by Lashley (1951), and some models use this principle (e."
