To better account for handwriting variability, we describe a supervised strategy for the construction of prototype distributions which are more robust to allograph deformations. The idea is to incorporate supervision to relate the allographic models to their manifestations in the feature space. This makes for a better utilization of the available training data, while at the same time allowing for a short design time turn around. The performance of this method is illustrated on a discrete handwriting recognition task with an alphabet of 81 characters.<<ETX>>"

A new method for nding the letter boundaries, based on minimizing a heuristic cost function, is introduced. The function is evaluated at each point along the baseline of the word to nd the best possible segmentation points. The algorithm tries to nd all the actual letter boundaries and as few additional ones as possible. After size and slant normalizations, the segments are classi ed by a one hidden layer feedforward neural network. The word recognition algorithm nds the segmentation points that are likely to be extraneous and generates all possible nal segmentations of the word, by either keeping or removing them. Interpreting the output of the neural network as posterior probabilities of letters, it then nds the word that maximizes the probability of having produced the image, over a set of 30,000 words and over all the possible nal segmentations. We compared two hypotheses for nding the likelihood of words that are in the lexicon and found that using a Hidden Markov Model of English is signi cantly less successful than assuming independence among the letters of a word. In our initial test with multiple writers, 61% of the words were recognized correctly."

The usefulness of 'regular' versus 'singular' classes of features is stressed. These notions are applied to obtain a graph, G, representing a line image, and also to find an 'axis' as the regular part of G. The complements to G of the axis are the 'tarsi', singular parts of G, which correspond to informative features of a cursive word. A segmentation of the graph is obtained, giving a symbolic description chain (SDC). Using one or more as robust anchors, possible words in a list of words are selected. Candidate words are examined to see if the other letters fit the rest of the SDC. Good results are obtained for clean images of words written by several persons. >"

Several component processes of a recognition system for isolated offline cursive script words are described. A word image is transformed through a hierarchy of representation levels: points, contours, features, letters, and words. A unique feature representation is generated bottom-up from the image using statistical dependences between letters and features. Ratings for partially formed words are computed using a stack algorithm and a lexicon represented as a trie. Several novel techniques for low- and intermediate-level processing for cursive script are described, including heuristics for reference line finding, letter segmentation based on detecting local minima along the lower contour and areas with low vertical profiles, simultaneous encoding of contours and their topological relationships, extracting features, and finding shape-oriented events. Experiments demonstrating the performance of the system are also described. >"

If this is the case it is likely that recognizing these features will be a useful technique for the machine recognition of cursive script. A new method of detecting the presence of these features in a cursive handwritten word is described. The method uses constrained snakes which adapt to fit the maxima in the distance transform of a word image while retaining their basic shape. When the shape has settled into a potential minimum its goodness-of-fit is used to determine whether a match has been found. The features located by this method are passed on to a neural network recognizer. Examples of the features recognized are shown, and results for word recognition for this method on a single-author database of scanned data with 825 word vocabulary are presented.<<ETX>>"

The network estimates posterior distributions for each of a series of frames representing sections of a handwritten word. The supervised training algorithm, backpropagation through time, requires target outputs to be provided for each frame. Three methods for deriving these targets are presented. A novel method based upon the forward-backward algorithm is found to result in the recognizer with the lowest error rate."

The operation of attempting to decompose the image into classifiable units on the basis of general image features is called \"dissection\". The second class of methods avoids dissection, and segments the image either explicitly, by classification of specified windows, or implicitly by classification of subsets of spatial features collected from the image as a whole. The third strategy is a hybrid of the first two, employing dissection together with recombination rules to define potential segments, but using classification to select from the range of admissible segmentation possibilities offered by these subimages. Finally, holistic approaches that avoid segmentation by recognizing entire character strings as units are described."

In this framework, neural networks (and in particular, multilayer perceptrons or MLPs) have been restricted to well-defined subtasks of the whole system, i.e., HMM emission probability estimation and feature extraction. The book describes a successful five year international collaboration between the authors. The lessons learned form a case study that demonstrates how hybrid systems can be developed to combine neural networks with more traditional statistical approaches. The book illustrates both the advantages and limitations of neural networks in the framework of a statistical system. Using standard databases and comparing with some conventional approaches, it is shown that MLP probability estimation can improve recognition performance. Other approaches are discussed, though there is no such unequivocal experimental result for these methods. Connectionist Speech Recognition: A Hybrid Approach is of use to anyone intending to use neural networks for speech recognition or within the framework provided by an existing successful statistical approach. This includes research and development groups working in the field of speech recognition, both with standard and neural network approaches, as well as other pattern recognition and/or neural network researchers. This book is also suitable as a text for advanced courses on neural networks or speech processing."

Experiments show an average reduction in word error rate of 16% and 13% from the CI system on ARPA 5,000 word and SQALE 20,000 word tasks respectively.

We have extended our approach from using word-internal gender independent modelling to use decision tree based state clustering, cross-word triphones and gender dependent models. Our current systems can be run with either bigram or trigram language models using a single pass dynamic network decoder. Systems based on these techniques were included in the November 1993 ARPA WSJ evaluation, and gave the lowest error rate reported on the 5 k word bigram, 5 k word trigram and 20 k word bigram \"hub\" tests and the second lowest error rate on the 20 k word trigram \"hub\" test.<<ETX>>"

The success of the approach depends on the definition of a comprehensive set of goals for the computation of edge points. These goals must be precise enough to delimit the desired behavior of the detector while making minimal assumptions about the form of the solution. We define detection and localization criteria for a class of edges, and present mathematical forms for these criteria as functionals on the operator impulse response. A third criterion is then added to ensure that the detector has only one response to a single edge. We use the criteria in numerical optimization to derive detectors for several common image features, including step edges. On specializing the analysis to step edges, we find that there is a natural uncertainty principle between detection and localization performance, which are the two main goals. With this principle we derive a single operator shape which is optimal at any scale. The optimal detector has a simple approximate implementation in which edges are marked at maxima in gradient magnitude of a Gaussian-smoothed image. We extend this simple detector using operators of several widths to cope with different signal-to-noise ratios in the image. We present a general method, called feature synthesis, for the fine-to-coarse integration of information from operators at different scales. Finally we show that step edge detector performance improves considerably as the operator point spread function is extended along the edge."

One of the major reasons why speech models, based on Markov chains, have not been developed until recently was the lack of a method for optimizing the parameters of the Markov model to match observed signal patterns. Such a method was proposed in the late 1960's and was immediately applied to speech processing in several research institutions. Continued refinements in the theory and implementation of Markov modelling techniques have greatly enhanced the method, leading to a wide range of applications of these models. It is the purpose of this tutorial paper to give an introduction to the theory of Markov models, and to illustrate how they have been applied to problems in speech recognition."

It would be astonishing if such a structure did not profoundly modify the response patterns of fibres coming into it. In the cat's visual cortex, the receptive field arrangements of single cells suggest that there is indeed a degree of complexity far exceeding anything yet seen at lower levels in the visual system. In a previous paper we described receptive fields of single cortical cells, observing responses to spots of light shone on one or both retinas (Hubel & Wiesel, 1959). In the present work this method is used to examine receptive fields of a more complex type (Part I) and to make additional observations on binocular interaction (Part II). This approach is necessary in order to understand the behaviour of individual cells, but it fails to deal with the problem of the relationship of one cell to its neighbours. In the past, the technique of recording evoked slow waves has been used with great success in studies of functional anatomy. It was employed by Talbot & Marshall (1941) and by Thompson, Woolsey & Talbot (1950) for mapping out the visual cortex in the rabbit, cat, and monkey. Daniel & Whitteiidge (1959) have recently extended this work in the primate. Most of our present knowledge of retinotopic projections, binocular overlap, and the second visual area is based on these investigations. Yet the method of evoked potentials is valuable mainly for detecting behaviour common to large populations of neighbouring cells; it cannot differentiate functionally between areas of cortex smaller than about 1 mm2. To overcome this difficulty a method has in recent years been developed for studying cells separately or in small groups during long micro-electrode penetrations through nervous tissue. Responses are correlated with cell location by reconstructing the electrode tracks from histological material. These techniques have been applied to"
