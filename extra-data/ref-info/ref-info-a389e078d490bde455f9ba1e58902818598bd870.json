Lines and tables are among the most frequent graphic, non-textual entities in documents and their detection is directly related to the OCR performance as well as to the document layout description. We propose a workflow for table detection that comprises three distinct steps: (i) image pre-processing; (ii) horizontal and vertical line detection and (iii) table detection. The efficiency of the proposed method is demonstrated by using a performance evaluation scheme which considers a great variety of documents such as forms, newspapers/magazines, scientific journals, tickets/bank cheques, certificates and handwritten documents."

In this paper we report a very simple but extremely powerful approach to detect tables present in document pages. The algorithm relies on the observation that the tables have distinct columns which implies that gaps between the fields are substantially larger than the gaps between the words in text lines. This deceptively simple observation has led to the design of a simple but powerful table detection system with low computation cost. Moreover, mathematical foundation of the approach is also established including formation of a regular expression for ease of implementation."

The presence of a table is hypothesized by searching parallel lines in the MXY tree of the page. This hypothesis is afterwards verified by locating perpendicular lines or white spaces in the region included between the parallel lines. Lastly, located tables can be merged on the basis of proximity and similarity criteria. The use of an optimization method, that relies on the definition of an appropriate table location index, allows us to identify, the optimal values of thresholds involved in the algorithm. In this way the algorithm can be adapted to recognize tables with different features by maximizing the performance on an appropriate training set. The algorithm has been evaluated on two data-sets containing more than 1500 pages, and comparing its results with the tables identified by two commercial OCRs."

Existing approaches for table detection mainly focus on detecting tables in single columns of text and do not work reliably on documents with varying layouts. This paper presents a practical algorithm for table detection that works with a high accuracy on documents with varying layouts (company reports, newspaper articles, magazine pages, ...). An open source implementation of the algorithm is provided as part of the Tesseract OCR engine. Evaluation of the algorithm on document images from publicly available UNLV dataset shows competitive performance in comparison to the table detection module of a commercial OCR system."

Although much work has been conducted in the domain of machine-print including books, scientific papers, etc., little has been done to address the case of handwritten inputs. In this paper, we study table detection in scanned handwritten documents subject to challenging artifacts and noise. First, we separate text components (machine-print, handwriting) from the rest of the page using an SVM classifier. We then employ a correlation-based approach to measure the coherence between adjacent text lines which may be part of the same table, solving the resulting page decomposition problem using dynamic programming. A report of preliminary results from ongoing experiments concludes the paper."

The resulting T-Recs system takes word bounding box information as input, and outputs the corresponding logical text block units. Starting with an arbitrary word as block seed the algorithm recursively expands this block to all words that interleave with their vertical neighbors. Since even smallest gaps of table columns prevent their words from mutual interleaving, this initial segmentation is able to identify and isolate such columns. In order to deal with some inherent segmentation errors caused by isolated lines, overhanging words, or cells spawning more than one column, a series of postprocessing steps is added. These steps benefit form a very simple distinction between type 1 and type 2 blocks: type 1 blocks are those of at most one word per line, all others are of type 2. This distinction allows the selective application of heuristics to each group of blocks. The conjoint decomposition of column blocks into subsets of table cells leads to the final block segmentation of a homogeneous abstraction level. These segments serve the final layout analysis which identifies table environments and cells that are stretching over several rows and/or columns."

This paper describes a general solution for detecting tables based on computing an optimal partitioning of a document into some number of tables. A dynamic programming algorithm is given to solve the resulting optimization problem. This high-level framework is independent of any particular table quality measure and independent of the document medium. Moreover, it does not rely on the presence of ruling lines or other table delimiters. We also present table quality measures based on white space correlation and vertical connected component analysis. These measures can be applied equally well to ASCII text and scanned images. We report on some preliminary experiments using this method to detect tables in both ASCII text and scanned images, yielding promising results. We present detailed evaluation of these results using three different criteria which by themselves pose interesting research questions."

While everyone seems to know what a table is, a precise, analytical definition of \u201ctabularity\u201d remains elusive because some bureaucratic forms, multicolumn text layouts, and schematic drawings share many characteristics of tables. There are significant differences between typeset tables, electronic files designed for display of tables, and tables in symbolic form intended for information retrieval. Most past research has addressed the extraction of low-level geometric information from raster images of tables scanned from printed documents, although there is growing interest in the processing of tables in electronic form as well. Recent research on table composition and table analysis has improved our understanding of the distinction between the logical and physical structures of tables, and has led to improved formalisms for modeling tables. This review, which is structured in terms of generalized paradigms for table processing, indicates that progress on half-a-dozen specific research issues would open the door to using existing paper and electronic tables for database update, tabular browsing, structured information retrieval through graphical and audio interfaces, multimedia table editing, and platform-independent display."

The learning of this OLP is then impossible no matter what learning rules we use, because the solution of the connection matrix just does not exist. However, we can always use a parallel-cascaded, two-layered perceptron (PCTLP) to realize this inseparable mapping. The design of this PCTLP is derived from the positive-linear independency condition we previously studied. It is a very intriguing mathematical derivation and the design of the PCTLP is much more efficient then that of the conventional series- cascaded, three-layered, neural networks. Also its robustness in recognizing any untrained, closely related patterns can be controlled and maximized. The physical origin, the theory, and the design of this novel, `universal' perceptron pattern recognition system will be discussed in detail in this paper."
