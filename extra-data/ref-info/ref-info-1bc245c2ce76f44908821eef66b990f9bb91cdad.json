Our method consists of two basic strategies. One is a specific structure analysis where local structures of subexpressions are checked by a bottom-up method. The other is a basic structure analysis in which the global structure of a whole expression is checked by using a top-down method. The structure of a recognized expression is represented by a tree structure and the original expression can be reproduced by using a suitable formatter like T/sub E/X. Experiments have been carried out for many types of expressions found in printed journals and our recognition method has shown favorable results."

The discussion is based on material in [7.1\u20132], and includes complete grammars for the recognition of commonly used arithmetic and matrix math notation. The format of the coordinate grammar rules has been completely revised for this chapter from earlier versions in an effort to increase the readability of the grammar. A top-down parsing scheme is used to partition a two-dimensional character configuration into subproblems. Syntax rules contain all necessary partitioning instructions. The syntax-directed recognition system described here has been successfully demonstrated in several prototype systems, and could be used to provide real-time interpretation of 2 D math expressions handprinted on a data tablet as input to an interactive computing system."

The value of the approach is demonstrated in a system that recognizes printed, noisy equations. The system uses a two-dimensional probabilistic version of the Cocke-Younger-Kasami parsing algorithm to find the most likely parse of the observed image, and then traverses the corresponding parse tree in accordance with translation formats associated with each production rule, to produce eqn I troff commands for the imaged equation. In addition, it uses two-dimensional versions of the Inside/Outside and Baum re-estimation algorithms for learning the parameters of the grammar from a training set of examples. Parsing the image of a simple noisy equation currently takes about one second of cpu time on an Alliant FX/80."
