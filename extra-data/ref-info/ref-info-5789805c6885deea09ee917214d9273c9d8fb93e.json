Its greatest strength lies in the clarity and succinctness with which it displays the information contained in tabulated results: for the experimenter a graph provides a rough and immediate check on the accuracy and suitability of the methods he is using, and for the reader of a scientific report it may convey in a few seconds information that could only be gleaned from a table of measurements by hours of close study. There are occasions where only the analysis of experimental graphs will provide the information we require, but usually the actual analysis of results is carried out nowadays by computational methods. The use of graphs is therefore not so much a necessary part of scientific procedure as an extremely useful one, and one that is often taken very much for granted."

In this article we take a few steps in the direction of establishing such a foundation. Our approach is based on graphical perception\u2014the visual decoding of information encoded on graphs\u2014and it includes both theory and experimentation to test the theory. The theory deals with a small but important piece of the whole process of graphical perception. The first part is an identification of a set of elementary perceptual tasks that are carried out when people extract quantitative information from graphs. The second part is an ordering of the tasks on the basis of how accurately people perform them. Elements of the theory are tested by experimentation in which subjects record their judgments of the quantitative information on graphs. The experiments validate these elements but also suggest that the set of elementary tasks should be expanded. The theory provides a guideline for graph construction..."

Areas of application include: the comparison of samples; the comparison of distributions; the presentation of results on sensitivities of statistical methods; the analysis of collections of contrasts and of collections of sample variances; the assessment of multivariate contrasts;_ and the structuring of analysis of variance mean squares. Many of the objectives and techniques are illustrated by examples. This paper reviews a variety of old and new statistical techniques based on the cumulative distribution function and its ramifications. Included in the coverage are applications, for various situations and purposes, of quantile probability plots (Q-Q plots), percentage probability plots (P-P plots) and extensions and hybrids of these. The general viewpoint is that of analysis of data by statistical methods that are suggestive and constructive rather than formal procedures to be applied in the light of a tightly specified mathematical model. The technological background is taken to be current capacities in data collection and highspeed computing systems, including graphical display facilities. It is very often useful in statistical data analysis to examine and to present a body of data as though it may have originated as a one-dimensional sample, i.e. data which one wishes to treat for purposes of analysis, as an unstructured array. Sometimes this is applicable to ' original' data; even more often such a viewpoint is useful with 'derived' data, e.g. residuals from a model fitted to the data. The empirical cumulative distribution function and probability plotting methods have a key role in the statistical treatment of one-dimensional samples, being of relevance for summarization and palatable description as well as for exposure and inference."

It was found that subjects who are relatively sophisticated in psychometric techniques tend to underestimate the magnitude of r, with most pronounced disparity in the range .2 < |r| < .6. Additionally, estimates of r from specially designed scatterplots indicated that subjects (1) correctly estimated the effects of range restriction, (2) underestimated the effects of attenuating outliers, (3) incorrectly reduced estimates of r when the regression slope was relatively high or low, and (4) often failed to consider the effects of removing the middle third of the data. Several implications of these generally conservative estimations are discussed."

This paper develops a way of analyzing the information in charts and graphs that reveals the design flaws in the display. The analytic scheme requires isolating four types of constituents in a display, and specifying their structure and interrelations at a syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic level of analysis. As the description is constructed, one checks for violations of acceptability principles, which are derived from facts about human visual information processing and from an analysis of the nature of symbols. Violations of these principles reveal the source of potential difficulties in using a display."

These predictions were confirmed by the finding that a comparison judgment was most accurate when the judgment required assessing position along a common scale (simple bar chart), had intermediate accuracy on length judgments (divided bar chart), and was least accurate when assessing angles (pie chart). In contrast, when the judgment was an estimate of the proportion of the whole, angle assessments (pie chart) were as accurate as position (simple bar chart) and more accurate than length (divided bar chart).

The additions we discuss here\u2014some new and some old\u2014are (a) sunflowers, (b) category codes, (c) point cloud sizings, (d) smoothings for the dependence of y on x (middle smoothings, spread smoothings, and upper and lower smoothings), and (e) smoothings for the bivariate distribution of x and y (pairs of middle smoothings, sum-difference smoothings, scale-ratio smoothings, and polar smoothings).

Four types of lines having low confusability were determined experimentally from a sample of twenty-five lines. The primary variable was single-graph, multiple-line presentation versus multiple-graph single-line presentation. Other variables included in this study were: number of lines, degree of confusion among lines, coding of lines, and two operator tasks: point-reading and comparing. It was found that for the point-reading task, either type of display is acceptable, but for the comparing task, the multiple-line display is much superior to the multiple-graph display. Moreover, the use of color coding for the graph lines tended to improve performance slightly."

Whatever is the object of his studies, he who measures a force, a movement, an electrical state or a temperature, whether he is a physicist, chemist, or physiologist, must have recourse to the same method and employs the same instruments.\" The art of graphic recording does indeed owe much to mechanics, medicine and natural philosophy. Closely associated in this development, giving and taking freely from each other, all have found need for that ingenious combination of sensitive element and graphic reproducer by which a phenomenon, so to speak, writes out by itself the changes that it undergoes as time passes, in this way to lay open for study and quantitative analysis along an expanded or contracted time scale the manifold operations in man, machine and nature. Monitoring thus the complex functions in organism, enviroment and mechanism, the recording instrument provides the \" afferent limb\" of the servo-systems that make possible the automation of machine and missile and promise the instrumental homeostasis of man in the incompatible environments of the future. It has been natural to seek the sources of graphic recording where sciences have overlapped, and among those men whom we recognize for the versatility of their interest and the adaptability of their methodology. There we have found what we have outlined in this paper as the beginnings of the art; it would by no means be surprising if earlier examples were found. The development of graphic recording comprises three sections sequential in time and probably in origins: (1) the revival by Renaissance engineers not the least of whom was Leonardo da Vinci of a heritage of Greco-Roman mechanics, the hodometer of Ctesibus and Hero of Alexandria and its adaptation to graphic recording by craftsmen in the Electorate of Saxony; (2) the development of the \"weather-clock \" by Christopher Wren and Robert Hooke, and (3) the ingenious self-recording contrivances of Jacob Leupold. If to these be added the self-recording meteorological instrument of Ons-en-"

Accuracy differed only when processing time was restricted, again with different colors and confusable letters representing the two extremes. We conclude that color is the optimal symbol type and show that measuring response latency in addition to accuracy is essential in research on graphical perception."

Three commonly used formats were included in the study: line type, vertical-bar type, and horizontal-bar type. Two secondary independent variables were: number of time points and amount of missing data. Results of the study indicate that preference should be given to line-type graphs, followed closely by the vertical-bar type. A secondary finding was that irrelevant points and missing data on graphic trend displays represent important factors in the degradation of operator performance."

The new face can be applied in the same way as the usual Chernoff face (with 36 instead of 18 representable variables). Special applications of the new face are the representation of multivariate paired comparison and the visual search for outliers. Several examples illustrate these applications. Compared with Chernoff's face, the new construction is more realistic, degenerates less, and avoids as much as possible mutual influences of the different face parameters."

All symbols have the same structure derived from a hierarchical clustering algorithm applied to the k variables (dimensions) over all points, but their parts are coded according to the coordinates of each individual point. Trees and castles show general size effects, the change of whole clusters of variables from point to point, trends, and outliers. They are especially appropriate for evaluating the clustering of variables and for observing clusters of points. Their major advantage over earlier attempts to represent multivariate observations (such as profiles, stars, faces, boxes, and Andrews's curves) lies in their matching of relationships between variables to relationships between features of the representing symbol. Several examples are given, including one with 48 variables."

Performance exceeded 90%, indicating retention of over 2,000 items, even when up to 3 days elapsed between learning and testing. Variants of the experiment showed that the presentation time could be reduced to 1 sec per picture without seriously affecting performance; also, that the stimuli could be reversed in orientation in the test situation without impairing recognition performance appreciably. The orientation of the stimuli could also be learned, although not as well as the identity of the pictures.
