Our experimental evaluation shows that ranking based algorithms do not outperform a one-vs-rest strategy and that the gap between the different algorithms reduces in case of high-dimensional data. We also show that for one-vs-rest, learning through cross-validation the optimal degree of imbalance between the positive and the negative samples can have a significant impact. Furthermore, early stopping can be used as an effective regularization strategy when training with stochastic gradient algorithms. Following these \"good practices\", we were able to improve the state-of-the-art on a large subset of 10K classes and 9M of images of lmageNet from 16.7% accuracy to 19.1%."

Therefore, we study large-scale image classification methods that can incorporate new classes and training images continuously over time at negligible cost. To this end, we consider two distance-based classifiers, the k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) and nearest class mean (NCM) classifiers. Since the performance of distance-based classifiers heavily depends on the used distance function, we cast the problem into one of learning a low-rank metric, which is shared across all classes. For the NCM classifier, we introduce a new metric learning approach, and we also introduce an extension to allow for richer class representations."

In the context of image classification the FK was shown to extend the popular bag-of-visual-words (BOV) by going beyond count statistics. However, in practice, this enriched representation has not yet shown its superiority over the BOV. In the first part we show that with several well-motivated modifications over the original framework we can boost the accuracy of the FK. On PASCAL VOC 2007 we increase the Average Precision (AP) from 47.9% to 58.3%. Similarly, we demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy on CalTech 256. A major advantage is that these results are obtained using only SIFT descriptors and costless linear classifiers. Equipped with this representation, we can now explore image classification on a larger scale. In the second part, as an application, we compare two abundant resources of labeled images to learn classifiers: ImageNet and Flickr groups. In an evaluation involving hundreds of thousands of training images we show that classifiers learned on Flickr groups perform surprisingly well (although they were not intended for this purpose) and that they can complement classifiers learned on more carefully annotated datasets."

There are two main reasons for the limited effort on large-scale image classification. First, until the emergence of ImageNet dataset, there was almost no publicly available large-scale benchmark data for image classification. This is mostly because class labels are expensive to obtain. Second, large-scale classification is hard because it poses more challenges than its medium-scale counterparts. A key challenge is how to achieve efficiency in both feature extraction and classifier training without compromising performance. This paper is to show how we address this challenge using ImageNet dataset as an example. For feature extraction, we develop a Hadoop scheme that performs feature extraction in parallel using hundreds of mappers. This allows us to extract fairly sophisticated features (with dimensions being hundreds of thousands) on 1.2 million images within one day. For SVM training, we develop a parallel averaging stochastic gradient descent (ASGD) algorithm for training one-against-all 1000-class SVM classifiers. The ASGD algorithm is capable of dealing with terabytes of training data and converges very fast\u2013typically 5 epochs are sufficient. As a result, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on the ImageNet 1000-class classification, i.e., 52.9% in classification accuracy and 71.8% in top 5 hit rate."

This setup has hardly been studied in computer vision research, but it is the rule rather than the exception, because the world contains tens of thousands of different object classes and for only a very few of them image, collections have been formed and annotated with suitable class labels. In this paper, we tackle the problem by introducing attribute-based classification. It performs object detection based on a human-specified high-level description of the target objects instead of training images. The description consists of arbitrary semantic attributes, like shape, color or even geographic information. Because such properties transcend the specific learning task at hand, they can be pre-learned, e.g. from image datasets unrelated to the current task. Afterwards, new classes can be detected based on their attribute representation, without the need for a new training phase. In order to evaluate our method and to facilitate research in this area, we have assembled a new large-scale dataset, \u201cAnimals with Attributes\u201d, of over 30,000 animal images that match the 50 classes in Osherson's classic table of how strongly humans associate 85 semantic attributes with animal classes. Our experiments show that by using an attribute layer it is indeed possible to build a learning object detection system that does not require any training images of the target classes."

In this paper, we show how to learn a Mahalanobis distance metric for kNN classification from labeled examples. The Mahalanobis metric can equivalently be viewed as a global linear transformation of the input space that precedes kNN classification using Euclidean distances. In our approach, the metric is trained with the goal that the k-nearest neighbors always belong to the same class while examples from different classes are separated by a large margin. As in support vector machines (SVMs), the margin criterion leads to a convex optimization based on the hinge loss. Unlike learning in SVMs, however, our approach requires no modification or extension for problems in multiway (as opposed to binary) classification. In our framework, the Mahalanobis distance metric is obtained as the solution to a semidefinite program. On several data sets of varying size and difficulty, we find that metrics trained in this way lead to significant improvements in kNN classification. Sometimes these results can be further improved by clustering the training examples and learning an individual metric within each cluster. We show how to learn and combine these local metrics in a globally integrated manner."

To support claims of KT w.r.t. scalability we thus advocate to evaluate KT in a large-scale setting. To this end, we provide an extensive evaluation of three popular approaches to KT on a recently proposed large-scale data set, the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Competition 2010 data set. In a first setting they are directly compared to one-vs-all classification often neglected in KT papers and in a second setting we evaluate their ability to enable zero-shot learning. While none of the KT methods can improve over one-vs-all classification they prove valuable for zero-shot learning, especially hierarchical and direct similarity based KT. We also propose and describe several extensions of the evaluated approaches that are necessary for this large-scale study."

It is particularly useful in large scale applications like searching for an image that is similar to a given image or finding videos that are relevant to a given video. In these tasks, users look for objects that are not only visually similar but also semantically related to a given object. Unfortunately, the approaches that exist today for learning such semantic similarity do not scale to large data sets. This is both because typically their CPU and storage requirements grow quadratically with the sample size, and because many methods impose complex positivity constraints on the space of learned similarity functions. \n \nThe current paper presents OASIS, an Online Algorithm for Scalable Image Similarity learning that learns a bilinear similarity measure over sparse representations. OASIS is an online dual approach using the passive-aggressive family of learning algorithms with a large margin criterion and an efficient hinge loss cost. Our experiments show that OASIS is both fast and accurate at a wide range of scales: for a data set with thousands of images, it achieves better results than existing state-of-the-art methods, while being an order of magnitude faster. For large, web scale, data sets, OASIS can be trained on more than two million images from 150K text queries within 3 days on a single CPU. On this large scale data set, human evaluations showed that 35% of the ten nearest neighbors of a given test image, as found by OASIS, were semantically relevant to that image. This suggests that query independent similarity could be accurately learned even for large scale data sets that could not be handled before."

Tags of test images are predicted using a weighted nearest-neighbor model to exploit labeled training images. Neighbor weights are based on neighbor rank or distance. TagProp allows the integration of metric learning by directly maximizing the log-likelihood of the tag predictions in the training set. In this manner, we can optimally combine a collection of image similarity metrics that cover different aspects of image content, such as local shape descriptors, or global color histograms. We also introduce a word specific sigmoidal modulation of the weighted neighbor tag predictions to boost the recall of rare words. We investigate the performance of different variants of our model and compare to existing work. We present experimental results for three challenging data sets. On all three, TagProp makes a marked improvement as compared to the current state-of-the-art."

For example, is it possible to learn a face detector using only unlabeled images? To answer this, we train a deep sparse autoencoder on a large dataset of images (the model has 1 billion connections, the dataset has 10 million 200\u00d7200 pixel images downloaded from the Internet). We train this network using model parallelism and asynchronous SGD on a cluster with 1,000 machines (16,000 cores) for three days. Contrary to what appears to be a widely-held intuition, our experimental results reveal that it is possible to train a face detector without having to label images as containing a face or not. Control experiments show that this feature detector is robust not only to translation but also to scaling and out-of-plane rotation. We also find that the same network is sensitive to other high-level concepts such as cat faces and human bodies. Starting from these learned features, we trained our network to recognize 22,000 object categories from ImageNet and achieve a leap of 70% relative improvement over the previous state-of-the-art."

From a classifier design standpoint, such small sample size problems have some interesting challenges. The first challenge is to find, from all hyperplanes that separate the classes, a separating hyperplane which generalizes well for future data. A second important task is to determine which features are required to distinguish the classes. To attack these problems, we propose the LESS (lowest error in a sparse subspace) classifier that efficiently finds linear discriminants in a sparse subspace. In contrast with most classifiers for high-dimensional data sets, the LESS classifier incorporates a (simple) data model. Further, by means of a regularization parameter, the classifier establishes a suitable trade-off between subspace sparseness and classification accuracy. In the experiments, we show how LESS performs on several high-dimensional data sets and compare its performance to related state-of-the-art classifiers like, among others, linear ridge regression with the LASSO and the support vector machine. It turns out that LESS performs competitively while using fewer dimensions."

This paper presents a large-scale evaluation of an approach that represents images as distributions (signatures or histograms) of features extracted from a sparse set of keypoint locations and learns a Support Vector Machine classifier with kernels based on two effective measures for comparing distributions, the Earth Mover\u2019s Distance and the \u03c72 distance. We first evaluate the performance of our approach with different keypoint detectors and descriptors, as well as different kernels and classifiers. We then conduct a comparative evaluation with several state-of-the-art recognition methods on four texture and five object databases. On most of these databases, our implementation exceeds the best reported results and achieves comparable performance on the rest. Finally, we investigate the influence of background correlations on recognition performance via extensive tests on the PASCAL database, for which ground-truth object localization information is available. Our experiments demonstrate that image representations based on distributions of local features are surprisingly effective for classification of texture and object images under challenging real-world conditions, including significant intra-class variations and substantial background clutter."

First, we study classification accuracy as a function of the image signature dimensionality and the training set size. We show experimentally that the larger the training set, the higher the impact of the dimensionality on the accuracy. In other words, high-dimensional signatures are important to obtain state-of-the-art results on large datasets. Second, we tackle the problem of data compression on very large signatures (on the order of 105 dimensions) using two lossy compression strategies: a dimensionality reduction technique known as the hash kernel and an encoding technique based on product quantizers. We explain how the gain in storage can be traded against a loss in accuracy and/or an increase in CPU cost. We report results on two large databases \u2014 ImageNet and a dataset of lM Flickr images \u2014 showing that we can reduce the storage of our signatures by a factor 64 to 128 with little loss in accuracy. Integrating the decompression in the classifier learning yields an efficient and scalable training algorithm. On ILSVRC2010 we report a 74.3% accuracy at top-5, which corresponds to a 2.5% absolute improvement with respect to the state-of-the-art. On a subset of 10K classes of ImageNet we report a top-1 accuracy of 16.7%, a relative improvement of 160% with respect to the state-of-the-art."

The measure is learned from pairs of training images labeled \"same\" or \"different\". This is far less informative than the commonly used individual image labels (e.g., \"car model X\"), but it is cheaper to obtain. The proposed algorithm learns the characteristic differences between local descriptors sampled from pairs of \"same\" and \"different\" images. These differences are vector quantized by an ensemble of extremely randomized binary trees, and the similarity measure is computed from the quantized differences. The extremely randomized trees are fast to learn, robust due to the redundant information they carry and they have been proved to be very good clusterers. Furthermore, the trees efficiently combine different feature types (SIFT and geometry). We evaluate our innovative similarity measure on four very different datasets and consistently outperform the state-of-the-art competitive approaches."

In particular, humans can recognize tens of thousands of object classes and scenes. No computer vision algorithm today has been tested at this scale. This paper presents a study of large scale categorization including a series of challenging experiments on classification with more than 10, 000 image classes. We find that a) computational issues become crucial in algorithm design; b) conventional wisdom from a couple of hundred image categories on relative performance of different classifiers does not necessarily hold when the number of categories increases; c) there is a surprisingly strong relationship between the structure of WordNet (developed for studying language) and the difficulty of visual categorization; d) classification can be improved by exploiting the semantic hierarchy. Toward the future goal of developing automatic vision algorithms to recognize tens of thousands or even millions of image categories, we make a series of observations and arguments about dataset scale, category density, and image hierarchy."

We r st evaluate the performance of our approach with different keypoint detectors and descriptors, as well as different kernels and classier s. We then conduct a comparative evaluation with several state-of-the-art recognition methods on 4 texture and 5 object databases. On most of these databases, our implementation exceeds the best reported results and achieves comparable performance on the rest. Finally, we investigate the inuence of background correlations on recognition performance."

The method is based on a segmentation energy defined over all images at the same time, which can be optimized efficiently by techniques used before in interactive segmentation. Over iterations, our method progressively learns a class model by integrating observations over all images. In addition to appearance, this model captures the location and shape of the class with respect to an automatically determined coordinate frame common across images. This frame allows us to build stronger shape and location models, similar to those used in object class detection. Our method is inspired by interactive segmentation methods [1], but it is fully automatic and learns models characteristic for the object class rather than specific to one particular object/image. We experimentally demonstrate on the Caltech4, Caltech101, and Weizmann horses datasets that our method (a) transfers class knowledge across images and this improves results compared to segmenting every image independently; (b) outperforms Grabcut [1] for the task of unsupervised segmentation; (c) offers competitive performance compared to the state-of-the-art in unsupervised segmentation and in particular it outperforms the topic model [2]."

Zero-data learning is useful for problems where the set of classes to distinguish or tasks to solve is very large and is not entirely covered by the training data. The main contributions of this work lie in the presentation of a general formalization of zero-data learning, in an experimental analysis of its properties and in empirical evidence showing that generalization is possible and significant in this context. The experimental work of this paper addresses two classification problems of character recognition and a multitask ranking problem in the context of drug discovery. Finally, we conclude by discussing how this new framework could lead to a novel perspective on how to extend machine learning towards AI, where an agent can be given a specification for a learning problem before attempting to solve it (with very few or even zero examples)."

The most accredited hypothesis is that humans are able to exploit prior knowledge when learning a new related category. This paper presents an SVM-based model adaptation algorithm able to perform knowledge transfer for a new category when very limited examples are available. Using a leave- one-out estimate of the weighted error-rate the algorithm automatically decides from where to transfer (on which known category to rely), how much to transfer (the degree of adaptation) and if it is worth transferring something at all. Moreover a weighted least-squares loss function takes optimally care of data unbalance between negative and positive examples. Experiments presented on two different object category databases show that the proposed method is able to exploit previous knowledge avoiding negative transfer. The overall classification performance is increased compared to what would be achieved by starting from scratch. Furthermore as the number of already learned categories grows, the algorithm is able to learn a new category from one sample with increasing precision, i.e. it is able to perform one-shot learning."

We first present and evaluate different ways of aggregating local image descriptors into a vector and show that the Fisher kernel achieves better performance than the reference bag-of-visual words approach for any given vector dimension. We then jointly optimize dimensionality reduction and indexing in order to obtain a precise vector comparison as well as a compact representation. The evaluation shows that the image representation can be reduced to a few dozen bytes while preserving high accuracy. Searching a 100 million image data set takes about 250 ms on one processor core."

We show that it is possible to learn much information about a category from just one, or a handful, of images. The key insight is that, rather than learning from scratch, one can take advantage of knowledge coming from previously learned categories, no matter how different these categories might be. We explore a Bayesian implementation of this idea. Object categories are represented by probabilistic models. Prior knowledge is represented as a probability density function on the parameters of these models. The posterior model for an object category is obtained by updating the prior in the light of one or more observations. We test a simple implementation of our algorithm on a database of 101 diverse object categories. We compare category models learned by an implementation of our Bayesian approach to models learned from by maximum likelihood (ML) and maximum a posteriori (MAP) methods. We find that on a database of more than 100 categories, the Bayesian approach produces informative models when the number of training examples is too small for other methods to operate successfully."

Like Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI), our models take account of correlations between words (synonymy, polysemy). However, unlike LSI our models are trained from a supervised signal directly on the ranking task of interest, which we argue is the reason for our superior results. As the query and target texts are modeled separately, our approach is easily generalized to different retrieval tasks, such as cross-language retrieval or online advertising placement. Dealing with models on all pairs of words features is computationally challenging. We propose several improvements to our basic model for addressing this issue, including low rank (but diagonal preserving) representations, correlated feature hashing and sparsification. We provide an empirical study of all these methods on retrieval tasks based on Wikipedia documents as well as an Internet advertisement task. We obtain state-of-the-art performance while providing realistically scalable methods."

In the generative stage, each video clip is encoded as a bag of SIFT feature vectors, the distribution of which is described by a Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM). In the discriminative stage, the SIFT-Bag Kernel is designed for characterizing the property of Kullback-Leibler divergence between the specialized GMMs of any two video clips, and then this kernel is utilized for supervised learning in two ways. On one hand, this kernel is further refined in discriminating power for centroid-based video event classification by using the Within-Class Covariance Normalization approach, which depresses the kernel components with high-variability for video clips of the same event. On the other hand, the SIFT-Bag Kernel is used in a Support Vector Machine for margin-based video event classification. Finally, the outputs from these two classifiers are fused together for final decision. The experiments on the TRECVID 2005 corpus demonstrate that the mean average precision is boosted from the best reported 38.2% in [36] to 60.4% based on our new framework."

But exactly how such data can be harnessed and organized remains a critical problem. We introduce here a new database called \u201cImageNet\u201d, a large-scale ontology of images built upon the backbone of the WordNet structure. ImageNet aims to populate the majority of the 80,000 synsets of WordNet with an average of 500-1000 clean and full resolution images. This will result in tens of millions of annotated images organized by the semantic hierarchy of WordNet. This paper offers a detailed analysis of ImageNet in its current state: 12 subtrees with 5247 synsets and 3.2 million images in total. We show that ImageNet is much larger in scale and diversity and much more accurate than the current image datasets. Constructing such a large-scale database is a challenging task. We describe the data collection scheme with Amazon Mechanical Turk. Lastly, we illustrate the usefulness of ImageNet through three simple applications in object recognition, image classification and automatic object clustering. We hope that the scale, accuracy, diversity and hierarchical structure of ImageNet can offer unparalleled opportunities to researchers in the computer vision community and beyond."

This enables efficient learning methods for linear kernels to be applied to the non-linear intersection kernel, expanding the applicability of this model to much larger problems. In this paper we generalize this idea, and analyse a large family of additive kernels, called homogeneous, in a unified framework. The family includes the intersection, Hellinger's, and \u03c72 kernels commonly employed in computer vision. Using the framework we are able to: (i) provide explicit feature maps for all homogeneous additive kernels along with closed form expression for all common kernels; (ii) derive corresponding approximate finite-dimensional feature maps based on the Fourier sampling theorem; and (iii) quantify the extent of the approximation. We demonstrate that the approximations have indistinguishable performance from the full kernel on a number of standard datasets, yet greatly reduce the train/test times of SVM implementations. We show that the \u03c72 kernel, which has been found to yield the best performance in most applications, also has the most compact feature representation. Given these train/test advantages we are able to obtain a significant performance improvement over current state of the art results based on the intersection kernel."

The idea is to decompose the space into a Cartesian product of low-dimensional subspaces and to quantize each subspace separately. A vector is represented by a short code composed of its subspace quantization indices. The euclidean distance between two vectors can be efficiently estimated from their codes. An asymmetric version increases precision, as it computes the approximate distance between a vector and a code. Experimental results show that our approach searches for nearest neighbors efficiently, in particular in combination with an inverted file system. Results for SIFT and GIST image descriptors show excellent search accuracy, outperforming three state-of-the-art approaches. The scalability of our approach is validated on a data set of two billion vectors."

The concepts of an optimal number of features, representativeness of the training data, and the need to avoid overfitting to the training data are stressed. The chapter shows that methods such as the support vector machine and artificial neural networks are subject to these same training limitations, although each has its advantages. For neural networks, the multilayer perceptron architecture and back-propagation algorithm are described. The chapter distinguishes between supervised and unsupervised learning, demonstrating the advantages of the latter and showing how methods such as clustering and principal components analysis fit into the SPR framework.

In this context, the capabilities of statistical machine learning methods is limited by the computing time rather than the sample size. A more precise analysis uncovers qualitatively different tradeoffs for the case of small-scale and large-scale learning problems. The large-scale case involves the computational complexity of the underlying optimization algorithm in non-trivial ways. Unlikely optimization algorithms such as stochastic gradient descent show amazing performance for large-scale problems. In particular, second order stochastic gradient and averaged stochastic gradient are asymptotically efficient after a single pass on the training set."

Three key issues of MAP estimation, namely, the choice of prior distribution family, the specification of the parameters of prior densities, and the evaluation of the MAP estimates, are addressed. Using HMM's with Gaussian mixture state observation densities as an example, it is assumed that the prior densities for the HMM parameters can be adequately represented as a product of Dirichlet and normal-Wishart densities. The classical maximum likelihood estimation algorithms, namely, the forward-backward algorithm and the segmental k-means algorithm, are expanded, and MAP estimation formulas are developed. Prior density estimation issues are discussed for two classes of applications/spl minus/parameter smoothing and model adaptation/spl minus/and some experimental results are given illustrating the practical interest of this approach. Because of its adaptive nature, Bayesian learning is shown to serve as a unified approach for a wide range of speech recognition applications. >"

                "text": "The course and conduct of medical research are only partly determined by medical investigators themselves. Science proceeds within legal, philosophical, and cultural bounds that are set by the society around it and that impose limits on the pace and conduct of medical research. The doctrine of informed consent for clinical research has been a cornerstone of this process since the end of the Second World War. Our present informed consent process, however, has proved difficult to apply to populations with diminished cognitive capacity, such as children, the retarded, the mentally ill, and those with dementia. As medical research interests turn to these special populations, conflicts arise concerning the application of the traditional doctrine of informed consent. We are probably in the midst of a change with regard to the consent process for clinical research in these special populations. A symposium of nationally recognized experts was convened to address the issue of informed consent in research involving people with Alzheimer disease (AD) on November 1, 2001, in Lubbock, Texas. The symposium was jointly sponsored by the Carillon Senior Living Campus Research and Education Center, and by the Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, and was supported by the Helen Jones Foundation and Janssen Pharmaceutica. The distinguished faculty of the symposium included an ethicist, an attorney, two clinical investigators in the fields of aging and AD, a sociologist, and a neuropsychiatrist. The texts of the primary presentations follow in this Supplement. The presenters agreed that we have a collective societal obligation to improve our scientific understanding and treatment of AD. The demographics, economics, and illness burdens of this disorder will create a therapeutic imperative for the twenty-first century, at least in the developed countries. There was also general agreement at the symposium that our present informed consent rules, statutes, and beliefs are an impediment to the conduct of research carrying moderate to high risk in people with AD. Our current consent procedures grew out of reactions to the social cataclysms of the middle years of the twentieth century, especially from examples of enforced experimentation that came to light during the Nuremburg trials. The philosophical substrate of this informed consent process rests on the notion of the autonomous, reasonable individual who gives consent based on an informed cognitive evaluation and judgment. There is often an implied or stated benefit to the individual participant in clinical research, which the participant presumably balances against the risks of the project. This philosophical foundation is a poor fit to the growing population of cognitively impaired individuals, the future cohorts of whom will have the most to gain from such medical research. Moreover, such a schema of the consent process may not, in fact, match some of the realities of the interchange between investigator and participant. Drs. Stephen Post and Cornelia Beck presented discussions of the current situation with regard to research ethics in clinical studies involving cognitively impaired older people. Our present autonomy-based ethics in consent are awkward to apply to clinical research for the cognitively impaired. These difficulties apply both to the consenting process of participation and to the dissenting dimension of participation, when it is presumed that an autonomous subject may decide to withdraw from any ongoing project. In medical research, unlike medical care, the beneficiary is most likely to be some present or future element of society, as opposed to the actual research participant. This displacement of potential benefit from the participant to society in clinical research creates an ethical problem for a consent process founded substantially on the notion of individual autonomy. Several solutions have been attempted, but we are fully comfortable with none. One approach has been for investigators to emphasize potential direct benefits that might accrue to research subjects during the conduct of research. The imputation of direct benefit to the research subject by investigators analogizes the consent process in research to the consent process in health care, with which we are all more familiar. Benefits are often emphasized by investigators Alzheimer Disease and Associated Disorders Vol. 17, Suppl. 1, pp. S1\u2013S2 \u00a9 2003 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc., Philadelphia"
