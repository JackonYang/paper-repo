Our most striking result is that those variables which assume binary values in an optimum (VLP) solution retain the same values in an optimum (VP) solution. This result is of interest because variables are (0, 1/2, 1). valued in basic feasible solutions to (VLP) and (VLP) can be solved by a \u201cgood\u201d algorithm. This relationship and other optimality conditions are incorporated into an implicit enumeration algorithm for solving (VP). Some computational experience is reported."

The main result is that if a variable takes a constant binary value in all$\\hat X \\in C$, then it takes the same value in all$\\hat X \\in D$ (this may be contrasted with a well-known result of Nemhauser and Trotter, stating that if a variable takes a binary value in some$\\hat X \\in C$, then it takes the same value in some$X \\in D$). For any graph G, the set P of the vertices j such that $\\hat X_j $ has a constant binary value in all$\\hat X \\in C$, can be efficiently detected; moreover, the results in this paper imply that in the unweighted case, the subgraph induced by P has the \u201cstrong\u201d Konig\u2013Egervary property and that the subgraph induced by the complement of P has a perfect 2-matching: actually, the maximum stable sets of G are in a 1-to-1 correspondence with those of the latter subgraph."

Such a function is called submodular. We consider the problem maxS\u2282N{a(S):|S|\u2264K,z(S) submodular}.Several hard combinatorial optimization problems can be posed in this framework. For example, the problem of finding a maximum weight independent set in a matroid, when the elements of the matroid are colored and the elements of the independent set can have no more thanK colors, is in this class. The uncapacitated location problem is a special case of this matroid optimization problem.We analyze greedy and local improvement heuristics and a linear programming relaxation for this problem. Our results are worst case bounds on the quality of the approximations. For example, whenz(S) is nondecreasing andz(0) = 0, we show that a \u201cgreedy\u201d heuristic always produces a solution whose value is at least 1 \u2212[(K \u2212 1)/K]K times the optimal value. This bound can be achieved for eachK and has a limiting value of (e \u2212 1)/e, where e is the base of the natural logarithm."

Here \u201creduced\u201d means, roughly speaking, that the first problem can be solved deterministically in polynomial time provided an oracle is available for solving the second. From this notion of reducible, polynomial degrees of difficulty are defined, and it is shown that the problem of determining tautologyhood has the same polynomial degree as the problem of determining whether the first of two given graphs is isomorphic to a subgraph of the second. Other examples are discussed. A method of measuring the complexity of proof procedures for the predicate calculus is introduced and discussed."
