The main connectionnist tools used for this purpose are associative memories [9], particularly multi-layer networks associated with the well-known algorithm of the backpropagation of the error gradient [10, 11, 13]. To obtain the best results with these devices, it is necessary to apply some preprocessing which increases the orthogonality degree of the prototypes to be stored. For instance, KOHONEN proposed such a preprocessing, very simple but efficient, with a Laplacian filter [9, pp. 170\u201371]. First, consider these prototypes, that is the input vectors of these memories. In fact, they come from the outputs of sensors (cameras, microphones or eyes, ears and so on\u2026). These sensors are multisensitive: the signal provided by one sensor is a superimposition of signals emitted by all the sources of the neighbourhood. It is clear that decisions and classification of such a set of multidimensional data (prototypes) is difficult or even impossible, because of the redundancy of the components of prototype vectors associated to the mixtures. So, separating the independent sources in these mixtures is a very powerful preprocessing."

These systems gave an exponentially damped response to step or impulse inputs. In Chapter 8, we showed how a second-order system can give rise to a sinusoidal response. In this chapter, we will discuss a simple circuit that can generate a sinusoidal response. We call this circuit the second-order section; we can use it to generate any response that can be represented by two poles in the complex plane, where the two poles have both real and imaginary parts. With this circuit, we can adjust the positions of the complex-conjugate poles anywhere in the plane. The second-order circuit is shown in Figure 11.1; it contains two cascaded follower\u2013integrator circuits and an extra amplifier. The capacitance C is the same for both stages (C1 = C2 = C), and the transconductance of the two feed-forward amplifiers, A1 and A2, are the same: G1 = G2 = G (approximately\u2014if G is defined as the average of G1 and G2, small differences will have no first-order effect on the parameters of the response). We obtain an oscillatory response by adding the feedback amplifier A3. This amplifier has transconductance G3, and its output current is proportional to the difference between V2 and V3, but the sign of the feedback is positive; for small signals, I3 is equal to G3(V2 \u2212 V3). If we reduce the feedback to zero by shutting off the bias current in A3, each follower\u2013integrator circuit will have the transfer function given"

Kittens were dark\u2010reared until 4\u20106 weeks old, and then for another 4\u20107 weeks with various combinations of cylindrical lenses, monocular occlusion, and normal vision. 2. Single unit recordings from 816 neurones of the visual cortex (area 17) were obtained after the end of exposure. Clear\u2010cut effects on the distributions of the neurones' ocular dominance and orientation preference were found yielding close correlations with the rearing conditions. 3. It was confirmed that most cortical neurones prefer vertical stimulus orientations when experience is restricted to vertical contours in both eyes. It was further confirmed that, if the experienced orientations are different in the two eyes, each eye dominates over those neurones whose orientation preference corresponds to the orientation this eye has experienced. 4. When one eye is covered while the other sees only contours of one orientation, the ocular dominance distribution of cortical neurones shows a bias towards the open eye. Neurones dominated by this eye prefer orientations corresponding to the experienced range. Neurones preferring other orientations are shared between both eyes. 5. When vision is unimpaired in one eye and restricted to vertical contours in the other, binocularity is common among neurones preferring vertical orientations. Neurones with orientation preferences off the vertical are mainly monocular and dominated by the eye with unrestricted vision. 6. When normal monocular vision of one eye precedes restricted monocular vision of the other eye, only a few binocular units are encountered. Reversal of the initial effects of monocular experience is found only in neurones preferring the orientation that has been experienced by the newly opened eye. The other neurones remain dominated by the originally open eye. Thus, complementary distributions of orientation preferences are found for the two eyes. 7. A good correlation was found between the amount of orientational experience as determined by the number of orientations exposed and the number of normally tuned neurones. Conversely, the number of neurones responding to all orientations decreases with increasing amount of experience."

Instead, it is shown that, except for a brief transient phase associated with the initial burst, response is proportional to the product of a velocity-dependent and a length-dependent term. The velocity-dependent term is approximately \u03bd0.3 for both primary and secondary endings, both in the presence and in the absence of spontaneous fusimotor activity. For the majority of receptors, length dependence is well characterised by an upwardly offset straight-line relation between discharge rate and muscle length. It seems likely that this peculiar form of relation derives from the mechanical properties of intrafusal muscle fibres. Regardless of the mechanism, the relation places many interesting constraints on theories of motor control."
