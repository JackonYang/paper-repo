Complex objects are represented as structures joining parts called generalized cylinders. These primitives are formalized in a volume representation by an arbitrary cross section varying along a space curve axis. Several types of joint structures are discussed. Experimental results are shown for the description (building of internal computer models) of a handful of complex objects, beginning with laser range data from actual objects. Our programs have generated complete descriptions of rings, cones, and snake-like objects, all of which may be described by a single primitive. Complex objects, such as dolls, have been segmented into parts, most of which are well described by programs which implement generalized cylinder descriptions."

This method is complementary to the use of stereoscopy which relies on matching up sharp detail and will fail on smooth objects. Until now the image processing of single views has been restricted to objects which can meaningfully be considered two-dimensional or bounded by plane surfaces. It is possible to derive a first-order non-linear partial differential equation in two unknowns relating the intensity at the image points to the shape of the object. This equation can be solved by means of an equivalent set of five ordinary differential equations. A curve traced out by solving this set of equations for one set of starting values is called a characteristic strip. Starting one of these strips from each point on some initial curve will produce the whole solution surface. The initial curves can usually be constructed around so-called singular points. A number of applications of this method will be discussed including one to lunar topography and one to the scanning electron microscope. In both of these cases great simplifications occur in the equations. A note on polyhedra follows and a quantitative theory of facial make-up is touched upon. An implementation of some of these ideas on the PDP-6 computer with its attached image-dissector camera at the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory will be described, and also a nose-recognition program."

The model expresses the transform relating object space to image space as a function of the control variables of the camera. We constructed a calibration system for measuring the model parameters which has a demonstrated accuracy more than adequate for our present needs. We have also identified the major source of error in model measurement to be undesired image motion and have developed means of measuring and compensating for some of it and eliminating other parts of it. The system can measure systematic image distortions if they become the major accuracy limitation. It has been shown how to generalize the model to handle small systematic errors due to aspects of pan-tilt head geometry not presently accounted for. The report demonstrates the model's application in stereo vision and have shown how it can be applied as a predictive device in locating objects of interest and centering them in an image. (Author)"
