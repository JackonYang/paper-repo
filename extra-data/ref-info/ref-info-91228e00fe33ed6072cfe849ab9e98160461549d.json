In the present paper, we consider an extension of flow-driven spatial smoothness terms to spatio-temporal regularizers. Our method leads to a rotationally invariant and time symmetric convex optimization problem. It has a unique minimum that can be found in a stable way by standard algorithms such as gradient descent. Since the convexity guarantees global convergence, the result does not depend on the flow initialization. Two iterative algorithms are presented that are not difficult to implement. Qualitative and quantitative results for synthetic and real-world scenes show that our spatio-temporal approach (i) improves optic flow fields significantly, (ii) smoothes out background noise efficiently, and (iii) preserves true motion boundaries. The computational costs are only 50% higher than for a pure spatial approach applied to all subsequent image pairs of the sequence."

Intell., Vol. 8, pp. 565\u2013593) can be regarded as an early anisotropic diffusion method with a diffusion tensor. We introduce three improvements into the model formulation that (i) avoid inconsistencies caused by centering the brightness term and the smoothness term in different images, (ii) use a linear scale-space focusing strategy from coarse to fine scales for avoiding convergence to physically irrelevant local minima, and (iii) create an energy functional that is invariant under linear brightness changes. Applying a gradient descent method to the resulting energy functional leads to a system of diffusion\u2013reaction equations. We prove that this system has a unique solution under realistic assumptions on the initial data, and we present an efficient linear implicit numerical scheme in detail. Our method creates flow fields with 100 % density over the entire image domain, it is robust under a large range of parameter variations, and it can recover displacement fields that are far beyond the typical one-pixel limits which are characteristic for many differential methods for determining optical flow. We show that it performs better than the optical flow methods with 100 % density that are evaluated by Barron et al. (1994, Int. J. Comput. Vision, Vol. 12, pp. 43\u201347). Our software is available from the Internet."

Typically, these energy functionals consist of two terms: a data term, which requires e.g. that a brightness constancy assumption holds, and a regularizer that encourages global or piecewise smoothness of the flow field. In this paper we present a systematic classification of rotation invariant convex regularizers by exploring their connection to diffusion filters for multichannel images. This taxonomy provides a unifying framework for data-driven and flow-driven, isotropic and anisotropic, as well as spatial and spatio-temporal regularizers. While some of these techniques are classic methods from the literature, others are derived here for the first time. We prove that all these methods are well-posed: they posses a unique solution that depends in a continuous way on the initial data. An interesting structural relation between isotropic and anisotropic flow-driven regularizers is identified, and a design criterion is proposed for constructing anisotropic flow-driven regularizers in a simple and direct way from isotropic ones. Its use is illustrated by several examples."

This problem is set as a regularization and minimization of a non quadratic functional. The Tikhonov quadratic regularization term usually used to recover smooth solution is replaced by a particular function of the gradient flow specifically derived to allow flow discontinuities formation in the solution. Conditions to be fulfilled by this specific regularizing term, to preserve discontinuities and insure stability of the regularization problem, are also derived. To minimize this non quadratic functional, two different methods have been investigated. The first one is an iterative scheme to solve the associated non-linear Euler-Lagrange equations. The second solution introduces dual variables so that the minimization problem becomes a quadratic or a convex functional minimization problem. Promising experimental results on synthetic and real image sequences will illustrate the capabilities of this approach."

Much work has been done based on the minimization of a distance between a first image and a second image after applying deformation or motion field. Usually no justification is given about convergence of the algorithm used. We start by showing, in the translation case, that convergence to the global minimum is made easier by applying a low pass filter to the images hence making the energy \u201cconvex enough\u201d. In order to keep convergence to the global minimum in the general case, we introduce a local rigidity hypothesis on the unknown deformation. We then deduce a new natural motion constraint equation (MCE) at each scale using the Dirichlet low pass operator. This transforms the problem to solving the energy minimization in a finite dimensional subspace of approximation obtained through Fourier Decomposition. This allows us to derive sufficient conditions for convergence of a new multi-scale and iterative motion estimation/registration scheme towards a global minimum of the usual nonlinear energy instead of a local minimum as did all previous methods. Although some of the sufficient conditions cannot always be fulfilled because of the absence of the necessary a priori knowledge on the motion, we use an implicit approach. We illustrate our method by showing results on synthetic and real examples in dimension 1 (signal matching, Stereo) and 2 (Motion, Registration, Morphing), including large deformation experiments."

Thissingle motion assumptionis violated in common situations involving transparency, depth discontinuities, independently moving objects, shadows, and specular reflections. To robustly estimate optical flow, the single motion assumption must be relaxed. This paper presents a framework based onrobust estimationthat addresses violations of the brightness constancy and spatial smoothness assumptions caused by multiple motions. We show how therobust estimation frameworkcan be applied to standard formulations of the optical flow problem thus reducing their sensitivity to violations of their underlying assumptions. The approach has been applied to three standard techniques for recovering optical flow: area-based regression, correlation, and regularization with motion discontinuities. This paper focuses on the recovery of multiple parametric motion models within a region, as well as the recovery of piecewise-smooth flow fields, and provides examples with natural and synthetic image sequences."

The first is a modified gradient-based regularization method, and the other is an SSD-based regularization method. For the gradient-based method, to amend the errors in the discrete image flow equation caused by numerical differentiation as well as temporal and spatial aliasing in the brightness function, we propose to selectively combine the image flow constraint and a contour-based flow constraint into the data constraint by using a reliability measure. Each data constraint is appropriately normalized to obtain an approximate minimum distance (of the data point to the linear flow equation) constraint instead of the conventional linear flow constraint. These modifications lead to robust and accurate optical flow estimation. We propose an incomplete Cholesky preconditioned conjugate gradient algorithm to solve the resulting large and sparse linear system efficiently. Our SSD-based regularization method uses a normalized SSD measure (based on a similar reasoning as in the gradient-based scheme) as the data constraint in a regularization framework. The nonlinear conjugate gradient algorithm in conjunction with an incomplete Cholesky preconditioning is developed to solve the resulting nonlinear minimization problem. Experimental results on synthetic and real image sequences for these two algorithms are given to demonstrate their performance in comparison with competing methods reported in literature."

An affine model of image motion is used within local image patches while a spatial smoothness constraint on the affine flow parameters of neighboring patches enforces continuity of the motion. We refer to this as a \"Skin and Bones\" model in which the affine patches can be thought of as rigid \"bones\" connected by a flexible \"skin\". Since local image patches may contain multiple motions we use a layered representation for the affine bones. To regularize this layered motion representation we develop a new framework for regularization with transparency."

A local algorithm for the computation of the optical flow which uses second order derivatives of the image brightness pattern, and that avoids the aperture problem, is presented. The obtained optical flow is very similar to the true motion field \u2014 which is the vector field associated with moving features on the image plane \u2014 and can be used to recover 3D motion information. Experimental results on sequences of real images, together with estimates of relevant motion parameters, like time-to-crash for translation and angular velocity for rotation, are presented and discussed. Due to the remarkable accuracy which can be achieved in estimating motion parameters, the proposed method is likely to be very useful in a number of computer vision applications."

The solution of the obtained nonlinear differential equations is done with a time dependent approach leading to the successive solutions of linear systems. This new method allows to compute optical flow fields while insuring a unique solution and preserving the flow discontinuities. This method seems to be more appropriate since it does not enforce the optical flow to be smooth in the boundaries of moving objects and reconstruct the optical flow discontinuities without any specific processing of these points. We have applied the model on synthetical and real image sequences which illustrate the properties of this approach. Finally we give an interesting application which merges optical flow field and snake models for boundaries tracking."

A second constraint is needed. A method for finding the optical flow pattern is presented which assumes that the apparent velocity of the brightness pattern varies smoothly almost everywhere in the image. An iterative implementation is shown which successfully computes the optical flow for a number of synthetic image sequences. The algorithm is robust in that it can handle image sequences that are quantized rather coarsely in space and time. It is also insensitive to quantization of brightness levels and additive noise. Examples are included where the assumption of smoothness is violated at singular points or along lines in the image."

The authors start by formulating constraints on image motion to account for the possibility of multiple motions. This is achieved by exploiting the notions of weak continuity and robust statistics in the formulation of a minimization problem. The resulting objective function is non-convex. Traditional stochastic relaxation techniques for minimizing such functions prove inappropriate for the task. A highly parallel incremental stochastic minimization algorithm is presented which has a number of advantages over previous approaches. The incremental nature of the scheme makes it dynamic and permits the detection of occlusion and disocclusion boundaries.<<ETX>>"

The approach developed here is a tradeoff between methods based on global parameterized flow models and local dense optic flow estimators. The method relies on an adaptive multigrid minimization approach. In addition to accelerated convergence toward good estimates, it allows to mix different parameterizations of the estimate relative to adaptive partitions of the image. The performances of the resulting algorithms are demonstrated in the difficult context of a non-convex energy. Experimental results on real world Meteosat sequences are presented."

One of the tradeoffs between accuracy and speed was that no attempts were made to obtain regions of coherent motion when estimating the parametric models. In this paper we show how this can be improved by doing a simultaneous segmentation of the motion field. The resulting algorithm is slower than the previous one, but more accurate. This is shown by evaluation on the well-known Yosemite sequence, where already the previous algorithm showed an accuracy which was substantially better than for earlier published methods.

In this paper we show how this can be improved by doing a simultaneous segmentation of the motion field. The resulting algorithm is slower than the previous one, but more accurate. This is shown by evaluation on the well-known Yosemite sequence, where already the previous algorithm showed an accuracy which was substantially better than for earlier published methods.

This paper describes a hierarchical computational framework for the determination of dense displacement fields from a pair of images, and an algorithm consistent with that framework. Our framework is based on a scale-based separation of the image intensity information and the process of measuring motion. The large-scale intensity information is first used to obtain rough estimates of image motion, which are then refined by using intensity information at smaller scales. The estimates are in the form of displacement (or velocity) vectors for pixels and are accompanied by a direction-dependent confidence measure. A smoothness constraint is employed to propagate measurements with high confidence to neighboring areas where the confidences are low. At all levels, the computations are pixel-parallel, uniform across the image, and based on information from a small neighborhood of a pixel. Results of applying our algorithm to pairs of real images are included. In addition to our own matching algorithm, we also show that two different hierarchical gradient-based algorithms are consistent with our framework."

In most situations, the mere gray value variations do not provide sufficient information in order to estimate such a displacement vector field. Supplementary constraints are necessary, for example the postulate that a displacement vector field varies smoothly as a function of the image position. Taken as a general requirement, this creates difficulties at gray value transitions which correspond to occluding contours. Nagel therefore introduced the ``oriented smoothness'' requirement which restricts variations of the displacement vector field only in directions with small or no variation of gray values. This contribution reports results of an investigation about how such an ``oriented smoothness'' constraint may be formulated and evaluated."

                "text": "Differential methods belong to the most widely used techniques for optic flow computation in image sequences. They can be classified into local methods such as the Lucas\u2013Kanade technique or Big\u00fcn's structure tensor method, and into global methods such as the Horn/Schunck approach and its extensions. Often local methods are more robust under noise, while global techniques yield dense flow fields. The goal of this paper is to contribute to a better understanding and the design of novel differential methods in four ways; (i) We juxtapose the role of smoothing/regularisation processes that are required in local and global differential methods for optic flow computation. (ii) This discussion motivates us to describe and evaluate a novel method that combines important advantages of local and global approaches: It yields dense flow fields that are robust against noise. (iii) Spatiotemporal and nonlinear extensions as well as multiresolution frameworks are presented for this hybrid method. (iv) We propose a simple confidence measure for optic flow methods that minimise energy functionals. It allows to sparsify a dense flow field gradually, depending on the reliability required for the resulting flow. Comparisons with experiments from the literature demonstrate the favourable performance of the proposed methods and the confidence measure."

It spans a wide variety of topics such as digitization, histogram manipulation, warping, filtering, segmentation, restoration and compression. Computer vision deals with theories and algorithms for automating the process of visual perception, and involves tasks such as noise removal, smoothing, and sharpening of edges (low-level vision); segmentation of images to isolate object regions, and description of the segmented regions (intermediate-level vision); and finally, interpretation of the scene (high-level vision). Thus, there is much overlap between these two fields. In this chapter, we concentrate on some of the aspects of image processing and computer vision in which a fuzzy approach has had an impact. We begin with some notation and definitions used throughout the chapter."
