The improvement is achieved by combining a large number of hypotheses, each of which is generated by training the given learning algorithm on a different set of examples. Our algorithm is based on ideas presented by Schapire and represents an improvement over his results, The analysis of our algorithm provides general upper bounds on the resources required for learning in Valiant\u2032s polynomial PAC learning framework, which are the best general upper bounds known today. We show that the number of hypotheses that are combined by our algorithm is the smallest number possible. Other outcomes of our analysis are results regarding the representational power of threshold circuits, the relation between learnability and compression, and a method for parallelizing PAC learning algorithms. We provide extensions of our algorithms to cases in which the concepts are not binary and to the case where the accuracy of the learning algorithm depends on the distribution of the instances."

We also introduced the related notion of a \"pseudo-loss\" which is a method for forcing a learning algorithm of multi-label concepts to concentrate on the labels that are hardest to discriminate. In this paper, we describe experiments we carried out to assess how well AdaBoost with and without pseudo-loss, performs on real learning problems. We performed two sets of experiments. The first set compared boosting to Breiman's \"bagging\" method when used to aggregate various classifiers (including decision trees and single attribute- value tests). We compared the performance of the two methods on a collection of machine-learning benchmarks. In the second set of experiments, we studied in more detail the performance of boosting using a nearest-neighbor classifier on an OCR problem."

In contrast to other approaches, the experts are trained independently and do not compete for data during learning. Only when a prediction for a query is required do the experts cooperate by blending their individual predictions. Each expert is trained by minimizing a penalized local cross validation error using second order methods. In this way, an expert is able to find a local distance metric by adjusting the size and shape of the receptive field in which its predictions are valid, and also to detect relevant input features by adjusting its bias on the importance of individual input dimensions. We derive asymptotic results for our method. In a variety of simulations the properties of the algorithm are demonstrated with respect to interference, learning speed, prediction accuracy, feature detection, and task oriented incremental learning."

Our analysis is for worst-case situations, i.e., we make no assumptions about the way the sequence of bits to be predicted is generated. We measure the performance of the algorithm by the difference between the expected number of mistakes it makes on the bit sequence and the expected number of mistakes made by the best expert on this sequence, where the expectation is taken with respect to the randomization in the predictions. We show that the minimum achievable difference is on the order of the square root of the number of mistakes of the best expert, and we give efficient algorithms that achieve this. Our upper and lower bounds have matching leading constants in most cases. We then show how this leads to certain kinds of pattern recognition/learning algorithms with performance bounds that improve on the best results currently known in this context. We also extend our analysis to the case in which log loss is used instead of the expected number of mistakes."

More precisely, we compare methods for finding a balance between the complexity of the hypothesis chosen and its observed error on a random training sample of limited size, when the goal is that of minimizing the resulting generalization error. We undertake a detailed comparison of three well-known model selection methods \u2014 a variation of Vapnik's Guaranteed Risk Minimization (GRM), an instance of Rissanen's Minimum Description Length Principle (MDL), and (hold-out) cross validation (CV). We introduce a general class of model selection methods (called penalty-based methods) that includes both GRM and MDL, and provide general methods for analyzing such rules. We provide both controlled experimental evidence and formal theorems to support the following conclusions:\u2022Even on simple model selection problems, the behavior of the methods examined can be both complex and incomparable. Furthermore, no amount of \u201ctuning\u201d of the rules investigated (such as introducing constant multipliers on the complexity penalty terms, or a distribution-specific \u201ceffective dimension\u201d) can eliminate this incomparability.\u2022It is possible to give rather general bounds on the generalization error, as a function of sample size, for penalty-based methods. The quality of such bounds depends in a precise way on the extent to which the method considered automatically limits the complexity of the hypothesis selected.\u2022For any model selection problem, the additional error of cross validation compared to any other method can be bounded above by the sum of two terms. The first term is large only if the learning curve of the underlying function classes experiences a phase transition\u201d between (1-\u03b3)m and m examples (where gamma is the fraction saved for testing in CV). The second and competing term can be made arbitrarily small by increasing \u03b3.\u2022The class of penalty-based methods is fundamentally handicapped in the sense that there exist two types of model selection problems for which every penalty-based method must incur large generalization error on at least one, while CV enjoys small generalization error on both."

Chapters 2 and 3 are concerned with algorithms for learning concepts from random examples. Briefly, the goal of the learner is to observe a set of labeled instances and generate a hypothesis that approximates the rule that maps the instances to their labels. \nChapter 2 describes and analyses an algorithm for improving the performance of a general concept learning algorithm by selecting those labeled instances that are most informative. This work is an improvement over previous work by Schapire. The analysis provides upper bounds on the time, space and number of examples that are required for concept learning. Chapter 3 is concerned with situations in which the learner can select, out of a stream of random instances, those for which it wants to know the label. We analyze an algorithm of Seung et. al. for selecting such instances, and prove that it is effective for the Perceptron concept class. Both Chapters 2 and 3 show situations in which a carefully selected exponentially small fraction of the random training examples are sufficient for learning. \nChapter 4 is concerned with learning distributions of binary vectors. Here we present a new distribution model that can represent combinations of correlation patterns. We describe two different algorithms for learning this distribution model from random examples, and provide experimental evidence that they are effective. \nWe conclude, in Chapter 5, with a brief discussion of the possible use of our algorithms in real world problems and compare them with classical approaches from pattern recognition."

For a sequence of trials, we compute total losses for both the algorithm and the experts under a loss function. At the end of the trial sequence, we compare the total loss of the algorithm to the total loss of the best expert, i.e., the expert with the least loss on the particular trial sequence. We show that for a large class of loss functions, with binary outcomes the total loss of the algorithm proposed by Vovk exceeds the total loss of the best expert at most by the amount c ln N, where c is a constant determined by the loss function. This upper bound does not depend on any assumptions on how the experts'' predictions or the outcomes are generated, and the trial sequence can be arbitrarily long. We give a straightforward method for finding the correct value c and show by a lower bound that for this value of c, the upper bound is asymptotically tight. The lower bound is based on a probabilistic adversary argument. The class of loss functions for which the c ln N upper bound holds includes the square loss, the logarithmic loss, and the Hellinger loss. We also consider another class of loss functions, including the absolute loss, for which we have an Omega((l log N)^(1/2)) lower bound, where l is the number of trials. We show that for the square and logarithmic loss functions, Vovk''s algorithm achieves the same worst-case upper bounds with continuous-valued outcomes as with binary outcomes. For the absolute loss, we show how bounds earlier achieved for binary outcomes can be achieved with continuous-valued outcomes using a slightly more complicated algorithm."

Among our results are the following bounds on appropriate sample vs. network size. Assume 0 < \u220a 1/8. We show that if m O(W/\u220a log N/\u220a) random examples can be loaded on a feedforward network of linear threshold functions with N nodes and W weights, so that at least a fraction 1 \u220a/2 of the examples are correctly classified, then one has confidence approaching certainty that the network will correctly classify a fraction 1 \u220a of future test examples drawn from the same distribution. Conversely, for fully-connected feedforward nets with one hidden layer, any learning algorithm using fewer than (W/\u220a) random training examples will, for some distributions of examples consistent with an appropriate weight choice, fail at least some fixed fraction of the time to find a weight choice that will correctly classify more than a 1 \u220a fraction of the future test examples."

It is assumed that the learner has reason to believe that one of some pool of known algorithms will perform well but does not know which one. A simple and effective method, based on weighted voting, is introduced for constructing a compound algorithm in such a circumstance. It is called the weighted majority algorithm and is shown to be robust with respect to errors in the data. Various versions of the weighted majority algorithm are discussed, and error bounds for them that are closely related to the error bounds of the best algorithms of the pool are proved.<<ETX>>"

                "text": "Multiclass learning problems involve finding a definition for an unknown function f(x) whose range is a discrete set containing k > 2 values (i.e., k \"classes\"). The definition is acquired by studying collections of training examples of the form (xi, f(xi)). Existing approaches to multiclass learning problems include direct application of multiclass algorithms such as the decision-tree algorithms C4.5 and CART, application of binary concept learning algorithms to learn individual binary functions for each of the k classes, and application of binary concept learning algorithms with distributed output representations. This paper compares these three approaches to a new technique in which error-correcting codes are employed as a distributed output representation. We show that these output representations improve the generalization performance of both C4.5 and backpropagation on a wide range of multiclass learning tasks. We also demonstrate that this approach is robust with respect to changes in the size of the training sample, the assignment of distributed representations to particular classes, and the application of overfitting avoidance techniques such as decision-tree pruning. Finally, we show that--like the other methods--the error-correcting code technique can provide reliable class probability estimates. Taken together, these results demonstrate that error-correcting output codes provide a general-purpose method for improving the performance of inductive learning programs on multiclass problems."

Both form a set of classifiers that are combined by voting, bagging by generating replicated bootstrap samples of the data, and boosting by adjusting the weights of training instances. This paper reports results of applying both techniques to a system that learns decision trees and testing on a representative collection of datasets. While both approaches substantially improve predictive accuracy, boosting shows the greater benefit. On the other hand, boosting also produces severe degradation on some datasets. A small change to the way that boosting combines the votes of learned classifiers reduces this downside and also leads to slightly better results on most of the datasets considered."

To study this, the concepts of bias and variance of a classifier are defined. Unstable classifiers can have universally low bias. Their problem is high variance. Combining multiple versions is a variance reducing device. One of the most effective is bagging (Breiman [1996a]) Here, modified training sets are formed by resampling from the original training set, classifiers constructed using these training sets and then combined by voting. Freund and Schapire [1995,1996] propose an algorithm the basis of which is to adaptively resample and combine (hence the acronym-arcing) so that the weights in the resampling are increased for those cases most often missclassified and the combining is done by weighted voting. Arcing is more sucessful than bagging in variance reduction. We explore two arcing algorithms, compare them to each other and to bagging, and try to understand how arcing works."

Thus in the (two-person, zero-sum) game with matrix \u039bf, player I has a strategy insuring an expected gain of at least v, and player II has a strategy insuring an expected loss of at most v. An alternative statement, which follows from the von Neumann theorem and an appropriate law of large numbers is that, for any e>0, I can, in a long series of plays of the game with matrix M, guarantee, with probability approaching 1 as the number of plays becomes infinite, that his average actual gain per play exceeds v \u2014 e and that II can similarly restrict his average actual loss to v-he. These facts are assertions about the extent to which each player can control the center of gravity of the actual payoffs in a long series of plays. In this paper we investigate the extent to which this center of gravity can be controlled by the players for the case of matrices M whose elements m(i9 j) are points of \u039b\u0393-space. Roughly, we seek to answer the following question. Given a matrix M and a set S in iV-space, can I guarantee that the center of gravity of the payoffs in a long series of plays is in or arbitrarily near St with probability approaching 1 as the number of plays becomes infinite ? The question is formulated more precisely below, and a complete solution is given in two cases: the case JV=1 and the case of convex S. Let"
