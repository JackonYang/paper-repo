Our detection technique is based on a cascade of boosted ensemble and localizer uses standard image processing techniques. We propose a small set of features (39 in total) capable of detecting various type of text in grey level natural scene images. Two weak learners, linear discriminant function and log likelihood-ratio test under gaussian assumption, are evaluated. Single features and combination of features are used to form weak classifiers. The proposed scheme is evaluated on ICDAR 2003 robust reading and text locating database. The results are encouraging and the detector can process an images of 640 times 480 pixels in less than 2 seconds."

The efficiency of the method is illustrated and the method is compared, according to various criteria, with common methods issued from the state of the art. This comparison shows that our method gives better results and is faster than the state of the art methods. Our method reduces also the number of segmented regions. This can lead to time saving in a complete scheme (executing time of multiple processing steps usually depends on the number of regions) and proves that our algorithm is more relevant."

This method is used in the French iTowns project (iTowns ANR project, 2008) to automatically enhance cartographic database by extracting text from geolocalized pictures of town streets. This task is difficult as 1. text in this environment varies in shape, size, color, orientation... 2. pictures may be blurred, as they are taken from a moving vehicle, and text may have perspective deformations, 3. all pictures are taken outside with various objects that can lead to false positives and in unconstrained conditions (especially light varies from one picture to the other). Then, we can not make the assumption on searched text. The only supposition is that text is not handwritten. Our process is based on two main steps: a new segmentation method based on morphological operator and a classification step based on a combination of multiple SVM classifiers. The description of our process is given in this article. The efficiency of each step is measured and the global scheme is illustrated on an example."

Then the two level features are combined hierarchically. The low-level features are color continuity, gray-level variation and color variance. The color continuity is used since most of the characters in a text region have the same color, and the gray-level variation is used since the text strokes are distinctive to the background in their gray-level values. Also, the color variance is used since the text strokes are distinctive in their colors to the background, and this value is more sensitive than the gray-level variations. As a high level feature, text stroke is examined using multi-resolution wavelet transforms on local image areas and the feature vector is input to a SVM (support vector machine) for verification. We tested the proposed method with various kinds of the natural scene images and confirmed that extraction rates are high even in complex images."

Country-specific systems are mostly, designed, which can (artificially) reach high-level recognition rates. This option, however, strictly limits their applicability. In this paper, we propose an approach that can deal with various national plates. There are three main areas of novelty. First, the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is managed by a hybrid strategy, combining statistical and structural algorithms. Secondly, an efficient probabilistic edit distance is proposed for providing an explicit video-based LPR. Last but not least, cognitive loops are introduced at critical stages of the algorithm. These feedback steps take advantage of the context modeling to increase the overall system performances, and overcome the inextricable parameter settings of the low-level processing. The system performances have been tested in more than 1200 static images with difficult illumination conditions and complex backgrounds, as well as in six different videos containing 525 moving vehicles. The evaluations prove our system to be very competitive among the non-country specific approaches."

After reviewing existing edge and gradient based descriptors, we show experimentally that grids of histograms of oriented gradient (HOG) descriptors significantly outperform existing feature sets for human detection. We study the influence of each stage of the computation on performance, concluding that fine-scale gradients, fine orientation binning, relatively coarse spatial binning, and high-quality local contrast normalization in overlapping descriptor blocks are all important for good results. The new approach gives near-perfect separation on the original MIT pedestrian database, so we introduce a more challenging dataset containing over 1800 annotated human images with a large range of pose variations and backgrounds."

A key to this remarkable performance seems to be that biological systems construct representations of their visual image data at multiple scales. A Pyramid Framework for Early Vision describes a multiscale, or 'pyramid', approach to vision, including its theoretical foundations, a set of pyramid-based modules for image processing, object detection, texture discrimination, contour detection and processing, feature detection and description, and motion detection and tracking. It also shows how these modules can be implemented very efficiently on hypercube-connected processor networks. The volume is intended for both students of vision and vision system designers; it provides a general approach to vision systems design as well as a set of robust, efficient vision modules."

For this we used the same data as the ICDAR 2003 competition, which has been kept private until now. This allows a direct comparison with the 2003 entries. The main result is that the leading 2005 entry has improved significantly on the leading 2003 entry, with an increase in average f-score from 0.5 to 0.62, where the f-score is the same adapted information retrieval measure used for the 2003 competition. The paper also discusses the Web-based deployment and evaluation of text locating systems, and one of the leading entries has now been deployed in this way. This mode of usage could lead to more complete and more immediate knowledge of the strengths and weaknesses of each newly developed system."

With 20-MHz Sparc processors, the average time per mail piece for the combined hardware and software system components is 0.210 seconds. The system located 89.0% of the addresses as the top choice. Recent developments in the system include the use of a top-down segmentation tool, address syntax analysis using only connected component data, and improvements to the segmentation refinement routines.

The machine conceptually implements the following idea: input vectors are non-linearly mapped to a very high-dimension feature space. In this feature space a linear decision surface is constructed. Special properties of the decision surface ensures high generalization ability of the learning machine. The idea behind the support-vector network was previously implemented for the restricted case where the training data can be separated without errors. We here extend this result to non-separable training data.High generalization ability of support-vector networks utilizing polynomial input transformations is demonstrated. We also compare the performance of the support-vector network to various classical learning algorithms that all took part in a benchmark study of Optical Character Recognition."
