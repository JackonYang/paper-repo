However, most segmentation algorithms adopt methods which are not explicitly linked to the goal of object recognition. Here we solve a related but slightly different problem in order to assist object recognition more directly - the extraction of a foreground mask, which identifies the locations of objects in the image. We propose a novel foreground/background segmentation algorithm that attempts to segment the interesting objects from the rest of the image, while maximizing an objective function which is tightly related to object recognition. We do this in a manner which requires no class-specific knowledge of object categories, using a probabilistic formulation which is derived from manually segmented images. The model includes a geometric prior and an appearance prior, whose parameters are learnt on the fly from images that are similar to the query image. We use graph-cut based energy minimization to enforce spatial coherence on the model's output. The method is tested on the challenging VOC09 and VOC10 segmentation datasets, achieving excellent results in providing a foreground mask. We also provide comparisons to the recent segmentation method of [7]."

This prevents useful developments, such as learning reliable object detectors for thousands of classes. In this paper we propose to automatically populate ImageNet with many more bounding-boxes, by leveraging existing manual annotations. The key idea is to localize objects of a target class for which annotations are not available, by transferring knowledge from related source classes with available annotations. We distinguish two kinds of source classes: ancestors and siblings. Each source provides knowledge about the plausible location, appearance and context of the target objects, which induces a probability distribution over windows in images of the target class. We learn to combine these distributions so as to maximize the location accuracy of the most probable window. Finally, we employ the combined distribution in a procedure to jointly localize objects in all images of the target class. Through experiments on 0.5 million images from 219 classes we show that our technique (i) annotates a wide range of classes with bounding-boxes; (ii) effectively exploits the hierarchical structure of ImageNet, since all sources and types of knowledge we propose contribute to the results; (iii) scales efficiently."

Co-segmentation is the problem of simultaneously dividing multiple images into regions (segments) corresponding to different object classes. In this paper, we combine existing tools for bottom-up image segmentation such as normalized cuts, with kernel methods commonly used in object recognition. These two sets of techniques are used within a discriminative clustering framework: the goal is to assign foreground/background labels jointly to all images, so that a supervised classifier trained with these labels leads to maximal separation of the two classes. In practice, we obtain a combinatorial optimization problem which is relaxed to a continuous convex optimization problem, that can itself be solved efficiently for up to dozens of images. We illustrate the proposed method on images with very similar foreground objects, as well as on more challenging problems with objects with higher intra-class variations."

We decompose the test image and all images in a supervised training set into overlapping windows likely to cover foreground objects. The key idea is to transfer segmentation masks from training windows that are visually similar to windows in the test image. These transferred masks are then used to derive the unary potentials of a binary, pairwise energy function defined over the pixels of the test image, which is minimized with standard graph-cuts. This results in a fully automatic segmentation scheme, as opposed to interactive techniques based on similar energy functions. Using windows as support regions for transfer efficiently exploits the training data, as the test image does not need to be globally similar to a training image for the method to work. This enables to compose novel scenes using local parts of training images. Our approach obtains very competitive results on three datasets (PASCAL VOC 2010 segmentation challenge, Weizmann horses, Graz-02)."

We introduce LOCUS (learning object classes with unsupervised segmentation) which uses a generative probabilistic model to combine bottom-up cues of color and edge with top-down cues of shape and pose. A key aspect of this model is that the object appearance is allowed to vary from image to image, allowing for significant within-class variation. By iteratively updating the belief in the object's position, size, segmentation and pose, LOCUS avoids making hard decisions about any of these quantities and so allows for each to be refined at any stage. We show that LOCUS successfully learns an object class model from unlabeled images, whilst also giving segmentation accuracies that rival existing supervised methods. Finally, we demonstrate simultaneous recognition and segmentation in novel images using the learned models for a number of object classes, as well as unsupervised object discovery and tracking in video."

The object hypotheses are represented as figure-ground segmentations, and are extracted automatically, without prior knowledge about properties of individual object classes, by solving a sequence of constrained parametric min-cut problems (CPMC) on a regular image grid. We then learn to rank the object hypotheses by training a continuous model to predict how plausible the segments are, given their mid-level region properties. We show that this algorithm significantly outperforms the state of the art for low-level segmentation in the VOC09 segmentation dataset. It achieves the same average best segmentation covering as the best performing technique to date [2], 0.61 when using just the top 7 ranked segments, instead of the full hierarchy in [2]. Our method achieves 0.78 average best covering using 154 segments. In a companion paper [18], we also show that the algorithm achieves state-of-the art results when used in a segmentation-based recognition pipeline."

Previous approaches require the input image to be presegmented into three regions: foreground, background and unknown, which are called a trimap. Partial opacity values are then computed only for pixels inside the unknown region. This presegmentation based approach fails for images with large portions of semitransparent foreground where the trimap is difficult to create even manually. In this paper, we combine the segmentation and matting problem together and propose a unified optimization approach based on belief propagation. We iteratively estimate the opacity value for every pixel in the image, based on a small sample of foreground and background pixels marked by the user. Experimental results show that compared with previous approaches, our method is more efficient to extract high quality mattes for foregrounds with significant semitransparent regions"

While previous works in co-segmentation have focussed on unsupervised co-segmentation, we use successful ideas from the interactive object-cutout literature. We develop an algorithm that allows users to decide what foreground is, and then guide the output of the co-segmentation algorithm towards it via scribbles. Interestingly, keeping a user in the loop leads to simpler and highly parallelizable energy functions, allowing us to work with significantly more images per group. However, unlike the interactive single-image counterpart, a user cannot be expected to exhaustively examine all cutouts (from tens of images) returned by the system to make corrections. Hence, we propose iCoseg, an automatic recommendation system that intelligently recommends where the user should scribble next. We introduce and make publicly available the largest co-segmentation dataset yet, the CMU-Cornell iCoseg dataset, with 38 groups, 643 images, and pixelwise hand-annotated groundtruth. Through machine experiments and real user studies with our developed interface, we show that iCoseg can intelligently recommend regions to scribble on, and users following these recommendations can achieve good quality cutouts with significantly lower time and effort than exhaustively examining all cutouts."

This model integrates image gradients, the location and scale of the object, the presence of object parts, and the tendency of these parts to have characteristic patterns of edges nearby. We enhance our method using multiple unsegmented images of objects to learn the parameters of the CRF, in an iterative conditional maximization framework. We show quantitative results on images of real scenes that demonstrate the accuracy of segmentation."

In this paper, we propose a supervised segmentation approach that tightly integrates object-level top down information with low-level image cues. The information from the two levels is fused under a kernelized structural SVM learning framework. We defined a novel nonlinear kernel for comparing two image-segmentation masks. This kernel combines four different kernels: the object similarity kernel, the object shape kernel, the per-image color distribution kernel, and the global color distribution kernel. Our experiments show that the structured SVM algorithm finds bad segmentations of the training examples given the current scoring function and punishes these bad segmentations to lower scores than the example (good) segmentations. The result is a segmentation algorithm that not only knows what good segmentations are, but also learns potential segmentation mistakes and tries to avoid them. Our proposed approach can obtain comparable performance to other state-of-the-art top-down driven segmentation approaches yet is flexible enough to be applied to widely different domains."

While previous approaches focus on unsupervised co-segmentation, we use successful ideas from the interactive object-cutout literature. We develop an algorithm that allows users to decide what foreground is, and then guide the output of the co-segmentation algorithm towards it via scribbles. Interestingly, keeping a user in the loop leads to simpler and highly parallelizable energy functions, allowing us to work with significantly more images per group. However, unlike the interactive single image counterpart, a user cannot be expected to exhaustively examine all cutouts (from tens of images) returned by the system to make corrections. Hence, we propose iCoseg, an automatic recommendation system that intelligently recommends where the user should scribble next. We introduce and make publicly available the largest co-segmentation datasetyet, the CMU-Cornell iCoseg Dataset, with 38 groups, 643 images, and pixelwise hand-annotated groundtruth. Through machine experiments and real user studies with our developed interface, we show that iCoseg can intelligently recommend regions to scribble on, and users following these recommendations can achieve good quality cutouts with significantly lower time and effort than exhaustively examining all cutouts."

The learned model is used for automatic visual recognition and semantic segmentation of photographs. Our discriminative model exploits novel features, based on textons, which jointly model shape and texture. Unary classification and feature selection is achieved using shared boosting to give an efficient classifier which can be applied to a large number of classes. Accurate image segmentation is achieved by incorporating these classifiers in a conditional random field. Efficient training of the model on very large datasets is achieved by exploiting both random feature selection and piecewise training methods. \n \nHigh classification and segmentation accuracy are demonstrated on three different databases: i) our own 21-object class database of photographs of real objects viewed under general lighting conditions, poses and viewpoints, ii) the 7-class Corel subset and iii) the 7-class Sowerby database used in [1]. The proposed algorithm gives competitive results both for highly textured (e.g. grass, trees), highly structured (e.g. cars, faces, bikes, aeroplanes) and articulated objects (e.g. body, cow)."

Its underlying model uses both colour and contrast information, together with a strong prior for region coherence. Estimation is performed by solving a graph cut problem for which very efficient algorithms have recently been developed.

A generative model for cosegmentation is presented. Inference in the model leads to minimizing an energy with an MRF term encoding spatial coherency and a global constraint which attempts to match the appearance histograms of the common parts. This energy has not been proposed previously and its optimization is challenging and NP-hard. For this problem a novel optimization scheme which we call trust region graph cuts is presented. We demonstrate that this framework has the potential to improve a wide range of research: Object driven image retrieval, video tracking and segmentation, and interactive image editing. The power of the framework lies in its generality, the common part can be a rigid/non-rigid object (or scene), observed from different viewpoints or even similar objects of the same class."

Existing methods are too generic and so far have not demonstrated competitive results for any specific task. In this paper we overcome this limitation by adding two new aspects to cosegmentation: (1) the \u201csomething\u201d has to be an object, and (2) the \u201csimilarity\u201d measure is learned. In this way, we are able to achieve excellent results on the recently introduced iCoseg dataset, which contains small sets of images of either the same object instance or similar objects of the same class. The challenge of this dataset lies in the extreme changes in viewpoint, lighting, and object deformations within each set. We are able to considerably outperform several competitors. To achieve this performance, we borrow recent ideas from object recognition: the use of powerful features extracted from a pool of candidate object-like segmentations. We believe that our work will be beneficial to several application areas, such as image retrieval."

The notion is related to the notions of a pixel, superpixel, segment or a part, but instead of referring to an element or a region of a single image, stel is a probabilistic element of an entire image class. Stels often define clear object or scene parts as a consequence of the modeling constraint which forces the regions belonging to a single stel to have a tight distribution over local measurements, such as color or texture. This self-similarity within a region in a single image is typical of most meaningful image parts, even when in different images of similar objects the corresponding parts may not have similar local measurements. The stel itself is expected to be consistent within a class, yet flexible, which we accomplish using a novel approach we dubbed stel component analysis. Experimental results show how stel component analysis can assist in image/video segmentation and object recognition where, in particular, it can be used as an alternative of, or in conjunction with, bag-of-features and related classifiers, where stel inference provides a meaningful spatial partition of features."

Classical image segmentation tools use either texture (colour) information, e.g. Magic Wand, or edge (contrast) information, e.g. Intelligent Scissors. Recently, an approach based on optimization by graph-cut has been developed which successfully combines both types of information. In this paper we extend the graph-cut approach in three respects. First, we have developed a more powerful, iterative version of the optimisation. Secondly, the power of the iterative algorithm is used to simplify substantially the user interaction needed for a given quality of result. Thirdly, a robust algorithm for \"border matting\" has been developed to estimate simultaneously the alpha-matte around an object boundary and the colours of foreground pixels. We show that for moderately difficult examples the proposed method outperforms competitive tools."

More advanced models attempt to improve the coherence of the labellings by introducing some form of inter-patch coupling: traditional spatial models such as MRF's provide crisper local labellings by exploiting neighbourhood-level couplings, while aspect models such as PLSA and LDA use global relevance estimates (global mixing proportions for the classes appearing in the image) to shape the local choices. We point out that the two approaches are complementary, combining them to produce aspect-based spatial field models that outperform both approaches. We study two spatial models: one based on averaging over forests of minimal spanning trees linking neighboring image regions, the other on an efficient chain-based Expectation Propagation method for regular 8-neighbor Markov random fields. The models can be trained using either patch-level labels or image-level keywords. As input features they use factored observation models combining texture, color and position cues. Experimental results on the MSR Cambridge data sets show that combining spatial and aspect models significantly improves the region-level classification accuracy. In fact our models trained with image-level labels outperform PLSA trained with pixel-level ones."

The parsing algorithm optimizes the posterior probability and outputs a scene representation as a \u201cparsing graph\u201d, in a spirit similar to parsing sentences in speech and natural language. The algorithm constructs the parsing graph and re-configures it dynamically using a set of moves, which are mostly reversible Markov chain jumps. This computational framework integrates two popular inference approaches\u2014generative (top-down) methods and discriminative (bottom-up) methods. The former formulates the posterior probability in terms of generative models for images defined by likelihood functions and priors. The latter computes discriminative probabilities based on a sequence (cascade) of bottom-up tests/filters. In our Markov chain algorithm design, the posterior probability, defined by the generative models, is the invariant (target) probability for the Markov chain, and the discriminative probabilities are used to construct proposal probabilities to drive the Markov chain. Intuitively, the bottom-up discriminative probabilities activate top-down generative models. In this paper, we focus on two types of visual patterns\u2014generic visual patterns, such as texture and shading, and object patterns including human faces and text. These types of patterns compete and cooperate to explain the image and so image parsing unifies image segmentation, object detection, and recognition (if we use generic visual patterns only then image parsing will correspond to image segmentation (Tu and Zhu, 2002. IEEE Trans. PAMI, 24(5):657\u2013673). We illustrate our algorithm on natural images of complex city scenes and show examples where image segmentation can be improved by allowing object specific knowledge to disambiguate low-level segmentation cues, and conversely where object detection can be improved by using generic visual patterns to explain away shadows and occlusions."

This process provides accurate delineation of object boundaries that cannot be achieved by either the top-down or bottom-up approach alone. The top-down approach uses object representation learned from examples to detect an object in a given input image and provide an approximation to its figure-ground segmentation. The bottom-up approach uses image-based criteria to define coherent groups of pixels that are likely to belong together to either the figure or the background part. The combination provides a final segmentation that draws on the relative merits of both approaches: The result is as close as possible to the top-down approximation, but is also constrained by the bottom-up process to be consistent with significant image discontinuities. We construct a global cost function that represents these top-down and bottom-up requirements. We then show how the global minimum of this function can be efficiently found by applying the sum-product algorithm. This algorithm also provides a confidence map that can be used to identify image regions where additional top-down or bottom-up information may further improve the segmentation. Our experiments show that the results derived from the algorithm are superior to results given by a pure top-down or pure bottom-up approach. The scheme has broad applicability, enabling the combined use of a range of existing bottom-up and top-down segmentations."

This setup has hardly been studied in computer vision research, but it is the rule rather than the exception, because the world contains tens of thousands of different object classes and for only a very few of them image, collections have been formed and annotated with suitable class labels. In this paper, we tackle the problem by introducing attribute-based classification. It performs object detection based on a human-specified high-level description of the target objects instead of training images. The description consists of arbitrary semantic attributes, like shape, color or even geographic information. Because such properties transcend the specific learning task at hand, they can be pre-learned, e.g. from image datasets unrelated to the current task. Afterwards, new classes can be detected based on their attribute representation, without the need for a new training phase. In order to evaluate our method and to facilitate research in this area, we have assembled a new large-scale dataset, \u201cAnimals with Attributes\u201d, of over 30,000 animal images that match the 50 classes in Osherson's classic table of how strongly humans associate 85 semantic attributes with animal classes. Our experiments show that by using an attribute layer it is indeed possible to build a learning object detection system that does not require any training images of the target classes."

A two-stage, partially supervised learning architecture is proposed: a rudimentary detector is learned from a very small set of segmented images and applied to a larger training set of un-segmented images; the second stage bootstraps these detections to learn an improved classifier while explicitly training against clutter. The detectors are learned with a boosting algorithm which creates a location-sensitive classifier using a discriminative set of features from a randomly chosen dictionary of contour fragments. We present results that are very competitive with other state-of-the-art object detection schemes and show robustness to object articulations, clutter, and occlusion. Our major contributions are the application of boosted local contour-based features for object detection in a partially supervised learning framework, and an efficient new boosting procedure for simultaneously selecting features and estimating per-feature parameters."

But exactly how such data can be harnessed and organized remains a critical problem. We introduce here a new database called \u201cImageNet\u201d, a large-scale ontology of images built upon the backbone of the WordNet structure. ImageNet aims to populate the majority of the 80,000 synsets of WordNet with an average of 500-1000 clean and full resolution images. This will result in tens of millions of annotated images organized by the semantic hierarchy of WordNet. This paper offers a detailed analysis of ImageNet in its current state: 12 subtrees with 5247 synsets and 3.2 million images in total. We show that ImageNet is much larger in scale and diversity and much more accurate than the current image datasets. Constructing such a large-scale database is a challenging task. We describe the data collection scheme with Amazon Mechanical Turk. Lastly, we illustrate the usefulness of ImageNet through three simple applications in object recognition, image classification and automatic object clustering. We hope that the scale, accuracy, diversity and hierarchical structure of ImageNet can offer unparalleled opportunities to researchers in the computer vision community and beyond."

In particular, graph cut has problems with segmenting thin elongated objects due to the ldquoshrinking biasrdquo. To overcome this problem, we propose to impose an additional connectivity prior, which is a very natural assumption about objects. We formulate several versions of the connectivity constraint and show that the corresponding optimization problems are all NP-hard. For some of these versions we propose two optimization algorithms: (i) a practical heuristic technique which we call DijkstraGC, and (ii) a slow method based on problem decomposition which provides a lower bound on the problem. We use the second technique to verify that for some practical examples DijkstraGC is able to find the global minimum."

We explicitly train it to distinguish objects with a well-defined boundary in space, such as cows and telephones, from amorphous background elements, such as grass and road. The measure combines in a Bayesian framework several image cues measuring characteristics of objects, such as appearing different from their surroundings and having a closed boundary. This includes an innovative cue measuring the closed boundary characteristic. In experiments on the challenging PASCAL VOC 07 dataset, we show this new cue to outperform a state-of-the-art saliency measure [17], and the combined measure to perform better than any cue alone. Finally, we show how to sample windows from an image according to their objectness distribution and give an algorithm to employ them as location priors for modern class-specific object detectors. In experiments on PASCAL VOC 07 we show this greatly reduces the number of windows evaluated by class-specific object detectors."

Leveraging this idea, cosegmentation jointly segments common regions from multiple images. In this paper, we propose CoSand, a distributed cosegmentation approach for a highly variable large-scale image collection. The segmentation task is modeled by temperature maximization on anisotropic heat diffusion, of which the temperature maximization with finite K heat sources corresponds to a K-way segmentation that maximizes the segmentation confidence of every pixel in an image. We show that our method takes advantage of a strong theoretic property in that the temperature under linear anisotropic diffusion is a submodular function; therefore, a greedy algorithm guarantees at least a constant factor approximation to the optimal solution for temperature maximization. Our theoretic result is successfully applied to scalable cosegmentation as well as diversity ranking and single-image segmentation. We evaluate CoSand on MSRC and ImageNet datasets, and show its competence both in competitive performance over previous work, and in much superior scalability."

The introduction of graph cuts has enabled efficient and optimal inference in associative random fields, greatly advancing applications such as segmentation, stereo reconstruction and many others. However, while fast inference is now widespread, parameter learning in random fields has remained an intractable problem. This paper shows how to apply fast inference algorithms, in particular graph cuts, to learn parameters of random fields with similar efficiency. We find optimal parameter values under standard regularized objective functions that ensure good generalization. Our algorithm enables learning of many parameters in reasonable time, and we explore further speedup techniques. We also discuss extensions to non-associative and multi-class problems. We evaluate the method on image segmentation and geometry recognition."

A graph-theoretic algorithm for finding globally optimal segmentations is given by the minimum ratio cycles, first applied to segmentation by Jermyn and Ishikawa (2001). In this paper we show that the class of image segmentation problems solvable by minimum ratio cycles is significantly larger than previously considered. In particular, they allow for the introduction of higher-order regularity of the region boundary. The key idea is to introduce an extended graph representation, where each node of the graph represents an image pixel as well as the orientation of the incoming line segment. With each graph edge representing a pair of adjacent line segments, edge weights can depend on the curvature. This way arbitrary positive functions of curvature can be introduced into globally optimal segmentation by minimum ratio cycles. In numerous experiments we demonstrate that compared to length-regularity the integration of curvature-regularity will drastically improve segmentation results. Moreover, we show an interesting relation to the snakes functional: minimum ratio cycles provide a way to find one of the few cases where the snakes functional has a meaningful global minimum."

The model offers a high degree of learnt invariance by utilizing viewpoint-dependent mixture components and movable parts in each mixture component. One might hope to increase the accuracy of the DPM by increasing the number of mixture components and parts to give a more faithful model, but limited training data prevents this from being effective. We propose an extension to the DPM which allows for sharing of object part models among multiple mixture components as well as object classes. This results in more compact models and allows training examples to be shared by multiple components, ameliorating the effect of a limited size training set. We (i) reformulate the DPM to incorporate part sharing, and (ii) propose a novel energy function allowing for coupled training of mixture components and object classes. We report state-of-the-art results on the PASCAL VOC dataset."

Methods for efficiently searching this incredibly rich resource are vital for a large number of applications. These include object recognition, computer graphics, personal photo collections, online image search tools. In this paper, our goal is to develop efficient image search and scene matching techniques that are not only fast, but also require very little memory, enabling their use on standard hardware or even on handheld devices. Our approach uses recently developed machine learning techniques to convert the Gist descriptor (a real valued vector that describes orientation energies at different scales and orientations within an image) to a compact binary code, with a few hundred bits per image. Using our scheme, it is possible to perform real-time searches with millions from the Internet using a single large PC and obtain recognition results comparable to the full descriptor. Using our codes on high quality labeled images from the LabelMe database gives surprisingly powerful recognition results using simple nearest neighbor techniques."

Pose estimation is formulated as a jigsaw puzzle problem in which the body part tiles maximally cover the foreground region, match local image features, and satisfy body plan and color constraints. This method explicitly imposes a global shape constraint on the body part assembly. It anchors multiple body parts simultaneously and introduces hyperedges in the part relation graph, which is essential for detecting complex poses. Using multiple cues in pose estimation, our method is resistant to cluttered foregrounds. We propose an efficient linear method to solve the consistent max-covering problem. A two-stage relaxation finds the solution in polynomial time. Our experiments on a variety of images and videos show that the proposed method is more robust than previous locally constrained methods."

We propose a simple and efficient alternating minimization scheme for finding a rotation of zero-centered data so as to minimize the quantization error of mapping this data to the vertices of a zero-centered binary hypercube. This method, dubbed iterative quantization (ITQ), has connections to multi-class spectral clustering and to the orthogonal Procrustes problem, and it can be used both with unsupervised data embeddings such as PCA and supervised embeddings such as canonical correlation analysis (CCA). Our experiments show that the resulting binary coding schemes decisively outperform several other state-of-the-art methods."

While recent progress in machine learning has mainly focused on designing flexible and powerful input representations, this paper addresses the complementary issue of designing classification algorithms that can deal with more complex outputs, such as trees, sequences, or sets. More generally, we consider problems involving multiple dependent output variables, structured output spaces, and classification problems with class attributes. In order to accomplish this, we propose to appropriately generalize the well-known notion of a separation margin and derive a corresponding maximum-margin formulation. While this leads to a quadratic program with a potentially prohibitive, i.e. exponential, number of constraints, we present a cutting plane algorithm that solves the optimization problem in polynomial time for a large class of problems. The proposed method has important applications in areas such as computational biology, natural language processing, information retrieval/extraction, and optical character recognition. Experiments from various domains involving different types of output spaces emphasize the breadth and generality of our approach."

Although binary codes are motivated by their use as direct indices (addresses) into a hash table, codes longer than 32 bits are not being used in this way, as it was thought to be ineffective. We introduce a rigorous way to build multiple hash tables on binary code substrings that enables exact K-nearest neighbor search in Hamming space. The algorithm is straightforward to implement, storage efficient, and it has sub-linear run-time behavior for uniformly distributed codes. Empirical results show dramatic speed-ups over a linear scan baseline and for datasets with up to one billion items, 64- or 128-bit codes, and search radii up to 25 bits."

Exploiting prior knowledge may be useful to reproduce the human capability of recognizing objects even from only one single view. This paper presents an SVM-based model adaptation algorithm able to select and weight appropriately prior knowledge coming from different categories. The method relies on the solution of a convex optimization problem which ensures to have the minimal leave-one-out error on the training set. Experiments on a subset of the Caltech-256 database show that the proposed method produces better results than both choosing one single prior model, and transferring from all previous experience in a flat uninformative way."
