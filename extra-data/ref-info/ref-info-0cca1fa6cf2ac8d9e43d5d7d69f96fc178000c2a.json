Computational studies of this capacity have established that 3-D shape can be extracted correctly from a brief presentation, provided the moving objects are rigid. The human visual system requires a longer temporal extension, but it can cope with considerable deviations from rigidity. It is shown how the 3-D structure of rigid as well as nonrigid objects can be recovered by maintaining an internal model of the viewed object and modifying it at each instant by the minimal nonrigid change that is sufficient to account for the observed transformation. The results of applying this incremental rigidity scheme to rigid and nonrigid objects in motion are described and compared with human perception."

The class of solutions treated in this paper is quite different from the usual treatment in that the rigidity condition is relaxed so as to include the important class of bending deformations. For instance, we show a case in which important aspects of shape are obtained for a configuration of seven points, no four of which move in a rigid way, and which can be obtained from only two views. (This violates all requirements of the structure from motion theorem.) We discuss an algorithm that obtains the three-dimensional configuration of a polyhedral vertex up to a relief transformation (a similar transformation to the one that maps object to image space in paraxial optics), in the presence of arbitrary flections of the edges, from the projection and the instantaneous-movement parallax. Such a solution can, for instance, be used to predict side views of the vertex, as is demonstrated for a specific example. The solution can be used in an iterative fashion on triangulations to solve the case of extended curved surfaces suffering arbitrary bendings. The class of bending deformations encompasses all deformations that conserve distances along the surface (but not necessarily through space); thus stretchings are excluded. Practical examples include, e.g., deformations of flexible but nonstretchable shells. Actual numerical examples illustrate the practicability of the method."

The solutions for recovering rigid structure from motion have a reflection ambiguity; the depth scale of the stereoscopic solution will not be known unless the fixation distance is specified in units of interpupil separation. (Hence the configuration will appear distorted.) However, the correct configuration and disposition of a rigid 3D shape can be recovered if stereopsis and motion are integrated, for then a unique solution follows from a set of linear equations.

The chief result is that the normal vector of an arbitrarily deformed smooth surface can be calculated directly from the surface normal vector of the undeformed surface and a transformation matrix. Deformations are easily combined in a hierarchical structure, creating complex objects from simpler ones. The position vectors and normal vectors in the simpler objects are used to calculate the position and normal vectors in the more complex forms; each level in the deformation hierarchy requires an additional matrix multiply for the normal vector calculation. Deformations are important and highly intuitive operations which ease the control and rendering of large families of three-dimensional geometric shapes."

We employ elasticity theory to construct differential equations that model the behavior of non-rigid curves, surfaces, and solids as a function of time. Elastically deformable models are active: they respond in a natural way to applied forces, constraints, ambient media, and impenetrable obstacles. The models are fundamentally dynamic and realistic animation is created by numerically solving their underlying differential equations. Thus, the description of shape and the description of motion are unified."

It is well known that if a static scene is viewed by an observer undergoing a known relative translation through space, then the distance to objects in the scene can be easily obtained from the measured image velocities associated with features on the objects (i.e., motion stereo). But in general, individual objects are translating and rotating at unknown rates with respect to a moving observer whose own motion may not be accurately monitored. The net effect is a complicated image flow field in which absolute range information is lost. However, if a second image flow field is produced by a camera whose motion through space differs from that of the first camera by a known amount, the range information can be recovered by subtracting the first image flow from the second. This ``difference flow'' must then be corrected for the known relative rotation between the two cameras, resulting in a divergent relative flow from a known focus of expansion. This passive ranging process may be termed Dynamic Stereo, the known difference in camera motions playing the role of the stereo baseline. We present the basic theory of this ranging process, along with some examples for simulated scenes."

Construction of the structural description of a 3-D object is composed of two stages: (i) The visible surface orientation and partial structure are first inferred from a set of single views, and (ii) the partial surface structures inferred from different viewpoints are integrated to complete the 3-D structural description of the object. In the first stage, an active stripe coding technique is used which projects spatially modulated patterns to encode the objects surfaces for analysis. The visible surface orientation is inferred using a constraint satisfaction process based upon the observed orientation of the projected patterns. The visible surface structure is recovered through integrating a dense orientation map. In the second stage, an iterative construction/refinement scheme is used which exploits both passive and active sensing for representing the object surfaces. The bounding volume description of the object is first constructed using multiple occluding contours which are acquired through passive sensing. The bounding volume is then refined using the partial surface structures inferred from active sensing. The final surface structure is recorded in a memory efficient data structure where the surface contours in a set of parallel planar cross sections are recorded. We expect this approach to be widely applicable in the field of robotics, geometric modeling and factory automation."

Therefore, implicit in the perceptual analysis of occluding contour must lie various assumptions about the viewed surfaces. The assumptions that seem most natural are (a) that the distinction between convex and concave segments reflects real properties of the viewed surface; and (b) that contiguous portions of contour arise from contiguous parts of the viewed surface \u2013 i. e. there are no invisible obscuring edges. It is proved that, for smooth surfaces, these assumptions are essentially equivalent to assuming that the viewed surface is a generalized cone. Methods are defined for finding the axis of such a cone, and for segmenting a surface constructed of several cones into its components, whose axes can then be found separately. These methods provide one link between an uninterpreted figure extracted from an image, and the 3-D representation theory of Marr & Nishihara (1977)."

Through regularization, they may be reformulated as well-posed variational principles whose solutions are computable. Standard regularization theory employs quadratic stabilizing functionals that impose global smoothness constraints on possible solutions. Discontinuities present serious difficulties to standard regularization, however, since their reconstruction requires a precise spatial control over the smoothing properties of stabilizers. This paper proposes a general class of controlled-continuity stabilizers which provide the necessary control over smoothness. These nonquadratic stabilizing functionals comprise multiple generalized spline kernels combined with (noncontinuous) continuity control functions. In the context of computational vision, they may be thought of as controlled-continuity constraints. These generic constraints are applicable to visual reconstruction problems that involve both continuous regions and discontinuities, for which global smoothness constraints fail."

For this representation to be useful it must be possible to recover such descriptions from image data; we show that the primitive elements of this representation may be recovered in an overconstrained and therefore potentially reliable manner."

We propose a modeling system for generic objects to recognize different objects from the same category with only one generic model. We base our design of the modeling system upon the current psychological theories of categorization and human visual perception. The representation consists of a prototype represented by parts and their configuration. Parts are modeled by superquadric volumetric primitives which can be combined via Boolean operations to form objects. Variations between objects within a category are described by changes in structure and shape deformations of prototypical parts. Recovery of deformed supequadric models from sparse 3-D points is developed and some results are shown."

It is argued that vision is the construction of efficient symbolic descriptions from images of the world. An important aspect of vision is therefore the choice of representations for the different kinds of information in a visual scene. An overall framework is suggested for extracting shape information from images, in which the analysis proceeds through three representations: (1) the primal sketch, which makes explicit the intensity changes and local two-dimensional geometry of an image; (2) the 2 1/2-D sketch, which is a viewer-centred representation of the depth, orientation and discontinuities of the visible surfaces; and (3) the 3-D model representation, which allows an object-centred description of the three-dimensional structure and organization of a viewed shape. The critical act in formulating computational theories for processes capable of constructing these representations is the discovery of valid constraints on the way the world behaves, that provide sufficient additional information to allow recovery of the desired characteristic. Finally, once a computational theory for a process has been formulated, algorithms for implementing it may be designed, and their performance compared with that of the human visual processor."

In this paper, we apply this approach to the problem of representing three-dimensional shapes for the purpose of recognition. 1. Three criteria, accessibility, scope and uniqueness, and stability and sensitivity, are presented for judging the usefulness of a representation for shape recognition. 2. Three aspects of a representation\u2019s design are considered, (i) the representation\u2019s coordinate system, (ii) its primitives, which are the primary units of shape information used in the representation, and (iii) the organization the representation imposes on the information in its descriptions. 3. In terms of these design issues and the criteria presented, a shape representation for recognition should: (i) use an object-centred coordinate system, (ii) include volumetric primitives of varied sizes, and (iii) have a modular organization. A representation based on a shape\u2019s natural axes (for example the axes identified by a stick figure) follows directly from these choices. 4. The basic process for deriving a shape description in this representation must involve: (i) a means for identifying the natural axes of a shape in its image and (ii) a mechanism for transforming viewer-centred axis specifications to specifications in an object-centred coordinate system. 5. Shape recognition involves: (i) a collection of stored shape descriptions, and (ii) various indexes into the collection that allow a newly derived description to be associated with an appropriate stored description. The most important of these indexes allows shape recognition to proceed conservatively from the general to the specific based on the specificity of the information available from the image. 6. New constraints supplied by a conservative recognition process can be used to extract more information from the image. A relaxation process for carrying out this constraint analysis is described."

We describe a \"parts\" representation that is fairly general purpose, despite having only a small number of parameters. Having this expressive power captured by a small number of parameters allows us to approach the problem of recovering an object's part structure by use of minimal length encoding. We present several examples of recovering part structure using various types of range imagery to show that the recovery procedure is robust."
