Depending on the class of a document, information to be extracted may be defined in advance in syntactic structures as well as in semantic structures. In this paper we present a system for detecting such information and transforming it into a semantic representation. The basic component is a pattern matcher which incorporates geometric positions to detect phrases in the document. By defining a Levenshtein distance, the component reacts more generously in order to be error tolerant against OCR failures."

We focus on extracting some of the important layout elements by using flexible matching strategy and easy model generation. Our proposed approach treats each extracted element as it were independent. Some segmented areas like \"title\" or \"author\" are defined locally making the system robust, able to withstand shifting and noise. The system is also easy to operate. Since the system is not full automatic, we need to supply typical models of each component. Our GUI presents the attributes of each segmented area as well as the original bit map images. The color-coded attributes help us to easily edit the extracted component. In experiments with 288 pages of test images, the proposed method is shown to be 95.6% correct for a wide range of documents. By using 145 pages of documents as a learning set, the system recognized 99.2% of feature sets from 148 various types of unknown documents."

                "text": "Many approaches have reported that knowledge-based layout recognition methods are very successful in classifying the meaningful data from document images automatically. However, these approaches are applicable to only the same kind of documents because they are based on the paradigm that specifies the structure definition information in advance so as to be able to analyze a particular class of documents intelligently. In this paper, the authors propose a method to recognize the layout structures of multi-kinds of table-form document images. For this purpose, the authors introduce a classification tree to manage the relationships among different classes of layout structures. The authors' recognition system has two modes: layout knowledge acquisition and layout structure recognition. In the layout knowledge acquisition mode, table-form document images are distinguished according to this. Classification tree and then the structure description trees which specify the logical structures of table-form documents are generated automatically. While, in the layout structure recognition mode, individual item fields in the table-form document images are extracted and classified successfully by searching the classification tree and interpreting the structure description tree. >"

Background regions can be extracted independently of line width or length, and multi-layer analysis employing a series of coarse-to-fine background images makes it possible to extract background regions regardless of small line-breaks. We propose two multi-layer analysis algorithms for different situations. One is applied in a registration process of a form model. It reliably extracts box regions from un-filled forms without using any model. The other is applied in a character extraction process. By using a spatial model of a form, it reliably extracts background regions, and re-integrates these regions if they are divided by characters written in the boxes. From these re-integrated regions, the exact locations of the character boxes are determined on the input image. Besides these algorithms, we present a form identification method that uses coarse background images. We implemented the algorithms into a prototype system that processes pre-printed forms. 50 types of existing forms were tested without any customization. Model registration, character extraction, and form identification were reliably carried out."
