Since the appearance of 3D texture depends on the illumination and viewing direction in a complicated manner, such image texture can be called a bidirectional texture function. A fundamental representation of image texture is the histogram of pixel intensities. Since the histogram of 3D texture also depends on the illumination and viewing directions in a complex fashion, we refer to it as a bidirectional histogram. In this work, we present a concise analytical model for the bidirectional histogram of Lambertian, isotropic, randomly rough surfaces, which are common in real-world scenes. We demonstrate the accuracy of the histogram model by fitting to several samples from the Columbia-Utrecht texture database. The parameters obtained from the model fits are roughness measures which can be used in texture recognition schemes. In addition, the model has potential application in estimating illumination direction in scenes where surfaces of known tilt and roughness are visible. We demonstrate the usefulness of our model by employing it in a novel 3D texture synthesis procedure."

We introduce the dimensionality surface as a representation for the visual complexity of a material sample. The dimensionality surface defines the number of basis textures that are required to represent the observed textures for a sample as a function of ranges of illumination and viewing angles. Basis textures are represented using multiband correlation functions that consider both within and between color band correlations. We examine properties of the dimensionality surface for real materials using the Columbia Utrecht Reflectance and Texture (CUReT) database. The analysis shows that the dependence of the dimensionality surface on ranges of illumination and viewing angles is approximately linear with a slope that depends on the complexity of the sample. We extend the analysis to consider the problem of recognizing rough surfaces in color images obtained under unknown illumination and viewing geometry. We show, using a set of 12,505 images from 61 material samples, that the information captured by the multiband correlation model allows surfaces to be recognized over a wide range of conditions. We also show that the use of color information provides significant advantages for three-dimensional texture recognition."

While texture is always associated with a form of repetition in the image, the repeating quantity may vary. The texture may be a color or albedo variation as in a checkerboard, a paisley print or zebra stripes. Very often in real-world scenes, texture is instead due to a surface height variation, e.g. pebbles, gravel, foliage and any rough surface. Such surfaces are referred to here as 3D textured surfaces. Standard texture recognition algorithms are not appropriate for 3D textured surfaces because the appearance of these surfaces changes in a complex manner with viewing direction and illumination direction. Recent methods have been developed for recognition of 3D textured surfaces using a database of surfaces observed under varied imaging parameters. One of these methods is based on 3D textons obtained using K-means clustering of multiscale feature vectors. Another method uses eigen-analysis originally developed for appearance-based object recognition. In this work we develop a hybrid approach that employs both feature grouping and dimensionality reduction. The method is tested using the Columbia-Utrecht texture database and provides excellent recognition rates. The method is compared with existing recognition methods for 3D textured surfaces. A direct comparison is facilitated by empirical recognition rates from the same texture data set. The current method has key advantages over existing methods including requiring less prior information on both the training and novel images."

While shape is a deterministic macroscopic description, texture is a finer scale geometric description with some repetitive or random component. The distinction between texture and shape is important when developing object recognition systems. Acquiring fine scale geometry is difficult due to local occlusions and limited resolution of imaging systems. Also, the complexities in geometric detail make geometric modeling of texture particularly challenging. Consequently, appearance is a convenient description for surfaces. A useful integration may entail geometry-based recognition for shape and appearance-based recognition for surface detail. We discuss our work on investigating and modeling surface detail using the framework of the BRDF (bidirectional reflectance distribution function) and the BTF (bidirectional texture function)."

Such natural textures arise from spatial variation of two surface attributes: (1) reflectance and (2) surface normal. In this paper, we provide a unified model to address both these aspects of natural texture. The main idea is to construct a vocabulary of prototype tiny surface patches with associated local geometric and photometric properties. We call these 3D textons. Examples might be ridges, grooves, spots or stripes or combinations thereof Associated with each texton is an appearance vector, which characterizes the local irradiance distribution, represented as a set of linear Gaussian derivative filter outputs, under different lighting and viewing conditions. Given a large collection of images of different materials, a clustering approach is used to acquire a small (on the order of 100) 3D texton vocabulary. Given a few (1 to 4) images of any material, it can be characterized using these textons. We demonstrate the application of this representation for recognition of the material viewed under novel lighting and viewing conditions."

Each object is represented as a continuous appearance manifold in a low-dimensional subspace parametrized by object pose and illumination direction. Here, the structural properties of appearance manifolds are analyzed with the aim of making appearance representation efficient in off-line computation, storage requirements, and online recognition time. In particular, the effect of illumination on the structure of the appearance manifold is studied. It is shown that for an ideal diffused surface of arbitrary texture, the appearance manifold is linear and three dimensional. This enables the construction of the entire illumination manifold from just three images of the object taken using linearly independent light sources. This result is shown to hold even for illumination by multiple light sources and for concave surfaces that exhibit inter-reflections. Finally, a simple but efficient algorithm is presented that uses just three manifold points for recognizing images taken under novel illuminations."
