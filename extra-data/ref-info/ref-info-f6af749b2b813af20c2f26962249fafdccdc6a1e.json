Recent e orts at our lab are aimed at providing such multimodal capabilities for human-machine communication as well by introducing gesture, character and speech recognition, eye-tracking and lipreading. Most of the visual modalities require a stable image of a speaker's face. In this technical report a connectionist face tracker is proposed that manipulates camera orientation and zoom, to keep a person's face located at all times in an image sequence. The system operates in real time and can adapt rapidly to di erent lighting conditions, di erent cameras and faces, making it robust against environmental variability. Extensions and integration of the system with a multimodal interface will be presented."

The computational approach taken in this system is motivated by both physiology and information theory, as well as by the practical requirements of near-real-time performance and accuracy. Our approach treats the face recognition problem as an intrinsically two-dimensional (2-D) recognition problem rather than requiring recovery of three-dimensional geometry, taking advantage of the fact that faces are normally upright and thus may be described by a small set of 2-D characteristic views. The system functions by projecting face images onto a feature space that spans the significant variations among known face images. The significant features are known as \"eigenfaces,\" because they are the eigenvectors (principal components) of the set of faces; they do not necessarily correspond to features such as eyes, ears, and noses. The projection operation characterizes an individual face by a weighted sum of the eigenface features, and so to recognize a particular face it is necessary only to compare these weights to those of known individuals. Some particular advantages of our approach are that it provides for the ability to learn and later recognize new faces in an unsupervised manner, and that it is easy to implement using a neural network architecture."

The mixture-distance technique we introduce achieves a recognition rate of 95% on a database of 685 people in which each face is represented by 30 measured distances. This is currently the best recorded recognition rate for a feature-based system applied to a database of this size. By comparison, nearest neighbor search using Euclidean distance yields 84%. In our work a novel distance function is constructed based on local second order statistics as estimated by modeling the training data as a mixture of normal densities. We report on the results from mixtures of several sizes. We demonstrate that a flat mixture of mixtures performs as well as the best model and therefore represents an effective solution to the model selection problem. A mixture perspective is also taken for individual Gaussians to choose between first order (variance) and second order (covariance) models. Here an approximation to flat combination is proposed and seen to perform well in practice. Our results demonstrate that even in the absence of multiple training examples for each class, it is sometimes possible to infer from a statistical model of training data, a significantly improved distance function for use in pattern recognition."

The saliency map indicates which regions of the input retina are important for performing the task. The saliency map is created through predictive auto-encoding. The performance of this method is demonstrated on two simple tasks which have multiple very strong distracting features in the input retina. Architectural extensions and application directions for this model are presented."

As a recognition task, the speaker-dependent recognition of the phonemes B, D, and G in varying phonetic contexts was chosen. For comparison, several discrete hidden Markov models (HMM) were trained to perform the same task. Performance evaluation over 1946 testing tokens from three speakers showed that the TDNN achieves a recognition rate of 98.5% correct while the rate obtained by the best of the HMMs was only 93.7%. >"

In this study, an abstraction of the basic genetic algorithm, the Equilibrium Genetic Algorithm (EGA), and the GA in turn, are reconsidered within the framework of competitive learning. This new perspective reveals a number of different possibilities for performance improvements. This paper explores population-based incremental learning (PBIL), a method of combining the mechanisms of a generational genetic algorithm with simple competitive learning. The combination of these two methods reveals a tool which is far simpler than a GA, and which out-performs a GA on large set of optimization problems in terms of both speed and accuracy. This paper presents an empirical analysis of where the proposed technique will outperform genetic algorithms, and describes a class of problems in which a genetic algorithm may be able to perform better. Extensions to this algorithm are discussed and analyzed. PBIL and extensions are compared with a standard GA on twelve problems, including standard numerical optimization functions, traditional GA test suite problems, and NP-Complete problems."

Pol and Gasparini (2009) matrix was composed of characters developed from other authors, e.g., Clark (1994). Furthermore, Clark (2011) expanded on Pol and Gasparini (2009) matrix with four additional characters (258\u2013262). This study further expands on this matrix with the addition of 1 character (char. 263) describing the position of the choana relative to the suborbital fenestra, and the connection between choana and palatal fenestra. Also, characters 258 and 200 were amended to include more specific information concerning the palatines contact with other elements, size and sculpturing. Characters 1, 3, 6, 23, 32, 37, 43, 45, 49, 65, 67, 69, 73, 77, 79, 86, 90, 91, 96, 97, 104, 105, 106, 108, 126, 142, 143, 149, 167, 182, 197, 226 were ordered (marked with a \u201c+\u201d)."
