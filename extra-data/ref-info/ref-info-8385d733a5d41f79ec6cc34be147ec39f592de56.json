The representation gives a qualitative description of the image structure that allows for detection of stable scales and regions of interest in a solely bottom-up data-driven way. In other words, it generates coarse segmentation cues and can be hence seen as preceding further processing, which can then be properly tuned. The authors argue that once such information is available many other processing tasks can become much simpler. Experiments on real imagery demonstrate that the proposed theory gives perceptually intuitive results.<<ETX>>"

                "text": "An introduction is given to a theory of early visual information processing. The theory has been implemented, and examples are given of images at various stages of analysis. It is argued that the first step of consequence is to compute a primitive but rich description of the grey-level changes present in an image. The description is expressed in a vocabulary of kinds of intensity change (EDGE, SHADING-EDGE, EXTENDED-EDGE, LINE, BLOB etc.). Modifying parameters are bound to the elements in the description, specifying their POSITION, ORIENTATION, TERMINATION points, CONTRAST, SIZE and FUZZINESS. This description is obtained from the intensity array by fixed techniques, and it is called the primal sketch. For most images, the primal sketch is large and unwieldy. The second important step in visual information processing is to group its contents in a way that is appropriate for later recognition. From our ability to interpret drawings with little semantic content, one may infer the presence in our perceptual equipment of symbolic processes that can define \"place-tokens\" in an image in various ways, and can group them according to certain rules. Homomorphic techniques fail to account for many of these grouping phenomena, whose explanations require mechanisms of construction rather than mechanisms of detection. The necessary grouping of elements in the primal sketch may be achieved by a mechanism that has available the processes inferred from above, together with the ability to select items by first order discriminations acting on the elements' parameters. Only occasionally do these mechanisms use downward-flowing information about the contents of the particular image being processed. It is argued that \"non-attentive\" vision is in practice implemented by these grouping operations and first order discriminations acting on the primal sketch. The class of computations so obtained differs slightly from the class of second order operations on the intensity array. The extraction of a form from the primal sketch using these techniques amounts to the separation of figure from ground. It is concluded that most of the separation can be carried out by using techniques that do not depend upon the particular image in question. Therefore, figure-ground separation can normally precede the description of the shape of the extracted form. Up to this point, higher-level knowledge and purpose are brought to bear on only a few of the decisions taken during the processing. This relegates the widespread use of downward-flowing information to a later stage than is found in current machine-vision programs, and implies that such knowledge should influence the control of, rather than interfering with, the actual data-processing that is taking place lower down."

The algorithm creates a tree structure for image description by defining a linking relationship between pixels in successively blurred versions of the initial image. The image is described in terms of nested light and dark regions. This algorithm, successfully implemented in one, two, and three dimensions, can theoretically work with any number of dimensions. The interactive postprocessing developed technique selects regions from the descriptive tree for display in several ways: pointing to a branch of the image description tree, specifying by sliders the range of scale and/or intensity of all regions which should be displayed, and pointing (on the original image) to any pixel in the desired region. The algorithm has been applied to approximately 15 computer tomography (CT) images of the abdomen. >"

We show that ``edge focusing'', i.e., a coarse-to-fine tracking in a continuous manner, combines high positional accuracy with good noise-reduction. This is of vital interest in several applications. Junctions of different kinds are in this way restored with high precision, which is a basic requirement when performing (projective) geometric analysis of an image for the purpose of restoring the three-dimensional scene. Segmentation of a scene using geometric clues like parallelism, etc., is also facilitated by the algorithm, since unnecessary detail has been filtered away. There are indications that an extension of the focusing algorithm can classify edges, to some extent, into the categories diffuse and nondiffuse (for example diffuse illumination edges). The edge focusing algorithm contains two parameters, namely the coarseness of the resolution in the blurred image from where we start the focusing procedure, and a threshold on the gradient magnitude at this coarse level. The latter parameter seems less critical for the behavior of the algorithm and is not present in the focusing part, i.e., at finer resolutions. The step length of the scale parameter in the focusing scheme has been chosen so that edge elements do not move more than one pixel per focusing step."

A number of components of this model are developed in further detail and implemented as computer algorithms. At the highest level, a verification process has been developed which can determine exact values of viewpoint and object parameters from hypothesized matches between three-dimensional object features and two-dimensional image features. This provides a reliable quantitative procedure for evaluating the correctness of an interpretation, even in the presence of noise or occlusion. Given a reliable method for final evaluation of correspondence, the remaining components of the system are aimed at reducing the size of the search space which must be covered. Unlike many previous approaches, this recognition process does not assume that it is possible to directly derive depth information from the image. Instead, the primary descriptive component is a process of perceptual organization, in which spatial relations are detected directly among two-dimensional image features. A basic requirement of the recognition process is that perceptual organization should accurately distinguish meaningful groupings from those which arise by accident of viewpoint or position. This requirement is used to derive a number of further constraints which must be satisfied by algorithms for perceptual grouping. A specific algorithm is presented for the problem of segmenting curves into natural descriptions. Methods are also presented for using the viewpoint-invariance properties of the perceptual groupings to infer three-dimensional relations directly from the image. The search process itself is described, both for covering the range of possible viewpoints and the range of possible objects. A method is presented for using evidential reasoning to combine information from multiple sources to determine the most efficient ordering for the search. This use of evidential reasoning allows a system to automatically improve its performance as it gains visual experience. In summary, spatial organization and recognition are shown to be a practical basis for current systems and to provide a promising path for further development of improved visual capabilities."

The goal is to relate the results of this analysis to the structure of the picture, which is determined by the physics of the image generation process. Candidates for contour points are the maximal magnitudes of the gray-value gradient for different scales in the direction of the gradient. Based on the output of such a bank of gradient filters, a procedure is proposed to select automatically a suitable scale, and with that, the size of the right convolution kernel. The application of poorly adapted filters, which make the exact localization of gray-value corners or T-, X-, and Y-junctions more difficult, is thus avoided. Possible gaps at such junctions are discussed for images of real scenes, and possibilities for the closure of some of these gaps are demonstrated when the extrema of the magnitudes of the gray-value gradients are used. >"

                "text": "In practice the relevant details of images exist only over a restricted range of scale. Hence it is important to study the dependence of image structure on the level of resolution. It seems clear enough that visual perception treats images on several levels of resolution simultaneously and that this fact must be important for the study of perception. However, no applicable mathematically formulated theory to deal with such problems appers to exist. In this paper it is shown that any image can be embedded in a one-parameter family of derived images (with resolution as the parameter) in essentially only one unique way if the constraint that no spurious detail should be generated when the resolution is diminished, is applied. The structure of this family is governed by the well known diffusion equation (a parabolic, linear, partial differential equation of the second order). As such the structure fits into existing theories that treat the front end of the visual system as a continuous tack of homogeneous layer, characterized by iterated local processing schemes. When resolution is decreased the images becomes less articulated because the extrem (\u201clight and dark blobs\u201d) disappear one after the other. This erosion of structure is a simple process that is similar in every case. As a result any image can be described as a juxtaposed and nested set of light and dark blobs, wherein each blod has a limited range of resolution in which it manifests itself. The structure of the family of derived images permits a derivation of the sampling density required to sample the image at multiple scales of resolution. The natural scale along the resolution axis (leading to an informationally uniform sampling density) is logarithmic, thus the structure is apt for the description of size invariances."

                "text": "This thesis, within the subfield of computer science known as computer vision, deals with the use of scale-space analysis in early low-level processing of visual information. The main contributions comprise the following five subjects: The formulation of a scale-space theory for discrete signals. Previously, the scale-space concept has been expressed for continuous signals only. We propose that the canonical way to construct a scale-space for discrete signals is by convolution with a kernel called the discrete analogue of the Gaussian kernel, or equivalently by solving a semi-discretized version of the diffusion equation. Both the one-dimensional and two-dimensional cases are covered. An extensive analysis of discrete smoothing kernels is carried out for one-dimensional signals and the discrete scale-space properties of the most common discretizations to the continuous theory are analysed. A representation, called the scale-space primal sketch, which gives a formal description of the hierarchical relations between structures at different levels of scale. It is aimed at making information in the scale-space representation explicit. We give a theory for its construction and an algorithm for computing it. A theory for extracting significant image structures and determining the scales of these structures from this representation in a solely bottom-up data-driven way. Examples demonstrating how such qualitative information extracted from the scale-space primal sketch can be used for guiding and simplifying other early visual processes. Applications are given to edge detection, histogram analysis and classification based on local features. Among other possible applications one can mention perceptual grouping, texture analysis, stereo matching, model matching and motion. A detailed theoretical analysis of the evolution properties of critical points and blobs in scale-space, comprising drift velocity estimates under scale-space smoothing, a classification of the possible types of generic events at bifurcation situations and estimates of how the number of local extrema in a signal can be expected to decrease as function of the scale parameter. For two-dimensional signals the generic bifurcation events are annihilations and creations of extremum-saddle point pairs. Interpreted in terms of blobs, these transitions correspond to annihilations, merges, splits and creations. Experiments on different types of real imagery demonstrate that the proposed theory gives perceptually intuitive results."

The need for two scale parameters is emphasized: a local scale, for describing the amount of smoothing used for suppressing noise and irrelevant details when computing primitive texture descriptors from image data; and an integration scale, for describing the size of the region in space over which the statistics of the local descriptors is accummulated. The proposed computational model is expressed completely in terms of different invariants defined from Gaussian derivatives at multiple scales in scale-space. The resulting texture description can be combined with various assumptions about surface texture to estimate local surface orientation. Two specific assumptions, weak isotropy and constant area, are explored in more detail. Results from experiments on real and synthetic reference data with known geometry that demonstrate the viability of the approach are presented.<<ETX>>"

These features, called \u201ctextons\u201d, are elongated blobs (e.g., rectangles, ellipses, or line segments) with specific properties, including color, angular orientation, width, length, binocular and movement disparity, and flicker rate. The ends-of-lines (terminators) and crossings of line segments are also textons. Only differences in the textons or in their density (or number) can be preattentively detected while the positional relationship between neighboring textons passes unnoticed. This kind of positional information is the essence of form perception, and can be extracted only by a time-consuming and spatially restricted process that we call \u201cfocal attention\u201d. The aperture of focal attention can be very narrow, even restricted to a minute portion of the fovea, and shifting its locus requires about 50 ms. Thus preattentive vision serves as an \u201cearly warning system\u201d by pointing out those loci of texton differences that should be attended to. According to this theory, at any given instant the visual information intake is relatively modest."

This paper introduces a new tool for dealing with this problem. A heuristic principle is proposed stating that local extrema over scales of di erent combinations of normalized scale invariant derivatives are likely candidates to correspond to interesting structures. Support is given by theoretical considerations and experiments on real and synthetic data. The resulting methodology lends itself naturally to two-stage algorithms; feature detection at coarse scales followed by feature localization at ner scales. Experiments on blob detection, junction detection and edge detection demonstrate that the proposed method gives intuitively reasonable results."

This paper introduces a new tool for dealing with this problem. A heuristic principle is proposed stating that local extrema over scales of diierent combinations of normalized scale invariant derivatives are likely candidates to correspond to interesting structures. Support is given by theoretical considerations and experiments on real and synthetic data. The resulting methodology lends itself naturally to two-stage algorithms; feature detection at coarse scales followed by feature localization at ner scales. Experiments on blob detection, junction detection and edge detection demonstrate that the proposed method gives intuitively reasonable results."

Starting from a set of natural requirements on the first processing stages of a visual system,the visual front end, it gives an axiomatic derivation of how a multiscale representation of derivative approximations can be constructed from a discrete signal, so that it possesses analgebraic structure similar to that possessed by the derivatives of the traditional scale-space representation in the continuous domain. A family of kernels is derived that constitutediscrete analogues to the continuous Gaussian derivatives.The representation has theoretical advantages over other discretizations of the scale-space theory in the sense that operators that commute before discretizationcommute after discretization. Some computational implications of this are that derivative approximations can be computeddirectly from smoothed data and that this will giveexactly the same result as convolution with the corresponding derivative approximation kernel. Moreover, a number ofnormalization conditions are automatically satisfied.The proposed methodology leads to a scheme of computations of multiscale low-level feature extraction that is conceptually very simple and consists of four basic steps: (i)large support convolution smoothing, (ii)small support difference computations, (iii)point operations for computing differential geometric entities, and (iv)nearest-neighbour operations for feature detection.Applications demonstrate how the proposed scheme can be used for edge detection and junction detection based on derivatives up to order three."

This representation is constructed by detecting peaks and ridges in the difference of lowpass (DOLP) transform. Descriptions of shapes which are encoded in this representation may be matched efficiently despite changes in size, orientation, or position. Motivations for a multiple resolution representation are presented first, followed by the definition of the DOLP transform. Techniques are then presented for encoding a symbolic structural description of forms from the DOLP transform. This process involves detecting local peaks and ridges in each bandpass image and in the entire three-dimensional space defined by the DOLP transform. Linking adjacent peaks in different bandpass images gives a multiple resolution tree which describes shape. Peaks which are local maxima in this tree provide landmarks for aligning, manipulating, and matching shapes. Detecting and linking the ridges in each DOLP bandpass image provides a graph which links peaks within a shape in a bandpass image and describes the positions of the boundaries of the shape at multiple resolutions. Detecting and linking the ridges in the DOLP three-space describes elongated forms and links the largest peaks in the tree. The principles for determining the correspondence between symbols in pairs of such descriptions are then described. Such correspondence matching is shown to be simplified by using the correspondence at lower resolutions to constrain the possible correspondence at higher resolutions."

The success of the approach depends on the definition of a comprehensive set of goals for the computation of edge points. These goals must be precise enough to delimit the desired behavior of the detector while making minimal assumptions about the form of the solution. We define detection and localization criteria for a class of edges, and present mathematical forms for these criteria as functionals on the operator impulse response. A third criterion is then added to ensure that the detector has only one response to a single edge. We use the criteria in numerical optimization to derive detectors for several common image features, including step edges. On specializing the analysis to step edges, we find that there is a natural uncertainty principle between detection and localization performance, which are the two main goals. With this principle we derive a single operator shape which is optimal at any scale. The optimal detector has a simple approximate implementation in which edges are marked at maxima in gradient magnitude of a Gaussian-smoothed image. We extend this simple detector using operators of several widths to cope with different signal-to-noise ratios in the image. We present a general method, called feature synthesis, for the fine-to-coarse integration of information from operators at different scales. Finally we show that step edge detector performance improves considerably as the operator point spread function is extended along the edge."

A number of necessary criteria are imposed on any candidate solution method. Path-based Gaussian smoothing techniques are applied to the curve to find zeros of curvature at varying levels of detail. The result is the ``generalized scale space'' image of a planar curve which is invariant under rotation, uniform scaling and translation of the curve. These properties make the scale space image suitable for matching. The matching algorithm is a modification of the uniform cost algorithm and finds the lowest cost match of contours in the scale space images. It is argued that this is preferable to matching in a so-called stable scale of the curve because no such scale may exist for a given curve. This technique is applied to register a Landsat satellite image of the Strait of Georgia, B.C. (manually corrected for skew) to a map containing the shorelines of an overlapping area."

Each picture element is independently classified and assigned a unique descriptive label, invariant under monotonically increasing gray tone transformations from the set (peak, pit, ridge, ravine, saddle, flat, and hillside), with hillside having subcategories (inflection point, slope, convex hill, concave hill, and saddle hill). The topographic classification is based on the first and second directional derivatives of the estimated image- intensity surface. A local, facet model, two-dimensional, cubic polynomial fit is done to estimate the image-intensity surface. Zero-crossings of the first directional derivative are identified as locations of interest in the image."

                "text": "In this paper, we study the problem of interpreting line drawings of scenes composed of opaque regular solid objects bounded by piecewise smooth surfaces with no markings or texture on them. It is assumed that the line drawing has been formed by orthographic projection of such a scene under general viewpoint, that the line drawing is error free, and that there are no lines due to shadows or specularities. Our definition implicitly excludes laminae, wires, and the apices of cones.A major component of the interpretation of line drawings is line labelling. By line labelling we mean (a) classification of each image curve as corresponding to either a depth or orientation discontinuity in the scene, and (b) further subclassification of each kind of discontinuity. For a depth discontinuity we determine whether it is a limb\u2014a locus of points on the surface where the line of sight is tangent to the surface\u2014or an occluding edge\u2014a tangent plane discontinuity of the surface. For an orientation discontinuity, we determine whether it corresponds to a convex or concave edge. This paper presents the first mathematically rigorous scheme for labelling line drawings of the class of scenes described. Previous schemes for labelling line drawings of scenes containing curved objects were heuristic, incomplete, and lacked proper mathematical justification.By analyzing the projection of the neighborhoods of different kinds of points on a piecewise smooth surface, we are able to catalog all local labelling possibilities for the different types of junctions in a line drawing. An algorithm is developed which utilizes this catalog to determine all legal labellings of the line drawing. A local minimum complexity rule\u2014at each vertex select those labellings which correspond to the minimum number of faces meeting at the vertex\u2014is used in order to prune highly counter-intuitive interpretations. The labelling scheme was implemented and tested on a number of line drawings. The labellings obtained are few and by and large in accordance with human interpretations."

This technique is applied to register a Landsat aerial image of an area (corrected for skew) to a map containing the shorelines of the same area. The shorelines are extracted from the Landsat image by forming a histogram of the gray-level distribution of pixels in the image and finding the land and water peaks in that histogram. The value at the trough between the two peaks is then used to threshold the image. Contours of dark regions in the resulting binary image are taken to be the shorelines. The Uniform Cost algorithm is used to find the least cost matches of the \"scale-space images\" of shorelines extracted from the Landsat image and those in the map giving priority to matches at higher levels of scale. A subset of those matches which are consistent are chosen to estimate the parameters of an affine transformation from the image to the map using a least squares method."

The technique involves generating a multiscale description of a histogram by convolving it with a series of Gaussians of gradually increasing width (standard deviation), and marking the location and direction of the sign change of zero-crossings in the second derivative. The resulting description, or fingerprint, is interpreted by relating pairs of zero-crossings to modes in the histogram where each mode or component is modeled by a normal distribution. Zero-crossings provide information from which estimates of the mixture parameters are computed. These initial estimates are subsequently refined using an iterative maximum likelihood estimation technique. Varying the scale or resolution of the analysis allows the number of components used in approximating the histogram to be controlled."

The central problem in structural pattern matching is to determine the correspondence between the symbols which comprise a model and symbols which describe a pattern. The difficulty of determining this correspondence depends critically on the representation that is used to describe patterns. This correspondence presents a probabilistic representation for structural models of pattern classes. Both pattern descriptions and models for pattern classes are based on symbols which represent grayscale information at multiple resolutions. A pattern description is given by a tree of symbols with attribute values. Structural models are represented by a tree of symbols with probabilistic attributes. The position and scale (resolution) of the symbols, as well as other ``features,'' are represented by these attributes. An algorithm is presented for determining the correspondence between symbols in a description of a pattern and symbols in a model of a pattern class. This algorithm uses the connectivity between symbols at different scales to constrain the search for correspondence. An interactive training program for learning models of pattern classes is described, and some conclusions from the work are presented."

This is especially true where similarities are noted between objects of different connectivity: in almost all of the present theories the topological type generates the primary categorization. It is argued that such relations find a logical place only in shape theories that involve morphogenesis. Any object can be embedded uniquely in a morphogenetic sequence if one takes resolution as the parameter of the sequence. A theory of measurement is presented that allows one to define surfaces and (boundary-) curves on multiple levels of resolution. The embedding is essentially unique and is generated via a partial differential equation that governs the evolution. A canonical projection connects any high resolution specimen to lower resolution versions. The bifurcation set of the projection generates natural part boundaries. Singularities of the evolution are completely characterized as emergence, accretion and versification processes (involving topological change) and singularities by which inflections (inflection points for curves, parabolic curves for surfaces) are generated. The latter singularities involve a single process for the generation of inflections and three other processes by which the existing inflection structure may be changed. Relations with existing theories in vogue in robotics and AI, as well as in psychophysics are discussed."

A genuinely discrete scale-space theory is developed and its connection to the continuous scale-space theory is explained. Special attention is given to discretization effects, which occur when results from the continuous scale-space theory are to be implemented computationally. The 1D problem is solved completely in an axiomatic manner. For the 2D problem, the author discusses how the 2D discrete scale space should be constructed. The main results are as follows: the proper way to apply the scale-space theory to discrete signals and discrete images is by discretization of the diffusion equation, not the convolution integral; the discrete scale space obtained in this way can be described by convolution with the kernel, which is the discrete analog of the Gaussian kernel, a scale-space implementation based on the sampled Gaussian kernel might lead to undesirable effects and computational problems, especially at fine levels of scale; the 1D discrete smoothing transformations can be characterized exactly and a complete catalogue is given; all finite support 1D discrete smoothing transformations arise from repeated averaging over two adjacent elements (the limit case of such an averaging process is described); and the symmetric 1D discrete smoothing kernels are nonnegative and unimodal, in both the spatial and the frequency domain. >"

Complexity level analysis may resolve this contradiction. Visual search can be reshaped into tractability through approximations and by optimizing the resources devoted to visual processing. Architectural constraints can be derived using the minimum cost principle to rule out a large class of potential solutions. The evidence speaks strongly against bottom-up approaches to vision. In particular, the constraints suggest an attentional mechanism that exploits knowledge of the specific problem being solved. This analysis of visual search performance in terms of attentional influences on visual information processing and complexity satisfaction allows a large body of neurophysiological and psychological evidence to be tied together."

Snakes provide a unified account of a number of visual problems, including detection of edges, lines, and subjective contours; motion tracking; and stereo matching. We have used snakes successfully for interactive interpretation, in which user-imposed constraint forces guide the snake near features of interest."

This paper introduces an attentional prototype for early visual processing. Our model is composed of a processing hierarchy and an attention beam that traverses the hierarchy, passing through the regions of greatest interest and inhibiting the regions that are not relevant. The type of input to the prototype is not limited to visual stimuli. Simulations using high-resolution digitized images were conducted, with image intensity and edge information as inputs to the model. The results confirm that this prototype is both robust and fast, and promises to be essential to any real-time vision system."

Various families of operators with special kinds of symmetries (such as translation, rotation, magnification) are explicitly constructed in 1-D, 2-D, and 3-D. A concept of 'order' is defined, and finite orthonormal bases of functions closely connected with the operators of various orders are constructed. Linear transformations between the various representations are considered. The method is based on two fundamental assumptions: a decrease of resolution should not introduce spurious detail, and the local operators should be self-similar under changes of resolution. These assumptions merely sum up the even more general need for homogeneity isotropy, scale invariance, and separability of independent dimensions of front-end processing in the absence of a priori information. >"

In order to exploit the a priori knowledge about the shape and the physical motion of vehicles in traffic scenes, a parameterized vehicle model is used for an intraframe matching process and a recursive estimator based on a motion model is used for motion estimation. The initial guess about the position and orientation for the models are computed with the help of a clustering approach of moving image features. Shadow edges of the models are taken into account in the matching process. This enables tracking of vehicles under complex illumination conditions and within a small effective field of view. Results on real world traffic scenes are presented and open problems are outlined."

A critical point is a point whose spatial derivatives are zero, and a toppoint is a critical point in which the Hessian does not have full rank. A critical curve is a curve consisting of critical points. It is proposed that toppoints be classified according to the number of critical curves that intersect at the toppoint.Toppoints are analyzed further when one or two critical curves pass through the toppoint. If the Hessian is of rank one, a single critical curve passes through the toppoint; an extremum and a saddle point meet along a curve with a horizontal tangent at the toppoint. Two possibilities exist in the generic case. Either an extremum and a saddle point approach each other with increasing scale and disappear at the toppoint, or an extremum and a saddle are created at the toppoint and diverge from each other at increasing scale.If two critical curves intersect at a toppoint, there are again two different cases when Gaussian blurring is used. In the first case the Hessian has rank zero and the two curves intersect with horizontal perpendicular tangents. Two subcases occur, depending on the root structure of the cubic form of the Taylor expansion of the image at the toppoint. If this cubic form has a single real root, two extrema and two saddles approach the toppoint from below and disappear at the toppoint. The two extrema approach each other along a tangent from opposite directions. Similarly, the two saddles approach each other along the perpendicular tangent. If the cubic form has three distinct real roots, two saddles approach each other from below along a tangent from opposite directions. Above the toppoint the two saddles separate from each other in the perpendicular direction.In the second case the Hessian has rank one and there also exists another algebraic constraint on the coefficients of the cubic form of the Taylor expansion of the image of the toppoint. Two critical curves intersect at the toppoint. Again, two subcases occur, depending on whether the curves are real or complex. If the curves are real, there are two tangents at the intersection point but they are not horizontal, as in the previous subcase. An extremum and a saddle approach each other from below. Above the toppoint an extremum and a saddle separate from each other. The saddle above the toppoint moves in the same direction as the extremum below the toppoint, and the extremum above the toppoint moves in the same direction as the saddle below the toppoint. If the curves are complex, the toppoint is an isolated point in scale space."

We prove that in any dimension the only filter that does not create generic zero crossings as the scale increases is the Gaussian. This result can be generalized to apply to level crossings of any linear differential operator: it applies in particular to ridges and ravines in the image intensity. In the case of the second derivative along the gradient, there is no filter that avoids creation of zero crossings, unless the filtering is performed after the derivative is applied."

For continuous signals, a scaling argument directly gives a natural unit for measuring scale-space lifetime in terms of the logarithm of the ordinary scale parameter. That approach is, however, not appropriate for discrete signals since an infinite lifetime would be assigned to structures existing in the original signal. It is shown how such an effective scale parameter can be defined to give consistent results for both discrete and continuous signals. The treatment is based on the assumption that the probability that a local extremum disappears during a short-scale interval should not vary with scale. As a tool for the analysis, estimates are given of how the density of local extrema can be expected to vary with scale in the scale-space representation of different random noise signals both in the continuous and discrete cases. >"

In this preface we will discuss what we feel are the strengths of the singularity theory approach. This discussion then Ieads naturally into a discussion of the contents of the book and the prerequisites for reading it. Let us emphasize that our principal contribution in this area has been to apply pre-existing techniques from singularity theory, especially unfolding theory and classification theory, to bifurcation problems. Many ofthe ideas in this part of singularity theory were originally proposed by Rene Thom; the subject was then developed rigorously by John Matherand extended by V. I. Arnold. In applying this material to bifurcation problems, we were greatly encouraged by how weil the mathematical ideas of singularity theory meshed with the questions addressed by bifurcation theory. Concerning our title, Singularities and Groups in Bifurcation Theory, it should be mentioned that the present text is the first volume in a two-volume sequence. In this volume our emphasis is on singularity theory, with group theory playing a subordinate role. In Volume II the emphasis will be more balanced. Having made these remarks, Iet us set the context for the discussion of the strengths of the singularity theory approach to bifurcation. As we use the term, bifurcation theory is the study of equations with multiple solutions."

The approach first takes an arbitrary set of 3-D volumetric primitives and generates a hierarchical aspect representation based on the projected surfaces of the primitives; conditional probabilities capture the ambiguity of mappings between levels of the hierarchy. The integration of object-centered and viewer-centered representations provides the indexing power of 3-D volumetric primitives, while supporting a 2-D matching paradigm for primitive reconstruction. Formulation of the problem based on grouping the image regions according to aspect is presented. No domain dependent heuristics are used; the authors exploit only the probabilities inherent in the aspect hierarchy. For a given selection of primitives, the success of the heuristic depends on the likelihood of the various aspects; best results are achieved when certain aspects are more likely, and fewer primitives project to a given aspect.<<ETX>>"
