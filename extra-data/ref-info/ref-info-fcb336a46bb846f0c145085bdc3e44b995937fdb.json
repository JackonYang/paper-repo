The max-product algorithm, also known as the max-plus or min-sum algorithm, is an iterative method for (approximately) solving such a problem on graphs with cycles. We provide a novel perspective on the algorithm, which is based on the idea of reparameterizing the distribution in terms of so-called pseudo-max-marginals on nodes and edges of the graph. This viewpoint provides conceptual insight into the max-product algorithm in application to graphs with cycles. First, we prove the existence of max-product fixed points for positive distributions on arbitrary graphs. Next, we show that the approximate max-marginals computed by max-product are guaranteed to be consistent, in a suitable sense to be defined, over every tree of the graph. We then turn to characterizing the nature of the approximation to the MAP assignment computed by max-product. We generalize previous work by showing that for any graph, the max-product assignment satisfies a particular optimality condition with respect to any subgraph containing at most one cycle per connected component. We use this optimality condition to derive upper bounds on the difference between the log probability of the true MAP assignment, and the log probability of a max-product assignment. Finally, we consider extensions of the max-product algorithm that operate over higher-order cliques, and show how our reparameterization analysis extends in a natural manner."

This quantity plays an important role in various contexts, including approximating marginal distributions, parameter estimation, combinatorial enumeration, statistical decision theory, and large-deviations bounds. Our derivation is based on concepts from convex duality and information geometry: in particular, it exploits mixtures of distributions in the exponential domain, and the Legendre mapping between exponential and mean parameters. In the special case of convex combinations of tree-structured distributions, we obtain a family of variational problems, similar to the Bethe variational problem, but distinguished by the following desirable properties: i) they are convex, and have a unique global optimum; and ii) the optimum gives an upper bound on the log partition function. This optimum is defined by stationary conditions very similar to those defining fixed points of the sum-product algorithm, or more generally, any local optimum of the Bethe variational problem. As with sum-product fixed points, the elements of the optimizing argument can be used as approximations to the marginals of the original model. The analysis extends naturally to convex combinations of hypertree-structured distributions, thereby establishing links to Kikuchi approximations and variants."

The max-product \"belief propagation\" algorithm is a local-message-passing algorithm on this graph that is known to converge to a unique fixed point when the graph is a tree. Furthermore, when the graph is a tree, the assignment based on the fixed point yields the most probable values of the unobserved variables given the observed ones. Good empirical performance has been obtained by running the max-product algorithm (or the equivalent min-sum algorithm) on graphs with loops, for applications including the decoding of \"turbo\" codes. Except for two simple graphs (cycle codes and single-loop graphs) there has been little theoretical understanding of the max-product algorithm on graphs with loops. Here we prove a result on the fixed points of max-product on a graph with arbitrary topology and with arbitrary probability distributions (discrete- or continuous-valued nodes). We show that the assignment based on a fixed point is a \"neighborhood maximum\" of the posterior probability: the posterior probability of the max-product assignment is guaranteed to be greater than all other assignments in a particular large region around that assignment. The region includes all assignments that differ from the max-product assignment in any subset of nodes that form no more than a single loop in the graph. In some graphs, this neighborhood is exponentially large. We illustrate the analysis with examples."

                "text": "Stochastic processes de ned on graphs arise in a tremendous variety of elds, including statistical physics, signal processing, computer vision, arti cial intelligence, and information theory. The formalism of graphical models provides a useful language with which to formulate fundamental problems common to all of these elds, including estimation, model tting, and sampling. For graphs without cycles, known as trees, all of these problems are relatively well-understood, and can be solved e\u00c6ciently with algorithms whose complexity scales in a tractable manner with problem size. In contrast, these same problems present considerable challenges in general graphs with cycles. The focus of this thesis is the development and analysis of methods, both exact and approximate, for problems on graphs with cycles. Our contributions are in developing and analyzing techniques for estimation, as well as methods for computing upper and lower bounds on quantities of interest (e.g., marginal probabilities; partition functions). In order to do so, we make use of exponential representations of distributions, as well as insight from the associated information geometry and Legendre duality. Our results demonstrate the power of exponential representations for graphical models, as well as the utility of studying collections of modi ed problems de ned on trees embedded within the original graph with cycles. The speci c contributions of this thesis include the following. We develop a method for performing exact estimation of Gaussian processes on graphs with cycles by solving a sequence of modi ed problems on embedded spanning trees. We present the tree-based reparameterization framework for approximate estimation of discrete processes. This framework leads to a number of theoretical results on belief propagation and related algorithms, including characterizations of their xed points and the associated approximation error. Next we extend the notion of reparameterization to a much broader class of methods for approximate inference, including Kikuchi methods, and present results on their xed points and accuracy. Finally, we develop and analyze a novel class of upper bounds on the log partition function based on convex combinations of distributions in the exponential domain. In the special case of combining tree-structured distributions, the associated dual function gives an interesting perspective on the Bethe free energy. Thesis Supervisors: Alan S.

This class includes the belief propagation (BP) or sum-product algorithm as well as variations and extensions of BP. Algorithms in this class can be formulated as a sequence of reparameterization updates, each of which entails refactorizing a portion of the distribution corresponding to an acyclic subgraph (i.e., a tree, or more generally, a hypertree). The ultimate goal is to obtain an alternative but equivalent factorization using functions that represent (exact or approximate) marginal distributions on cliques of the graph. Our framework highlights an important property of the sum-product algorithm and the larger class of reparameterization algorithms: the original distribution on the graph with cycles is not changed. The perspective of tree-based updates gives rise to a simple and intuitive characterization of the fixed points in terms of tree consistency. We develop interpretations of these results in terms of information geometry. The invariance of the distribution, in conjunction with the fixed-point characterization, enables us to derive an exact expression for the difference between the true marginals on an arbitrary graph with cycles, and the approximations provided by belief propagation. More broadly, our analysis applies to any algorithm that minimizes the Bethe free energy. We also develop bounds on the approximation error, which illuminate the conditions that govern their accuracy. Finally, we show how the reparameterization perspective extends naturally to generalizations of BP (e.g., Kikuchi (1951) approximations and variants) via the notion of hypertree reparameterization."

We develop a unified approach, with examples, notation, and graphical models borrowed from the relevant disciplines.We explain the close connection between the BP algorithm and the Bethe approximation of statistical physics. In particular, we show that BP can only converge to a fixed point that is also a stationary point of the Bethe approximation to the free energy. This result helps explaining the successes of the BP algorithm and enables connections to be made with variational approaches to approximate inference.The connection of BP with the Bethe approximation also suggests a way to construct new message-passing algorithms based on improvements to Bethe's approximation introduced Kikuchi and others. The new generalized belief propagation (GBP) algorithms are significantly more accurate than ordinary BP for some problems. We illustrate how to construct GBP algorithms with a detailed example."

The decoding algorithm is based on a linear programming (LP) relaxation that is defined by a factor graph or parity-check representation of the code. The resulting \"LP decoder\" generalizes our previous work on turbo-like codes. A precise combinatorial characterization of when the LP decoder succeeds is provided, based on pseudocodewords associated with the factor graph. Our definition of a pseudocodeword unifies other such notions known for iterative algorithms, including \"stopping sets,\" \"irreducible closed walks,\" \"trellis cycles,\" \"deviation sets,\" and \"graph covers.\" The fractional distance d/sub frac/ of a code is introduced, which is a lower bound on the classical distance. It is shown that the efficient LP decoder will correct up to /spl lceil/d/sub frac//2/spl rceil/-1 errors and that there are codes with d/sub frac/=/spl Omega/(n/sup 1-/spl epsi//). An efficient algorithm to compute the fractional distance is presented.

(Nov. 2005)- tree-reweighted max-product message passing (TRW). It was inspired by the problem of maximizing a lower bound on the energy. However, the algorithm is not guaranteed to increase this bound - it may actually go down. In addition, TRW does not always converge. We develop a modification of this algorithm which we call sequential tree-reweighted message passing. Its main property is that the bound is guaranteed not to decrease. We also give a weak tree agreement condition which characterizes local maxima of the bound with respect to TRW algorithms. We prove that our algorithm has a limit point that achieves weak tree agreement. Finally, we show that, our algorithm requires half as much memory as traditional message passing approaches. Experimental results demonstrate that on certain synthetic and real problems, our algorithm outperforms both the ordinary belief propagation and tree-reweighted algorithm in (M. J. Wainwright, et al., Nov. 2005). In addition, on stereo problems with Potts interactions, we obtain a lower energy than graph cuts"

It is shown that the strength of the resulting reformulation depends on the degree of the terms used to produce the polynomial program at the intermediate step of this method. In fact, as this degree varies from one up to the number of variables in the problem, a hierarchy of sharper representations is obtained with the final relaxation representing the convex hull of feasible solutions. The reformulation technique readily extends to produce a similar hierarchy of linear relaxations for zero-one polynomial programming problems. A characterization of the convex hull in the original variable space is also available through a projection process. The structure of this convex hull characterization (or its other relaxations) can be exploited to generate strong or facetial valid inequalities through appropriate surrogates in a computational framework. The surrogation process can also be used to study various classes of facets for different combinatorial optimization problems. Some examples are given to illustrate this point. 1. Introduction. This paper describes a technique for generating a hierarchy of polyhedral representations for linear and polynomial zero-one programming problems."

We gave a precise characterization of the noise patterns that cause decoding error under the binar y symmetric and additive white Gaussian noise channels. We used this characterization to p rove that the word error rate is bounded by an inverse polynomial in the code length. Furth ermore, for any turbo-like code, our algorithm has the ML certificateproperty: whenever it outputs a code word, it is guaranteed to be the maximum-likelihood (ML) code word. In this paper we extend these results and give an iterative de coder whose output is equivalent to that of the LP decoder. We also extend the ML cer tifi ate property to the more efficient iterativetree reweighted max-product message-passing algorithm developed by Wainwright, Jaakkola, and Willsky [13]: we show that whenev er this algorithm converges to a code word, it must be the ML code word. Finally, we demonstrate experimentally that the noise patt erns that cause decoding error in the LP decoder also cause decoding error in the stand ard iterative sum-product and max-product (min-sum) message-passing algorithms. Conse quently, the deterministically constructible interleaver used by the LP decoder to achieve its bounds on error rate is useful in practice not only for the LP decoder, but for these s tandard iterative decoders as"

This paper gives an \"orthogonal\" decomposition of such a system based on information geometry. A typical example is the decomposition of stochastic dependency among a number of random variables. In general, they have a complex structure of dependencies. Pairwise dependency is easily represented by correlation, but it is more difficult to measure effects of pure triplewise or higher order interactions (dependencies) among these variables. Stochastic dependency is decomposed quantitatively into an \"orthogonal\" sum of pairwise, triplewise, and further higher order dependencies. This gives a new invariant decomposition of joint entropy. This problem is important for extracting intrinsic interactions in firing patterns of an ensemble of neurons and for estimating its functional connections. The orthogonal decomposition is given in a wide class of hierarchical structures including both exponential and mixture families. As an example, we decompose the dependency in a higher order Markov chain into a sum of those in various lower order Markov chains."

The main result is that the four gaps associated with the four relaxations are equal. Furthermore, a solution to any of these problems leads at once to solutions of the other three equivalent ones. The four relaxations can be solved in polynomial time by transforming them to a bipartite maximum flow problem. The optimal solutions of the \u2018roof-dual\u2019 define \u2018best\u2019 linear majorantsp(x) off, having the following persistency property: if theith coefficient inp is positive (negative) thenxi=1 (0) in every optimum of the primal problem. Several characterizations are given for the case where these persistency results cannot be used to fix any variable of the primal. On the other hand, a class of gap-free functions (properly including the supermodular ones) is exhibited."

In particular, the recent success of turbo codes indicates that performance close to the Shannon limit may be achieved. In this thesis, it is showed that many iterative decoding algorithms are special cases of two generic algorithms, the min-sum and sum-product algorithms, which also include non-iterative algorithms such as Viterbi decoding. The min-sum and sum-product algorithms are developed and presented as generalized trellis algorithms, where the time axis of the trellis is replaced by an arbitrary graph, the \u201cTanner graph\u201d. With cycle-free Tanner graphs, the resulting decoding algorithms (e.g., Viterbi decoding) are maximum-likelihood but suffer from an exponentially increasing complexity. Iterative decoding occurs when the Tanner graph has cycles (e.g., turbo codes); the resulting algorithms are in general suboptimal, but significant complexity reductions are possible compared to the cycle-free case. Several performance estimates for iterative decoding are developed, including a generalization of the union bound used with Viterbi decoding and a characterization of errors that are uncorrectable after infinitely many decoding iterations."

(1993) and an algorithm that has been well known in the artificial intelligence community for a decade, but which is relatively unknown to information theorists: Pearl's (1982) belief propagation algorithm. We see that if Pearl's algorithm is applied to the \"belief network\" of a parallel concatenation of two or more codes, the turbo decoding algorithm immediately results. Unfortunately, however, this belief diagram has loops, and Pearl only proved that his algorithm works when there are no loops, so an explanation of the experimental performance of turbo decoding is still lacking. However, we also show that Pearl's algorithm can be used to routinely derive previously known iterative, but suboptimal, decoding algorithms for a number of other error-control systems, including Gallager's (1962) low-density parity-check codes, serially concatenated codes, and product codes. Thus, belief propagation provides a very attractive general methodology for devising low-complexity iterative decoding algorithms for hybrid coded systems."

                "text": "Data association is a fundamental problem in multitarget-multisensor tracking. It entails selecting the most probable association between sensor measurements and target tracks from a very large set of possibilities. With N sensors and n targets in the detection range of each sensor, even with perfect detection there are (n!)N different configurations which renders infeasible a solution by direct computation even in modestly-sized applications. We describe an iterative method for solving the optimal data association problem in a distributed fashion; the work exploits the framework of graphical models, which are a powerful tool for encoding the statistical dependencies of a set of random variables and are widely used in many applications (e.g., computer vision, error-correcting codes). Our basic idea is to treat the measurement assignment for each sensor as a random variable, which is in turn represented as a node in an underlying graph. Neighboring nodes are coupled by the targets visible to both sensors. Thus we transform the data association problem to that of computing the maximum a posteriori (MAP) configuration in a graphical model to which efficient techniques (e.g., the max-product/min-sum algorithm) can be applied. We use a tree-reweighted version of the usual max-product algorithm that either outputs the MAP data association, or acknowledges failure. For acyclic graphs, this message-passing algorithm can solve the data association problem directly and recursively with complexity O((n!)2N). On graphs with cycles, the algorithm may require more iterations to converge, and need not output an unambiguous assignment. However, for the data association problems considered here, the coupling matrices involved in computations are inherently of low rank, and experiments show that the algorithm converges very fast and finds the MAP configurations in this case."

While the structural properties of turbo codes and low density parity check codes have now been put on a firm theoretical footing, what is still lacking is a satisfactory theoretical explanation as to why iterative decoding algorithms perform as well as they do. In this thesis we make a first step by discussing the behavior of various iterative decoders for the graphs of tail-biting codes and cycle codes. By increasing our understanding of the behavior of the iterative min-sum (MSA) and sum-product (SPA) algorithms on graphs with cycles, we can design codes which achieve better performance.\n\nMuch of this thesis is devoted to the analysis of the performance of the MSA and SPA on the graphs for tail-biting codes and cycle codes. We give sufficient conditions for the MSA to converge to the maximum likelihood codeword after a finite number of iterations. We also use the familiar union bound argument to characterize the performance of the MSA after many iterations. For a cycle code, we show that the performance of the MSA decoder is asymptotically as good as maximum likelihood. For tail-biting codes this will depend on our choice of trellis."

Smith in the Chair] SUMMARY A continuous two-dimensional region is partitioned into a fine rectangular array of sites or \"pixels\", each pixel having a particular \"colour\" belonging to a prescribed finite set. The true colouring of the region is unknown but, associated with each pixel, there is a possibly multivariate record which conveys imperfect information about its colour according to a known statistical model. The aim is to reconstruct the true scene, with the additional knowledge that pixels close together tend to have the same or similar colours. In this paper, it is assumed that the local characteristics of the true scene can be represented by a nondegenerate Markov random field. Such information can be combined with the records by Bayes' theorem and the true scene can be estimated according to standard criteria. However, the computational burden is enormous and the reconstruction may reflect undesirable largescale properties of the random field. Thus, a simple, iterative method of reconstruction is proposed, which does not depend on these large-scale characteristics. The method is illustrated by computer simulations in which the original scene is not directly related to the assumed random field. Some complications, including parameter estimation, are discussed. Potential applications are mentioned briefly."

In this way, power EP is applicable to a wide variety of models, much more than EP. Instead of minimizing KL-divergence at each step, power EP minimizes \u03b1-divergence. This minimization turns out to be equivalent to minimizing KL-divergence with the exact distribution raised to a power. By choosing this power to cancel exponents, the problem may be substantially simplified. The resulting approximation is not the same as regular EP, but in practice is still very good, and allows tackling problems which are intractable under regular EP."

The pseudocodewords of such a tree are the words that satisfy all tree constraintsj pseudocodewords govern decoding performance. Wiberg [12] determined the effective weight of pseudocodewords for binary codewords on an AWGN channel. This paper extends Wiberg\u2019s formula for AWGN channels to nonbinary codes, develops similar results for BSC and BEC channels, and gives upper and lower bounds on the effective weight. The 16-state tail-biting trellis of the Golay code [2] is used for exampIes. Although in this case no pseudocodeword is found with effective weight less than the minimum Hamming weight of the Golay code on an AWGN channel, it is shown by example that the minimum effective pseudocodeword weight can be less than the minimum codeword weight."

The set of pseudosignals corresponds to \"pseudocodewords\", only a vanishingly small number of which correspond to codewords.
