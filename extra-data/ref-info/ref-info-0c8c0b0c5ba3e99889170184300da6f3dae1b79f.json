Analyzing articulated motion is challenging because the dimensionality increase potentially demands tremendous increase of computation. To ease this problem, we propose an approach that analyzes subparts locally while reinforcing the structural constraints at the mean time. The computational model of the proposed approach is based on a dynamic Markov network, a generative model which characterizes the dynamics and the image observations of each individual subpart as well as the motion constraints among different subparts. Probabilistic variational analysis of the model reveals a mean field approximation to the posterior densities of each subparts given visual evidence, and provides a computationally efficient way for such a difficult Bayesian inference problem. In addition, we design mean field Monte Carlo (MFMC) algorithms, in which a set of low dimensional particle filters interact with each other and solve the high dimensional problem collaboratively. Extensive experiments on tracking human body parts demonstrate the effectiveness, significance and computational efficiency of the proposed method."

Within a Bayesian framework, we define a generative model of image appearance, a robust likelihood function based on image graylevel differences, and a prior probability distribution over pose and joint angles that models how humans move. The posterior probability distribution over model parameters is represented using a discrete set of samples and is propagated over time using particle filtering. The approach extends previous work on parameterized optical flow estimation to exploit a complex 3D articulated motion model. It also extends previous work on human motion tracking by including a perspective camera model, by modeling limb self occlusion, and by recovering 3D motion from a monocular sequence. The explicit posterior probability distribution represents ambiguities due to image matching, model singularities, and perspective projection. The method relies only on a frame-to-frame assumption of brightness constancy and hence is able to track people under changing viewpoints, in grayscale image sequences, and with complex unknown backgrounds."

We introduce the use of a novel mathematical technique, the product of exponential maps and twist motions, and its integration into a differential motion estimation. This results in solving simple linear systems, and enables us to recover robustly the kinematic degrees-of-freedom in noise and complex self occluded configurations. We demonstrate this on several image sequences of people doing articulated full body movements, and visualize the results in re-animating an artificial 3D human model. We are also able to recover and re-animate the famous movements of Eadweard Muybridge's motion studies from the last century. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first computer vision based system that is able to process such challenging footage and recover complex motions with such high accuracy."

We define a \"card-board person model\" in which a person's limbs are represented by a set of connected planar patches. The parametrized image motion of these patches in constrained to enforce articulated motion and is solved for directly using a robust estimation technique. The recovered motion parameters provide a rich and concise description of the activity that can be used for recognition. We propose a method for performing view-based recognition of human activities from the optical flow parameters that extends previous methods to cope with the cyclical nature of human motion. We illustrate the method with examples of tracking human legs of long image sequences."

A graph model is proposed for human upper body motion, and motion inference is posed as a mapping problem between state nodes in the graph model and the motion cues in images. Belief Propagation and dynamic programming algorithms are utilized for Bayesian inference of upper body motion in this graph model, which captures constraint of human body configuration under specific view angles. A multi-frame inference algorithm is proposed to combine temporal smoothness constraints in human upper body motion. The algorithm is applied in a prototype system that can automatically detect and track human upper body motion from captured videos, without manual initialization of human body parts. We present evaluation results of our algorithm on this system and some further considerations for refine the model in the future."

Search algorithms, either deterministic or stochastic, that search such a space without constraint, fall foul of exponential computational complexity. One approach is to introduce constraints: either labelling using markers or colour coding, prior assumptions about motion trajectories or view restrictions. Another is to relax constraints arising from articulation, and track limbs as if their motions were independent. In contrast, we aim for general tracking without special preparation of objects or restrictive assumptions. The principal contribution of the paper is the development of a modified particle filter for search in high dimensional configuration spaces. It uses a continuation principle based on annealing to introduce the influence of narrow peaks in the fitness function, gradually. The new algorithm, termed annealed particle filtering, is shown to be capable of recovering full articulated body motion efficiently."

Moving people are modeled with the assumption that, while configuration can vary quite substantially from frame to frame, appearance does not. This leads to an algorithm that firstly builds a model of the appearance of the body of each individual by clustering candidate body segments, and then uses this model to find all individuals in each frame. Unusually, the tracker does not rely on a model of human dynamics to identify possible instances of people; such models are unreliable, because human motion is fast and large accelerations are common. We show our tracking algorithm can be interpreted as a loopy inference procedure on an underlying Bayes net. Experiments on video of real scenes demonstrate that this tracker can (a) count distinct individuals; (b) identify and track them; (c) recover when it loses track, for example, if individuals are occluded or briefly leave the view; (d) identify the configuration of the body largely correctly; and (e) is not dependent on particular models of human motion."

We show how to find people by finding candidate body segments, and then constructing assemblies of segments that are consistent with the constraints on the appearance of a person that result from kinematic properties. Since a reasonable model of a person requires at least nine segments, it is not possible to inspect every group, due to the huge combinatorial complexity.We propose two approaches to this problem. In one, the search can be pruned by using projected versions of a classifier that accepts groups corresponding to people. We describe an efficient projection algorithm for one popular classifier, and demonstrate that our approach can be used to determine whether images of real scenes contain people.The second approach employs a probabilistic framework, so that we can draw samples of assemblies, with probabilities proportional to their likelihood, which allows to draw human-like assemblies more often than the non-person ones. The main performance problem is in segmentation of images, but the overall results of both approaches on real images of people are encouraging."

As the state-space of a model grows, the dependencies between the dimensions lead to an exponential growth in computation when performing inference. Many common computer vision problems naturally map onto the graphical model framework; the representation is a graph where each node contains a portion of the state-space and there is an edge between two nodes only if they are not independent conditional on the other nodes in the graph. When this graph is sparsely connected, belief propagation algorithms can turn an exponential inference computation into one, which is linear in the size of the graph. However belief propagation is only applicable when the variables in the nodes are discrete-valued or jointly represented by a single multivariate Gaussian distribution, and this rules out many computer vision applications. This paper combines belief propagation with ideas from particle filtering; the resulting algorithm performs inference on graphs containing both cycles and continuous-valued latent variables with general conditional probability distributions. Such graphical models have wide applicability in the computer vision domain and we test the algorithm on example problems of low-level edge linking and locating jointed structures in clutter."

Monocular 3D body tracking is challenging: for reliable tracking at least 30 joint parameters need to be estimated, subject to highly nonlinear physical constraints; the problem is chronically ill conditioned as about 1/3 of the d.o.f. (the depth-related ones) are almost unobservable in any given monocular image; and matching an imperfect, highly flexible self-occluding model to cluttered image features is intrinsically hard. To reduce correspondence ambiguities we use a carefully designed robust matching-cost metric that combines robust optical flow, edge energy, and motion boundaries. Even so, the ambiguity, nonlinearity and non-observability make the parameter-space cost surface multi-modal, unpredictable and ill conditioned, so minimizing it is difficult. We discuss the limitations of CONDENSATION-like samplers, and introduce a novel hybrid search algorithm that combines inflated-covariance-scaled sampling and continuous optimization subject to physical constraints. Experiments on some challenging monocular sequences show that robust cost modelling, joint and self-intersection constraints, and informed sampling are all essential for reliable monocular 3D body tracking."

We address this problem with mixtures of trees, and demonstrate an efficient and compact representation of this mixture, which admits simple learning and inference algorithms. We use this method to build an automated tracker for Muybridge sequences of a variety of human activities. Tracking is difficult, because the temporal dependencies rule out simple inference methods. We show how to use our model for efficient inference, using a method that employs alternate spatial and temporal inference. The result is a cracker that (a) uses a very loose motion model, and so can track many different activities at a variable frame rate and (b) is entirely, automatic."

Conventional particle filters, however, do not scale to the problem of human motion capture (HMC) because of the large number of degrees of freedom involved. Annealed Particle Filtering (APF), introduced by J. Deutscher et al. (2000), tackled this by layering the search space and was shown to be a very effective tool for HMC. We improve upon and extend the APF in two ways. First we develop a hierarchical search strategy which automatically partitions the search space without any explicit representation of the partitions. Then we introduce a crossover operator (similar to that found in genetic algorithms) which improves the ability of the tracker to search different partitions in parallel. We present results for a simple example to demonstrate the new algorithm's implementation and then apply it to the considerably more complex problem of human motion capture with 34 degrees of freedom."

There exist inference algorithms for discrete approximations to these continuous distributions, but for the high-dimensional variables typically of interest, discrete inference becomes infeasible. Stochastic methods such as particle filters provide an appealing alternative. However, existing techniques fail to exploit the rich structure of the graphical models describing many vision problems. Drawing on ideas from regularized particle filters and belief propagation (BP), this paper develops a nonparametric belief propagation (NBP) algorithm applicable to general graphs. Each NBP iteration uses an efficient sampling procedure to update kernel-based approximations to the true, continuous likelihoods. The algorithm can accommodate an extremely broad class of potential functions, including nonparametric representations. Thus, NBP extends particle filtering methods to the more general vision problems that graphical models can describe. We apply the NBP algorithm to infer component interrelationships in a parts-based face model, allowing location and reconstruction of occluded features."

The template is formulated as a Bayesian graphical model of a two-dimensional shape contour, and it is matched to the image using a variant of the belief propagation (BP) algorithm used for inference on graphical models. The algorithm can localize a target shape contour in a cluttered image and can accommodate arbitrary global translation and rotation of the target as well as significant shape deformations, without requiring the template to be initialized in any special way (e.g. near the target).The use of BP removes a serious restriction imposed in related earlier work, in which the matching is performed by dynamic programming and thus requires the graphical model to be tree-shaped (i.e. without loops). Although BP is not guaranteed to converge when applied to inference on non-tree-shaped graphs, we find empirically that it does converge even for deformable template models with one or more loops. To speed up the BP algorithm, we augment it by a pruning procedure and a novel technique, inspired by the 20 Questions (divide-and-conquer) search strategy, called \"focused message updating.\" These modifications boost the speed of convergence by over an order of magnitude, resulting in an algorithm that detects and localizes shapes in grayscale images in as little as several seconds on an 850 MHz AMD processor."

We focus on the probabilistic tracking of people and learn models of how they appear and move in images. In particular we learn the likelihood of observing various spatial and temporal filter responses corresponding to edges, ridges, and motion differences given a model of the person. Similarly, we learn probability distributions over filter responses for general scenes that define a likelihood of observing the filter responses for arbitrary backgrounds. We then derive a probabilistic model for tracking that exploits the ratio between the likelihood that image pixels corresponding to the foreground (person) were generated by an actual person or by some unknown background. The paper extends previous work on learning image statistics and combines it with Bayesian tracking using particle filtering. By combining multiple image cues, and by using learned likelihood models, we demonstrate improved robustness and accuracy when tracking complex objects such as people in monocular image sequences with cluttered scene and a moving camera."

We introduce a simplified model of a deformable object class and derive the optimal detector for this model.

A cousin of the optimal detector is developed which uses \u201csoft\u201d part detectors with a probabilistic description of the spatial arrangement of the parts. Spatial arrangements are modeled probabilistically using shape statistics to achieve invariance to translation, rotation, and scaling. Improved recognition performance over methods based on \u201chard\u201d part detectors is demonstrated for the problem of face detection in cluttered scenes."

Segments are found using an EM algorithm and then assembled into hypotheses incrementally, using a learned likelihood model. Each assembly step passes on a set of samples of its likelihood to the next; this yields effective pruning of the space of hypotheses. The collection of available nine-segment hypotheses is then represented by a set of equivalence classes, which yield an efficient pruning process. The posterior for the number of people is obtained from the class representatives. People are counted quite accurately in images of real scenes using a MAP estimate. We show the method allows top-down as well as bottom up reasoning. While the method can be overwhelmed by very large numbers of segments, we show that this problem can be avoided by quite simple pruning steps."

Extended Kalman filters have commonly been applied to kinematic variables, to combine predictions consistent with plausible motion, with the incoming stream of visual measurements. Kalman filtering is applicable only when the underlying distribution is approximately Gaussian. Often this assumption proves remarkably robust. There are two pervasive circumstances under which the Gaussianity assumption can break down. The first is kinematic singularity and the second is at joint endstops. Failure of Kalman filtering under these circumstances is illustrated. The non-Gaussian nature of the distributions is demonstrated experimentally by means of Monte Carlo simulation. Random simulation (particle filtering or Condensation) proves to provide a robust alternative algorithm for tracking that can also deal with these difficult conditions."

However most work on tracking and synthesizing figure motion has employed either simple, generic dynamic models or highly specific hand-tailored ones. Recently, a broad class of learning and inference algorithms for time-series models have been successfully cast in the framework of dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs). This paper describes a novel DBN-based switching linear dynamic system (SLDS) model and presents its application to figure motion analysis. A key feature of our approach is an approximate Viterbi inference technique for overcoming the intractability of exact inference in mixed-state DBNs. We present experimental results for learning figure dynamics from video data and show promising initial results for tracking, interpolation, synthesis, and classification using learned models."

This assumption states that the imaged scene contains three orthogonal, dominant directions, and is often satisfied by outdoor or indoor views of man-made structures and environments.The proposed method combines the calibration likelihood introduced in [5] with a stochastic search algorithm to obtain a MAP estimate of the camera's focal length and alignment. Results on real images of indoor scenes are presented. The calibrations obtained are less accurate than those from standard methods employing a calibration pattern or multiple images. However, the outputs are certainly good enough for common vision tasks such as tracking. Moreover, the results are obtained without any user intervention, from a single image, and without use of a calibration pattern."

In fact this technique can reduce the curse of dimensionality in other situations too. This paper describes how to use partitioned sampling on articulated objects, obtaining results that would be impossible with standard sampling methods. Because partitioned sampling is the statistical analogue of a hierarchical search, it makes sense to use it on articulated objects, since links at the base of the object can be localised before moving on to search for subsequent links."

We propose a mechanism based on spectral graph partitioning that readily combine the two processes into one. A part-based recognition system detects object patches, supplies their partial segmentations as well as knowledge about the spatial configurations of the object. The goal of patch grouping is to find a set of patches that conform best to the object configuration, while the goal of pixel grouping is to find a set of pixels that have the best low-level feature similarity. Through pixel-patch interactions and between-pateh competition encoded in the solution space, these two processes are realized in one joint optimization problem. The globally optima] partition is obtained by solving a constrained eigenvalue problem. We demonstrate that the resulting object segmentation eliminates false positives for the part detection, while overcoming occlusion and weak contours for the low-level edge detection."

However, there has been little understanding of the algorithm or the nature of the solutions it finds for general graphs. \n \nWe show that BP can only converge to a stationary point of an approximate free energy, known as the Bethe free energy in statistical physics. This result characterizes BP fixed-points and makes connections with variational approaches to approximate inference. \n \nMore importantly, our analysis lets us build on the progress made in statistical physics since Bethe's approximation was introduced in 1935. Kikuchi and others have shown how to construct more accurate free energy approximations, of which Bethe's approximation is the simplest. Exploiting the insights from our analysis, we derive generalized belief propagation (GBP) versions of these Kikuchi approximations. These new message passing algorithms can be significantly more accurate than ordinary BP, at an adjustable increase in complexity. We illustrate such a new GBP algorithm on a grid Markov network and show that it gives much more accurate marginal probabilities than those found using ordinary BP."

These methods, appearing under the names of bootstrap filters, condensation, optimal Monte Carlo filters, particle filters and survival of the fittest, have made it possible to solve numerically many complex, non-standard problems that were previously intractable. This book presents the first comprehensive treatment of these techniques, including convergence results and applications to tracking, guidance, automated target recognition, aircraft navigation, robot navigation, econometrics, financial modeling, neural networks, optimal control, optimal filtering, communications, reinforcement learning, signal enhancement, model averaging and selection, computer vision, semiconductor design, population biology, dynamic Bayesian networks, and time series analysis. This will be of great value to students, researchers and practitioners, who have some basic knowledge of probability. Arnaud Doucet received the Ph. D. degree from the University of Paris-XI Orsay in 1997. From 1998 to 2000, he conducted research at the Signal Processing Group of Cambridge University, UK. He is currently an assistant professor at the Department of Electrical Engineering of Melbourne University, Australia. His research interests include Bayesian statistics, dynamic models and Monte Carlo methods. Nando de Freitas obtained a Ph.D. degree in information engineering from Cambridge University in 1999. He is presently a research associate with the artificial intelligence group of the University of California at Berkeley. His main research interests are in Bayesian statistics and the application of on-line and batch Monte Carlo methods to machine learning. Neil Gordon obtained a Ph.D. in Statistics from Imperial College, University of London in 1993. He is with the Pattern and Information Processing group at the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency in the United Kingdom. His research interests are in time series, statistical data analysis, and pattern recognition with a particular emphasis on target tracking and missile guidance."

This has been due in part to the computational difficulty of matching pictorial structures to images. In this paper we present an efficient algorithm for finding the best global match of a pictorial stucture to an image. With this improved algorithm, pictorial structures provide a practical and powerful framework for quantitative descriptions of objects and scenes, and are suitable for many generic image recognition problems. We illustrate the approach using simple models of a person and a car."

We propose a mechanism based on spectral graph partitioning that readily couple the two processes into one. A part-based object recognition system detects parts, supplies their partial segmentations and an evaluation of how well possible labellings on these parts go together based on the statistics of object spatial configurations. We integrate the top-level part grouping into the low-level pixel grouping based on feature similarity to segregate objects of interest from the background. We demonstrate that object part consistency and image pixel coherence can work together to eliminate local false positives and labelling ambiguities at high level, while at the same time overcome occlusion and weak contours at low level."
