Hence, it is essential to have a compact representation for a face. So an important issue is the minimum spatial and grayscale resolutions necessary for a pattern to be detected as a face and then identified. Several experiments were performed to estimate these limits using a collection of 64 faces imaged under very different conditions. All experiments were performed using human observers. The results indicate that there is enough information in 32 x32 x 4bpp images for human eyes to detect and identify the faces. Thus an automated system could represent a face using only 512 bytes."

Each silhouette is preprocessed to remove noise, smooth edges, and extract the front edge. The processed silhouettes are then represented by a 12-dimensional feature vector, the components of which are obtained by a circular autocorrelation function. Using a weighted k-nearest neighbor decision rule it is shown that a recognition accuracy of 90 percent is attainable in a ten-class problem. An adaptive training procedure is also described which is used for setting up the authority files. This training procedure appears to identify those feature vectors representing a class which are either most important, from an information content point of view, or are observed most often. Finally, a comparison is made between the recognition accuracy obtained using circular autocorrelation features and moment invariant features. It is shown that the former outperforms, in this problem, the latter. The system is also compared to human observers with the result that the system performs no worse than the human observers."

Three classes of experiments are reported: 1) Gathering, analysis, and assessment of face-feature data for 255 faces. 2) Computer identification-studies. 3) Human identification-studies. A set of 22 features was evolved from an initially larger set to provide relevant, distinctive, relatively independent measures which can be judged reliably. Computer studies and a mathematical model established limits of performance of a person attempting to isolate a face from a population using feature descriptions. The model predicts that under certain conditions approximately 6 of an individual's features are required to isolate him from a population of 255. Human experiments under similar conditions showed unique identification occurred with an average of about 7 features. The model predicts that for a population of 4\u00d7106, only 14 feature-descriptions are required. These studies form a foundation for continuing research on real-time man-machine interaction for computer classification and identification of multidimensional vectors specified by noisy components."

While the computational recognition of a well-framed face as one of a known set of faces has received some attention, the computational location of faces in varying contexts is relatively unexplored. Candidates for the locations of faces are hypothesized by extracting features in the edge-image of the photograph and matching with a model of a face profile. A face is defined by a parametric representation of each of the component parts. Knowledge contained in the caption is represented using semantic networks and is used to reason about the locations of faces of individuals in the photograph.<<ETX>>"

Distinct facial features correspond to convex regions of the range image of the face, which is obtained by a segmentation of the range image based on the sign of the mean and Gaussian curvature at each point. Each convex region is represented by its extended Gaussian image, a 1-1 mapping between points of the region and points on the unit sphere that have the same normal. Several issues are examined that are associated with the difficult problem of interpolation of the values of the extended Gaussian image and its representation. A similarity measure between two regions is obtained by correlating their extended Gaussian images. To establish the optimal correspondence, a graph matching algorithm is applied. It uses the correlation matrix between convex regions of the two faces and incorporates additional relational constraints that account for the relative spatial locations of the convex regions in the domain of the range image.<<ETX>>"

These are the notch between the brow and the nose, the tip of the nose, the notch between the nose and the upper lip, the parting of the lips, and the tip of the chin. Supposing these five points, B\u2032, N\u2032, U\u2032, L\u2032, and C\u2032, to be located with fair precision, as will shortly be shown to be feasible, then Fig. 1 is directly deducible from them, together with the vertical and horizontal axes, C\u2032B\u2032, and C\u2032X at right angles to C\u2032B\u2032. The position of the five cardinal points varies in different profiles much more than the probable error of measurement. So though Fig. 1 is a mere skeleton, which determines what may be called the set of the features, and corresponds to the primary triangulation of a country, other points are to be derived from it, and similarly utilised. Among these are the intersections with the outline by perpendiculars, drawn from the middle or other specified division of the lines. This skeleton serves as an excellent basis for the classification of profiles and for anthropological statistics."

Additional sources of speech information, such as lipreading (or speechreading), should enhance automatic speech recognition, just as lipreading is used by humans to enhance speech recognition when the acoustic signal is degraded. This paper describes an automatic lipreading system which has been developed. A commercial device performs the acoustic speech recognition independently of the lipreading system. \nThe recognition domain is restricted to isolated utterances and speaker dependent recognition. The speaker faces a solid state camera which sends digitized video to a minicomputer system with custom video processing hardware. The video data is sampled during an utterance and then reduced to a template consisting of visual speech parameter time sequences. The distances between the incoming template and all of the trained templates for each utterance in the vocabulary are computed and a visual recognition candidate is obtained. The combination of the acoustic and visual recognition candidates is shown to yield a final recognition accuracy which greatly exceeds the acoustic recognition accuracy alone. Practical considerations and the possible enhancement of speaker independent and continuous speech recognition systems are also discussed."

It is postulated that perceptually significant features of the human face and hands, at which cartoon lines should be drawn in the image, occur wherever surfaces in object space are approximately tangential to the line of sight of the camera or viewer. The implications of this postulate are analyzed for smooth lambertian reflectors seen against a background of the same luminance factor; it is shown that the combined effects of surface gradient and illumination lead to the formation of luminance valleys at the significant features. An experimental comparison of several detectors is described which confirmed the advantage of valley-based detection for deriving economical but recognizable cartoons."

Experiment 1 tested memory for typical and unusual faces by (1) subjects who received an input list followed immediately by a recognition test (standard condition), (2) subjects who viewed all test faces (targets and lures) prior to the input list (prefamiliarization condition), and (3) subjects who viewed all test faces after the input list but prior to recognition (postfamiliarization condition). Although false-alarm errors in the standard condition were lower for unusual than for typical faces, this effect was reduced by postfamiliarization and was eliminated entirely by prefamiliarization. The prefamiliarization and typicality effects were replicated in Experiment 2, which showed that patterns of old judgments were compatible with the hypothesis that, although familiarity of new faces is greater if these faces are typical, the increment in familiarity that results from presentation is greater if these faces are unusual."

For my own part I have frequently chafed under the sense of inability to verbally explain hereditary resemblances and types of features, and to describe irregular outlines of many different kinds, which I will not now particularize. At last I tried to relieve myself as far as might be from this embarrasment, and took considerable trouble, and made many experiments. The net result is that while there appear to be many ways of approximately effecting what is wanted, it is difficult as yet to select the best of them with enough assurance to justify a plunge into a rather serious undertaking. According to the French proverb, the better has thus far proved an enemy to the passably good, so I cannot go much into detail at present, but will chiefly dwell on general principles."

You can admit that \"emotion is only a chapter heading,\" to quote Madison Bentley; in this case you present a sort of smorgasbord of interesting and important facts, and then go on to clinical cases or to experiments on drives in white rats, depending on your inclination. Or, if you wish a more orderly presentation of the topic, you may build it around some of the many theoretical controversies that stud the history of the field. My preference is for the latter method, and after years of following it in class, I think I am beginning to get a satisfactory integration.

The MLP network is trained with a set of face images until it is in a \"learned\" state. The network is capable of classifying the face input into its class. In the case of the subject face is not one of those trained, the network will register it as unknown. The system, which takes the face image input from video camera, is also devcloped to detect the presence of an object in front of the camera and to search for the human facial area automatically. The detected facial area will then be used as the inputs to the neural network to perform recognition."
