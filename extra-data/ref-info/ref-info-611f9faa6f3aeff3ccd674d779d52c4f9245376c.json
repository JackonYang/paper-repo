                "text": "Many state-of-the-art approaches for object recognition reduce the problem to a 0-1 classification task. This allows one to leverage sophisticated machine learning techniques for training classifiers from labeled examples. However, these models are typically trained independently for each class using positive and negative examples cropped from images. At test-time, various post-processing heuristics such as non-maxima suppression (NMS) are required to reconcile multiple detections within and between different classes for each image. Though crucial to good performance on benchmarks, this post-processing is usually defined heuristically.We introduce a unified model for multi-class object recognition that casts the problem as a structured prediction task. Rather than predicting a binary label for each image window independently, our model simultaneously predicts a structured labeling of the entire image (Fig.\u00a01). Our model learns statistics that capture the spatial arrangements of various object classes in real images, both in terms of which arrangements to suppress through NMS and which arrangements to favor through spatial co-occurrence statistics.We formulate parameter estimation in our model as a max-margin learning problem. Given training images with ground-truth object locations, we show how to formulate learning as a convex optimization problem. We employ the cutting plane algorithm of Joachims et al. (Mach. Learn.\u00a02009) to efficiently learn a model from thousands of training images. We show state-of-the-art results on the PASCAL VOC benchmark that indicate the benefits of learning a global model encapsulating the spatial layout of multiple object classes (a preliminary version of this work appeared in ICCV 2009, Desai et al., IEEE international conference on computer vision,\u00a02009)."

                "text": "Object detection is one of the key problems in computer vision. In the last decade, discriminative learning approaches have proven effective in detecting rigid objects, achieving very low false positives rates. The field has also seen a resurgence of part-based recognition methods, with impressive results on highly articulated, diverse object categories. In this paper we propose a discriminative learning approach for detection that is inspired by part-based recognition approaches. Our method, Multiple Component Learning (mcl), automatically learns individual component classifiers and combines these into an overall classifier. Unlike previous methods, which rely on either fairly restricted part models or labeled part data, mcl learns powerful component classifiers in a weakly supervised manner, where object labels are provided but part labels are not. The basis of mcl lies in learning a set classifier; we achieve this by combining boosting with weakly supervised learning, specifically the Multiple Instance Learning framework (mil). mcl is general, and we demonstrate results on a range of data from computer audition and computer vision. In particular, mcl outperforms all existing methods on the challenging INRIA pedestrian detection dataset, and unlike methods that are not part-based, mcl is quite robust to occlusions."

The technique is demonstrated by developing a system that locates people in cluttered scenes. The system is structured with four distinct example-based detectors that are trained to separately find the four components of the human body: the head, legs, left arm, and right arm. After ensuring that these components are present in the proper geometric configuration, a second example-based classifier combines the results of the component detectors to classify a pattern as either a \"person\" or a \"nonperson.\" We call this type of hierarchical architecture, in which learning occurs at multiple stages, an adaptive combination of classifiers (ACC). We present results that show that this system performs significantly better than a similar full-body person detector. This suggests that the improvement in performance is due to the component-based approach and the ACC data classification architecture. The algorithm is also more robust than the full-body person detection method in that it is capable of locating partially occluded views of people and people whose body parts have little contrast with the background."

Objects are modeled as flexible constellations of parts. A probabilistic representation is used for all aspects of the object: shape, appearance, occlusion and relative scale. An entropy-based feature detector is used to select regions and their scale within the image. In learning the parameters of the scale-invariant object model are estimated. This is done using expectation-maximization in a maximum-likelihood setting. In recognition, this model is used in a Bayesian manner to classify images. The flexible nature of the model is demonstrated by excellent results over a range of datasets including geometrically constrained classes (e.g. faces, cars) and flexible objects (such as animals)."

Our system achieves a two-fold improvement in average precision over the best performance in the 2006 PASCAL person detection challenge. It also outperforms the best results in the 2007 challenge in ten out of twenty categories. The system relies heavily on deformable parts. While deformable part models have become quite popular, their value had not been demonstrated on difficult benchmarks such as the PASCAL challenge. Our system also relies heavily on new methods for discriminative training. We combine a margin-sensitive approach for data mining hard negative examples with a formalism we call latent SVM. A latent SVM, like a hidden CRF, leads to a non-convex training problem. However, a latent SVM is semi-convex and the training problem becomes convex once latent information is specified for the positive examples. We believe that our training methods will eventually make possible the effective use of more latent information such as hierarchical (grammar) models and models involving latent three dimensional pose."

Our system is able to represent highly variable object classes and achieves state-of-the-art results in the PASCAL object detection challenges. While deformable part models have become quite popular, their value had not been demonstrated on difficult benchmarks such as the PASCAL data sets. Our system relies on new methods for discriminative training with partially labeled data. We combine a margin-sensitive approach for data-mining hard negative examples with a formalism we call latent SVM. A latent SVM is a reformulation of MI--SVM in terms of latent variables. A latent SVM is semiconvex, and the training problem becomes convex once latent information is specified for the positive examples. This leads to an iterative training algorithm that alternates between fixing latent values for positive examples and optimizing the latent SVM objective function."

These features are focused on local regions of the image and are built from low-level gradient information that discriminates between pedestrian and non-pedestrian classes. Using Ad-aBoost, these shapelet features are created as a combination of oriented gradient responses. To train the final classifier, we use AdaBoost for a second time to select a subset of our learned shapelets. By first focusing locally on smaller feature sets, our algorithm attempts to harvest more useful information than by examining all the low-level features together. We present quantitative results demonstrating the effectiveness of our algorithm. In particular, we obtain an error rate 14 percentage points lower (at 10-6 FPPW) than the previous state of the art detector of Dalal and Triggs on the INRIA dataset."

People are highly non-rigid objects with a high degree of variability in size, shape, color, and texture. Unlike previous approaches, this system learns from examples and does not rely on any a priori (hand-crafted) models or on motion. The detection technique is based on the novel idea of the wavelet template that defines the shape of an object in terms of a subset of the wavelet coefficients of the image. It is invariant to changes in color and texture and can be used to robustly define a rich and complex class of objects such as people. We show how the invariant properties and computational efficiency of the wavelet template make it an effective tool for object detection."

A classifier is then learned for each of these parts, and feature selection is used to determine the most discriminative ones. This approach allows robust pan detection, and it is invariant under scale changes-that is, neither the training images nor the test images have to be normalized. The proposed method is evaluated in car detection tasks with significant variations in viewing conditions, and promising results are demonstrated. Different local regions, classifiers and feature selection methods are quantitatively compared. Our evaluation shows that local invariant descriptors are an appropriate representation for object classes such as cars, and it underlines the importance of feature selection."

Much of the progress of the past few years has been driven by the availability of challenging public datasets. To continue the rapid rate of innovation, we introduce the Caltech Pedestrian Dataset, which is two orders of magnitude larger than existing datasets. The dataset contains richly annotated video, recorded from a moving vehicle, with challenging images of low resolution and frequently occluded people. We propose improved evaluation metrics, demonstrating that commonly used per-window measures are flawed and can fail to predict performance on full images. We also benchmark several promising detection systems, providing an overview of state-of-the-art performance and a direct, unbiased comparison of existing methods. Finally, by analyzing common failure cases, we help identify future research directions for the field."

We study the influence of each stage of the computation on performance, concluding that fine-scale gradients, fine orientation binning, relatively coarse spatial binning, and high-quality local contrast normalization in overlapping descriptor blocks are all important for good results. The new approach gives near-perfect separation on the original MIT pedestrian database, so we introduce a more challenging dataset containing over 1800 annotated human images with a large range of pose variations and backgrounds."

Surprisingly, most approaches rely on static image features only despite the obvious potential of motion information for people detection. This paper systematically evaluates different features and classifiers in a sliding-window framework. First, our experiments indicate that incorporating motion information improves detection performance significantly. Second, the combination of multiple and complementary feature types can also help improve performance. And third, the choice of the classifier-feature combination and several implementation details are crucial to reach best performance. In contrast to many recent papers experimental results are reported for four different datasets rather than using a single one. Three of them are taken from the literature allowing for direct comparison. The fourth dataset is newly recorded using an onboard camera driving through urban environment. Consequently this dataset is more realistic and more challenging than any currently available dataset."

Two kinds of detectors, i.e., global detector for whole scanning windows and part detectors for local regions, are learned from the training data using linear SVM. For each ambiguous scanning window, we construct an occlusion likelihood map by using the response of each block of the HOG feature to the global detector. The occlusion likelihood map is then segmented by Mean-shift approach. The segmented portion of the window with a majority of negative response is inferred as an occluded region. If partial occlusion is indicated with high likelihood in a certain scanning window, part detectors are applied on the unoccluded regions to achieve the final classification on the current scanning window. With the help of the augmented HOG-LBP feature and the global-part occlusion handling method, we achieve a detection rate of 91.3% with FPPW= 10\u22126, 94.7% with FPPW= 10\u22125, and 97.9% with FPPW= 10\u22124 on the INRIA dataset, which, to our best knowledge, is the best human detection performance on the INRIA dataset. The global-part occlusion handling method is further validated using synthesized occlusion data constructed from the INRIA and Pascal dataset."

The objective of this paper is to provide an overview of the current state of the art from both methodological and experimental perspectives. The first part of the paper consists of a survey. We cover the main components of a pedestrian detection system and the underlying models. The second (and larger) part of the paper contains a corresponding experimental study. We consider a diverse set of state-of-the-art systems: wavelet-based AdaBoost cascade, HOG/linSVM, NN/LRF, and combined shape-texture detection. Experiments are performed on an extensive data set captured onboard a vehicle driving through urban environment. The data set includes many thousands of training samples as well as a 27-minute test sequence involving more than 20,000 images with annotated pedestrian locations. We consider a generic evaluation setting and one specific to pedestrian detection onboard a vehicle. Results indicate a clear advantage of HOG/linSVM at higher image resolutions and lower processing speeds, and a superiority of the wavelet-based AdaBoost cascade approach at lower image resolutions and (near) real-time processing speeds. The data set (8.5 GB) is made public for benchmarking purposes."

                "text": "In the matching tasks which form an integral part of all types of tracking and geometrical vision, there are invariably priors available on the absolute and/or relative image locations of features of interest. Usually, these priors are used post-hoc in the process of resolving feature matches and obtaining final scene estimates, via `first get candidate matches, then resolve' consensus algorithms such as RANSAC. In this paper we show that the dramatically different approach of using priors dynamically to guide a feature by feature matching search can achieve global matching with much fewer image processing operations and lower overall computational cost. Essentially, we put image processing into the loopof the search for global consensus. In particular, our approach is able to cope with significant image ambiguity thanks to a dynamic mixture of Gaussians treatment. In our fully Bayesian algorithm, the choice of the most efficient search action at each step is guided intuitively and rigorously by expected Shannon information gain. We demonstrate the algorithm in feature matching as part of a sequential SLAM system for 3D camera tracking. Robust, real-time matching can be achieved even in the previously unmanageable case of jerky, rapid motion necessitating weak motion modelling and large search regions."

In this paper, we provide a framework for placing local object detection in the context of the overall 3D scene by modeling the interdependence of objects, surface orientations, and camera viewpoint. Most object detection methods consider all scales and locations in the image as equally likely. We show that with probabilistic estimates of 3D geometry, both in terms of surfaces and world coordinates, we can put objects into perspective and model the scale and location variance in the image. Our approach reflects the cyclical nature of the problem by allowing probabilistic object hypotheses to refine geometry and vice-versa. Our framework allows painless substitution of almost any object detector and is easily extended to include other aspects of image understanding. Our results confirm the benefits of our integrated approach."

Such features have been used in recent literature for a variety of \ntasks \u2013 indeed, variations appear to have been invented independently multiple times. \nAlthough integral channel features have proven effective, little effort has been devoted to \nanalyzing or optimizing the features themselves.

In this paper we describe a human detection method that augments widely used edge-based features with texture and color information, providing us with a much richer descriptor set. This augmentation results in an extremely high-dimensional feature space (more than 170,000 dimensions). In such high-dimensional spaces, classical machine learning algorithms such as SVMs are nearly intractable with respect to training. Furthermore, the number of training samples is much smaller than the dimensionality of the feature space, by at least an order of magnitude. Finally, the extraction of features from a densely sampled grid structure leads to a high degree of multicollinearity. To circumvent these data characteristics, we employ Partial Least Squares (PLS) analysis, an efficient dimensionality reduction technique, one which preserves significant discriminative information, to project the data onto a much lower dimensional subspace (20 dimensions, reduced from the original 170,000). Our human detection system, employing PLS analysis over the enriched descriptor set, is shown to outperform state-of-the-art techniques on three varied datasets including the popular INRIA pedestrian dataset, the low-resolution gray-scale DaimlerChrysler pedestrian dataset, and the ETHZ pedestrian dataset consisting of full-length videos of crowded scenes."

The detection component involves a cascade of modules, each utilizing complementary visual criteria to successively narrow down the image search space, balancing robustness and efficiency considerations. Novel is the tight integration of the consecutive modules: (sparse) stereo-based ROI generation, shape-based detection, texture-based classification and (dense) stereo-based verification. For example, shape-based detection activates a weighted combination of texture-based classifiers, each attuned to a particular body pose.Performance of individual modules and their interaction is analyzed by means of Receiver Operator Characteristics (ROCs). A sequential optimization technique allows the successive combination of individual ROCs, providing optimized system parameter settings in a systematic fashion, avoiding ad-hoc parameter tuning. Application-dependent processing constraints can be incorporated in the optimization procedure.Results from extensive field tests in difficult urban traffic conditions suggest system performance is at the leading edge."

Examples include principal component analysis (as used for instance in 'eigen-faces'), independent component analysis, and auto-encoder neural networks. Such methods suffer from a number of restrictions such as the limitation to linear manifolds or the absence of a probablistic representation. In this paper we exploit recent developments in the fields of variational inference and latent variable models to develop a novel and tractable probabilistic approach to modelling manifolds which can handle complex non-linearities. Our framework comprises a mixture of sub-space components in which both the number of components and the effective dimensionality of the subspaces are determined automatically as part of the Bayesian inference procedure. We illustrate our approach using two classical problems: modelling the manifold of face images and modelling the manifolds of hand-written digits."

Our scale and affine invariant detectors are based on the following recent results: (1) Interest points extracted with the Harris detector can be adapted to affine transformations and give repeatable results (geometrically stable). (2) The characteristic scale of a local structure is indicated by a local extremum over scale of normalized derivatives (the Laplacian). (3) The affine shape of a point neighborhood is estimated based on the second moment matrix.Our scale invariant detector computes a multi-scale representation for the Harris interest point detector and then selects points at which a local measure (the Laplacian) is maximal over scales. This provides a set of distinctive points which are invariant to scale, rotation and translation as well as robust to illumination changes and limited changes of viewpoint. The characteristic scale determines a scale invariant region for each point. We extend the scale invariant detector to affine invariance by estimating the affine shape of a point neighborhood. An iterative algorithm modifies location, scale and neighborhood of each point and converges to affine invariant points. This method can deal with significant affine transformations including large scale changes. The characteristic scale and the affine shape of neighborhood determine an affine invariant region for each point.We present a comparative evaluation of different detectors and show that our approach provides better results than existing methods. The performance of our detector is also confirmed by excellent matching results; the image is described by a set of scale/affine invariant descriptors computed on the regions associated with our points."

In the first step, contour features are used in a hierarchical template matching approach to efficiently \"lock\" onto candidate solutions. Shape matching is based on Distance Transforms. By capturing the objects shape variability by means of a template hierarchy and using a combined coarse-to-fine approach in shape and parameter space, this method achieves very large speed-ups compared to a brute-force method. We have measured gains of several orders of magnitude. The second step utilizes the richer set of intensity features in a pattern classification approach to verify the candidate solutions (i.e. using Radial Basis Functions). We present experimental results on pedestrian detection off-line and on-board our Urban Traffic Assistant vehicle and discuss the challenges that lie ahead."

For a class of kernels we show that one can do this much more efficiently. In particular we show that one can build histogram intersection kernel SVMs (IKSVMs) with runtime complexity of the classifier logarithmic in the number of support vectors as opposed to linear for the standard approach. We further show that by precomputing auxiliary tables we can construct an approximate classifier with constant runtime and space requirements, independent of the number of support vectors, with negligible loss in classification accuracy on various tasks. This approximation also applies to 1 - chi2 and other kernels of similar form. We also introduce novel features based on a multi-level histograms of oriented edge energy and present experiments on various detection datasets. On the INRIA pedestrian dataset an approximate IKSVM classifier based on these features has the current best performance, with a miss rate 13% lower at 10-6 False Positive Per Window than the linear SVM detector of Dalal & Triggs. On the Daimler Chrysler pedestrian dataset IKSVM gives comparable accuracy to the best results (based on quadratic SVM), while being 15times faster. In these experiments our approximate IKSVM is up to 2000times faster than a standard implementation and requires 200times less memory. Finally we show that a 50times speedup is possible using approximate IKSVM based on spatial pyramid features on the Caltech 101 dataset with negligible loss of accuracy."

Since the descriptors do not form a vector space, well known machine learning techniques are not well suited to learn the classifiers. The space of d-dimensional nonsingular covariance matrices can be represented as a connected Riemannian manifold. The main contribution of the paper is a novel approach for classifying points lying on a connected Riemannian manifold using the geometry of the space. The algorithm is tested on INRIA and DaimlerChrysler pedestrian datasets where superior detection rates are observed over the previous approaches."
