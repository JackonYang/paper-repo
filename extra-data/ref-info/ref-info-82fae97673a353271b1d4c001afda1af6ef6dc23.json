Like an object detector, it can learn class models directly from images, and can localize novel instances in the presence of intra-class variations, clutter, and scale changes. Like a shape matcher, it finds the boundaries of objects, rather than just their bounding-boxes. This is achieved by a novel technique for learning a shape model of an object class given images of example instances. Furthermore, we also integrate Hough-style voting with a non-rigid point matching algorithm to localize the model in cluttered images. As demonstrated by an extensive evaluation, our method can localize object boundaries accurately and does not need segmented examples for training (only bounding-boxes)."

In this paper, we propose an algorithm to recover the occlusion boundaries and depth ordering of free-standing structures in the scene. Rather than viewing the problem as one of pure image processing, our approach employs cues from an estimated surface layout and applies Gestalt grouping principles using a conditional random field (CRF) model. We propose a hierarchical segmentation process, based on agglomerative merging, that re-estimates boundary strength as the segmentation progresses. Our experiments on the Geometric Context dataset validate our choices for features, our iterative refinement of classifiers, and our CRF model. In experiments on the Berkeley Segmentation Dataset, PASCAL VOC 2008, and LabelMe, we also show that the trained algorithm generalizes to other datasets and can be used as an object boundary predictor with figure/ground labels."

We believe that occlusion can provide a strong cue for object segmentation and \"pop-out\", but detecting an object's occlusion boundaries using appearance alone is a difficult problem in itself. If the camera or the scene is moving, however, that motion provides an additional powerful indicator of occlusion. Thus, we use standard appearance cues (e.g. brightness/color gradient) in addition to motion cues that capture subtle differences in the relative surface motion (i.e. parallax) on either side of an occlusion boundary. We describe a learned local classifier and global inference approach which provide a frame-work for combining and reasoning about these appearance and motion cues to estimate which region boundaries of an initial over-segmentation correspond to object/occlusion boundaries in the scene. Through results on a dataset which contains short videos with labeled boundaries, we demonstrate the effectiveness of motion cues for this task."

However, for the most part, these edge-based methods operate solely on the geometric shape of edges, treating them equally and ignoring the fact that for certain object classes, the appearance of the object on the \u201cinside\u201d of the edge may provide valuable recognition cues. \n \nWe show how, for such object classes, small regions around edges can be used to classify the edge into object or non-object. This classifier may then be used to prune edges which are not relevant to the object class, and thereby improve the performance of subsequent processing. We demonstrate learning class specific edges for a number of object classes \u2014 oranges, bananas and bottles \u2014 under challenging scale and illumination variation. \n \nBecause class-specific edge classification provides a low-level analysis of the image it may be integrated into any edge-based recognition strategy without significant change in the high-level algorithms. We illustrate its application to two algorithms: (i) chamfer matching for object detection, and (ii) modulating contrast terms in MRF based object-specific segmentation. We show that performance of both algorithms (matching and segmentation) is considerably improved by the class-specific edge labelling."

We formulate features that respond to characteristic changes in brightness, color, and texture associated with natural boundaries. In order to combine the information from these features in an optimal way, we train a classifier using human labeled images as ground truth. The output of this classifier provides the posterior probability of a boundary at each image location and orientation. We present precision-recall curves showing that the resulting detector significantly outperforms existing approaches. Our two main results are 1) that cue combination can be performed adequately with a simple linear model and 2) that a proper, explicit treatment of texture is required to detect boundaries in natural images."

Our key objectives are completeness and diversity: every object should have at least one good proposed region, and a diverse set should be top-ranked. Our approach is to generate a set of segmentations by performing graph cuts based on a seed region and a learned affinity function. Then, the regions are ranked using structured learning based on various cues. Our experiments on BSDS and PASCAL VOC 2008 demonstrate our ability to find most objects within a small bag of proposed regions."

It is difficult since often the decision for an edge cannot be made purely based on low level cues such as gradient, instead we need to engage all levels of information, low, middle, and high, in order to decide where to put edges. In this paper we propose a novel supervised learning algorithm for edge and object boundary detection which we refer to as Boosted Edge Learning or BEL for short. A decision of an edge point is made independently at each location in the image; a very large aperture is used providing significant context for each decision. In the learning stage, the algorithm selects and combines a large number of features across different scales in order to learn a discriminative model using an extended version of the Probabilistic Boosting Tree classification algorithm. The learning based framework is highly adaptive and there are no parameters to tune. We show applications for edge detection in a number of specific image domains as well as on natural images. We test on various datasets including the Berkeley dataset and the results obtained are very good."

Such data is useful for supervised learning and quantitative evaluation. To achieve this, we developed a web-based tool that allows easy image annotation and instant sharing of such annotations. Using this annotation tool, we have collected a large dataset that spans many object categories, often containing multiple instances over a wide variety of images. We quantify the contents of the dataset and compare against existing state of the art datasets used for object recognition and detection. Also, we show how to extend the dataset to automatically enhance object labels with WordNet, discover object parts, recover a depth ordering of objects in a scene, and increase the number of labels using minimal user supervision and images from the web.\n"

Our system is able to represent highly variable object classes and achieves state-of-the-art results in the PASCAL object detection challenges. While deformable part models have become quite popular, their value had not been demonstrated on difficult benchmarks such as the PASCAL data sets. Our system relies on new methods for discriminative training with partially labeled data. We combine a margin-sensitive approach for data-mining hard negative examples with a formalism we call latent SVM. A latent SVM is a reformulation of MI--SVM in terms of latent variables. A latent SVM is semiconvex, and the training problem becomes convex once latent information is specified for the positive examples. This leads to an iterative training algorithm that alternates between fixing latent values for positive examples and optimizing the latent SVM objective function."

There are two main steps in this method: a hypothesis generation step and a verification step. In the top-down hypothesis generation step, we design an improved Shape Context feature, which is more robust to object deformation and background clutter. The improved Shape Context is used to generate a set of hypotheses of object locations and figure-ground masks, which have high recall and low precision rate. In the verification step, we first compute a set of feasible segmentations that are consistent with top-down object hypotheses, then we propose a False Positive Pruning (FPP) procedure to prune out false positives. We exploit the fact that false positive regions typically do not align with any feasible image segmentation. Experiments show that this simple framework is capable of achieving both high recall and high precision with only a few positive training examples and that this method can be generalized to many object classes."

After reviewing existing edge and gradient based descriptors, we show experimentally that grids of histograms of oriented gradient (HOG) descriptors significantly outperform existing feature sets for human detection. We study the influence of each stage of the computation on performance, concluding that fine-scale gradients, fine orientation binning, relatively coarse spatial binning, and high-quality local contrast normalization in overlapping descriptor blocks are all important for good results. The new approach gives near-perfect separation on the original MIT pedestrian database, so we introduce a more challenging dataset containing over 1800 annotated human images with a large range of pose variations and backgrounds."

They have recently been generalized to discriminative image understanding tasks such as texture segmentation and feature selection. This paper extends this line of research by proposing a multiscale method to minimize least-squares reconstruction errors and discriminative cost functions under ?0 or ?1 regularization constraints. It is applied to edge detection, category-based edge selection and image classification tasks. Experiments on the Berkeley edge detection benchmark and the PASCAL VOC'05 and VOC'07 datasets demonstrate the computational efficiency of our algorithm and its ability to learn local image descriptions that effectively support demanding computer vision tasks."

Potential completions are generated by building a constrained Delaunay triangulation (CDT) over the set of contours found by a local edge detector. Maximum likelihood parameters for the model are learned from human labeled ground truth. Using held out test data, we measure how the model, by incorporating continuity structure, improves boundary detection over the local edge detector. We also compare performance with a baseline local classifier that operates on pairs of edgels. Both algorithms consistently dominate the low-level boundary detector at all thresholds. To our knowledge, this is the first time that curvilinear continuity has been shown quantitatively useful for a large variety of natural images. Better boundary detection has immediate application in the problem of object detection and recognition"

In this paper we develop a new algorithm for detecting people using poselets. Unlike that work which used 3D annotations of keypoints, we use only 2D annotations which are much easier for naive human annotators. The main algorithmic contribution is in how we use the pattern of poselet activations. Individual poselet activations are noisy, but considering the spatial context of each can provide vital disambiguating information, just as object detection can be improved by considering the detection scores of nearby objects in the scene. This can be done by training a two-layer feed-forward network with weights set using a max margin technique. The refined poselet activations are then clustered into mutually consistent hypotheses where consistency is based on empirically determined spatial keypoint distributions. Finally, bounding boxes are predicted for each person hypothesis and shape masks are aligned to edges in the image to provide a segmentation. To the best of our knowledge, the resulting system is the current best performer on the task of people detection and segmentation with an average precision of 47.8% and 40.5% respectively on PASCAL VOC 2009."

Our contour detector combines multiple local cues into a globalization framework based on spectral clustering. Our segmentation algorithm consists of generic machinery for transforming the output of any contour detector into a hierarchical region tree. In this manner, we reduce the problem of image segmentation to that of contour detection. Extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that both our contour detection and segmentation methods significantly outperform competing algorithms. The automatically generated hierarchical segmentations can be interactively refined by user-specified annotations. Computation at multiple image resolutions provides a means of coupling our system to recognition applications."

                "text": "We introduce a novel topological formulation for contour grouping. Our grouping criterion, called untangling cycles, exploits the inherent topological 1D structure of salient contours to extract them from the otherwise 2D image clutter. To define a measure for topological classification robust to clutter and broken edges, we use a graph formulation instead of the standard computational topology. The key insight is that a pronounced ID contour should have a clear ordering of edges, to which all graph edges adhere, and no long range entanglements persist. Finding the contour grouping by optimizing these topological criteria is challenging. We introduce a novel concept of circular embedding to encode this combinatorial task. Our solution leads to computing the dominant complex eigenvectors/eigenvalues of the random walk matrix of the contour grouping graph. We demonstrate major improvements over state-of-the-art approaches on challenging real images."
