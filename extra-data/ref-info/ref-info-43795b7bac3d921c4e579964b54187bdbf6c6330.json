In this paper, we present a generative model based on a deep recurrent architecture that combines recent advances in computer vision and machine translation and that can be used to generate natural sentences describing an image. The model is trained to maximize the likelihood of the target description sentence given the training image. Experiments on several datasets show the accuracy of the model and the fluency of the language it learns solely from image descriptions. Our model is often quite accurate, which we verify both qualitatively and quantitatively. For instance, while the current state-of-the-art BLEU-1 score (the higher the better) on the Pascal dataset is 25, our approach yields 59, to be compared to human performance around 69. We also show BLEU-1 score improvements on Flickr30k, from 56 to 66, and on SBU, from 19 to 28. Lastly, on the newly released COCO dataset, we achieve a BLEU-4 of 27.7, which is the current state-of-the-art."

Our pipeline effectively unifies joint image-text embedding models with multimodal neural language models. We introduce the structure-content neural language model that disentangles the structure of a sentence to its content, conditioned on representations produced by the encoder. The encoder allows one to rank images and sentences while the decoder can generate novel descriptions from scratch. Using LSTM to encode sentences, we match the state-of-the-art performance on Flickr8K and Flickr30K without using object detections. We also set new best results when using the 19-layer Oxford convolutional network. Furthermore we show that with linear encoders, the learned embedding space captures multimodal regularities in terms of vector space arithmetic e.g. *image of a blue car* - \"blue\" + \"red\" is near images of red cars. Sample captions generated for 800 images are made available for comparison."

Although DNNs work well whenever large labeled training sets are available, they cannot be used to map sequences to sequences. In this paper, we present a general end-to-end approach to sequence learning that makes minimal assumptions on the sequence structure. Our method uses a multilayered Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to map the input sequence to a vector of a fixed dimensionality, and then another deep LSTM to decode the target sequence from the vector. Our main result is that on an English to French translation task from the WMT-14 dataset, the translations produced by the LSTM achieve a BLEU score of 34.8 on the entire test set, where the LSTM's BLEU score was penalized on out-of-vocabulary words. Additionally, the LSTM did not have difficulty on long sentences. For comparison, a phrase-based SMT system achieves a BLEU score of 33.3 on the same dataset. When we used the LSTM to rerank the 1000 hypotheses produced by the aforementioned SMT system, its BLEU score increases to 36.5, which is close to the previous state of the art. The LSTM also learned sensible phrase and sentence representations that are sensitive to word order and are relatively invariant to the active and the passive voice. Finally, we found that reversing the order of the words in all source sentences (but not target sentences) improved the LSTM's performance markedly, because doing so introduced many short term dependencies between the source and the target sentence which made the optimization problem easier."

We propose a strategy for generating textual descriptions of videos by using a factor graph to combine visual detections with language statistics. We use state-of-the-art visual recognition systems to obtain confidences on entities, activities, and scenes present in the video. Our factor graph model combines these detection confidences with probabilistic knowledge mined from text corpora to estimate the most likely subject, verb, object, and place. Results on YouTube videos show that our approach improves both the joint detection of these latent, diverse sentence components and the detection of some individual components when compared to using the vision system alone, as well as over a previous n-gram language-modeling approach. The joint detection allows us to automatically generate more accurate, richer sentential descriptions of videos with a wide array of possible content."

In order to provide natural language descriptions for visual content, this paper combines two important ingredients. First, we generate a rich semantic representation of the visual content including e.g. object and activity labels. To predict the semantic representation we learn a CRF to model the relationships between different components of the visual input. And second, we propose to formulate the generation of natural language as a machine translation problem using the semantic representation as source language and the generated sentences as target language. For this we exploit the power of a parallel corpus of videos and textual descriptions and adapt statistical machine translation to translate between our two languages. We evaluate our video descriptions on the TACoS dataset, which contains video snippets aligned with sentence descriptions. Using automatic evaluation and human judgments we show significant improvements over several baseline approaches, motivated by prior work. Our translation approach also shows improvements over related work on an image description task."

We develop a novel recurrent convolutional architecture suitable for large-scale visual learning which is end-to-end trainable, and demonstrate the value of these models on benchmark video recognition tasks, image description and retrieval problems, and video narration challenges. In contrast to current models which assume a fixed spatio-temporal receptive field or simple temporal averaging for sequential processing, recurrent convolutional models are \u201cdoubly deep\u201d in that they can be compositional in spatial and temporal \u201clayers\u201d. Such models may have advantages when target concepts are complex and/or training data are limited. Learning long-term dependencies is possible when nonlinearities are incorporated into the network state updates. Long-term RNN models are appealing in that they directly can map variable-length inputs (e.g., video frames) to variable length outputs (e.g., natural language text) and can model complex temporal dynamics; yet they can be optimized with backpropagation. Our recurrent long-term models are directly connected to modern visual convnet models and can be jointly trained to simultaneously learn temporal dynamics and convolutional perceptual representations. Our results show such models have distinct advantages over state-of-the-art models for recognition or generation which are separately defined and/or optimized."

It directly models the probability distribution of generating a word given previous words and the image. Image descriptions are generated by sampling from this distribution. The model consists of two sub-networks: a deep recurrent neural network for sentences and a deep convolutional network for images. These two sub-networks interact with each other in a multimodal layer to form the whole m-RNN model. The effectiveness of our model is validated on three benchmark datasets (IAPR TC-12, Flickr 8K, and Flickr 30K). Our model outperforms the state-of-the-art generative method. In addition, the m-RNN model can be applied to retrieval tasks for retrieving images or sentences, and achieves significant performance improvement over the state-of-the-art methods which directly optimize the ranking objective function for retrieval."

Solutions to image description have either focused on a top-down approach of generating language through combinations of object detections and language models or bottom-up propagation of keyword tags from training images to test images through probabilistic or nearest neighbor techniques. In contrast, describing videos with natural language is a less studied problem. In this paper, we combine ideas from the bottom-up and top-down approaches to image description and propose a method for video description that captures the most relevant contents of a video in a natural language description. We propose a hybrid system consisting of a low level multimodal latent topic model for initial keyword annotation, a middle level of concept detectors and a high level module to produce final lingual descriptions. We compare the results of our system to human descriptions in both short and long forms on two datasets, and demonstrate that final system output has greater agreement with the human descriptions than any single level."

However, most existing approaches focus on exploring the language model upon on a fixed visual model. In this paper, we propose a unified framework that jointly models video and the corresponding text sentences. The framework consists of three parts: a compositional semantics language model, a deep video model and a joint embedding model. In our language model, we propose a dependency-tree structure model that embeds sentence into a continuous vector space, which preserves visually grounded meanings and word order. In the visual model, we leverage deep neural networks to capture essential semantic information from videos. In the joint embedding model, we minimize the distance of the outputs of the deep video model and compositional language model in the joint space, and update these two models jointly. Based on these three parts, our system is able to accomplish three tasks: 1) natural language generation, and 2) video retrieval and 3) language retrieval. In the experiments, the results show our approach outperforms SVM, CRF and CCA baselines in predicting Subject-Verb-Object triplet and natural sentence generation, and is better than CCA in video retrieval and language retrieval tasks.\u00a0\n \n"

We use multiple instance learning to train visual detectors for words that commonly occur in captions, including many different parts of speech such as nouns, verbs, and adjectives. The word detector outputs serve as conditional inputs to a maximum-entropy language model. The language model learns from a set of over 400,000 image descriptions to capture the statistics of word usage. We capture global semantics by re-ranking caption candidates using sentence-level features and a deep multimodal similarity model. Our system is state-of-the-art on the official Microsoft COCO benchmark, producing a BLEU-4 score of 29.1%. When human judges compare the system captions to ones written by other people on our held-out test set, the system captions have equal or better quality 34% of the time."

Our generic tasks may differ significantly from the originally trained tasks and there may be insufficient labeled or unlabeled data to conventionally train or adapt a deep architecture to the new tasks. We investigate and visualize the semantic clustering of deep convolutional features with respect to a variety of such tasks, including scene recognition, domain adaptation, and fine-grained recognition challenges. We compare the efficacy of relying on various network levels to define a fixed feature, and report novel results that significantly outperform the state-of-the-art on several important vision challenges. We are releasing DeCAF, an open-source implementation of these deep convolutional activation features, along with all associated network parameters to enable vision researchers to be able to conduct experimentation with deep representations across a range of visual concept learning paradigms."

We show that this knowledge, automatically mined from web-scale text corpora, enhances the triplet selection algorithm by providing it contextual information and leads to a four-fold increase in activity identification. Unlike previous methods, our approach can annotate arbitrary videos without requiring the expensive collection and annotation of a similar training video corpus. We evaluate our technique against a baseline that does not use text-mined knowledge and show that humans prefer our descriptions 61% of the time.\n \n"

Our interest lies in empirically evaluating the expressiveness and the learnability of LSTMs in the sequence-to-sequence regime by training them to evaluate short computer programs, a domain that has traditionally been seen as too complex for neural networks. We consider a simple class of programs that can be evaluated with a single left-to-right pass using constant memory. Our main result is that LSTMs can learn to map the character-level representations of such programs to their correct outputs. Notably, it was necessary to use curriculum learning, and while conventional curriculum learning proved ineffective, we developed a new variant of curriculum learning that improved our networks' performance in all experimental conditions. The improved curriculum had a dramatic impact on an addition problem, making it possible to train an LSTM to add two 9-digit numbers with 99% accuracy."

In this paper, we tackle the challenge of recognizing and describing activities ``in-the-wild''. We present a solution that takes a short video clip and outputs a brief sentence that sums up the main activity in the video, such as the actor, the action and its object. Unlike previous work, our approach works on out-of-domain actions: it does not require training videos of the exact activity. If it cannot find an accurate prediction for a pre-trained model, it finds a less specific answer that is also plausible from a pragmatic standpoint. We use semantic hierarchies learned from the data to help to choose an appropriate level of generalization, and priors learned from Web-scale natural language corpora to penalize unlikely combinations of actors/actions/objects, we also use a Web-scale language model to ``fill in'' novel verbs, i.e. when the verb does not appear in the training set. We evaluate our method on a large YouTube corpus and demonstrate it is able to generate short sentence descriptions of video clips better than baseline approaches."

We then introduce a structured max-margin objective that allows our model to explicitly associate these fragments across modalities. Extensive experimental evaluation shows that reasoning on both the global level of images and sentences and the finer level of their respective fragments improves performance on image-sentence retrieval tasks. Additionally, our model provides interpretable predictions for the image-sentence retrieval task since the inferred inter-modal alignment of fragments is explicit."

The work starts with implementation of conventional image processing techniques to extract high level features from video. These features are converted into natural language descriptions using context free grammar. Although feature extraction processes are erroneous at various levels, we explore approaches to putting them together to produce a coherent description. Evaluation is made by calculating ROUGE scores between human annotated and machine generated descriptions. Further we introduce a task based evaluation by human subjects which provides qualitative evaluation of generated descriptions."

The neural machine translation models often consist of an encoder and a decoder. The encoder extracts a fixed-length representation from a variable-length input sentence, and the decoder generates a correct translation from this representation. In this paper, we focus on analyzing the properties of the neural machine translation using two models; RNN Encoder--Decoder and a newly proposed gated recursive convolutional neural network. We show that the neural machine translation performs relatively well on short sentences without unknown words, but its performance degrades rapidly as the length of the sentence and the number of unknown words increase. Furthermore, we find that the proposed gated recursive convolutional network learns a grammatical structure of a sentence automatically."

The system is based on a combination of the deep bidirectional LSTM recurrent neural network architecture and the Connectionist Temporal Classification objective function. A modification to the objective function is introduced that trains the network to minimise the expectation of an arbitrary transcription loss function. This allows a direct optimisation of the word error rate, even in the absence of a lexicon or language model. The system achieves a word error rate of 27.3% on the Wall Street Journal corpus with no prior linguistic information, 21.9% with only a lexicon of allowed words, and 8.2% with a trigram language model. Combining the network with a baseline system further reduces the error rate to 6.7%."

Unlike prior computer-vision approaches that learn from videos with verb labels or images with noun labels, our labels are sentences containing nouns, verbs, prepositions, adjectives, and adverbs. The correspondence between words and concepts in the video is learned in an unsupervised fashion, even when the video depicts simultaneous events described by multiple sentences or when different aspects of a single event are described with multiple sentences.

On the test data, we achieved top-1 and top-5 error rates of 37.5% and 17.0%, respectively, which is considerably better than the previous state-of-the-art. The neural network, which has 60 million parameters and 650,000 neurons, consists of five convolutional layers, some of which are followed by max-pooling layers, and three fully connected layers with a final 1000-way softmax. To make training faster, we used non-saturating neurons and a very efficient GPU implementation of the convolution operation. To reduce overfitting in the fully connected layers we employed a recently developed regularization method called \"dropout\" that proved to be very effective. We also entered a variant of this model in the ILSVRC-2012 competition and achieved a winning top-5 test error rate of 15.3%, compared to 26.2% achieved by the second-best entry."

The framework is a BSD-licensed C++ library with Python and MATLAB bindings for training and deploying general-purpose convolutional neural networks and other deep models efficiently on commodity architectures. Caffe fits industry and internet-scale media needs by CUDA GPU computation, processing over 40 million images a day on a single K40 or Titan GPU (approx 2 ms per image). By separating model representation from actual implementation, Caffe allows experimentation and seamless switching among platforms for ease of development and deployment from prototyping machines to cloud environments. Caffe is maintained and developed by the Berkeley Vision and Learning Center (BVLC) with the help of an active community of contributors on GitHub. It powers ongoing research projects, large-scale industrial applications, and startup prototypes in vision, speech, and multimedia."

Although automated discovery of semantically related words from text improves free text query understanding, translating videos into text summaries facilitates better video search particularly in the absence of accompanying text. In this paper, we propose a multimedia topic modeling framework suitable for providing a basis for automatically discovering and translating semantically related words obtained from textual metadata of multimedia documents to semantically related videos or frames from videos.\n The framework jointly models video and text and is flexible enough to handle different types of document features in their constituent domains such as discrete and real valued features from videos representing actions, objects, colors and scenes as well as discrete features from text. Our proposed models show much better fit to the multimedia data in terms of held-out data log likelihoods. For a given query video, our models translate low level vision features into bag of keyword summaries which can be further translated using simple natural language generation techniques into human readable paragraphs. We quantitatively compare the results of video to bag of words translation against a state-of-the-art baseline object recognition model from computer vision. We show that text translations from multimodal topic models vastly outperform the baseline on a multimedia dataset downloaded from the Internet."

Major difficulty in transforming video images into textual descriptions is how to bridge a semantic gap between them, which is also known as inverse Hollywood problem. In general, the concepts of events or actions of human can be classified by semantic primitives. By associating these concepts with the semantic features extracted from video images, appropriate syntactic components such as verbs, objects, etc. are determined and then translated into natural language sentences. We also demonstrate the performance of the proposed method by several experiments."

However there is no clear understanding of why they perform so well, or how they might be improved. In this paper we explore both issues. We introduce a novel visualization technique that gives insight into the function of intermediate feature layers and the operation of the classifier. Used in a diagnostic role, these visualizations allow us to find model architectures that outperform Krizhevsky et al on the ImageNet classification benchmark. We also perform an ablation study to discover the performance contribution from different model layers. We show our ImageNet model generalizes well to other datasets: when the softmax classifier is retrained, it convincingly beats the current state-of-the-art results on Caltech-101 and Caltech-256 datasets."

However, existing approaches for automatic video description focus on generating only single sentences and are not able to vary the descriptions\u2019 level of detail. In this paper, we address both of these limitations: for a variable level of detail we produce coherent multi-sentence descriptions of complex videos. To understand the difference between detailed and short descriptions, we collect and analyze a video description corpus of three levels of detail. We follow a two-step approach where we first learn to predict a semantic representation (SR) from video and then generate natural language descriptions from it. For our multi-sentence descriptions we model across-sentence consistency at the level of the SR by enforcing a consistent topic. Human judges rate our descriptions as more readable, correct, and relevant than related work."

We describe a system that can compute a score linking an image to a sentence. This score can be used to attach a descriptive sentence to a given image, or to obtain images that illustrate a given sentence. The score is obtained by comparing an estimate of meaning obtained from the image to one obtained from the sentence. Each estimate of meaning comes from a discriminative procedure that is learned us-ingdata. We evaluate on a novel dataset consisting of human-annotated images. While our underlying estimate of meaning is impoverished, it is sufficient to produce very good quantitative results, evaluated with a novel score that can account for synecdoche."

In this paper we review previous work on audio and video processing, and define the task of Topic-Oriented Multimedia Summarization (TOMS) using natural language generation: given a set of automatically extracted features from a video (such as visual concepts and ASR transcripts) a TOMS system will automatically generate a paragraph of natural language (\"a recounting\"), which summarizes the important information in a video belonging to a certain topic area, and provides explanations for why a video was matched and retrieved. We see this as a first step towards systems that will be able to discriminate visually similar, but semantically different videos, compare two videos and provide textual output or summarize a large number of videos at once. In this paper, we introduce our approach of solving the TOMS problem. We extract visual concept features and ASR transcription features from a given video, and develop a template-based natural language generation system to produce a textual recounting based on the extracted features. We also propose possible experimental designs for continuously evaluating and improving TOMS systems, and present results of a pilot evaluation of our initial system."

Conversely, it also provides validation of existing labels, if any. While training, our method does not assume any explicit manual annotation other than the weak labels already available in the form of video title, description, and tags. Prior work related to such auto-annotation assumed that a vocabulary of labels of interest (e. g., indoor, outdoor, city, landscape) is specified a priori. In contrast, the proposed method begins with an empty vocabulary. It analyzes audiovisual features of 25 million YouTube. com videos -- nearly 150 years of video data -- effectively searching for consistent correlation between these features and text metadata. It autonomously extends the label vocabulary as and when it discovers concepts it can reliably identify, eventually leading to a vocabulary with thousands of labels and growing. We believe that this work significantly extends the state of the art in multimedia data mining, discovery, and organization based on the technical merit of the proposed ideas as well as the enormous scale of the mining exercise in a very challenging, unconstrained, noisy domain."

The highly parallel nature of this data allows us to use simple n-gram comparisons to measure both the semantic adequacy and lexical dissimilarity of paraphrase candidates.

We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O. 1. Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms."

                "text": "In this paper, we present an image parsing to text description (I2T) framework that generates text descriptions of image and video content based on image understanding. The proposed I2T framework follows three steps: 1) input images (or video frames) are decomposed into their constituent visual patterns by an image parsing engine, in a spirit similar to parsing sentences in natural language; 2) the image parsing results are converted into semantic representation in the form of Web ontology language (OWL), which enables seamless integration with general knowledge bases; and 3) a text generation engine converts the results from previous steps into semantically meaningful, human readable, and query-able text reports. The centerpiece of the I2T framework is an and-or graph (AoG) visual knowledge representation, which provides a graphical representation serving as prior knowledge for representing diverse visual patterns and provides top-down hypotheses during the image parsing. The AoG embodies vocabularies of visual elements including primitives, parts, objects, scenes as well as a stochastic image grammar that specifies syntactic relations (i.e., compositional) and semantic relations (e.g., categorical, spatial, temporal, and functional) between these visual elements. Therefore, the AoG is a unified model of both categorical and symbolic representations of visual knowledge. The proposed I2T framework has two objectives. First, we use semiautomatic method to parse images from the Internet in order to build an AoG for visual knowledge representation. Our goal is to make the parsing process more and more automatic using the learned AoG model. Second, we use automatic methods to parse image/video in specific domains and generate text reports that are useful for real-world applications. In the case studies at the end of this paper, we demonstrate two automatic I2T systems: a maritime and urban scene video surveillance system and a real-time automatic driving scene understanding system."

The potential benefit from this source is made more significant due to the enormous amount of language data easily available today. We present a system to automatically generate natural language descriptions from images that exploits both statistics gleaned from parsing large quantities of text data and recognition algorithms from computer vision. The system is very effective at producing relevant sentences for images. It also generates descriptions that are notably more true to the specific image content than previous work."

The evaluation of computer-generated text is a notoriously difficult problem, however, the quality of image descriptions has typically been measured using unigram BLEU and human judgements. The focus of this paper is to determine the correlation of automatic measures with human judgements for this task. We estimate the correlation of unigram and Smoothed BLEU, TER, ROUGE-SU4, and Meteor against human judgements on two data sets. The main finding is that unigram BLEU has a weak correlation, and Meteor has the strongest correlation with human judgements."

This is achieved by gathering images of complex everyday scenes containing common objects in their natural context. Objects are labeled using per-instance segmentations to aid in precise object localization. Our dataset contains photos of 91 objects types that would be easily recognizable by a 4 year old. With a total of 2.5 million labeled instances in 328k images, the creation of our dataset drew upon extensive crowd worker involvement via novel user interfaces for category detection, instance spotting and instance segmentation. We present a detailed statistical analysis of the dataset in comparison to PASCAL, ImageNet, and SUN. Finally, we provide baseline performance analysis for bounding box and segmentation detection results using a Deformable Parts Model."

The challenge has been run annually from 2010 to present, attracting participation from more than fifty institutions. This paper describes the creation of this benchmark dataset and the advances in object recognition that have been possible as a result. We discuss the challenges of collecting large-scale ground truth annotation, highlight key breakthroughs in categorical object recognition, provide a detailed analysis of the current state of the field of large-scale image classification and object detection, and compare the state-of-the-art computer vision accuracy with human accuracy. We conclude with lessons learned in the 5\u00a0years of the challenge, and propose future directions and improvements."

We investigate two related tasks: image caption generalization and generation, where the former is an optional subtask of the latter. The high-level idea of our approach is to harvest expressive phrases (as tree fragments) from existing image descriptions, then to compose a new description by selectively combining the extracted (and optionally pruned) tree fragments. Key algorithmic components are tree composition and compression, both integrating tree structure with sequence structure. Our proposed system attains significantly better performance than previous approaches for both image caption generalization and generation. In addition, our work is the first to show the empirical benefit of automatically generalized captions for composing natural image descriptions."

The summarizer is biased by dependency pattern models towards sentences which contain features typically provided for different scene types such as those of churches, bridges, etc. Our results show that summaries biased by dependency pattern models lead to significantly higher ROUGE scores than both n-gram language models reported in previous work and also Wikipedia baseline summaries. Summaries generated using dependency patterns also lead to more readable summaries than those generated without dependency patterns."

We present a novel combination of standard activity classification, object recognition, and text mining to learn effective activity recognizers without ever explicitly labeling training videos. We cluster verbs used to describe videos to automatically discover classes of activities and produce a labeled training set. This labeled data is then used to train an activity classifier based on spatio-temporal features. Next, text mining is employed to learn the correlations between these verbs and related objects. This knowledge is then used together with the outputs of an off-the-shelf object recognizer and the trained activity classifier to produce an improved activity recognizer. Experiments on a corpus of YouTube videos demonstrate the effectiveness of the overall approach."

This is an enabling technology for content-based video annotation, query and retrieval with applications in Internet video search and video data mining. The method involves identifying objects in the scene, describing their inter-relations, detecting events of interest, and representing them semantically in a human readable and query-able format. The SAVE framework is composed of three main components. The first component is an image parsing engine that performs scene content extraction using bottom-up image analysis and a stochastic attribute image grammar, where we define a visual vocabulary from pixels, primitives, parts, objects and scenes, and specify their spatio-temporal or compositional relations; and a bottom-up top-down strategy is used for inference. The second component is an event inference engine, where the video event markup language (VEML) is adopted for semantic representation, and a grammar-based approach is used for event analysis and detection. The third component is the text generation engine that generates text report using head-driven phrase structure grammar (HPSG). The main contribution of this paper is a framework for an end-to-end system that infers visual events and annotates a large collection of videos. Experiments with maritime and urban scenes indicate the feasibility of the proposed approach."

Unigrams can be matched based on their surface forms, stemmed forms, and meanings; furthermore, METEOR can be easily extended to include more advanced matching strategies. Once all generalized unigram matches between the two strings have been found, METEOR computes a score for this matching using a combination of unigram-precision, unigram-recall, and a measure of fragmentation that is designed to directly capture how well-ordered the matched words in the machine translation are in relation to the reference. We evaluate METEOR by measuring the correlation between the metric scores and human judgments of translation quality. We compute the Pearson R correlation value between its scores and human quality assessments of the LDC TIDES 2003 Arabic-to-English and Chinese-to-English datasets. We perform segment-bysegment correlation, and show that METEOR gets an R correlation value of 0.347 on the Arabic data and 0.331 on the Chinese data. This is shown to be an improvement on using simply unigramprecision, unigram-recall and their harmonic F1 combination. We also perform experiments to show the relative contributions of the various mapping modules."

Therefore, it is crucial for search engines to achieve high accuracy on the topranked documents. While many methods exist for boosting video search performance, they either pay less attention to the above factor or encounter difficulties in practical applications. In this paper, we present a flexible and effective re-ranking method, called CR-Re-ranking, to improve the retrieval effectiveness. To offer high accuracy on the top-ranked results, CRRe-ranking employs a cross-reference (CR) strategy to fuse multimodal cues. Specifically, multimodal features are first utilized separately to re-rank the initial returned results at the cluster level, and then all the ranked clusters from different modalities are cooperatively used to infer the shots with high relevance. Experimental results show that the search quality, especially on the top-ranked results, is improved significantly."

In general, statistical techniques allow automatic translation systems to be built quickly for any language-pair using only translated texts and generic software. With increasing globalization, statistical machine translation will be central to communication and commerce. Based on courses and tutorials, and classroom-tested globally, it is ideal for instruction or self-study, for advanced undergraduates and graduate students in computer science and/or computational linguistics, and researchers in natural language processing. The companion website provides open-source corpora and tool-kits."

This paper proposes a flexible multi-modal clustering method for web videos. This method achieves web video representation and similarity measurement by integrating the extracted visual features, semantic features and text features of videos to describe a web video more accurately. With the multi-modal combined similarity as input, the affinity propagation algorithm is employed for the clustering procedure. The clustering method is evaluated by experiments conducted on web video dataset and has a better performance than existing methods."
