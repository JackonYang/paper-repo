The technique takes advantage of the fact that cross-language lexicalizations of the same concept tend to be consistent, preserving some core element of its semantics, and yet also variable, reflecting differing translator preferences and the influence of context. Working with parallel corpora introduces an extra complication for evaluation, since it is difficult to find a corpus that is both sense tagged and parallel with another language; therefore we use pseudo-translations, created by machine translation systems, in order to make possible the evaluation of the approach against a standard test set. The results demonstrate that word-level translation correspondences are a valuable source of information for sense disambiguation."

Incorporating word-level alignments into the parameter estimation of the IBM models reduces alignment error rate and increases the Bleu score when compared to training the same models only on sentence-aligned data. On the Verbmobil data set, we attain a 38% reduction in the alignment error rate and a higher Bleu score with half as many training examples.

This system is based on phrase-to-phrase translations extracted from a bilingual corpus. We experimented with two different phrase extraction methods; PESA on-the-fly phrase extraction and alignment free extraction method. The translation model, language model and other features were combined in a log-linear model during decoding. We present our experiments on model adaptation for new data in a different domain, as well as combining different translation hypotheses to obtain better translations. We participated in the supplied data track for manual transcriptions in the translation directions: ArabicEnglish, Chinese-English, Japanese-English and KoreanEnglish. For Chinese-English direction we also worked on ASR output of the supplied data, and with additional data in unrestricted and C-STAR tracks."

Within our framework, we carry out a large number of experiments to understand better and explain why phrase-based models out-perform word-based models. Our empirical results, which hold for all examined language pairs, suggest that the highest levels of performance can be obtained through relatively simple means: heuristic learning of phrase translations from word-based alignments and lexical weighting of phrase translations. Surprisingly, learning phrases longer than three words and learning phrases from high-accuracy word-level alignment models does not have a strong impact on performance. Learning only syntactically motivated phrases degrades the performance of our systems."

We also show some of the ways in which the theme/rheme specifications within the semantic net influence lexical and syntactic choices during realization.

The units of translation are blocks -- pairs of phrases. During decoding, we use a block unigram model and a word-based trigram language model. During training, the blocks are learned from source interval projections using an underlying high-precision word alignment. The system performance is significantly increased by applying a novel block extension algorithm using an additional high-recall word alignment. The blocks are further filtered using unigram-count selection criteria. The system has been successfully test on a Chinese-English and an Arabic-English translation task."

We consider the five alignment models presented in Brown, Della Pietra, Della Pietra, and Mercer (1993), the hidden Markov alignment model, smoothing techniques, and refinements. These statistical models are compared with two heuristic models based on the Dice coefficient. We present different methods for combining word alignments to perform a symmetrization of directed statistical alignment models. As evaluation criterion, we use the quality of the resulting Viterbi alignment compared to a manually produced reference alignment. We evaluate the models on the German-English Verbmobil task and the French-English Hansards task. We perform a detailed analysis of various design decisions of our statistical alignment system and evaluate these on training corpora of various sizes. An important result is that refined alignment models with a first-order dependence and a fertility model yield significantly better results than simple heuristic models. In the Appendix, we present an efficient training algorithm for the alignment models presented."

We define a concept of word-by-word alignment between such pairs of sentences. For any given pair of such sentences each of our models assigns a probability to each of the possible word-by-word alignments. We give an algorithm for seeking the most probable of these alignments. Although the algorithm is suboptimal, the alignment thus obtained accounts well for the word-by-word relationships in the pair of sentences. We have a great deal of data in French and English from the proceedings of the Canadian Parliament. Accordingly, we have restricted our work to these two languages; but we feel that because our algorithms have minimal linguistic content they would work well on other pairs of languages. We also feel, again because of the minimal linguistic content of our algorithms, that it is reasonable to argue that word-by-word alignments are inherent in any sufficiently large bilingual corpus."

There are two important aspects to person-machine communication: understanding and generating. While natural language understanding has been a major focus of research, natural language generation is a relatively new and increasingly active field of research. This book presents an overview of the state of the art in natural language generation, describing both new results and directions for new research. The principal emphasis of natural language generation is not only to facili tate the use of computers but also to develop a computational theory of human language ability. In doing so, it is a tool for extending, clarifying and verifying theories that have been put forth in linguistics, psychology and sociology about how people communicate. A natural language generator will typically have access to a large body of knowledge from which to select information to present to users as well as numer of expressing it. Generating a text can thus be seen as a problem of ous ways decision-making under multiple constraints: constraints from the propositional knowledge at hand, from the linguistic tools available, from the communicative goals and intentions to be achieved, from the audience the text is aimed at and from the situation and past discourse. Researchers in generation try to identify the factors involved in this process and determine how best to represent the factors and their dependencies."
