An object is represented by a set of high-dimensional iconic feature vectors comprised of the responses of derivatives of Gaussian filters at a range of orientations and scales. Since these filters can be shown to form the eigenvectors of arbitrary images containing both natural and man-made structures, they are well-suited for indexing in disparate domains. The indexing algorithm uses an active vision system in conjunction with a modified form of Kanerva's (1988, 1993) sparse distributed memory which facilitates interpolation between views and provides a convenient platform for learning the association between an object's appearance and its identity. The robustness of the indexing method was experimentally confirmed by subjecting the method to a range of viewing conditions and the accuracy was verified using a well-known model database containing a number of complex 3D objects under varying pose.<<ETX>>"
