                "text": "The adaptive line enhancer (ALE) was first described as a practical technique for separating the periodic from the broad-band components of an input signal and for detecting the presence of a sinusoid in white noise. Subsequent work has shown that this adaptive filtering structure is applicable to spectral estimation, predictive deconvolution, speech processing, interference rejection, and other applications which have historically used matrix inversion or Levinson's algorithm techniques. This paper uses an eigenvalue-eigenvector analysis of the expected ALE impulse response vector to demonstrate properties of the convergent filter and to quantify the convergence time and characteristics of the ALE. In particular the ALE's response to a sinusoid plus white noise input is derived and compared to a computer simulation of the ALE with such an input. The eigenvalue-eigenvector technique is then used to evaluate the ALE's performance as an adaptive prewhitener for autoregressive (AR) models with white observation noise. A method is demonstrated which prevents the problem of spectral estimation bias which usually accrues from the observation noise."

The estimated parameter is termed the digital instantaneous frequency of the input and is defined in a manner similar to that used previously to describe frequency-modulated, continuous-time signals. Instantaneous frequency estimates are derived from a spectral computation based on the use of an adaptive linear prediction filter. The proposed method differs from previous techniques in that the coefficients of this filter are continuously updated as each new input data sample is received using a simple time-domain algorithm, A derivation of the algorithm and its properties are presented. Numerical examples are included which illustrate the properties of the procedure."

Although an algorithm for automatically extracting the formants from the raw data is not presented here, for nearly 90 percent of the time an automatic decision algorithm is trivial, namely, the first three peaks of the reciprocal of the inverse filter spectrum define the first three formants."

In contrast with conventional echo suppressors, the device described achieves echo-cancellation without interrupting the return path. A replica of the echo is synthesized and subtracted from the return signal. The replica is synthesized by means of a filter which, under the control of a feedback loop, adapts to the transmission characteristic of the echo path and tracks variations of the path that may occur during a conversation. The adaptive control loop is described by a set of simultaneous, nonlinear, first-order differential equations. It is shown that under ideal conditions, the echo converges to zero. Estimates of the rate of convergence are obtained. Effects of noise are discussed. The results of computer simulations of various alternative configurations of the system are described."

An automatic equalizer was shown which used this algorithm during a training period of test pulse transmission prior to actual data transmission. The present paper extends the utility of this automatic equalization system by permitting it to change settings during the data transmission period in response to changes in transmission channel characteristics. Three schemes for accomplishing this adaptive equalization without the use of test signals are described and evaluated analytically. The first such scheme uses periodic estimates of channel response based on the received data signal to adjust or update the transversal filter settings. The second system is entirely digital and employs a sequential testing procedure to make adjustments aperiodically as they are required by changing conditions. The third system uses information obtained from a forward-acting error correction system for the purposes of adaptive equalization. Of the three systems described, the second is not only theoretically superior, but is practically the simplest. Experimental results for this second system are described."

Filters of this type are generally implemented in tapped-delay-line form and have been widely used in linear prediction filtering, spectral estimation and noise cancelling applications. Recently, an alternative implementation, called the lattice structure, has been proposed for fixed-coefficient recursive and non-recursive digital filters. The purpose of this paper is to present a class of adaptive algorithms suitable for use with the lattice structure, and to compare these algorithms with the conventional tapped-delay-line implementation. It is suggested that the successive orthogonalization offered by the lattice may provide convergence advantages not obtainable with tapped-delay-line methods."

It plays a big role in telecommunications as well, and in this paper, we will discuss how and why echo cancelers are becoming the dominant means to control echo in the telephone system [1,2]. Echo in the telephone system is generally undesirable but .unavoidable. Consider a typical toll call (Fig. 1) in which the transmission medium is a satellite link instead of wires. The local link from phone to central office is a bidirectional \u201ctwo-wire\u201d loop while the satellite link uses two separate unidirectional channels for \u201dfour-wire\u201d transmission. The use of separate channels for the two directions of transmission is a necessary characteristic of long distance transmission links. The conversion between the two-wire and four-wire parts of the overall transmission link is done in the device called a \u201chybrid\u201d. Ideally, a hybrid circuit couples all energy on the incoming branch of the four-wire circuit into the two-wire circuit, and none of the incoming four-wire signal should be transferred to the outgoing branch of the four-wire circuit. The hybrids do not operate perfectly, however, because of impedance mismatch problems. As a result, some energy on the in-"

                "text": "Echo of a trasmitted signal can occur in the telephone network and is sometimes a disturbing phenomenon. Various methods of echo control have been used for over 50 years but recent introduction of transmission delays in excess of 300 ms, over satellite circuits, has resulted in a general reexamination of suppression methods. This led to development of the echo canceller. Adaptive echo cancellation is accomplished by automatically synthesizing a replica of the echo path response, convolving the incoming signal with the replica and subtracting the resulting echo estimate from the echo path output. Transmission is not thereby interrupted in any way and two-way information transmission proceeds normally with little or no echo. Detailed mathematical formulations for the convergence properties of such devices allow understanding of the effects of various hardware configurations and input signal properties. Echo cancellers may be applied to the network in a number of ways and the development of a VLSI canceller chip promises inexpensive implementation of these applications. Worldwide tests have shown the effectiveness of cancellation methods for satellite transmission."

He eventually became John von Neumann's research assistant, and it was one of von Neumann's inspiring lectures that spurred Halmos to write Finite Dimensional Vector Spaces. The book brought him instant fame as an expositor of mathematics. Finite Dimensional Vector Spaces combines algebra and geometry to discuss the three-dimensional area where vectors can be plotted. The book broke ground as the first formal introduction to linear algebra, a branch of modern mathematics that studies vectors and vector spaces. The book continues to exert its influence sixty years after publication, as linear algebra is now widely used, not only in mathematics but also in the natural and social sciences, for studying such subjects as weather problems, traffic flow, electronic circuits, and population genetics. In 1983 Halmos received the coveted Steele Prize for exposition from the American Mathematical Society for \"his many graduate texts in mathematics dealing with finite dimensional vector spaces, measure theory, ergodic theory, and Hilbert space.\""
