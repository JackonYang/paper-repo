In a first stage, the method automatically identifies distinctive parts in the training set by applying a clustering algorithm to patterns selected by an interest operator.

The training images contain a preponderance of clutter and learning is unsupervised. Our models represent objects as probabilistic constellations of rigid parts (features). The variability within a class is represented by a join probability density function on the shape of the constellation and the appearance of the parts. Our method automatically identifies distinctive features in the training set. The set of model parameters is then learned using expectation maximization. When trained on different, unlabeled and unsegmented views of a class of objects, each component of the mixture model can adapt to represent a subset of the views. Similarly, different component models can also \"specialize\" on sub-classes of an object class. Experiments on images of human heads, leaves from different species of trees, and motor-cars demonstrate that the method works well over a wide variety of objects."

We introduce a simplified model of a deformable object class and derive the optimal detector for this model.

A cousin of the optimal detector is developed which uses \u201csoft\u201d part detectors with a probabilistic description of the spatial arrangement of the parts. Spatial arrangements are modeled probabilistically using shape statistics to achieve invariance to translation, rotation, and scaling. Improved recognition performance over methods based on \u201chard\u201d part detectors is demonstrated for the problem of face detection in cluttered scenes."

We have chosen a functional form of the posterior probability function that captures the joint statistics of local appearance and position on the object as well as the statistics of local appearance in the visual world at large. We use a discrete representation of local appearance consisting of approximately 10/sup 6/ patterns. We compute an estimate of P(object/image) in closed form by counting the frequency of occurrence of these patterns over various sets of training images. We have used this method for detecting human faces from frontal and profile views. The algorithm for frontal views has shown a detection rate of 93.0% with 88 false alarms on a set of 125 images containing 483 faces combining the MIT test set of Sung and Poggio with the CMU test sets of Rowley, Baluja, and Kanade. The algorithm for detection of profile views has also demonstrated promising results."

We focus on a model where objects are represented as constellations of rigid features (parts). Variability is represented by a joint probability density function (PDF) on the shape of the constellation. In the first stage, the method automatically identifies distinctive features in the training set using an interest operator followed by vector quantization. The set of model parameters, including the shape PDF, is then learned using expectation maximization. Experiments show good generalization performance to novel viewpoints and unseen faces. Performance is above 90% correct with less than 1 s computation time per image."

In some cases, for example with human faces, the objects in a class are visually similar and form a visual object class. In other cases, say chairs, objects in the class may not look at all alike|the only similarities are in function. Recognition of functional object classes requires higher-level cognitive reasoning, we restrict here our attention to visual object classes. The main diiculty in object recognition is the problem of invariance. The pixel representation provided by the camera is dependent upon the lighting conditions, object pose, camera position, etc. Further, there is inherent variability between diierent instances from the same object class. Our approach to this problem is to model an object class as a set of local parts arranged in a deformable spatial connguration. For example, human faces consist of parts such as the eyes, nose, and mouth whose positions in the image plane vary with pose and expression as well as from individual to individual. The allowed object deformations are represented through shape statistics, which are learned from examples. Instances of an object in an image are detected by nding the appropriate features in the correct spatial connguration. The algorithm is robust with respect to partial occlusion, detector false alarms, and missed features. A 94% success rate is demonstrated for the problem of locating quasi-frontal views of faces in cluttered scenes."

The dynamic link architecture exploits correlations in the fine-scale temporal structure of cellular signals to group neurons dynamically into higher-order entities. These entities represent a rich structure and can code for high-level objects. To demonstrate the capabilities of the dynamic link architecture, a program was implemented that can recognize human faces and other objects from video images. Memorized objects are represented by sparse graphs, whose vertices are labeled by a multiresolution description in terms of a local power spectrum, and whose edges are labeled by geometrical distance vectors. Object recognition can be formulated as elastic graph matching, which is performed here by stochastic optimization of a matching cost function. The implementation on a transputer network achieved recognition of human faces and office objects from gray-level camera images. The performance of the program is evaluated by a statistical analysis of recognition results from a portrait gallery comprising images of 87 persons. >"

This paradigm enables a unified approach to rigid object recognition under different viewing transformation assumptions both for 2-D and 3-D objects obtained by different sensors, e.g. vision, range, tactile. It is based on an intensive off-line model preprocessing (learning) stage, where model information is indexed into a hash-table using minimal, transformation invariant features. This enables the on-line recognition algorithm to be particularly efficient. The algorithm is straightforwardly parallelizable. Initial experimentation of the technique has led to successful recognition of both 2-D and 3-D objects in cluttered scenes from an arbitrary viewpoint. We, also, compare the Geometric Hashing with the Hough Transform and the alignment techniques. Extensions of the basic paradigm which reduce its worst case recognition complexity are discussed."

A method is described for generating a similar flexible shape model automatically from real image data. A cubic B-spline is used as the shape vector for training the model. Large training sets are used to generate a robust model of the human profile for use in the labelling and tracking of pedestrians in real-world scenes.

The method alternately hypothesizes feature pairings and estimates a viewpoint transformation from those pairings; at each stage a refined transformation estimate is used to suggest additional pairings. This paper extends iterative alignment in the domain of 2D similarity transformations so that it represents the uncertainty in the position of each model and image feature, and that of the transformation estimate. A model describes probabilistically the significance, position, and intrinsic attributes of each feature, plus topological relations among features. A measure of the match between a model and an image integrates all four of these, and leads to an efficient matching procedure called probabilistic alignment. That procedure supports both recognition and a learning procedure for acquiring models from training images. By explicitly representing uncertainty, one model can satisfactorily describe appearance over a wider range of viewing conditions. Thus, when models represent 2D characteristic views of a 3D object, fewer models are needed. Experiments demonstrating the effectiveness of this approach are reported."

Our experiments show that our system is very successful in analyzing cluttered scenes. The system architecture goes beyond classical neural networks by making extensive use of flexible links between units, as proposed in the dynamic link architecture. The present implementation is, however, rather algorithmic in style and is to be regarded as a pilot study that is preparing the way for a detailed implementation of the architecture."

We divide detection into visual selection and final classification, concentrating on the former: drastically reducing the number of candidate regions that require further, usually more intensive, processing, but with a minimum of computation and missed detections. Bottom-up processing is based on local groupings of edge fragments constrained by loose geometrical relationships. They have no a priori semantic or geometric interpretation. The role of training is to select special groupings that are moderately likely at certain places on the object but rare in the background. We show that the statistics in both populations are stable. The candidate regions are those that contain global arrangements of several local groupings. Whereas our model was not conceived to explain brain functions, it does cohere with evidence about the functions of neurons in V1 and V2, such as responses to coarse or incomplete patterns (e.g., illusory contours) and to scale and translation invariance in IT. Finally, the algorithm is applied to face and symbol detection."

Intuitively, given a set of points which belong to either of two classes, a linear SVM finds the hyperplane leaving the largest possible fraction of points of the same class on the same side, while maximizing the distance of either class from the hyperplane. The hyperplane is determined by a subset of the points of the two classes, named support vectors, and has a number of interesting theoretical properties. The proposed method does not require feature extraction and performs recognition on images regarded as points of a space of high dimension. We illustrate the potential of the recognition system on a database of 7200 images of 100 different objects. The remarkable recognition rates achieved in all the performed experiments indicate that SVMs are well-suited for aspect-based recognition, even in the presence of small amount of occlusions."

This paper demonstrates the use of the AAM's efficient iterative matching scheme for image interpretation. We use the AAM as a basis for face recognition, obtain good results for difficult images. We show how the AAM framework allows identity information to be decoupled from other variation, allowing evidence of identity to be integrated over a sequence. The AAM approach makes optimal use of the evidence from either a single image or image sequence. Since we derive a complete description of a given image our method can be used as the basis for a range of face image interpretation tasks."

A trained classifier determines, based on the difference feature vector measurements, whether or not a human face exists at the current image location.

Among the various frameworks in which pattern recognition has been traditionally formulated, the statistical approach has been most intensively studied and used in practice. More recently, neural network techniques and methods imported from statistical learning theory have been receiving increasing attention. The design of a recognition system requires careful attention to the following issues: definition of pattern classes, sensing environment, pattern representation, feature extraction and selection, cluster analysis, classifier design and learning, selection of training and test samples, and performance evaluation. In spite of almost 50 years of research and development in this field, the general problem of recognizing complex patterns with arbitrary orientation, location, and scale remains unsolved. New and emerging applications, such as data mining, web searching, retrieval of multimedia data, face recognition, and cursive handwriting recognition, require robust and efficient pattern recognition techniques. The objective of this review paper is to summarize and compare some of the well-known methods used in various stages of a pattern recognition system and identify research topics and applications which are at the forefront of this exciting and challenging field."

The mapping is calculated by maximizing the probability of the morph field in a Bayesian framework. In contrast to other techniques this new method needs no training and is derived based on group invariances and expected singularities, only. An infeasible exhaustive search is replaced by an new iterative approximation approach where, in a neighborhood around the current morph field solution, the probability distribution is approximated by a Gaussian probability distribution for which the most likely solution is evaluated by linear algebra techniques. New views are generated by applying linearly interpolated morph fields to the original reference image. Experiments demonstrate that this approach is well suited to interpolate between different views of a single face image or between images of different persons. Finally, a new face recognition algorithm makes use of the fact that morphs among images of a single person are confined to a five-dimensional subspace within the space of all possible morphs."

The eeects of translation, rotation, and scale are eliminated by mapping to a set of shape variables. The constellations are then ranked according to the likelihood that the shape variables correspond to a face versus an alternative model.

The computational approach taken in this system is motivated by both physiology and information theory, as well as by the practical requirements of near-real-time performance and accuracy. Our approach treats the face recognition problem as an intrinsically two-dimensional (2-D) recognition problem rather than requiring recovery of three-dimensional geometry, taking advantage of the fact that faces are normally upright and thus may be described by a small set of 2-D characteristic views. The system functions by projecting face images onto a feature space that spans the significant variations among known face images. The significant features are known as \"eigenfaces,\" because they are the eigenvectors (principal components) of the set of faces; they do not necessarily correspond to features such as eyes, ears, and noses. The projection operation characterizes an individual face by a weighted sum of the eigenface features, and so to recognize a particular face it is necessary only to compare these weights to those of known individuals. Some particular advantages of our approach are that it provides for the ability to learn and later recognize new faces in an unsupervised manner, and that it is easy to implement using a neural network architecture."

Such natural textures arise from spatial variation of two surface attributes: (1) reflectance and (2) surface normal. In this paper, we provide a unified model to address both these aspects of natural texture. The main idea is to construct a vocabulary of prototype tiny surface patches with associated local geometric and photometric properties. We call these 3D textons. Examples might be ridges, grooves, spots or stripes or combinations thereof Associated with each texton is an appearance vector, which characterizes the local irradiance distribution, represented as a set of linear Gaussian derivative filter outputs, under different lighting and viewing conditions. Given a large collection of images of different materials, a clustering approach is used to acquire a small (on the order of 100) 3D texton vocabulary. Given a few (1 to 4) images of any material, it can be characterized using these textons. We demonstrate the application of this representation for recognition of the material viewed under novel lighting and viewing conditions."

Vapnik and his team (AT&T Bell Labs., 1985) that can be seen as a new method for training polynomial, neural network, or Radial Basis Functions classifiers. The decision surfaces are found by solving a linearly constrained quadratic programming problem. This optimization problem is challenging because the quadratic form is completely dense and the memory requirements grow with the square of the number of data points. We present a decomposition algorithm that guarantees global optimality, and can be used to train SVM's over very large data sets. The main idea behind the decomposition is the iterative solution of sub-problems and the evaluation of optimality conditions which are used both to generate improved iterative values, and also establish the stopping criteria for the algorithm. We present experimental results of our implementation of SVM, and demonstrate the feasibility of our approach on a face detection problem that involves a data set of 50,000 data points."

This eliminates the difficult task of manually selecting non-face training examples, which must be chosen to span the entire space of non-face images.

We here demonstrate human face recognition against a gallery of 112 neutral frontal view faces. Probe images are distorted due to rotation in depth and changing facial expression. Probe images and gallery models are represented by layers of neurons interpreted as labeled graphs. Nodes are labeled by local features based on the Gabor wavelet transform. Probe images are matched to the gallery of face models by Dynamic Link Matching. Concurrently with the matching process a simple winner-take-all mechanism identiies the correct model. A dynamic window of attention restricts the match to the part of the image occupied by the face."

A retinally connected neural network examines small windows of an image and decides whether each window contains a face. The system arbitrates between multiple networks to improve performance over a single network. We use a bootstrap algorithm for training the networks, which adds false detections into the training set as training progresses. This eliminates the difficult task of manually selecting non-face training examples, which must be chosen to span the entire space of non-face images. Comparisons with other state-of-the-art face detection systems are presented; our system has better performance in terms of detection and false-positive rates."

In this paper, the Bayesian approach to regularization and model-comparison is demonstrated by studying the inference problem of interpolating noisy data. The concepts and methods described are quite general and can be applied to many other data modeling problems. Regularizing constants are set by examining their posterior probability distribution. Alternative regularizers (priors) and alternative basis sets are objectively compared by evaluating the evidence for them. Occam's razor is automatically embodied by this process. The way in which Bayes infers the values of regularizing constants and noise levels has an elegant interpretation in terms of the effective number of parameters determined by the data set. This framework is due to Gull and Skilling."

Pooling features derived from different texture models, followed by a feature selection results in a substantial improvement in the classification accuracy. We also illustrate the dangers of using feature selection in small sample size situations."

The non-linear selection mechanism is a hierarchy of binary units each of which gates the output of one of the linear units. There are no connections from linear units to binary units, so the generative model can be viewed as a logistic belief net (Neal 1992) which selects a skeleton linear model from among the available linear units. We show that Gibbs sampling can be used to learn the parameters of the linear and binary units even when the sampling is so brief that the Markov chain is far from equilibrium."

                "text": "Biometric studies of the forms of organisms usually consider size and shape variations in the geometric configuration of landmarks, points that correspond biologically from form to form. The size variables may be usefully considered the linear vector space spanned by the set of all distances between pairs of landmarks. The shape of a single triangle AABC of landmarks may be reduced to a single pair of shape coordinates locating the vertex C in the coordinate system with landmark A sent to (0,O) and landmark B to (1,O). A useful space of shape variables is the span of all such shape coordinate pairs for various triples of landmarks. On a convenient null model of identical circular normal perturbations at each landmark independently, one size variable S , which may be taken as the mean square of all the interlandmark distances, has covariance zero with every shape variable. Then associations between shape and size may be tested by the F ratio for multiple regression of S on any basis for shape space. For a single triangle of landmarks, the existence of any mean difference or mean change in shape may be tested by Hotelling's T 2 applied to any pair of shape coordinates for that triangle. When such a difference is statistically significant, it may be interpreted as the ratio of a pair of size variables measured along directions a t an angle averaging 90\" in the samples of forms. One size variable will bear the greatest mean rate or ratio of change between the forms, the other the least. Analysis of configurations of more than three landmarks reduces to consideration of size variables involving at most three landmarks. These techniques are demonstrated in a study of the growth of the head in 62 normal Ann Arbor youth. Each comparison of interest is summarized in its own orthogonal coordinate system, the biorthogonal grid pair."

Beyond the discussion of the whys and wherefores of the logistic function, I also hope to illuminate the general distinction between the \\generative/causal/class-conditional\" and the \\discriminative/diagnostic/ predictive\" directions for the modeling of data. Crudely put, the belief network community has tended to focus on the former while the neural network community has tended to focus on the latter (although there are numerous papers in both communities going against their respective grains). It is the author's view that these two directions are two sides of the same coin, a corollary of which is that the two network-based communities are in closer contact than one might otherwise think. To illustrate some of the issues involved, I discuss the simplest nonlinear neural network|a logistic function of a linear combination of the input variables (also known in statistics as a logistic regression). The logistic function has had a lengthy history in classical statistics and in neural networks. In statistics it plays a leading role in the methodology of logistic regression, where it makes an important contribution to the literature on classi cation. The logistic function has also appeared in many guises in neural network research. In early work, in which continuous time formalisms tended to dominate, it was justi ed via its being the solution to a particular di erential equation. In later work, with the emphasis on discrete time, it was generally used more heuristically as one of the many possible smooth, monotonic \\squashing\" functions that map real values into a bounded interval. More recently, however, with the increasing focus on learning, the probabilistic properties of the logistic function have begun to"

The shape density is written in a closed form, in terms of Kendall's or Bookstein's shape variables. The distribution simplifies considerably in certain cases, including the complex normal, isotropic, circular Markov and equal means cases. Various asymptotic properties of the distribution are investigated, including a large variation distribution and the normal approximation for small variations. The triangle case is considered in particular detail, and we compare the density with simulated densities for some examples. Finally, we consider inference problems, with an application in biology."

Let Ei? denote an independent performance of experiment Ei. Let Pe(E) denote the probability of error resulting from the performance of experiment E. Elashoff [1] gives an example of three experiments E1,E2,E3 such that Pe(E1) < Pe(E2) < Pe(E3), but Pe(E1,E3) < Pe(E1,E2). Toussaint [2] exhibits binary valued experiments satisfying Pe(E1) < Pe(E2) < Pe(E3), such that Pe(E2,E3) < Pe(E1,E3) < Pe(E1,E2). We shall give an example of binary valued experiments E1 and E2 such that Pe(E1) < Pe(E2), but Pe(E2,E2?) < Pe(E1,E2) < Pe(E1,E1?). Thus if one observation is allowed, E1 is the best experiment.
