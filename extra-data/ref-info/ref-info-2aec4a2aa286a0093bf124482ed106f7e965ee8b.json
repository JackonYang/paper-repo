Moreover, our method produces an SVM classifier that allows linear time classification of test sequences. Our experiments provide evidence that string-based kernels, in conjunction with SVMs, could offer a viable and computationally efficient alternative to other methods of protein classification and homology detection."

A subsequence is any ordered sequence of k characters occurring in the text though not necessarily contiguously. The subsequences are weighted by an exponentially decaying factor of their full length in the text, hence emphasising those occurrences which are close to contiguous. A direct computation of this feature vector would involve a prohibitive amount of computation even for modest values of k, since the dimension of the feature space grows exponentially with k. The paper describes how despite this fact the inner product can be efficiently evaluated by a dynamic programming technique. A preliminary experimental comparison of the performance of the kernel compared with a standard word feature space kernel [6] is made showing encouraging results."

The basic idea is to find a hyperplane which separates the d-dimensional data perfectly into its two classes. However, since example data is often not linearly separable, SVM\u2019s introduce the notion of a \u201ckernel induced feature space\u201d which casts the data into a higher dimensional space where the data is separable. Typically, casting into such a space would cause problems computationally, and with overfitting. The key insight used in SVM\u2019s is that the higher-dimensional space doesn\u2019t need to be dealt with directly (as it turns out, only the formula for the dot-product in that space is needed), which eliminates the above concerns. Furthermore, the VC-dimension (a measure of a system\u2019s likelihood to perform well on unseen data) of SVM\u2019s can be explicitly calculated, unlike other learning methods like neural networks, for which there is no measure. Overall, SVM\u2019s are intuitive, theoretically wellfounded, and have shown to be practically successful. SVM\u2019s have also been extended to solve regression tasks (where the system is trained to output a numerical value, rather than \u201cyes/no\u201d classification)."

The method can be applied iteratively to build a kernel on a innnite set from kernels involving generators of the set. The family of kernels generated generalizes the family of radial basis kernels. It can also be used to deene kernels in the form of joint Gibbs probability distributions. Kernels can be built from hidden Markov random elds, generalized regular expressions, pair-HMMs, or ANOVA de-compositions. Uses of the method lead to open problems involving the theory of innnitely divisible positive deenite functions. Fundamentals of this theory and the theory of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces are reviewed and applied in establishing the validity of the method."

The basis for comparison is not only the customary Dayhoff mutational-distance matrix but also the results of structural studies and information implicit in the alignments of the sequences of families of similar proteins. This information is expressed in a position-specific scoring table (profile), which is created from a group of sequences previously aligned by structural or sequence similarity. The similarity of any other sequence (target) to the group of aligned sequences (probe) can be tested by comparing the target to the profile using dynamic programming algorithms. The profile method differs in two major respects from methods of sequence comparison in common use: (i) Any number of known sequences can be used to construct the profile, allowing more information to be used in the testing of the target than is possible with pairwise alignment methods. (ii) The profile includes the penalties for insertion or deletion at each position, which allow one to include the probe secondary structure in the testing scheme. Tests with globin and immunoglobulin sequences show that profile analysis can distinguish all members of these families from all other sequences in a database containing 3800 protein sequences."

A smooth and convergent algorithm is introduced to iteratively adapt the transition and emission parameters of the models from the examples in a given family.

In all cases, the models derived capture the important statistical characteristics of the family and can be used for a number of tasks, including multiple alignments, motif detection, and classification.

By contrast with PROSITE, which uses single consensus expressions to characterise particular families, PRINTS exploits groups of motifs to build characteristic signatures. These signatures offer improved diagnostic reliability by virtue of the mutual context provided by motif neighbours. To date, 800 fingerprints have been constructed and stored in PRINTS. The current version, 17.0, encodes approximately 4500 motifs, covering a range of globular and membrane proteins, modular polypeptides, and so on. The database is accessible via the UCL Bioinformatics World Wide Web (WWW) Server at http://www. biochem.ucl.ac.uk/bsm/dbbrowser/ . We have recently enhanced the usefulness of PRINTS by making available new, intuitive search software. This allows both individual query sequence and bulk data submission, permitting easy analysis of single sequences or complete genomes. Preliminary results indicate that use of the PRINTS system is able to assign additional functions not found by other methods, and hence offers a useful adjunct to current genome analysis protocols."

                "text": "Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are applied to the problems of statistical modeling, database searching and multiple sequence alignment of protein families and protein domains. These methods are demonstrated on the globin family, the protein kinase catalytic domain, and the EF-hand calcium binding motif. In each case the parameters of an HMM are estimated from a training set of unaligned sequences. After the HMM is built, it is used to obtain a multiple alignment of all the training sequences. It is also used to search the SWISS-PROT 22 database for other sequences that are members of the given protein family, or contain the given domain. The HMM produces multiple alignments of good quality that agree closely with the alignments produced by programs that incorporate three-dimensional structural information. When employed in discrimination tests (by examining how closely the sequences in a database fit the globin, kinase and EF-hand HMMs), the HMM is able to distinguish members of these families from non-members with a high degree of accuracy. Both the HMM and PROFILESEARCH (a technique used to search for relationships between a protein sequence and multiply aligned sequences) perform better in these tests than PROSITE (a dictionary of sites and patterns in proteins). The HMM appears to have a slight advantage over PROFILESEARCH in terms of lower rates of false negatives and false positives, even though the HMM is trained using only unaligned sequences, whereas PROFILESEARCH requires aligned training sequences. Our results suggest the presence of an EF-hand calcium binding motif in a highly conserved and evolutionary preserved putative intracellular region of 155 residues in the alpha-1 subunit of L-type calcium channels which play an important role in excitation-contraction coupling. This region has been suggested to contain the functional domains that are typical or essential for all L-type calcium channels regardless of whether they couple to ryanodine receptors, conduct ions or both."

In comprehensive tests of these and other family representations, PSSM\u2010embedded queries produced the best results overall when used with a special version of the Smith\u2010Waterman searching algorithm. Moreover, embedding consensus residues instead of PSSMs improved performance with readily available single sequence query searching programs, such as BLAST and FASTA.

Simulated annealing is better able to find near-global optima in the multiple alignment probability landscape than the other tested HMM training methods.

Several different methods and techniques have been proposed so far, but in most of the cases signals in DNA sequences are very complicated and avoid detection. Exact exhaustive methods can solve the problem only for short signals with a limited number of mutations. In this work, we extend exhaustive enumeration also to longer patterns. More in detail, the basic version of algorithm presented in this paper, given as input a set of sequences and an error ratio epsilon < 1, finds all patterns that occur in at least q sequences of the set with at most epsilonm mutations, where m is the length of the pattern. The only restriction is imposed on the location of mutations along the signal. That is, a valid occurrence of a pattern can present at most [epsiloni] mismatches in the first i nucleotides, and so on. However, we show how the algorithm can be used also when no assumption can be made on the position of mutations. In this case, it is also possible to have an estimate of the probability of finding a signal according to the signal length, the error ratio, and the input parameters. Finally, we discuss some significance measures that can be used to sort the patterns output by the algorithm."

                "text": "We present in this paper two algorithms. The first one extracts repeated motifs from a sequence defined over an alphabet \u03a3. For instance, \u03a3 may be equal to (A, C, G, T} and the sequence represents an encoding of a DNA macromolecule. The motifs searched correspond to words over the same alphabet which occur a minimum number q of times in the sequence with at most e mismatches each time (q is called the quorum constraint). The second algorithm extracts common motifs from a set of N \u2265 2 sequences. In this case, the motifs must occur, again with at most e mismatches, in 1 \u2264 q \u2264 N distinct sequences of the set. In both cases, the words representing the motifs may never be present exactly in the sequences. We therefore speak of the motifs, repeated in a sequence or common to a set of them, as being external objects and denote them by the expression valid models if they verify the quorum constraint q. The approach we introduce here for finding all valid models corresponding to either repeated or common motifs starts by building a suffix tree of the sequence(s) and then, after some further preprocessing, uses this tree to simply spell the models. Assuming an alphabet of fixed size, the total time needed is O(nN 2 V(e, \u03ba)) using O(nN 2 /\u03c9) space, where n is the (average) length of the sequence(s), k is the length of the models sought or is the length of the longest possible valid models, \u03c9 is the size of a word machine and V(e,\u03ba) is the number of words of length \u03ba at a Hamming distance at most e from another \u03ba-length word. V(e,\u03ba) may be majored by k e |\u03a3| e . This improves on an algorithm by Waterman [23]. It is also a better time bound than our previous approach [15] for the common motifs problem whenever N < k|\u03a3|, and a better space bound when N/\u03c9 < k. It is a better time and space bound in absolute for the repeated motifs problem. The complexities obtained in this second case are O(nV(e,k)) and O(n) respectively. Finally, we suggest how to extend these algorithms to deal with gaps."

                "text": "An important component of many data mining projects is finding a good classification algorithm, a process that requires very careful thought about experimental design. If not done very carefully, comparative studies of classification and other types of algorithms can easily result in statistically invalid conclusions. This is especially true when one is using data mining techniques to analyze very large databases, which inevitably contain some statistically unlikely data. This paper describes several phenomena that can, if ignored, invalidate an experimental comparison. These phenomena and the conclusions that follow apply not only to classification, but to computational experiments in almost any aspect of data mining. The paper also discusses why comparative analysis is more important in evaluating some types of algorithms than for others, and provides some suggestions about how to avoid the pitfalls suffered by many experimental studies."
