However, many existing texture classification schemes suffer from a number of drawbacks. A large number of features are commonly used to represent each texture and an excessively large image area is often required for the texture analysis, both leading to high computational complexity. Furthermore, most existing schemes are highly orientation dependent and thus cannot correctly classify textures after rotation. In this paper, two novel feature extraction techniques for rotation invariant texture classification are presented. These schemes, using the wavelet transform and Gaussian Markov random field modelling, are shown to give a consistently high performance for rotated textures in the presence of noise. Moreover, they use just four features to represent each texture and require only a 16/spl times/16 image area for their analysis leading to a significantly lower computational complexity than most existing schemes."

Color texture is modeled using spatial correlation functions defined within and between sensor bands. Using a linear model for surface spectral reflectance with the same number of parameters as the number of sensor classes, we show that illumination and geometry changes in the scene correspond to a linear transformation of the correlation functions and a linear transformation of their coordinates. A several step algorithm that includes scale estimation and correlation moment computation is used to achieve the invariance. The key to the method is the new result that illumination, rotation, and scale changes in the scene correspond to a specific transformation of correlation function Zernike moment matrices. These matrices can be estimated from a color image. This relationship is used to derive an efficient algorithm for recognition. The algorithm is substantiated using classification results on over 200 images of color textures obtained under various illumination conditions and geometric configurations."

A test textured image can be correctly classified even if it is rotated and scaled. Based on a 2-D Wold-like decomposition of homogeneous random fields, the texture field can be decomposed into a deterministic component and an indeterministic component. The spectral density function (SDF) of the former is a sum of 1-D or 2-D delta functions. The 2-D autocorrelation function (ACF) of the latter is fitted to the assumed anisotropic ACF that has an elliptical contour. Invariant parameters applicable to the classification of rotated and scaled textured images can be estimated by combining the parameters representing the ellipse and those representing the delta functions. The effectiveness of this method is illustrated through experimental results on natural textures."

It is shown that textures and fully textured images can be practically decomposed into, and synthesized from, a finite set of EFs. Textured-images can be synthesized from a set of EFs using an image coefficient library. Alternatively, texturing of contoured (cartoonlike) images is analogous to adding chromaticity information to contoured images. A method for texture discrimination and image segmentation using local features based on the Gabor approach is introduced. Features related to the EF's parameters provide efficient means for texture discrimination and classification. This method is invariant under rotation and translation. The performance of the classification appears to be robust with respect to noisy conditions. The results show the insensitivity of the discrimination to relatively high noise levels, comparable to the performances of the human observer.<<ETX>>"

Furthermore, unlike most existing schemes, the proposed schemes are shown to be rotation invariant demonstrate a high level of robustness noise. The performances of the three schemes are compared, indicating that the wavelet-based approach is the most accurate, exhibits the best noise performance and has the lowest computational complexity."

The training texture images (parent classes) are modeled by Gaussian Markov random fields (GMRFs). To classify a rotated and scaled test texture, the rotation and scale changes are incorporated in the texture model through an appropriate transformation of the power spectral density of the GMRF. For the rotated and scaled image, a bona fide likelihood function that shows the explicit dependence of the likelihood function on the GMRF parameters, as well as on the rotation and scale parameters, is derived. Although, in general, the scaled and/or rotated texture does not correspond to a finite-order GMRF, it is possible nonetheless to write down a likelihood function for the image data. The likelihood function of the discrete Fourier transform of the image data corresponds to that of a white nonstationary Gaussian random field, with the variance at each pixel (i,j) being a known function of the rotation, the scale, the GMRF model parameters, and (i,j). The variance is an explicit function of the appropriately sampled power spectral density of the GMRF. The estimation of the rotation and scale parameters is performed in the frequency domain by maximizing the likelihood function associated with the discrete Fourier transform of the image data. Cramer-Rao error bounds on the scale and rotation estimates are easily computed. A modified Bayes decision rule is used to classify a given test image into one of C possible texture classes. The classification power of the method is demonstrated through experimental results on natural textures from the Brodatz album. >"

The proposed algorithm requires less computation than the original IMD algorithm. The improved iterative morphological decomposition (IIMD) is compared with granulometric moments, multiresolution rotation-invariant SAR (MRRISAR) models and multichannel Gabor filters. It is found that IIMD is superior to granulometric moments and MRRISAR in rotated texture classification. IIMD may also perform better than multichannel Gabor filters by employing many different kinds of structuring elements. In the study, three kinds of pseudo rotation-invariant structuring elements, namely the disc, octagon and square, as well as a line structuring element are tested. Since the line structuring element is rotation-variant in nature, the image is rotated to different orientations of equal angular separation to find a set of primitive features. A Fourier transform is then applied to convert these features to rotation-invariant. An accuracy rate as high as 96% is achieved in classifying 30 classes of textured images in the experiment. It is also demonstrated that using both the normalised variance and the mean can give better classification accuracy rate than using both the variance and the mean when classified by simplified Bayes or Mahalanobis distance measure."

Since rotating an image does not change the intensities of its pixels but shifts them circularly, rotation-invariant features can be realised if the relationship between circular motion and spatial shift is established. For each individual circular neighbourhood centred at every pixel, a number of input sequences are formed by the intensities of pixels on concentric rings of various radii measured from the centre of each neighbourhood. Fourier transforming the sequences would generate coefficients whose magnitudes are invariant to rotation. Features extracted from these magnitudes were used in various classification and segmentation experiments. These features outperformed those of the circular simultaneous autoregressive model in classifying rotated images and those of the wavelet transform and the Gaussian Markov random field in classifying unrotated images of 30 classes. They also showed superior performance to those of the CSAR in several rotation-invariant segmentation experiments."

The first approach extracts invariant features from texture images; moment invariant features and log-polar filter features are employed. The second approach follows a mental transformation procedure similar to the process of scaled and rotated shape recognition carried out by human beings. Texture images are rotated and scaled to a specific size and orientation which allows the application of a more general rotation-scale sensitive classification scheme. A two-stage estimation procedure is introduced to determine the required scaling and rotation factors. Simulations show that the mental transformation approaches outperformed the other approaches, giving a good averaged error rate of 10%.<<ETX>>"

In the literature most of the attention has been focussed on the texture features with minimal consideration of the noise models. In this paper, we investigate the problem of texture classification from a maximum likelihood perspective. We take into account the texture model, the noise distribution, and the inter-dependence of the texture features. Our investigation shows that the real noise distribution is closer to an exponential than a Gaussian distribution, and that the L/sub 1/ metric has a better retrieval rate than L/sub 2/. We also propose the Cauchy metric as an alternative for both the L/sub 1/ and L/sub 2/ metrics. Furthermore, we provide a direct method for deriving an optimal distortion measure from the real noise distribution, which experimentally provides consistently improved results over the other metrics. We conclude with results and discussions on an international texture database."

First, we convert two-dimensional (2-D) texture images to one-dimensional (1-D) signals by spiral resampling. Then, we use a quadrature mirror filter (QMF) bank to decompose sampled signals into subbands. In each band, we take high-order autocorrelation functions as features. Features in different bands, which form a vector sequence, are then modeled as a hidden Markov model (BMM). During classification, the unknown texture is matched against all the models and the best match is taken as the classification result. Simulations showed that the highest correct classification rate for 16 kinds of texture was 95.14%."

A polar, analytic form of a two-dimensional (2-D) Gabor wavelet is developed, and a multiresolution family of these wavelets is used to compute information-conserving microfeatures. From these microfeatures a micromodel, which characterizes spatially localized amplitude, frequency, and directional behavior of the texture, is formed. The essential characteristics of a texture sample, its macrofeatures, are derived from the estimated selected parameters of the micromodel. Classification of texture samples is based on the macromodel derived from a rotation invariant subset of macrofeatures. In experiments, comparatively high correct classification rates were obtained using large sample sets."

A texton encoder produces a texture code which is invariant to local and global textural rotations. The proposed method uses six statistical features obtained from two scales of this invariant encoder to result in indices for roughness, anisotropy, and other higher-order textural features. Classification results for synthetic and natural textures are presented. The authors also discuss the effect of window sizes used at local and global scales on the performance of the classifier.<<ETX>>"

We show that three dimensional geometric transformations of a surface in the scene produce corresponding transformations in these correlation functions. From this analysis, we derive invariants of color correlation functions that can be computed efficiently and used for geometry invariant recognition. We show experimentally that these invariants are effective for recognition in situations where neither color distributions nor gray scale texture are sufficient. Following recognition, the estimated color correlation functions can be used to recover the three dimensional location and orientation of surfaces. The color texture invariants can be used in the recognition of three dimensional objects, the segmentation of images of three dimensional scenes, and the searching of image databases.<<ETX>>"

This latter technique allows the calculation of a set of texture descriptors from a 2-D spectrum estimate which is invariant under rotation and scaling. A comparison of the HMHV and the \"standard\" parametric HM (harmonic mean) methods on synthetic and natural stochastic textures shows that the HMHV method presents almost no spurious peaks and is quite isotropic. By performing the classification of a set of 60 images divided in 12 texture classes, descriptors computed with the HMHV method provide better results than those computed with the HM method."

The method uses three statistical features, two of which are obtained from a new parametric model of the image called a ``circular symmetric autoregressive model.'' Two of the proposed features have physical interpretation in terms of the roughness and directionality of the texture. The results of several classification experiments on differently oriented samples of natural textures including both microtextures and macrotextures are presented."

The textures are described using features derived from generalized co-occurrence matrices (GCM). A GCM is determined by a spatial constraint predicate F and a set of local features P = {(Xi, Yi, di), i = 1,..., m} where (Xi, Yi) is the location of the ith feature, and di is a description of the ith feature. The GCM of P under F, GF, is defined by GF(i, j) = number of pairs, pk, pl such that F(pk, pl) is true and di and dj are the descriptions of pk and pl, respectively. We discuss features derived from GCM's and present an experimental study using natural textures."

The features are computed as the local energy of the filter responses. The effect of the filtering is highlighted, keeping the local energy function and the classification algorithm identical for most approaches. For reference, comparisons with two classical nonfiltering approaches, co-occurrence (statistical) and autoregressive (model based) features, are given.

These features are then used in an attempt to solve a practical but hitherto mostly overlooked problem in document image processing-the identification of the script of a machine printed document. Automatic script and language recognition is an essential front-end process for the efficient and correct use of OCR and language translation products in a multilingual environment.

We approximated in computational form six basic textural features, namely, coarseness, contrast, directionality, line-likeness, regularity, and roughness. In comparison with psychological measurements for human subjects, the computational measures gave good correspondences in rank correlation of 16 typical texture patterns. Similarity measurements using these features were attempted. The discrepancies between human vision and computerized techniques that we encountered in this study indicate fundamental problems in digital analysis of textures. Some of them could be overcome by analyzing their causes and using more sophisticated techniques."

The problems are encapsulated into test suites, for which baseline results obtained with algorithms from literature are provided. The rich functionality of the framework is demonstrated with examples in texture classification, segmentation and retrieval. The framework has a web site for public dissemination of the database and comparative results obtained by research groups world wide."

The TDOBSG algorithm employs a space-varying convergence factor for all the filter coefficients, where the convergence factor at each block iteration is optimized in a least squares sense that the squared norm of the a posteriori estimation error vector is minimized. It has the same order of computational complexity as another 2-D optimum block adaptive (TDOBA) algorithm. Computer simulations for image restoration show that the TDOBSG algorithm outperforms the TDOBA algorithm and other related algorithms in terms of objective and/or subjective measures."

This kind of operator is adapted to the measurement of distances between objects sampled on nonuniform grids. This operator can be regarded as a nonstationary version of local distance operators adapted to parallelepipedic (noncubic) grids. The principle of coefficient computation and spatial adaptation are given. An application to dissimilarity measurement between color images is presented. We compare the nonstationary local distance operator with two stationary versions: 1) images are sampled with the lowest sampling step; and 2) the local operator is designed according to the average voxel size."

                "text": "The Textbook of Contraceptive Practice is a current overview of population control. The authors are John Peel, Senior Lecturer in Sociology, University of Hull and Malcolm Potts, Director of Medical Studies, Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge. Individual chapters cover the various methods: the oral contraceptives, intrauterine devices, withdrawal, diaphragm, spermicides, safe period, sterilization and abortion. Each method is described in detail with respect to its mode of action, suggestions for its optimal use by the patient, its effectiveness and side effects. Additional chapters consider the population explosion, the history of contraception, and medical, ethical, and legal aspects. This scope and the inclusion of recently recognized side effects of the oral contraceptives make this book unique. The oral contraceptives seem to be responsible for an increased incidence of thromboembolic phenomena, abnormal glucose tolerance curves and increased serum lipids. (Hypertension should be added to this list.) The book is clearly and well written. The small size and large print of the book (also available as a paperback) prevent in-depth documentation; selected references are provided. The authors summarize complex problems accurately and, in general, their opinions are reasonable. With the information presently available, the authors conclude that the woman who takes oral contraceptives has a greater likelihood of being alive one year later than the woman who chooses to have a baby or use some less effective method of contraception. This book should be of interest and value to everyone concerned with women. In the opinion of Dr. Alan Guttmacher, author of an earlier standard text in this field and president of Planned-Parenthood World Population, \"Textbook of Contraceptive Practice is a splendid book. It is the sanest and clearest presentation of the topic I have ever read.\" ARNOLD EISENFELD"
