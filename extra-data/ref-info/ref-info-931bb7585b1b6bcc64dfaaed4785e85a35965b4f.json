These responses are similar in latency and waveform to those evoked from the primary visual area. Recent studies using the Nauta method have shown that degeneration appears in the medial wall of the suprasylvian sulcus after lesions in various parts of the visual pathway, including the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) (ref. 5), striate and peristriate cortex6,7. The band of degeneration is separated from visual area III by a degeneration-free zone along the apex of the suprasylvian gyrus. The experiments reported here were designed to analyse the specificity of response to visual stimuli of single neurones in the medial wall of the suprasylvian sulcus."

The majority of the cells were independently driven from the two eyes and there were no marked differences in the organization of the receptive fields for the two eyes. Most cells responded equally well to stimulation of either eye alone, although preferences for one eye or the other were often seen. For some cells, the shape of the moving stimulus was clearly not very critical nor was the direction of movement of the stimulus. These cells responded well to a stimulus moved in any direction within the receptive field and a small spot of light appeared to be as effective in eliciting a vigorous response as a light or dark bar covering the receptive field. A particularly good response was obtained to jerky movements within the receptive fields. These cells, responding to movement in all directions within their receptive fields, were in a minority and were usually encountered upon first penetrating the cortex from white matter (see Text-fig. 1), although they were occasionally encountered in more superficial layers. In their response to movement in any direction within the receptive field and in their wide tolerance of stimulus shape and size, these cells were reminiscent of the 'pandirectional' cells described by Schiller & Koerner (1971) and by Goldberg & Wurtz (1972) in the monkey superior colliculus."

The dura was then re-approximated, covered with gelfoam and the defect in the skull filled with sterile dental cement to prevent herniation.

Talbot & Marshall (1941) used physiological methods to map the central part of the visual field on to the posterolateral surface ofthe cortex in the monkey. They devised an index of cortical representation expressed as the increment of the angle, measured radially from the centre of gaze, which is represented on each millimetre of cortex. We have confirmed their observations and have extended the mapping to the buried visual cortex in the horizontal and vertical calcarine fissures. We have preferred to use the reciprocal of their index and to call it the cortical magnification, M. When this is measured along radii and at right angles to them, it provides the empirical quantitative relation which Polyak wanted. It also defines the shape and size of the visual receptive field. We have made such a surface, folded it and compared it with the calcarine cortex of the monkey. A preliminary account of this work has been published (Daniel & Whitteridge, 1959)."

Ablation experiments indicate that lesions in the hamster superior colliculus can cause severe deficits in orienting to visual and auditory stimuli while leaving intact the ability to discriminate pat serns in situ .ations in whi ch no orienting component is necessary for the successful performance of the discrimination (32). Related to this view is the idea that the colliculus plays an important role in the control of eye and head movements. After unilateral colliculectomy in the monkey, Denny-Brown (6) reports a fascinating cluster of eye-movement deficits. While the animal could look to either side or up and down, there was a slight divergent strabismus, and the optokinetic response was present only when the stripes entered the visual field from the operated side. Though the monkey could reach accurately for an object in the visual field contralateral to the lesion, he could not fixate the object, but only looked in its general direction. After bilateral colliculus lesions, monkeys showed fixed gaze, lack of reactivity to visual stimuli; lack of vocalization, and a variety of other deficits which led Denny-Brown to describe this structure as the \u201cpattern setter of the nervous system.\u201d Though other workers have failed to confirm the oculomotor deficits reported in this study (2, 28), recent work usi *g more sophisticated methods for head immobilization and eyemovement recording has confirmed and extended many of Denny-Brown\u2019s original observations (M. Stryker, P. H. Schiller, and F. Koerner, unpublished observations). It"

Such units fire selectively prior to saccades of a specific direction and size, irrespective of the position of the eye in orbit. Stimulation studies of the superior colliculus have so far produced conflicting results. Some reports suggest that in the alert cat stimulation brings the eye to a certain position in orbit irrespective of eye position prior to stimulation (1, 9, 19). Thus, the size and direction of elicited saccades is reported to vary as a function of initial eye position. By contrast, in the alert monkey it has recently been reported that stimulation produces conjugate saccades of a specific size and direction; these parameters are the same no matter where the eye is in the orbit prior to stimulation (12, 15, 16). The stimulation map of Robinson (12) shows a reasonable correspondence with the receptive-field map of the superior colliculus reported by Cynader and Berman (5). The aim of this study was to clarify the relationship between recording and stimulation data by using methods which allow a direct comparison. We used alert rhesus monkeys which had one eye immobilized for the mapping of visual receptive fields. The other eye was normal, thus permitting the study of eye movement. Stimulation and recording were carried out using the same low-resistance microelectrode; for each site sampled, records were obtained for both single-unit activity and for electrical stimulation."

It would be astonishing if such a structure did not profoundly modify the response patterns of fibres coming into it. In the cat's visual cortex, the receptive field arrangements of single cells suggest that there is indeed a degree of complexity far exceeding anything yet seen at lower levels in the visual system. In a previous paper we described receptive fields of single cortical cells, observing responses to spots of light shone on one or both retinas (Hubel & Wiesel, 1959). In the present work this method is used to examine receptive fields of a more complex type (Part I) and to make additional observations on binocular interaction (Part II). This approach is necessary in order to understand the behaviour of individual cells, but it fails to deal with the problem of the relationship of one cell to its neighbours. In the past, the technique of recording evoked slow waves has been used with great success in studies of functional anatomy. It was employed by Talbot & Marshall (1941) and by Thompson, Woolsey & Talbot (1950) for mapping out the visual cortex in the rabbit, cat, and monkey. Daniel & Whitteiidge (1959) have recently extended this work in the primate. Most of our present knowledge of retinotopic projections, binocular overlap, and the second visual area is based on these investigations. Yet the method of evoked potentials is valuable mainly for detecting behaviour common to large populations of neighbouring cells; it cannot differentiate functionally between areas of cortex smaller than about 1 mm2. To overcome this difficulty a method has in recent years been developed for studying cells separately or in small groups during long micro-electrode penetrations through nervous tissue. Responses are correlated with cell location by reconstructing the electrode tracks from histological material. These techniques have been applied to"

Ablation studies have shown that destruction of superior colliculi interferes with spatial orientation and eye movement (Z-29), although the evidence regarding the effects of such lesions in primates is conflicting (1, 7, 17, 18; and unpublished observations). Stimulation studies have disclosed that electrical or chemical stimulation of the superior colliculus elicits eye and head movement in several species (4, 1 I, 20, 22). While most single-unit studies centered on the visual information-processing role of the mammalian superior colliculi (12-16, 30, 32, 33; M. Cynader and N. Berman, unpublished observations), a few studies have recently appeared that demonstrate eye-movement related unit activity (22, 31, 35) The aim of the present study was to investigate the discharge characteristics of single units in the superior colliculus of the alert, unanesthe tized monkey. We wished to assess both the visual receptivefield characteristics of units and the possible relation of unit discharges to eye movement. To carry out this plan one eye of each monkey was immobilized prior to the experiment by transection of the 3rd, 4th, and 6th cranial nerves. This made it possible to study in the monkey, whose head was restrained, receptive fields of units of the immobilized eye, and to relate the discharge characteristics of collicular units to the movement of the normal eye during both saccadic and smooth pursuit eye movements. M. Cynader and N. Berman (unpublished data) recently have shown that nearly all units in the monkey"

The two most massive connections originate mainly from layer III. These are the interlaminar fibers terminating in the underlying layer V, and the systematically arranged projection upon area 18. Another cortical projection upon a narrow region in the superior temporal sulcus originates mainly from the infragranular layers, from which originate also the fibers passing to three subcortical structures, viz. the colliculus superior, the medial pulvinar and the griseum pontis. These subcortical projections are sparse compared to the interlaminar and cortico\u2010cortical connections. In particular, no evidence was obtained that the lateral geniculate nucleus receives fibers from the lateral striate cortex. Lesions injuring the white matter, however, produced, in addition, anterograde degeneration in the nucleus praetectalis, three pulvinar nuclei, the lateral geniculate nucleus and the pregeniculate nucleus. This degeneration must have resulted from the interruption of fibers originating in areas other than the lateral striate cortex, and passing beneath the site of the lesion."
