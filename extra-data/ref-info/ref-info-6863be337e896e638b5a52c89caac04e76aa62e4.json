Following the initial binarization and deskewing operations, the image is scanned to extract all horizontal and vertical lines that are present. The table's dimensions are estimated based on these lines. Unlike other systems, the procedure described does not depend on the sole existence of lines to mark the item blocks. White streams are recognized in both the horizontal and vertical direction as substitutes for any missing demarcation lines. A structure interpretation procedure uses the extracted demarcation information to identify each of the item blocks in the table. Subsequently, the interrelations of these item blocks are used to recognize the structure of the tabulated data.<<ETX>>"

It is very important to be able to classify table and figure areas automatically. Furthermore, in tables, the column and row in which a character string is located are very important pieces of information. To detect and analyze table areas, the following method is applied: First, areas that may contain tables or figures are distinguished from text areas by the presence of horizontal and vertical lines. Next, the areas are assumed to be table areas and are analyzed as such. A judgment is made on whether each of the areas can in fact be a table area or not; in this way, the actual table areas are detected. Finally, the structures of the areas are analyzed and character strings in the areas are arranged by using the DP matching method. This method was applied to sixty-five pages of Japanese technical papers, magazines, manuals for software programs, and pages including 34 table areas, 48 line drawing areas, and 35 image areas. As a result, 96.6 percent of the areas were detected correctly and 91.7 percent of the tables were analyzed and arranged correctly."

Although Y. Nakano et al. (1986) looked upon the recognition of multi-kinds of table-form documents as an important subject from a practical point of view, they could not report any successful approach because their knowledge was based only on the physical coordinate data. In the approach presented, this recognition issue was solved, using both the classification tree based on the physical characteristics and the structure description tree based on the logical characteristics. At least, it is not so difficult to classify various kinds of documents into appropriate document classes since table-form documents are well designed on the basis of vertical and horizontal line segments. However, it is not easy in the case of the other documents because the geometric and spatial characteristics of documents are not well specified. It is necessary to investigate the application techniques for the other documents from the viewpoint of the knowledge representation.<<ETX>>"

The paper presents a method called Box Driven Reasoning (BDR) to robustly analyze the structure of table form documents which include touching characters and broken lines. Most previous methods employ a line oriented approach. Real documents are copied repeatedly and overlaid with printed data, resulting in characters which touch cells and lines which are broken. BDR deals with regions directly, in contrast with other previous methods. Experimental tests show that BDR reliably recognizes cells and strings in document images with touching characters and broken lines."
