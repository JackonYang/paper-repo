A two-stage, partially supervised learning architecture is proposed: a rudimentary detector is learned from a very small set of segmented images and applied to a larger training set of un-segmented images; the second stage bootstraps these detections to learn an improved classifier while explicitly training against clutter. The detectors are learned with a boosting algorithm which creates a location-sensitive classifier using a discriminative set of features from a randomly chosen dictionary of contour fragments. We present results that are very competitive with other state-of-the-art object detection schemes and show robustness to object articulations, clutter, and occlusion. Our major contributions are the application of boosted local contour-based features for object detection in a partially supervised learning framework, and an efficient new boosting procedure for simultaneously selecting features and estimating per-feature parameters."

Instead of using a model based on salient image fragments, we show that object class detection is also possible using only the object's boundary. To this end, we develop a novel learning technique to extract class-discriminative boundary fragments. In addition to their shape, these \u201ccodebook\u201d entries also determine the object's centroid (in the manner of Leibe et al. [19]). Boosting is used to select discriminative combinations of boundary fragments (weak detectors) to form a strong \u201cBoundary-Fragment-Model\u201d (BFM) detector. The generative aspect of the model is used to determine an approximate segmentation. \n \nWe demonstrate the following results: (i) the BFM detector is able to represent and detect object classes principally defined by their shape, rather than their appearance; and (ii) in comparison with other published results on several object classes (airplanes, cars-rear, cows) the BFM detector is able to exceed previous performances, and to achieve this with less supervision (such as the number of training images)."

After reviewing existing edge and gradient based descriptors, we show experimentally that grids of histograms of oriented gradient (HOG) descriptors significantly outperform existing feature sets for human detection. We study the influence of each stage of the computation on performance, concluding that fine-scale gradients, fine orientation binning, relatively coarse spatial binning, and high-quality local contrast normalization in overlapping descriptor blocks are all important for good results. The new approach gives near-perfect separation on the original MIT pedestrian database, so we introduce a more challenging dataset containing over 1800 annotated human images with a large range of pose variations and backgrounds."

Region features are appealing in this context because: (1) they encode shape and scale information of objects naturally; (2) they are only mildly affected by background clutter. Regions have not been popular as features due to their sensitivity to segmentation errors. In this paper, we start by producing a robust bag of overlaid regions for each image using Arbeldez et al., CVPR 2009. Each region is represented by a rich set of image cues (shape, color and texture). We then learn region weights using a max-margin framework. In detection and segmentation, we apply a generalized Hough voting scheme to generate hypotheses of object locations, scales and support, followed by a verification classifier and a constrained segmenter on each hypothesis. The proposed approach significantly outperforms the state of the art on the ETHZ shape database(87.1% average detection rate compared to Ferrari et al. 's 67.2%), and achieves competitive performance on the Caltech 101 database."

However, for the most part, these edge-based methods operate solely on the geometric shape of edges, treating them equally and ignoring the fact that for certain object classes, the appearance of the object on the \u201cinside\u201d of the edge may provide valuable recognition cues. \n \nWe show how, for such object classes, small regions around edges can be used to classify the edge into object or non-object. This classifier may then be used to prune edges which are not relevant to the object class, and thereby improve the performance of subsequent processing. We demonstrate learning class specific edges for a number of object classes \u2014 oranges, bananas and bottles \u2014 under challenging scale and illumination variation. \n \nBecause class-specific edge classification provides a low-level analysis of the image it may be integrated into any edge-based recognition strategy without significant change in the high-level algorithms. We illustrate its application to two algorithms: (i) chamfer matching for object detection, and (ii) modulating contrast terms in MRF based object-specific segmentation. We show that performance of both algorithms (matching and segmentation) is considerably improved by the class-specific edge labelling."

At the core of contour detection technologies are a set of hand-designed gradient features, used by most approaches including the state-of-the-art Global Pb (gPb) operator. In this work, we show that contour detection accuracy can be significantly improved by computing Sparse Code Gradients (SCG), which measure contrast using patch representations automatically learned through sparse coding. We use K-SVD for dictionary learning and Orthogonal Matching Pursuit for computing sparse codes on oriented local neighborhoods, and apply multi-scale pooling and power transforms before classifying them with linear SVMs. By extracting rich representations from pixels and avoiding collapsing them prematurely, Sparse Code Gradients effectively learn how to measure local contrasts and find contours. We improve the F-measure metric on the BSDS500 benchmark to 0.74 (up from 0.71 of gPb contours). Moreover, our learning approach can easily adapt to novel sensor data such as Kinect-style RGB-D cameras: Sparse Code Gradients on depth maps and surface normals lead to promising contour detection using depth and depth+color, as verified on the NYU Depth Dataset."

It is difficult since often the decision for an edge cannot be made purely based on low level cues such as gradient, instead we need to engage all levels of information, low, middle, and high, in order to decide where to put edges. In this paper we propose a novel supervised learning algorithm for edge and object boundary detection which we refer to as Boosted Edge Learning or BEL for short. A decision of an edge point is made independently at each location in the image; a very large aperture is used providing significant context for each decision. In the learning stage, the algorithm selects and combines a large number of features across different scales in order to learn a discriminative model using an extended version of the Probabilistic Boosting Tree classification algorithm. The learning based framework is highly adaptive and there are no parameters to tune. We show applications for edge detection in a number of specific image domains as well as on natural images. We test on various datasets including the Berkeley dataset and the results obtained are very good."

The learned model is used for automatic visual understanding and semantic segmentation of photographs. Our discriminative model exploits texture-layout filters, novel features based on textons, which jointly model patterns of texture and their spatial layout. Unary classification and feature selection is achieved using shared boosting to give an efficient classifier which can be applied to a large number of classes. Accurate image segmentation is achieved by incorporating the unary classifier in a conditional random field, which (i) captures the spatial interactions between class labels of neighboring pixels, and (ii) improves the segmentation of specific object instances. Efficient training of the model on large datasets is achieved by exploiting both random feature selection and piecewise training methods.\n\nHigh classification and segmentation accuracy is demonstrated on four varied databases: (i) the MSRC 21-class database containing photographs of real objects viewed under general lighting conditions, poses and viewpoints, (ii) the 7-class Corel subset and (iii) the 7-class Sowerby database used in He et\u00a0al. (Proceeding of IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, vol.\u00a02, pp.\u00a0695\u2013702, June 2004), and (iv) a set of video sequences of television shows. The proposed algorithm gives competitive and visually pleasing results for objects that are highly textured (grass, trees, etc.), highly structured (cars, faces, bicycles, airplanes, etc.), and even articulated (body, cow, etc.).\n"

When trained on natural images, the layers of our model capture image information in a variety of forms: low-level edges, mid-level edge junctions, high-level object parts and complete objects. To build our model we rely on a novel inference scheme that ensures each layer reconstructs the input, rather than just the output of the layer directly beneath, as is common with existing hierarchical approaches. This makes it possible to learn multiple layers of representation and we show models with 4 layers, trained on images from the Caltech-101 and 256 datasets. When combined with a standard classifier, features extracted from these models outperform SIFT, as well as representations from other feature learning methods."

                "text": "This paper describes a face detection framework that is capable of processing images extremely rapidly while achieving high detection rates. There are three key contributions. The first is the introduction of a new image representation called the \u201cIntegral Image\u201d which allows the features used by our detector to be computed very quickly. The second is a simple and efficient classifier which is built using the AdaBoost learning algorithm (Freund and Schapire, 1995) to select a small number of critical visual features from a very large set of potential features. The third contribution is a method for combining classifiers in a \u201ccascade\u201d which allows background regions of the image to be quickly discarded while spending more computation on promising face-like regions. A set of experiments in the domain of face detection is presented. The system yields face detection performance comparable to the best previous systems (Sung and Poggio, 1998; Rowley et al., 1998; Schneiderman and Kanade, 2000; Roth et al., 2000). Implemented on a conventional desktop, face detection proceeds at 15 frames per second."

Our system is able to represent highly variable object classes and achieves state-of-the-art results in the PASCAL object detection challenges. While deformable part models have become quite popular, their value had not been demonstrated on difficult benchmarks such as the PASCAL data sets. Our system relies on new methods for discriminative training with partially labeled data. We combine a margin-sensitive approach for data-mining hard negative examples with a formalism we call latent SVM. A latent SVM is a reformulation of MI--SVM in terms of latent variables. A latent SVM is semiconvex, and the training problem becomes convex once latent information is specified for the positive examples. This leads to an iterative training algorithm that alternates between fixing latent values for positive examples and optimizing the latent SVM objective function."

They have recently been generalized to discriminative image understanding tasks such as texture segmentation and feature selection. This paper extends this line of research by proposing a multiscale method to minimize least-squares reconstruction errors and discriminative cost functions under ?0 or ?1 regularization constraints. It is applied to edge detection, category-based edge selection and image classification tasks. Experiments on the Berkeley edge detection benchmark and the PASCAL VOC'05 and VOC'07 datasets demonstrate the computational efficiency of our algorithm and its ability to learn local image descriptions that effectively support demanding computer vision tasks."

We introduce LOCUS (learning object classes with unsupervised segmentation) which uses a generative probabilistic model to combine bottom-up cues of color and edge with top-down cues of shape and pose. A key aspect of this model is that the object appearance is allowed to vary from image to image, allowing for significant within-class variation. By iteratively updating the belief in the object's position, size, segmentation and pose, LOCUS avoids making hard decisions about any of these quantities and so allows for each to be refined at any stage. We show that LOCUS successfully learns an object class model from unlabeled images, whilst also giving segmentation accuracies that rival existing supervised methods. Finally, we demonstrate simultaneous recognition and segmentation in novel images using the learned models for a number of object classes, as well as unsupervised object discovery and tracking in video."

This paper is the first large scale exploration of human sketches. We analyze the distribution of non-expert sketches of everyday objects such as 'teapot' or 'car'. We ask humans to sketch objects of a given category and gather 20,000 unique sketches evenly distributed over 250 object categories. With this dataset we perform a perceptual study and find that humans can correctly identify the object category of a sketch 73% of the time. We compare human performance against computational recognition methods. We develop a bag-of-features sketch representation and use multi-class support vector machines, trained on our sketch dataset, to classify sketches. The resulting recognition method is able to identify unknown sketches with 56% accuracy (chance is 0.4%). Based on the computational model, we demonstrate an interactive sketch recognition system. We release the complete crowd-sourced dataset of sketches to the community."

We take an object recognition approach, designing an intermediate body parts representation that maps the difficult pose estimation problem into a simpler per-pixel classification problem. Our large and highly varied training dataset allows the classifier to estimate body parts invariant to pose, body shape, clothing, etc. Finally we generate confidence-scored 3D proposals of several body joints by reprojecting the classification result and finding local modes. The system runs at 200 frames per second on consumer hardware. Our evaluation shows high accuracy on both synthetic and real test sets, and investigates the effect of several training parameters. We achieve state of the art accuracy in our comparison with related work and demonstrate improved generalization over exact whole-skeleton nearest neighbor matching."

These are ensembles of decision trees that act directly on image pixels, and therefore do not need the expensive computation of filter-bank responses or local descriptors. They are extremely fast to both train and test, especially compared with k-means clustering and nearest-neighbor assignment of feature descriptors. The nodes in the trees provide (i) an implicit hierarchical clustering into semantic textons, and (ii) an explicit local classification estimate. Our second contribution, the bag of semantic textons, combines a histogram of semantic textons over an image region with a region prior category distribution. The bag of semantic textons is computed over the whole image for categorization, and over local rectangular regions for segmentation. Including both histogram and region prior allows our segmentation algorithm to exploit both textural and semantic context. Our third contribution is an image-level prior for segmentation that emphasizes those categories that the automatic categorization believes to be present. We evaluate on two datasets including the very challenging VOC 2007 segmentation dataset. Our results significantly advance the state-of-the-art in segmentation accuracy, and furthermore, our use of efficient decision forests gives at least a five-fold increase in execution speed."

These structures, called \"graphlets\", are the most frequently occurring primitives, junctions and composite junctions in natural images, and are arranged in a 3-layer And-Or graph representation. In this hierarchic model, larger graphlets are decomposed (in And-nodes) into smaller graphlets in multiple alternative ways (at Or-nodes), and parts are shared and re-used between graphlets. Then we present a compositional boosting algorithm for computing the 17 graphlets categories collectively in the Bayesian framework. The algorithm runs recursively for each node A in the And-Or graph and iterates between two steps -bottom-up proposal and top-down validation. The bottom-up step includes two types of boosting methods, (i) Detecting instances of A (often in low resolutions) using Adaboosting method through a sequence of tests (weak classifiers) image feature, (ii) Proposing instances of A (often in high resolution) by binding existing children nodes of A through a sequence of compatibility tests on their attributes (e.g angles, relative size etc). The Adaboosting and binding methods generate a number of candidates for node A which are verified by a top-down process in a way similar to Data-Driven Markov Chain Monte Carlo [18]. Both the Adaboosting and binding methods are trained off-line for each graphlet category, and the compositional nature of the model means the algorithm is recursive and can be learned from a small training set. We apply this algorithm to a wide range of indoor and outdoor images with satisfactory results."

We present an approach to automatically detect and track multiple, possibly partially occluded humans in a walking or standing pose from a single camera, which may be stationary or moving. A human body is represented as an assembly of body parts. Part detectors are learned by boosting a number of weak classifiers which are based on edgelet features. Responses of part detectors are combined to form a joint likelihood model that includes an analysis of possible occlusions. The combined detection responses and the part detection responses provide the observations used for tracking. Trajectory initialization and termination are both automatic and rely on the confidences computed from the detection responses. An object is tracked by data association and meanshift methods. Our system can track humans with both inter-object and scene occlusions with static or non-static backgrounds. Evaluation results on a number of images and videos and comparisons with some previous methods are given."

Organised annually from 2005 to present, the challenge and its associated dataset has become accepted as the benchmark for object detection.This paper describes the dataset and evaluation procedure. We review the state-of-the-art in evaluated methods for both classification and detection, analyse whether the methods are statistically different, what they are learning from the images (e.g. the object or its context), and what the methods find easy or confuse. The paper concludes with lessons learnt in the three year history of the challenge, and proposes directions for future improvement and extension."

What is correlated across images (or across video sequences) is the internal layout of local self-similarities (up to some distortions), even though the patterns generating those local self-similarities are quite different in each of the images/videos. These internal self-similarities are efficiently captured by a compact local \"self-similarity descriptor\"', measured densely throughout the image/video, at multiple scales, while accounting for local and global geometric distortions. This gives rise to matching capabilities of complex visual data, including detection of objects in real cluttered images using only rough hand-sketches, handling textured objects with no clear boundaries, and detecting complex actions in cluttered video data with no prior learning. We compare our measure to commonly used image-based and video-based similarity measures, and demonstrate its applicability to object detection, retrieval, and action detection."

We present a unified approach to detecting, classifying, and reconstructing junctions in images. Our main contribution is a modeling of the junction which is complex enough to handle all these issues and yet simple enough to admit an effective dynamic programming solution. We use a template deformation framework along with a gradient criterium to detect radial partitions of the template. We use the minimum description length principle to obtain the optimal number of partitions that best describes the junction. The Kona detector presented by Parida et al. (1997) is an implementation of this model. We demonstrate the stability and robustness of the detector by analyzing its behavior in the presence of noise, using synthetic/controlled apparatus. We also present a qualitative study of its behavior on real images."

The descriptor is the output of a large number of weakly trained object category classifiers on the image. The trained categories are selected from an ontology of visual concepts, but the intention is not to encode an explicit decomposition of the scene. Rather, we accept that existing object category classifiers often encode not the category per se but ancillary image characteristics; and that these ancillary characteristics can combine to represent visual classes unrelated to the constituent categories' semantic meanings. \n \nThe advantage of this descriptor is that it allows object-category queries to be made against image databases using efficient classifiers (efficient at test time) such as linear support vector machines, and allows these queries to be for novel categories. Even when the representation is reduced to 200 bytes per image, classification accuracy on object category recognition is comparable with the state of the art (36% versus 42%), but at orders of magnitude lower computational cost."

Our contour detector combines multiple local cues into a globalization framework based on spectral clustering. Our segmentation algorithm consists of generic machinery for transforming the output of any contour detector into a hierarchical region tree. In this manner, we reduce the problem of image segmentation to that of contour detection. Extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that both our contour detection and segmentation methods significantly outperform competing algorithms. The automatically generated hierarchical segmentations can be interactively refined by user-specified annotations. Computation at multiple image resolutions provides a means of coupling our system to recognition applications."

The general idea behind integral channel features is that multiple registered image channels are computed using linear and \nnon-linear transformations of the input image, and then features such as local sums, histograms, and Haar features and their various generalizations are efficiently computed \nusing integral images. Such features have been used in recent literature for a variety of \ntasks \u2013 indeed, variations appear to have been invented independently multiple times. \nAlthough integral channel features have proven effective, little effort has been devoted to \nanalyzing or optimizing the features themselves. In this work we present a unified view \nof the relevant work in this area and perform a detailed experimental evaluation. We \ndemonstrate that when designed properly, integral channel features not only outperform \nother features including histogram of oriented gradient (HOG), they also (1) naturally \nintegrate heterogeneous sources of information, (2) have few parameters and are insensitive to exact parameter settings, (3) allow for more accurate spatial localization during \ndetection, and (4) result in fast detectors when coupled with cascade classifiers."

The success of the approach depends on the definition of a comprehensive set of goals for the computation of edge points. These goals must be precise enough to delimit the desired behavior of the detector while making minimal assumptions about the form of the solution. We define detection and localization criteria for a class of edges, and present mathematical forms for these criteria as functionals on the operator impulse response. A third criterion is then added to ensure that the detector has only one response to a single edge. We use the criteria in numerical optimization to derive detectors for several common image features, including step edges. On specializing the analysis to step edges, we find that there is a natural uncertainty principle between detection and localization performance, which are the two main goals. With this principle we derive a single operator shape which is optimal at any scale. The optimal detector has a simple approximate implementation in which edges are marked at maxima in gradient magnitude of a Gaussian-smoothed image. We extend this simple detector using operators of several widths to cope with different signal-to-noise ratios in the image. We present a general method, called feature synthesis, for the fine-to-coarse integration of information from operators at different scales. Finally we show that step edge detector performance improves considerably as the operator point spread function is extended along the edge."

(1) Intensity changes, which occur in a natural image over a wide range of scales, are detected separately at different scales. An appropriate filter for this purpose at a given scale is found to be the second derivative of a Gaussian, and it is shown that, provided some simple conditions are satisfied, these primary filters need not be orientation-dependent. Thus, intensity changes at a given scale are best detected by finding the zero values of \u22072G(x, y)* I(x, y) for image I, where G(x, y) is a two-dimensional Gaussian distribution and \u22072 is the Laplacian. The intensity changes thus discovered in each of the channels are then represented by oriented primitives called zero-crossing segments, and evidence is given that this representation is complete. (2) Intensity changes in images arise from surface discontinuities or from reflectance or illumination boundaries, and these all have the property that they are spatially localized. Because of this, the zero-crossing segments from the different channels are not independent, and rules are deduced for combining them into a description of the image. This description is called the raw primal sketch. The theory explains several basic psychophysical findings, and the operation of forming oriented zero-crossing segments from the output of centre-surround \u22072G filters acting on the image forms the basis for a physiological model of simple cells (see Marr & Ullman 1979)."

In this paper, we focus on learning such descriptors, which make use of the DAISY configuration and are simple to compute both sparsely and densely. We develop a new training set of match/non-match image patches which improves on previous work. We test a wide variety of gradient and steerable filter based configurations and optimize over all parameters to obtain low matching errors for the descriptors. We further explore robust normalization, dimension reduction and dynamic range reduction to increase the discriminative power and yet reduce the storage requirement of the learned descriptors. All these enable us to obtain highly efficient local descriptors: e.g, 13.2% error at 13 bytes storage per descriptor, compared with 26.1% error at 128 bytes for SIFT."

We define a predicate for measuring the evidence for a boundary between two regions using a graph-based representation of the image. We then develop an efficient segmentation algorithm based on this predicate, and show that although this algorithm makes greedy decisions it produces segmentations that satisfy global properties. We apply the algorithm to image segmentation using two different kinds of local neighborhoods in constructing the graph, and illustrate the results with both real and synthetic images. The algorithm runs in time nearly linear in the number of graph edges and is also fast in practice. An important characteristic of the method is its ability to preserve detail in low-variability image regions while ignoring detail in high-variability regions."

Using complementary priors, we derive a fast, greedy algorithm that can learn deep, directed belief networks one layer at a time, provided the top two layers form an undirected associative memory. The fast, greedy algorithm is used to initialize a slower learning procedure that fine-tunes the weights using a contrastive version of the wake-sleep algorithm. After fine-tuning, a network with three hidden layers forms a very good generative model of the joint distribution of handwritten digit images and their labels. This generative model gives better digit classification than the best discriminative learning algorithms. The low-dimensional manifolds on which the digits lie are modeled by long ravines in the free-energy landscape of the top-level associative memory, and it is easy to explore these ravines by using the directed connections to display what the associative memory has in mind."

The traditional approach to recognition and 3D reconstruction of human activity has been to track motion in 3D, mainly using advanced geometric and dynamic models. In this paper we reverse this process. View based activity recognition serves as an input to a human body location tracker with the ultimate goal of 3D reanimation in mind. We demonstrate that specific human actions can be detected from single frame postures in a video sequence. By recognizing the image of a person's posture as corresponding to a particular key frame from a set of stored key frames, it is possible to map body locations from the key frames to actual frames. This is achieved using a shape matching algorithm based on qualitative similarity that computes point to point correspondence between shapes, together with information about appearance. As the mapping is from fixed key frames, our tracking does not suffer from the problem of having to reinitialise when it gets lost. It is effectively a closed loop. We present experimental results both for recognition and tracking for a sequence of a tennis player."

This gives us the opportunity to write and optimize the core implementation only once, with application to many diverse tasks. \n \nThe proposed model may be used both in a discriminative or generative way and may be applied to discrete or continuous, labeled or unlabeled data. \n \nThe main contributions of this review are: (1) Proposing a unified, probabilistic and efficient model for a variety of learning tasks; (2) Demonstrating margin-maximizing properties of classification forests; (3) Discussing probabilistic regression forests in comparison with other nonlinear regression algorithms; (4) Introducing density forests for estimating probability density functions; (5) Proposing an efficient algorithm for sampling from a density forest; (6) Introducing manifold forests for nonlinear dimensionality reduction; (7) Proposing new algorithms for transductive learning and active learning. Finally, we discuss how alternatives such as random ferns and extremely randomized trees stem from our more general forest model. \n \nThis document is directed at both students who wish to learn the basics of decision forests, as well as researchers interested in the new contributions. It presents both fundamental and novel concepts in a structured way, with many illustrative examples and real-world applications. Thorough comparisons with state-of-the-art algorithms such as support vector machines, boosting and Gaussian processes are presented and relative advantages and disadvantages discussed. The many synthetic examples and existing commercial applications demonstrate the validity of the proposed model and its flexibility."

The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund & R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference, ***, 148\u2013156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression."
