                "text": "Inverse problems, such as the reconstruction problems that arise in early vision, tend to be mathematically ill-posed. Through regularization, they may be reformulated as well-posed variational principles whose solutions are computable. Standard regularization theory employs quadratic stabilizing functionals that impose global smoothness constraints on possible solutions. Discontinuities present serious difficulties to standard regularization, however, since their reconstruction requires a precise spatial control over the smoothing properties of stabilizers. This paper proposes a general class of controlled-continuity stabilizers which provide the necessary control over smoothness. These nonquadratic stabilizing functionals comprise multiple generalized spline kernels combined with (noncontinuous) continuity control functions. In the context of computational vision, they may be thought of as controlled-continuity constraints. These generic constraints are applicable to visual reconstruction problems that involve both continuous regions and discontinuities, for which global smoothness constraints fail."

The sensitivity of a regularized estimate of f to the noise is made explicit. After giving the intrinsic rank of the examples of first and second derivative, Abel's equation and Fujita's equation, it is argued that the first three are only mildly ill posed and f should be amendable to accurate estimation by the method of regularization. The method of Generalized Cross Validation (GCV) for choosing the regularization parameter is described and numerical results for the estimation of first and second derivative from noisy data are given. Two numerical algorithms for obtaining a regularized estimate with GCV are detailed. The second uses a B-spline basis to allow the handling of large data sets. This use of outside information in the estimation of f is discussed. We discuss the problem of checking the validity of the 'model' k, and provide a crude goodness-of-fit test. Finally we end by describing the (known) result that the number k of iterations in a Landweber iteration for solving large linear systems is a form of regularization parameter. We than show how GCV can feasibly be used to choose k in very large problems like those arising in computerized tomography."

Such problems occur frequently in instrumental science, e.g. tomography, radar, sonar, optical imaging, particle sizing and so on. They give a general formulation of the problem by extending the approach of Backus and Gilbert (1968) and by defining a mapping from an infinite-dimensional function space into a finite-dimensional vector space. The singular system of this mapping is introduced and used to define natural bases both in the solution and in the data space. They analyse in this context normal solutions, least-squares solutions and generalised inverses. They illustrate the wide applicability of the singular system technique by discussing several examples in detail. Particular attention is devoted to showing the many connections between this method and techniques developed in other topics like the extrapolation of band-limited signals and the interpolation of functions specified on a finite set of points. For example, orthogonal polynomials for least-squares approximation, spline functions and discrete prolate spheroidal functions are particular cases of the singular functions introduced. The problem of numerical stability is briefly discussed, but the investigation of the method developed for overcoming this difficulty, like truncated expansions in the singular bases, regularised solutions, iterative methods, and so on, is deferred to a second part of this work."

Moreover, visual processes such as stereopsis can provide such information at a number of levels spanning a range of resolutions. In this paper, we extend this multi-level structure to encompass the subsequent task of reconstructing full surface descriptions from the sparse information. The mathematical development proceeds in three steps. First, the surface most consistent with the sparse constraints is characterized as the solution to an equilibrium state of a thin flexible plate. Second, local, finite element representations of surfaces are introduced and, by applying the finite element method, the continuous variational principle is transformed into a discrete problem in the form of a large system of linear algebraic equations whose solution is computable by local-support, cooperative mechanisms. Third, to exploit the information available at each level of resolution, a hierarchy of discrete problems is formulated and a highly efficient multi-level algorithm, involving both intra-level relaxation processes and bi-directional inter-level algorithm, involving both intra- level relaxation processes and bidirectional inter-level local interpolation processes is applied to their simultaneous solution.. Examples of the generation of hierarchies of surface representations from stereo constraints are given. Finally, the basic surface approximation problem is revisited in a broader mathematical context whose implications are of relevance to vision."

Edge detection operators are typically designed to optimally estimate first or second derivative over some (usually small) support. Other criteria such as output signal to noise ratio or bandwidth have also been been argued for. This thesis is an attempt to formulate a set of edge detection criteria that capture as directly as possible the desirable properties of an edge operator. Variational techniques are used to find a solution over the space of all linear shift invariant operators. The first criterion is that the detector have low probability of error i.e. failing to mark edges or falsely marking non-edges. The second is that the marked points should b The third criterion is that there should be low probability of more than one response to a single edge. The technique is used to find optimal operators for step edges and for extended impulse profiles (ridges or valleys in two dimensions). The extension of the one dimensional operators to two dimensions is then discussed. The result is a set of operators of varying width, length and orientation. The problem of combining these outputs into a single description is discussed, and a set of heuristics for the integration are given. (Author)"

                "text": "Scale-space filtering (Witkin 83) is a recently developed technique, both powerful and general, for segmentation and analysis of signals. Asada and Brady (84) have amply demonstrated the value of scale-space for description of curved contours from digitised images . Weak continuity constraints (Blake 83a,b, Blake and Zisserman 85,87) furnish novel, powerful, non-linear filters , to use in place of gaussians, for scale-space filtering. This has some striking advantages (fig 1). First, scale-space is uniform, so that tracking across scale is a trivial task. Structure need not be preserved to indefinitely fine scale; this leads to an enrichment of the concept of scale a rounded corner, for example, can be represented as a discontinuity at coarse scale but smooth at fine scale. And finally boundary conditions at ends of curves are handled satisfactorily it is as easy to analyse open curves as closed ones. 1 Weak continuity constraints Weak continuity constraints are a principled and effective treatment of the localisation of discontinuities in discrete data. Detailed discussions are given in (Blake 83a, Blake 83b, Blake and Zisserman 85, Blake and Zisserman 87). Applications in computer vision include curve description, edge detection, reconstruction of 2~D surfaces from stereo or laser-rangefinder data, and others. This paper deals with the application of weak continuity constraints to description of plane curves. First a brief summary of weak continuity constraints is given for problems like curve description, in which the data is a 1D array. Data may be obtained from a plane curve as an array (Ji of tangent angle values at equal spacings in arc-length s . The problem is to localise discontinuities in noisy, discrete data. The notion of a discontinuity applies to functions, not to discrete arrays so the problem is ill-posed, and this is exacerbated by the presence of noise. One solution is to interpolate the data by a smooth function such as a gaussian, whose 1st derivative can then be examined. Of course this is common practice in edge detection and in spline interpolation (e.g. de Boor 78) . Such smoothing can be regarded as fitting a function u(s) which tends to seek a minimum of some elastic energy P. Energy P is traded off against a sum of squares error measure D , defined as : D = ~i(U(Si) (Ji)2 by minimising variationally the total energy (or cost) P+ D. The result is a function u(s) that is both fairly smooth and is a fair approximation to the data (}i. The simplest form of the energy P is that of a horizontal stretched string (approximately) : where the parameter A governs the stiffness of the string. If.>. is large then the tendency to smoothness overwhelms the tendency (from D) to approximate the data well. In the extremes, if'>' is very large, the fitted function is simply u = canst , the least squares regression of a constant function to the data (Ji; but if .>. ~ 0 then u interpolates the data, linking the (Ji by straight lines. Weak continuity constraints can be applied to a scheme like the one above, to incorporate discontinuities explicitly into the fitting of u above. Rather than fitting a u that is smooth everywhere and then examining the gradient u' , the function u is allowed to break (at knots, in spline jargon) it is piecewise continuous. The number and position of the discontinuities is chosen optimally, by using an augmented form of cost function E = D + P + S, where the additional term S embodies weak continuity constraints: s = n' X (number of discontinuities) a fixed penalty a is paid for each discontinuity allowed. This has the effect of discouraging discontinuities; u is continuous \"almost everywhere\". But an occasional discontinuity may be allowed if there is sufficient benefit in terms of smoothness (P) and faithfulness to data (D) in so doing . Clearly a is some kind of measure of reluctance to allow a discontinuity. In fact the two parameters a,'>' interact in a rather interesting way. Far from being \"fudge factors\" that must be empirically set, they have clear interpretations in terms of"

                "text": "An Algorithm is proposed for solving the stereoscopic matching problem. The algorithm consists of five steps: (1) Each image is filtered with bar masks of four sizes that vary with eccentricity; the equivalent filters are about one octave wide. (2) Zero-crossings of the mask values are localized, and positions that correspond to terminations are found; (3) For each mask size, matching takes place between pairs of zero- crossings or terminations of the same sign in the two images, for a range of disparities up to about the vergence movements, thus causing small masks to come into correspondence; (5) When a correspondence is achieved, it is written into a dynamic buffer, called the 2 1/2 D sketch. It is shown that this proposal provides a theoretical framework for most existing phychophysical and neurophysiological data about stereopsis. Several critical experimental predictions are also made, for instance, about the wsize of Panum?s area under various conditions. The results of such experiments would tell us whether, for example, cooperativity is necessary for the fusion process."

A critical, intermediate goal of edge detection is the detection and characterization of significant intensity changes. This paper discusses this part of the edge detection problem. To characterize the types of intensity changes derivatives of different types, and possibly different scales, are needed. Thus, we consider this part of edge detection as a problem in numerical differentiation. We show that numerical differentiation of images is an ill-posed problem in the sense of Hadamard. Differentiation needs to be regularized by a regularizing filtering operation before differentiation. This shows that this part of edge detection consists of two steps, a filtering step and a differentiation step. Following this perspective, the paper discusses in detail the following theoretical aspects of edge detection. 1) The properties of different types of filters-with minimal uncertainty, with a bandpass spectrum, and with limited support-are derived. Minimal uncertainty filters optimize a tradeoff between computational efficiency and regularizing properties. 2) Relationships among several 2-D differential operators are established. In particular, we characterize the relation between the Laplacian and the second directional derivative along the gradient. Zero crossings of the Laplacian are not the only features computed in early vision. 3) Geometrical and topological properties of the zero crossings of differential operators are studied in terms of transversality and Morse theory."

                "text": "Computational theories of structure-from-motion and stereo vision only specify the computation of three-dimensional surface information at special points in the image. Yet the visual perception is clearly of complete surfaces. To account for this a computational theory of the interpolation of surfaces from visual information is presented. The problem is constrained by the fact that the surface must agree with the information from stereo or motion correspondence, and not vary radically between these points. Using the image irradiance equation, an explicit form of this surface consistency constraint can be derived. To determine which of two possible surfaces is more consistent with the surface consistency constraint, one must be able to compare the two surfaces. To do this, a functional from the space of possible functions to the real numbers is required. In this way, the surface most consistent with the visual information will be that which minimizes the functional. To ensure that the functional has a unique minimal surface, conditions on the form of the functional are derived. In particular, if the functional is a complete semi-norm that satisfies the parallelogram law, or the space of functions is a semi-Hilbert space and the functional is a semi-inner product, then there is a unique (to within possibly an element of the null space of the functional) surface that is most consistent with the visual information. It can be shown, based on the above conditions plus a condition of rotational symmetry, that there is a vector space of possible functionals that measure surface consistency, this vector space being spanned by the functional of quadratic variation and the functional of square Laplacian. Arguments based on the null spaces of the respective functionals are used to justify the choice of the quadratic variation as the optimal functional. Possible refinements to the theory, concerning the role of discontinuities in depth and the effects of applying the interpolation process to scenes containing more than one object, are discussed."

In particular, we have described the development by Horn and his colleagues of the reflectance map, the albedo image, and the Gaussian image, and we have described the work of the group founded by Marr using the primal sketch, the 2 1/2 D sketch, and axis based 3-D models. In the April, 1981 Proceedings, we reviewed work on computing shape from shading and occluding boundaries, including a local parallel algorithm for doing this due to Ikeuchi and Horn 1981; the detection and perception of motion by computing the optical flow and directional selectivity of zero crossings; the interpolation of curves and surfaces; the real-time convolution of images with a difference-of-Gaussians (DOG) operator; and progress toward computing the full primal sketch. Here we review work on stereo to facilitate the computation of depth information and visible surface characteristics, the detction and interpretation of motion, the interpolation and description of visible surfaces, the description of two- and three-dimensional shapes, real-time convolution, and shape from shading.

The algorithm consists of five steps: (1) Each image is filtered at different orientations with bar masks of four sizes that increase with eccentricity; the equivalent filters are one or two octaves wide. (2) Zero-crossings in the filtered images, which roughly correspond to edges, are localized. Positions of the ends of lines and edges are also found. (3) For each mask orientation and size, matching takes place between pairs of zero-crossings or terminations of the same sign in the two images, for a range of disparities up to about the width of the mask\u2019s central region. (4) Wide masks can control vergence movements, thus causing small masks to come into correspondence. (5) When a correspondence is achieved, it is stored in a dynamic buffer, called the 2\u00bd-D sketch. It is shown that this proposal provides a theoretical framework for most existing psychophysical and neurophysiological data about stereopsis. Several critical experimental predictions are also made, for instance about the size of Panum\u2019s area under various conditions. The results of such experiments would tell us whether, for example, co-operativity is necessary for the matching process."

                "text": "A theory of edge detection is presented. The analysis proceeds in two parts. (1) Intensity changes, which occur in a natural image over a wide range of scales, are detected separately at different scales. An appropriate filter for this purpose at a given scale is found to be the second derivative of a Gaussian, and it is shown that, provided some simple conditions are satisfied, these primary filters need not be orientation-dependent. Thus, intensity changes at a given scale are best detected by finding the zero values of \u22072G(x, y)* I(x, y) for image I, where G(x, y) is a two-dimensional Gaussian distribution and \u22072 is the Laplacian. The intensity changes thus discovered in each of the channels are then represented by oriented primitives called zero-crossing segments, and evidence is given that this representation is complete. (2) Intensity changes in images arise from surface discontinuities or from reflectance or illumination boundaries, and these all have the property that they are spatially localized. Because of this, the zero-crossing segments from the different channels are not independent, and rules are deduced for combining them into a description of the image. This description is called the raw primal sketch. The theory explains several basic psychophysical findings, and the operation of forming oriented zero-crossing segments from the output of centre-surround \u22072G filters acting on the image forms the basis for a physiological model of simple cells (see Marr & Ullman 1979)."

This book examines the measurement of this movement and the use of relative movement to locate the boundaries of physical objects in the environment. It investigates the nature of the computations that are necessary to perform this analysis by any vision system, biological or artificial. \nThe author first defines the goals of these visual tasks, reveals the properties of the physical world that a vision system can rely upon to achieve such goals, and suggests general methods that can be used to carry out the tasks. From the general methods, she designs algorithms specifying a particular sequence of computations that a vision system can execute to perform these visual tasks. These algorithms are implemented on a computer system under a variety of circumstances. Combined with the traditional approaches of psychology and neurophysiology, this computational approach provides an exciting analysis of visual function, raising many new questions about the human vision system for further investigation. \nEllen Catherine Hildreth received her doctorate from MIT. She is a Research Scientist in the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory and associate director of theCenter for Biological Information Processing at the Whitaker College of Health Sciences, Technology, and Management. The Measurement of Visual Motion is an ACM Distinguished Dissertation."

This method is complementary to the use of stereoscopy which relies on matching up sharp detail and will fail on smooth objects. Until now the image processing of single views has been restricted to objects which can meaningfully be considered two-dimensional or bounded by plane surfaces. It is possible to derive a first-order non-linear partial differential equation in two unknowns relating the intensity at the image points to the shape of the object. This equation can be solved by means of an equivalent set of five ordinary differential equations. A curve traced out by solving this set of equations for one set of starting values is called a characteristic strip. Starting one of these strips from each point on some initial curve will produce the whole solution surface. The initial curves can usually be constructed around so-called singular points. A number of applications of this method will be discussed including one to lunar topography and one to the scanning electron microscope. In both of these cases great simplifications occur in the equations. A note on polyhedra follows and a quantitative theory of facial make-up is touched upon. An implementation of some of these ideas on the PDP-6 computer with its attached image-dissector camera at the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory will be described, and also a nose-recognition program."

A description of this movement is not provided to our visual system directly, however; it must be inferred from the pattern of changing intensity that reaches the eye. This paper examines the problem of motion measurement, which we formulate as the computation of an instantaneous two-dimensional velocity field from the changing image. Initial measurements of motion take place at the location of significant intensity changes. These measurements provide only one component of local velocity, and must be integrated to compute the two-dimensional velocity field. A fundamental problem for this integration stage is that the velocity field is not determined uniquely from information available in the changing image. We formulate an additional constraint of smoothness of the velocity field, based on the physical assumption that surfaces are generally smooth, which allows the computation of a unique velocity field. A theoretical analysis of the conditions under which this computation yields the correct velocity field suggests that the solution is physically plausible. Empirical studies show the predictions of this computation to be consistent with human motion perception."

It has been shown that the location and the nature of singular points of the motion field carry most of the relevant information on 3-D motion. Moreover, since the singular points of the motion field are usually structurally stable, the extraction of 3-D motion information from them is robust against noise and small perturbations. The practical relevance of the proposed approach is justified by the observation that it is possible to obtain from a time-varying sequence of images a 2-D vector field which is very close to the true motion field. As a consequence the recovery of 3-D motion from structurally stable properties of the optical flow is feasible and provides good experimental results. Therefore, the whole framework seems very appropriate for computer vision.<<ETX>>"

In this paper we consider the problem of optimizing spatial frequency domain filters for detecting edges in digital pictures. The filter is optimum in that it produces maximum energy within a resolution interval of specified width in the vicinity of the edge. We show that, in the continuous case, the filter transfer function is specified in terms of the prolate spheroidal wave function. In the discrete case, the filter transfer function is specified in terms of the sampled values of the first-order prolate spheroidal wave function or in terms of the sampled values of an asymptotic approximation of the wave function. Both versions can be implemented via the fast Fourier transform (FFT). We show that the optimum filter is very effective for detecting blufred and noisy edges. Finally, we compare the performance of the optimum edge detection filter with other edge detection filters using a variety of input images."

A fundamental problem of motion measurement in general is that the velocity field is not determined uniquely from the changing intensity patterns. They formulate the measurement of motion as the computation of the smoothest velocity field consistent with the changing contour. We analyse this Extremum principle and prove that it is closely related to a matching scheme for motion measurement which matches points on the moving contour that have similar tangent vectors. We then derive necessary and sufficient conditions for the principle to yield the correct velocity field. These results have possible implications for the design of computer visions systems, and for the study of human vision."

Therefore, dense optical flow is often ill-suited for computing structure from motion and for reconstructing the 3-D velocity field by algorithms which require a locally accurate estimate of the motion field. A different use of the optical flow is suggested. It is shown that the (smoothed) optical flow and the motion field can be interpreted as vector fields tangent to flows of planar dynamical systems. Stable qualitative properties of the motion field, which give useful informations about the 3-D velocity field and the 3-D structure of the scene, usually can be obtained from the optical flow. The idea is supported by results from the theory of structural stability of dynamical systems. >"

Pixel gray levels and the presence and orientation of edges are viewed as states of atoms or molecules in a lattice-like physical system. The assignment of an energy function in the physical system determines its Gibbs distribution. Because of the Gibbs distribution, Markov random field (MRF) equivalence, this assignment also determines an MRF image model. The energy function is a more convenient and natural mechanism for embodying picture attributes than are the local characteristics of the MRF. For a range of degradation mechanisms, including blurring, nonlinear deformations, and multiplicative or additive noise, the posterior distribution is an MRF with a structure akin to the image model. By the analogy, the posterior distribution defines another (imaginary) physical system. Gradual temperature reduction in the physical system isolates low energy states (``annealing''), or what is the same thing, the most probable states under the Gibbs distribution. The analogous operation under the posterior distribution yields the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the image given the degraded observations. The result is a highly parallel ``relaxation'' algorithm for MAP estimation. We establish convergence properties of the algorithm and we experiment with some simple pictures, for which good restorations are obtained at low signal-to-noise ratios."

A method for finding the optical flow pattern is presented which assumes that the apparent velocity of the brightness pattern varies smoothly almost everywhere in the image. An iterative implementation is shown which successfully computes the optical flow for a number of synthetic image sequences. The algorithm is robust in that it can handle image sequences that are quantized rather coarsely in space and time. It is also insensitive to quantization of brightness levels and additive noise.

                "text": "It appears that the development of machine vision may benefit from a detailed understanding of the imaging process. The reflectance map, showing scene radiance as a function of surface gradient, has proved to be helpful in this endeavor. The reflectance map depends both on the nature of the surface layers of the objects being imaged and the distribution of light sources. Recently, a unified approach to the specification of surface reflectance in terms of both incident and reflected beam geometry has been proposed. The reflecting properties of a surface are specified in terms of the bidirectional reflectance-distribution function (BRDF). Here we derive the reflectance map in terms of the BRDF and the distribution of source radiance. A number of special cases of practical importance are developed in detail. The significance of this approach to the understanding of image formation is briefly indicated."

                "text": "SummarySmoothing splines are well known to provide nice curves which smooth discrete, noisy data. We obtain a practical, effective method for estimating the optimum amount of smoothing from the data. Derivatives can be estimated from the data by differentiating the resulting (nearly) optimally smoothed spline.We consider the modelyi(ti)+\u03b5i,i=1, 2, ...,n,ti\u2208[0, 1], whereg\u2208W2(m)={f:f,f\u2032, ...,f(m\u22121) abs. cont.,f(m)\u2208\u21122[0,1]}, and the {\u03b5i} are random errors withE\u03b5i=0,E\u03b5i\u03b5j=\u03c32\u03b4ij. The error variance \u03c32 may be unknown. As an estimate ofg we take the solutiongn, \u03bb to the problem: Findf\u2208W2(m) to minimize\n$$\\frac{1}{n}\\sum\\limits_{j = 1}^n {(f(t_j ) - y_j )^2 + \\lambda \\int\\limits_0^1 {(f^{(m)} (u))^2 du} }$$\n. The functiongn, \u03bb is a smoothing polynomial spline of degree 2m\u22121. The parameter \u03bb controls the tradeoff between the \u201croughness\u201d of the solution, as measured by\n$$\\int\\limits_0^1 {[f^{(m)} (u)]^2 du}$$\n, and the infidelity to the data as measured by\n$$\\frac{1}{n}\\sum\\limits_{j = 1}^n {(f(t_j ) - y_j )^2 }$$\n, and so governs the average square errorR(\u03bb; g)=R(\u03bb) defined by\n$$R(\\lambda ) = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum\\limits_{j = 1}^n {(g_{n,\\lambda } (t_j ) - g(t_j ))^2 }$$\n. We provide an estimate\n$$\\hat \\lambda$$\n, called the generalized cross-validation estimate, for the minimizer ofR(\u03bb). The estimate\n$$\\hat \\lambda$$\n is the minimizer ofV(\u03bb) defined by\n$$V(\\lambda ) = \\frac{1}{n}\\parallel (I - A(\\lambda ))y\\parallel ^2 /\\left[ {\\frac{1}{n}{\\text{Trace(}}I - A(\\lambda ))} \\right]^2$$\n, wherey=(y1, ...,yn)t andA(\u03bb) is then\u00d7n matrix satisfying(gn, \u03bb (t1), ...,gn, \u03bb (tn))t=A (\u03bb) y. We prove that there exist a sequence of minimizers\n$$\\tilde \\lambda = \\tilde \\lambda (n)$$\n ofEV(\u03bb), such that as the (regular) mesh{ti}i=1n becomes finer,\n$$\\mathop {\\lim }\\limits_{n \\to \\infty } ER(\\tilde \\lambda )/\\mathop {\\min }\\limits_\\lambda ER(\\lambda ) \\downarrow 1$$\n. A Monte Carlo experiment with several smoothg's was tried withm=2,n=50 and several values of \u03c32, and typical values of\n$$R(\\hat \\lambda )/\\mathop {\\min }\\limits_\\lambda R(\\lambda )$$\n were found to be in the range 1.01\u20131.4. The derivativeg\u2032 ofg can be estimated by\n$$g'_{n,\\hat \\lambda } (t)$$\n. In the Monte Carlo examples tried, the minimizer of\n$$R_D (\\lambda ) = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum\\limits_{j = 1}^n {(g'_{n,\\lambda } (t_j ) - } g'(t_j ))$$\n tended to be close to the minimizer ofR(\u03bb), so that\n$$\\hat \\lambda$$\n was also a good value of the smoothing parameter for estimating the derivative."

The method, referred to as photometric stereo, can be implemented using table lookup based on numerical inversion of reflectance maps. Here we concentrate on objects with specularly reflecting surfaces, since these are of importance in industrial applications. Previous methods, intended for diffusely reflecting surfaces, employed point source illumination, which is quite unsuitable in this case. Instead, we use a distributed light source obtained by uneven illumination of a diffusely reflecting planar surface. Experimental results are shown to verify analytic expressions obtained for a method employing three light source distributions."

It is important to choose $\\lambda $ correctly. The purpose of this paper is to propose the method of weighted cross-validation for choosing $\\lambda $from the data. We suppose that g is very smooth and the errors are white noise. It is shown that the weighted cross-validation estimate $\\hat \\lambda $ estimates the value of $\\lambda $ which minimizes $({1 / n})E\\sum\\nolimits_{j = 1}^n {[(\\mathcal{K}f_{n,\\lambda } )(t_j ) - (\\mathcal{K}f)(t_j )]} ^2 $ .

Le chapitre III applique les r\u00e9sultats pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents au probl\u00e8me de Steenrod: Toute classe d'homologie d'un poly\u00e8dre fini est-elle l'image de la classe fondamentale d'une vari\u00e9t\u00e9 1 On y montre que, Ri le probl\u00e8me admet une r\u00e9ponse affirmative en homologie mod 2, il existe au contraire, pour toute dimension ~ 7, des classes d'homologie enti\u00e8re qui ne sont l'image d'aucune vari\u00e9t\u00e9 diff\u00e9rentiable compacte. Le chapitre IV, enfin, est consacr\u00e9 \u00e0 l'\u00e9tude des conditions pour qu'une vari\u00e9t\u00e9 soit une vari\u00e9t\u00e9-bord, et \u00e0 la classification des vari\u00e9t\u00e9s cobordantes. Ici encore, on obtient des r\u00e9sultats assez complets pour les classes \u00abmod 2\u00bb, sans condition d'orientabilit\u00e9. Par contre, je n'ai pu donner que des r\u00e9sultats fragmentaires pour les groupes Qk qui s'introduisent dans la classification des vari\u00e9t\u00e9s orient\u00e9es, \u00e0 cause de difficult\u00e9s alg\u00e9briques li\u00e9es en particulier au comportement des puissances de Steenrod dans la suite spec-"
