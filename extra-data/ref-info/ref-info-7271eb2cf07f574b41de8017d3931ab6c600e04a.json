The localization method has been implemented and experimental results are presented demonstrating the localization of a target to within 11 m of its known location"

The UAV components include the avionics, ground station, and a gimballing camera with feedback isolation and command loops. The point of interest is locked in the camera image by maintaining the center of the image frame-to-frame. An architecture for a geolocation tracking estimator is developed and demonstrated. The estimator has the unique characteristics of being 1) modular so that it can work with different camera systems and different UAV components; 2) able to compensate for random and bias uncertainties in the UAV hardware components; 3) able to run in real time on a relatively slow processor; and 4) able to deliver an accurate estimate of the location and uncertainty of the object being tracked. Flight results using the SeaScan UAV show excellent results for two and three dimensional tracking of stationary and moving targets."

The system includes a mountable head with three on-board stereo CCD cameras that can be installed on the robot. There the main emphasis is on the ability to estimate the geometric information of the robot independently from any prior scene knowledge, landmark or extra sensory device. Distinctive scene features are identified using a novel algorithm and their 3D locations are estimated with a stereo algorithm. Using multi-stage feature tracking and motion estimation in a symbolic manner, precise motion vectors are obtained. The 3D positions of the scene features are updated by a Kalman filtering process. Experimental results show that robust tracking and localization can be achieved using our vision system."

The two camera angles are adjusted automatically in order to keep the target in the camera's field of view. While the camera actuators are fast enough to keep up with vehicle motion, the limited range of the camera angles leads to the target getting out of sight. Therefore, target exposure is affected by wind. Furthermore, the relative position of the sun can lead to glare and image overexposure. While the effect of wind can be improved by commanding a sideslip angle, image overexposure is avoided by keeping the vehicle between sun and target. Thus, it is desirable of define maneuvers that result in maximum target exposure, and provide guidance laws to allow path following for these maneuvers. This paper presents initial results, obtained based on circular and elliptical maneuvers. The results were generated using an accurate non-linear Aerosonde UAV representation and environmental dynamic models. Simulated GPS data was used for the path following guidance. The complete path about the target at constant altitude and airspeed is specified simply by the desired orbital segment and course reversals at the segment boundaries. With camera pan limited to the forward 180\u00b0, this can achieve long term observation. A camera with minor 'look-back' range can provide continuous observation in a maneuver that employs both circular and elliptical segments."

                "text": "The ability to locate scenes and objects visible in aerial video imagery with their corresponding locations and coordinates in a reference coordinate system is important in visually-guided navigation, surveillance and monitoring systems. However, a key technical problem of locating objects and scenes in a video with their geo-coordinates needs to be solved in order to ascertain the geo-location of objects seen from the camera platform's current location. We present the key algorithms for the problem of accurate mapping between camera coordinates and geo-coordinates, called geo-spatial registration. Current systems for geo-location use the position and attitude information for the moving platform in some fixed world coordinates to locate the video frames in the reference database. However, the accuracy achieved is only of the order of 100s of pixels. Our approach utilizes the imagery and terrain information contained in the geo-spatial database to precisely align dynamic videos with the reference imagery and thus achieves a much higher accuracy. Applications of geo-spatial registration include aerial mapping, target location and tracking and enhanced visualization such as the overlay of textual/graphical annotations of objects of interest in the current video using the stored annotations in the reference database."

As technical advances have made UAV\u2019s smaller and less expensive, they have become more flexible and extensive in their roles. To continue using smaller and less expensive components while retaining and even enhancing performance requires more sophisticated processing of sensor data in order for the UAV to accurately determine its state and thereby allow the use of feedback in controlling the aircraft automatically. This work presents a three-stage state-estimation scheme for the class of UAV\u2019s know as Miniature Air Vehicles (MAV\u2019s). The first stage estimates pitch and roll, the second stage estimates heading, and the third stage produces a position estimate and an estimate of wind speed and direction. All three stages make use of the extended Kalman filter, a framework for using a system dynamic model to predict future states and to update the predictions using weighted sensor measurements as they become available, where the weighting is based on the relative uncertainty of the dynamic model and the sensors. Using the three-stage state estimation scheme, significant improvements in the estimation of pitch, roll and heading have been achieved in simulation and flight testing. Performance of the navigation (position and wind) stage is comparable to an existing baseline algorithms for position and wind, and shows additional promise for use in dead reckoning when GPS updates become unavailable."

We present the results of experiments in air-ground localization analyzing three complementary approaches to determining the positions of vehicles on the ground.

No assumptions about the sampling rate of the two sensors are made. The basic idea is a common state vector and a common dynamic description which is stored together with the time instant of the estimation. Every time one of the sensor sends new data, the corresponding filter equation is updated and a new estimation is generated. In this paper the filter equations for an extended Kalman filter are derived together with considerations of the tuning. Simulations with real sensor data show the successful implementation of this concept. \u00a9 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."

In this paper, we outline a feasible, hierarchal approach for real-time motion planning of small autonomous flxed-wing UAVs. The approach divides the trajectory generation into four tasks: waypoint path planning, dynamic trajectory smoothing, trajectory tracking, and low-level autopilot compensation. The waypoint path planner determines the vehicle\u2019s route without regard for the dynamic constraints of the vehicle. This results in a signiflcant reduction in the path search space, enabling the generation of complicated paths that account for pop-up and dynamically moving threats. Kinematic constraints are satisfled using a trajectory smoother which has the same kinematic structure as the physical vehicle. The third step of the approach uses a novel tracking algorithm to generate a feasible state trajectory that can be followed by a standard autopilot. Monte-Carlo simulations were done to analyze the performance and feasibility of the approach and determine real-time computation requirements. A planar version of the algorithm has also been implemented and tested in a low-cost micro-controller. The paper describes a custom UAV built to test the algorithms."

At the University of Massachusetts we are developing an aerial reconnaissance system capable of generating high resolution, geographically registered terrain models (in the form of a seamless mosaic) in real-time from a single down-looking digital video camera. The efficiency of the processing algorithms, as well as the simplicity of the hardware, will provide the user with the ability to produce and roam through stereoscopic geo-referenced mosaic images in real-time, and to automatically generate highly accurate 3D terrain models offline in a fraction of the time currently required by softcopy conventional photogrammetry systems. The system is organized around a set of integrated sensor and software components. The instrumentation package is comprised of several inexpensive commercial-off-the-shelf components, including a digital video camera, a differential GPS, and a 3-axis heading and reference system. At the heart of the system is a set of software tools for image registration, mosaic generation, geo-location and aircraft state vector recovery. Each process is designed to efficiently handle the data collected by the instrument package. Particular attention is given to minimizing geospatial errors at each stage, as well as modeling propagation of errors through the system. Preliminary results for an urban and forested scene are discussed in detail."

At the University of Massachusetts we are developing an aerial reconnaissance system capable of generating high resolution, geographically registered terrain models (in the form of a seamless mosaic) in real-time from a single down-looking digital video camera. The efficiency of the processing algorithms, as well as the simplicity of the hardware, will provide the user with the ability to produce and roam through stereoscopic geo-referenced mosaic images in real-time, and to automatically generate highly accurate 3D terrain models offline in a fraction of the time currently required by softcopy conventional photogrammetry systems. The system is organized around a set of integrated sensor and software components. The instrumentation package is comprised of several inexpensive commercial-off-the-shelf components, including a digital video camera, a differential GPS, and a 3-axis heading and reference system. At the heart of the system is a set of software tools for image registration, mosaic generation, geo-location and aircraft state vector recovery. Each process is designed to efficiently handle the data collected by the instrument package. Particular attention is given to minimizing geospatial errors at each stage, as well as modeling propagation of errors through the system. Preliminary results for an urban and forested scene are discussed in detail."
