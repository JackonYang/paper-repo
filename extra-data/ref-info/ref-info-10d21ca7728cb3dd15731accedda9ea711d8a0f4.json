We introduce two novel perceptroninspired reranking algorithms that improve on the quality of machine translation over the baseline system based on evaluation using the BLEU metric. We provide experimental results on the NIST 2003 Chinese-English large data track evaluation. We also provide theoretical analysis of our algorithms and experiments that verify that our algorithms provide state-of-theart performance in machine translation."

We make use of a conditional log-linear model, with hidden variables representing the assignment of lexical items to word clusters or word senses. The model learns to automatically make these assignments based on a discriminative training criterion. Training and decoding with the model requires summing over an exponential number of hidden-variable assignments: the required summations can be computed efficiently and exactly using dynamic programming. As a case study, we apply the model to parse reranking. The model gives an F-measure improvement of a 1.25% beyond the base parser, and an a 0.25% improvement beyond the Collins (2000) reranker. Although our experiments are focused on parsing, the techniques described generalize naturally to NLP structures other than parse trees."

Our empirical results, which hold for all examined language pairs, suggest that the highest levels of performance can be obtained through relatively simple means: heuristic learning of phrase translations from word-based alignments and lexical weighting of phrase translations. Surprisingly, learning phrases longer than three words and learning phrases from high-accuracy word-level alignment models does not have a strong impact on performance. Learning only syntactically motivated phrases degrades the performance of our systems."

A general problem of this approach is that there is only a loose relation to the final translation quality on unseen text. In this paper, we analyze various training criteria which directly optimize translation quality. These training criteria make use of recently proposed automatic evaluation metrics. We describe a new algorithm for efficient training an unsmoothed error count. We show that significantly better results can often be obtained if the final evaluation criterion is taken directly into account as part of the training procedure."

We contrast two parameter estimation methods: the perceptron algorithm, and a method based on conditional random fields (CRFs). The models are encoded as deterministic weighted finite state automata, and are applied by intersecting the automata with word-lattices that are the output from a baseline recognizer. The perceptron algorithm has the benefit of automatically selecting a relatively small feature set in just a couple of passes over the training data. However, using the feature set output from the perceptron algorithm (initialized with their weights), CRF training provides an additional 0.5% reduction in word error rate, for a total 1.8% absolute reduction from the baseline of 39.2%."

A beam-search algorithm is used during both training and decoding phases of the method. The perceptron approach was implemented with the same feature set as that of an existing generative model (Roark, 2001a), and experimental results show that it gives competitive performance to the generative model on parsing the Penn treebank. We demonstrate that training a perceptron model to combine with the generative model during search provides a 2.1 percent F-measure improvement over the generative model alone, to 88.8 percent."

In an experimental comparison of two statistical significance tests we show that p-values are estimated more conservatively by approximate randomization than by bootstrap tests, thus increasing the likelihood of type-I error for the latter. We point out a pitfall of randomly assessing significance in multiple pairwise comparisons, and conclude with a recommendation to combine NIST with approximate randomization, at more stringent rejection levels than is currently standard."

We define a concept of word-by-word alignment between such pairs of sentences. For any given pair of such sentences each of our models assigns a probability to each of the possible word-by-word alignments. We give an algorithm for seeking the most probable of these alignments. Although the algorithm is suboptimal, the alignment thus obtained accounts well for the word-by-word relationships in the pair of sentences. We have a great deal of data in French and English from the proceedings of the Canadian Parliament. Accordingly, we have restricted our work to these two languages; but we feel that because our algorithms have minimal linguistic content they would work well on other pairs of languages. We also feel, again because of the minimal linguistic content of our algorithms, that it is reasonable to argue that word-by-word alignments are inherent in any sufficiently large bilingual corpus."

Objects are modeled as flexible constellations of parts conditioned on local observations found by an interest operator. For each object class the probability of a given assignment of parts to local features is modeled by a Conditional Random Field (CRF). We propose an extension of the CRF framework that incorporates hidden variables and combines class conditional CRFs into a unified framework for part-based object recognition. The parameters of the CRF are estimated in a maximum likelihood framework and recognition proceeds by finding the most likely class under our model. The main advantage of the proposed CRF framework is that it allows us to relax the assumption of conditional independence of the observed data (i.e. local features) often used in generative approaches, an assumption that might be too restrictive for a considerable number of object classes."
