Our method can deal with significant affine transformations including large scale changes. Such transformations introduce significant changes in the point location as well as in the scale and the shape of the neighbourhood of an interest point. Our approach allows to solve for these problems simultaneously. It is based on three key ideas : 1) The second moment matrix computed in a point can be used to normalize a region in an affine invariant way (skew and stretch). 2) The scale of the local structure is indicated by local extrema of normalized derivatives over scale. 3) An affine-adapted Harris detector determines the location of interest points. A multi-scale version of this detector is used for initialization. An iterative algorithm then modifies location, scale and neighbourhood of each point and converges to affine invariant points. For matching and recognition, the image is characterized by a set of affine invariant points; the affine transformation associated with each point allows the computation of an affine invariant descriptor which is also invariant to affine illumination changes. A quantitative comparison of our detector with existing ones shows a significant improvement in the presence of large affine deformations. Experimental results for wide baseline matching show an excellent performance in the presence of large perspective transformations including significant scale changes. Results for recognition are very good for a database with more than 5000 images."

The method is based on two recent results on scale space: (1) Interest points can be adapted to scale and give repeatable results (geometrically stable). (2) Local extrema over scale of normalized derivatives indicate the presence of characteristic local structures. Our method first computes a multi-scale representation for the Harris interest point detector. We then select points at which a local measure (the Laplacian) is maximal over scales. This allows a selection of distinctive points for which the characteristic scale is known. These points are invariant to scale, rotation and translation as well as robust to illumination changes and limited changes of viewpoint. For indexing, the image is characterized by a set of scale invariant points; the scale associated with each point allows the computation of a scale invariant descriptor. Our descriptors are, in addition, invariant to image rotation, of affine illumination changes and robust to small perspective deformations. Experimental results for indexing show an excellent performance up to a scale factor of 4 for a database with more than 5000 images."

Recent work has shown that scale-space `interest points' may be found with good repeatability in spite of such changes. Further- more, the high entropy of the surrounding image regions means that local descriptors are highly discriminative for matching. For descrip- tors at interest points to be robustly matched between images, they must be as far as possible invariant to the imaging process. In this work we introduce a family of features which use groups of interest points to form geometrically invariant descriptors of image regions. Feature descriptors are formed by resampling the image rel- ative to canonical frames de\u00afned by the points. In addition to robust matching, a key advantage of this approach is that each match implies a hypothesis of the local 2D (projective) transformation. This allows us to immediately reject most of the false matches using a Hough trans- form. We reject remaining outliers using RANSAC and the epipolar constraint. Results show that dense feature matching can be achieved in a few seconds of computation on 1GHz Pentium III machines."

A new set of image elements that are put into correspondence, the so called extremal regions, is introduced. Extremal regions possess highly desirable properties: the set is closed under 1. continuous (and thus projective) transformation of image coordinates and 2. monotonic transformation of image intensities. An efficient (near linear complexity) and practically fast detection algorithm (near frame rate) is presented for an affinely-invariant stable subset of extremal regions, the maximally stable extremal regions (MSER). A new robust similarity measure for establishing tentative correspondences is proposed. The robustness ensures that invariants from multiple measurement regions (regions obtained by invariant constructions from extremal regions), some that are significantly larger (and hence discriminative) than the MSERs, may be used to establish tentative correspondences. The high utility of MSERs, multiple measurement regions and the robust metric is demonstrated in wide-baseline experiments on image pairs from both indoor and outdoor scenes. Significant change of scale (3.5\u00d7), illumination conditions, out-of-plane rotation, occlusion , locally anisotropic scale change and 3D translation of the viewpoint are all present in the test problems. Good estimates of epipolar geometry (average distance from corresponding points to the epipolar line below 0.09 of the inter-pixel distance) are obtained."

Such regions are then described by a set of invariant features, which makes it relatively easy to match them between views and under changing illumination. In previous work, we have presented invariant regions that are based on a combination of corners and edges. The application discussed then was image database retrieval. Here, an alternative method for extracting (affinely) invariant regions is given, that does not depend on the presence of edges or corners in the image but is purely intensity-based. Also, we demonstrate the use of such regions for another application, which is wide baseline stereo matching. As a matter of fact, the goal is to build an opportunistic system that exploits several types of invariant regions as it sees fit. This yields more correspondences and a system that can deal with a wider range of images. To increase the robustness of the system even further, two semi-local constraints on combinations of region correspondences are derived (one geometric, the other photometric). They allow to test the consistency of correspondences and hence to reject falsely matched regions."

Many different descriptors have been proposed in the literature. It is unclear which descriptors are more appropriate and how their performance depends on the interest region detector. The descriptors should be distinctive and at the same time robust to changes in viewing conditions as well as to errors of the detector. Our evaluation uses as criterion recall with respect to precision and is carried out for different image transformations. We compare shape context [Belongie, S, et al., April 2002], steerable filters [Freeman, W and Adelson, E, Setp. 1991], PCA-SIFT [Ke, Y and Sukthankar, R, 2004], differential invariants [Koenderink, J and van Doorn, A, 1987], spin images [Lazebnik, S, et al., 2003], SIFT [Lowe, D. G., 1999], complex filters [Schaffalitzky, F and Zisserman, A, 2002], moment invariants [Van Gool, L, et al., 1996], and cross-correlation for different types of interest regions. We also propose an extension of the SIFT descriptor and show that it outperforms the original method. Furthermore, we observe that the ranking of the descriptors is mostly independent of the interest region detector and that the SIFT-based descriptors perform best. Moments and steerable filters show the best performance among the low dimensional descriptors."

Patterns are described in a feature space of which each dimension is a scale and orientation normalized receptive field (a unit composed of normalized Gaussian-based filters). \n \nScale invariance is obtained by automatic selection of an appropriate local scale [Lin98b] and followed by normalisation of the receptive field to the appropriate scale. Orientation invariance is obtained by the determination of the dominant local orientation and by steering the receptive fields to this orientation. \n \nData is represented structurally in a feature space that is designed for the recognition of static object configurations. In this space an image is modeled by the vectorial representation of the receptive field responses at each pixel, forming a surface in the feature space. Recognition is achieved by measuring the distance between the vector of normalized receptive fields responses of an observed neighborhood and the surface point of the image model. \n \nThe power of a scale equivariant feature space is validated by experimental results for point correspondences in images of different scales and the recognition of objects under different view points."

The features are invariant to image scaling, translation, and rotation, and partially invariant to illumination changes and affine or 3D projection. These features share similar properties with neurons in inferior temporal cortex that are used for object recognition in primate vision. Features are efficiently detected through a staged filtering approach that identifies stable points in scale space. Image keys are created that allow for local geometric deformations by representing blurred image gradients in multiple orientation planes and at multiple scales. The keys are used as input to a nearest neighbor indexing method that identifies candidate object matches. Final verification of each match is achieved by finding a low residual least squares solution for the unknown model parameters. Experimental results show that robust object recognition can be achieved in cluttered partially occluded images with a computation time of under 2 seconds."

Unlike many existing feature extraction methods, which treat the neighborhood of every pixel as a candidate texture element, the proposed algorithm works by selecting a sparse set of affine-invariant local patches. This spatial selection process, besides provi ding greater computational efficiency and reducing redundancy in texton dictionaries, permits the computation of characteristic scale and neighborhood shape for every texture element. Shape information is used to determine the right support region for computing intensity-based descri ptors. When affine invariance is not required, shape can itsel f become a discriminative feature. The proposed texture representation is evaluated in retrieval and classification tasks using the entire Brodatz database and a collection of photographs of textured surfaces featuring viewpoint changes and non-rigid deformations, as well as variations in illumination and appearance ."

To this end we develop a number of novel components. First, we introduce a new edge-based local feature detector that is invariant to similarity transformations. The features are localized on edges and a neighbourhood is estimated in a scale invariant manner. Second, the neighbourhood descriptor computed for foreground features is not affected by background clutter, even if the feature is on an object boundary. Third, the descriptor generalizes Lowe's SIFT method to edges. An object model is learnt from a single training image. The object is then recognized in new images in a series of steps which apply progressively tighter geometric restrictions. A final contribution of this work is to allow sufficient flexibility in the geometric representation that objects in the same visual class can be recognized. Results are demonstrated for various object classes including bikes and rackets."

                "text": "The fact that objects in the world appear in different ways depending on the scale of observation has important implications if one aims at describing them. It shows that the notion of scale is of utmost importance when processing unknown measurement data by automatic methods. In their seminal works, Witkin (1983) and Koenderink (1984) proposed to approach this problem by representing image structures at different scales in a so-called scale-space representation. Traditional scale-space theory building on this work, however, does not address the problem of how to select local appropriate scales for further analysis. This article proposes a systematic methodology for dealing with this problem. A framework is presented for generating hypotheses about interesting scale levels in image data, based on a general principle stating that local extrema over scales of different combinations of \u03b3-normalized derivatives are likely candidates to correspond to interesting structures. Specifically, it is shown how this idea can be used as a major mechanism in algorithms for automatic scale selection, which adapt the local scales of processing to the local image structure.Support for the proposed approach is given in terms of a general theoretical investigation of the behaviour of the scale selection method under rescalings of the input pattern and by integration with different types of early visual modules, including experiments on real-world and synthetic data. Support is also given by a detailed analysis of how different types of feature detectors perform when integrated with a scale selection mechanism and then applied to characteristic model patterns. Specifically, it is described in detail how the proposed methodology applies to the problems of blob detection, junction detection, edge detection, ridge detection and local frequency estimation.In many computer vision applications, the poor performance of the low-level vision modules constitutes a major bottleneck. It is argued that the inclusion of mechanisms for automatic scale selection is essential if we are to construct vision systems to automatically analyse complex unknown environments."

It is applicable to texture patches which are locally planar and have stationary statistics. The novelty of the descriptor is that it is based on statistics aggregated over the region, resulting in richer and more stable descriptors than those computed at a point. Two texture matching applications of this descriptor are demonstrated: (1) it is used to automatically identify, regions of the same type of texture, but with varying surface pose, within a single image; (2) it is used to support wide baseline stereo, i.e. to enable the automatic computation of the epipolar geometry between two images acquired from quite separated viewpoints.

Here, we deal with the development of a computational approach to these important features. We consider first a corner model and study analytically its behavior once it has been smoothed using the well-known Gaussian filter. This allows us to clarify the behavior of some well-knowncornerness measure based approaches used to detect these points of interest. Most of these classical approaches appear to detect points that do not correspond to the exact position of the corner. A new scale-space based approach that combines useful properties from the Laplacian and Beaudet's measure (Beaudet 1978) is then proposed in order to correct and detect exactly the corner position. An extension of this approach is then developed to solve the problem of trihedral vertex characterization and detection. In particular, it is shown that a trihedral vertex has two elliptic maxima on extremal contrast surfaces if the contrast is sufficient, and this allows us to classify trihedral vertexes in 2 classes: \u201cvertex,\u201d and \u201cvertex as corner.\u201d The corner-detection approach developed is applied to accurately detect trihedral vertexes using an additional test in order to make a distinction between trihedral vertexes and corners. Many experiments have been carried out using noisy synthetic data and real images containing corners and vertexes. Most of the promising results obtained are used to illustrate the experimental section of this paper."

On the premise that changes in resolution act as a smoothing equivalent to changes in scale, a scale-space representation of the high-resolution image is produced. Hence the one-to-one classical image matching paradigm becomes one-to-many because the low-resolution image is compared with all the scale-space representations of the high-resolution one. Key to the success of such a process is the proper representation of the features to be matched in scale-space. We show how to extract interest points at variable scales and we devise a method allowing the comparison of two images at two different resolutions. The method comprises the use of photometric- and rotation-invariant descriptors, a geometric model mapping the high-resolution image onto a low-resolution image region, and an image matching strategy based on the robust estimation of this geometric model. Extensive experiments show that our matching method can be used for scale changes up to a factor 6."

This article emphasizes the need for including explicit mechanisms for automatic scale selection in feature tracking algorithms in order to: (i) adapt the local scale of processing to the local image structure, and (ii) adapt to the size variations that may occur over time. The problems of corner detection and blob detection are treated in detail, and a combined framework for feature tracking is presented. The integrated tracking algorithm overcomes some of the inherent limitations of exposing fixed-scale tracking methods to image sequences in which the size variations are large. It is also shown how the stability over time of scale descriptors can be used as a part of a multi-cue similarity measure for matching. Experiments on real-world sequences are presented showing the performance of the algorithm when applied to (individual) tracking of corners and blobs."

Recently, several wide baseline matching algorithms capable of handling large changes of viewpoint have appeared. By computing feature values from image data, these algorithms mainly use appearance as a cue for matching. Topological information, i.e. spatial relations between features, has also been used, but not nearly to the same extent as appearance. In this paper, we incorporate topological constraints into an existing matching algorithm [1] which matches image intensity profiles between interest points. We show that the algorithm can be improved by exploiting the constraint that the intensity profiles around each interest point should be cyclically ordered. String matching techniques allows for an efficient implementation of the ordering constraint. Experiments with real data indicate that the modified algorithm indeed gives superior results to the original one. The method of enforcing the spatial constraints is not limited to the presented case, but can be used on any algorithm where interest point correspondences are sought."

Unlike conventional stereo matching approaches we assume no prior knowledge about the relative camera positions and orientations. In fact in our application this is the information we wish to determine from the image feature matches. Features are detected in two or more images and characterised using affine texture invariants. The problem of window effects is explicitly addressed by our method-our feature characterisation is invariant to linear transformations of the image data including rotation, stretch and skew. The feature matching process is optimised for a structure-from-motion application where we wish to ignore unreliable matches at the expense of reducing the number of feature matches."

In other words, it generates coarse segmentation cues, and can hence be seen as preceding further processing, which can then be properly tuned. It is argued that once such information is available, many other processing tasks can become much simpler. Experiments on real imagery demonstrate that the proposed theory gives intuitive results."

Conditioning on feature positions in some of the images gives well-localized distributions for their correspondents in the others, and hence tight likelihood regions for correspondence search. We apply the framework in the simplest case of Gaussian-like distributions over the direct sum (affine images) and tensor product (projective images) of the image coordinates. This produces probabilistic correspondence models that generalize the geometric multi-image matching constraints, roughly speaking by a form of model-averaging over them. These very simple methods predict accurate correspondence likelihood regions for any scene geometry including planar and near-planar scenes, without ill-conditioning or explicit model selection. Small amounts of distortion and non-rigidity are also tolerated. We develop the theory for any number of affine or projective images, explain its relationship to matching tensors, and give results for an initial implementation."

The shape adaptation procedure adapts the smoothing operation to the local ridge structures, which allows interrupted ridges to be joined without destroying essential singularities such as branching points and enforces continuity of their directional fields. The scale selection procedure estimates local ridge width and adapts the amount of smoothing to the local amount of noise. In addition, a ridgeness measure is defined, which reflects how well the local image structure agrees with a qualitative ridge model, and is used for spreading the results of shape adaptation into noisy areas. The combined approach makes it possible to resolve fine scale structures in clear areas while reducing the risk of enhancing noise in blurred or fragmented areas. The result is a reliable and adaptively detailed estimate of the ridge orientation field and ridge width, as well as a smoothed grey-level version of the input image. We propose that these general techniques should be of interest to developers of automatic fingerprint identification systems as well as in other applications of processing related types of imagery."

This representation is constructed by detecting peaks and ridges in the difference of lowpass (DOLP) transform. Descriptions of shapes which are encoded in this representation may be matched efficiently despite changes in size, orientation, or position. Motivations for a multiple resolution representation are presented first, followed by the definition of the DOLP transform. Techniques are then presented for encoding a symbolic structural description of forms from the DOLP transform. This process involves detecting local peaks and ridges in each bandpass image and in the entire three-dimensional space defined by the DOLP transform. Linking adjacent peaks in different bandpass images gives a multiple resolution tree which describes shape. Peaks which are local maxima in this tree provide landmarks for aligning, manipulating, and matching shapes. Detecting and linking the ridges in each DOLP bandpass image provides a graph which links peaks within a shape in a bandpass image and describes the positions of the boundaries of the shape at multiple resolutions. Detecting and linking the ridges in the DOLP three-space describes elongated forms and links the largest peaks in the tree. The principles for determining the correspondence between symbols in pairs of such descriptions are then described. Such correspondence matching is shown to be simplified by using the correspondence at lower resolutions to constrain the possible correspondence at higher resolutions."

Once the fitting is accomplished, the position of the corner in the image can be deduced by the knowledge of the corner position in the image.

The proposed approach does not require a separate segmentation stage and is applicable to cluttered scenes. Preliminary modeling and recognition results are presented."

A scale-invariant dissimilarity measure is proposed for comparing scale-space features at different positions and scales. Based on this measure, the likelihood of hierarchical, parameterized models can be evaluated in such a way that maximization of the measure over different models and their parameters allows for both model selection and parameter estimation. Then, within the framework of particle filtering, we consider the area of hand gesture analysis, and present a method for simultaneous tracking and recognition of hand models under variations in the position, orientation, size and posture of the hand. In this way, qualitative hand states and quantitative hand motions can be captured, and be used for controlling different types of computerised equipment."

The appropriate choice of type and level of description is of course task dependent, yet it is generally accepted that the low-level or so called early vision layers in the Human Visual System are context independent.This paper concentrates on the use of low-level approaches for solving computer vision problems and discusses three inter-related aspects of this: saliency; scale selection and content description. In contrast to many previous approaches which separate these tasks, we argue that these three aspects are intrinsically related. Based on this observation, a multiscale algorithm for the selection of salient regions of an image is introduced and its application to matching type problems such as tracking, object recognition and image retrieval is demonstrated."

                "text": "This dissertation presents a new technique for representing digital pictures. The principal benefit of this representation is that it greatly simplifies the problem of finding the correspondence between components in the description of two pictures. \nThis representation technique is based on a new class of reversible transforms (the Difference of Low Pass or DOLP transform). A DOLP transform separates a signal into a set of band-pass components. The set of band-pass filters used in a DOLP transform are defined by subtracting adjacent members of a sequence of low-pass filters. This sequence of low-pass filters is formed by scaling a low-pass filter in size by an exponential set of scale factors. The result of these subtractions is a set of band-pass filters which are all scaled copies of a smallest band-pass filter. \nSeveral techniques are presented for reducing the complexity of computing a DOLP transform. It is shown that as the each band-pass image can be resampled at a sample rate proportional to the scale of the band-pass image. This is called a Sampled DOLP transform. Resampling reduces the cost of computing a DOLP transform from O(N('2)) multiplies('1) to O(N Log N) multiplies and reduces the memory requirements from O(N Log N) storage elements to (DBLTURN) 3 N storage elements. \nA fast algorithm for computing the DOLP transform is then presented. This algorithm, called \"cascade convolution with expansion\" is based on the auto-convolution scaling property of Gaussian functions. Cascaded convolution with expansion also reduces the cost of computing a DOLP transform to O(N Log N) multiplies. When combined with resampling, this fast algorithm can compute a Sampled DOLP transform in 3 X(,(CCIRC)) N multiplies.('2) \nTechniques are then described for constructing a structural description of an image from its Sampled DOLP transform. The symbols in this description are detected by detecting local peaks and ridges in each band-pass image, and among all of the band-pass images. This description has the form of a tree of peaks, with the peaks interconnected by chains of symbols from the ridges. The tree of peaks has a structure which can be matched despite changes in size, orientation, or position of the gray scale shape that is described. \nThe tree of peaks permits the global shape of a gray-scale form^to be matched independently of the high resolution details of the^form. Thus it can be used for rapidly searching through a data base^of prototype descriptions for potential matches. This representation^is very efficient for finding the correspondence of components of^forms from two images. In such matching the peaks serves as the^tokens for which correspondence is determined. The^correspondence of peaks at each band-pass level constrain the^possible matches at the next, higher resolution image. This^representation can also be used to describe forms which are^textured or have blurry boundaries. Examples are presented in \nwhich the descriptions of images of the same object are matched despite changes in the size and image plane orientation of the^object. \n^^('1)N is the number of sample points in an image or signal.^('2)X(,(CCIRC)) is the number of coefficients in the smallest low-pass filter."

This facilitates matching between quite disparate views-wide baseline stereo. Two extensions are made to the current small baseline algorithms: first, and most importantly, a viewpoint invariant measure is developed for assessing the affinity of corner neighbourhoods over image pairs; second, algorithms are given for generating putative corner matches between image pairs using local homographies. Two novel infrastructure developments are also described: the automatic generation of local homographies, and the combination of possibly conflicting sets of matches prior to RANSAC estimation. The wide baseline matching algorithm is demonstrated on a number of image pairs with varying relative motion, and for different scene types. All processing is automatic."

In contrast in the case of widely separated views, methods have generally been restricted to two or three views.In this paper we investigate the problem of establishing relative viewpoints given a large number of images where no ordering information is provided. A typical application would be where images are obtained from different sources or at different times: both the viewpoint (position, orientation, scale) and lighting conditions may vary significantly over the data set.Such a problem is not fundamentally amenable to exhaustive pair wise and triplet wide baseline matching because this would be prohibitively expensive as the number of views increases. Instead, we investiate how a combination of image invariants, covariants, and multiple view relations can be used in concord to enable efficient multiple view matching. The result is a matching algorithm which is linear in the number of views.The methods are illustrated on several real image data sets. The output enables an image based technique for navigating in a 3D scene, moving from one image to whichever image is the next most appropriate."

The geometric information content of the gradient of binocular disparity is analyzed for the general case of a fixating system with symmetric or asymmetric vergence, and with either known or unknown viewing geometry. A computationally inexpensive technique which exploits this analysis is proposed. This technique allows a local estimate of surface orientation to be computed directly from the local statistics of the left and right image brightness gradients, without iterations or search. The viability of the approach is demonstrated with experimental results for both synthetic and natural gray-level images."

For example, we desire to obtain an understanding of natural scenes, containing roads, buildings, trees, bushes, etc., as typified by the two frames from a sequence illustrated in Figure 1. The solution to this problem that we are pursuing is to use a computer vision system based upon motion analysis of a monocular image sequence from a mobile camera. By extraction and tracking of image features, representations of the 3D analogues of these features can be constructed."

The approach is different from bottom-up segmentation methods that primarily use the continuity of grey-level, texture, and bounding contours. We show that the method leads to markedly improved segmentation results and can deal with significant variation in shape and varying backgrounds. We discuss the relative merits of class-specific and general image-based segmentation methods and suggest how they can be usefully combined."

On the other hand, image interpretation uses sophisticated object descriptions in representation frameworks such as semantic networks. We suggest an intermediate-level description between low- and high-level vision. This description is produced by grouping image features into more and more abstract structures. First, we motivate our choice with respect to what should be represented and we stress the limitations inherent with the use of sensory data. Second, we describe our current implementation and illustrate it with various examples."

The authors show how to design and steer the filters and present examples of their use in the analysis of orientation and phase, angularly adaptive filtering, edge detection, and shape from shading. One can also build a self-similar steerable pyramid representation. The same concepts can be generalized to the design of 3-D steerable filters. >"
