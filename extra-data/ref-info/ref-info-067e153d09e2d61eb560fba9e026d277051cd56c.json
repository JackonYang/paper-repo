The key ideas are twofold. One is to automatically select one axis in the RGB color space that maximizes the between-class separability by a suitably chosen threshold for segmentation of character and background or binarization. The other is affine-invariant or distortion-tolerant grayscale character recognition using global affine transformation (GAT) correlation that yields the maximum correlation value between input and template images. In experiments, we use a total of 698 test images extracted from the public ICDAR 2003 robust OCR dataset containing a variety of single-character images in natural scenes. In advance, we classify those images into seven groups according to the degree of image degradations and/or background complexity. On the other hand, we only prepare a single-font set of 62 alphanumerics for templates. Experimental results show an average recognition rate of 81.4%, ranging from 94.5% for clear images to 39.3% for seriously distorted images"

Binarization of scanned gray scale images is the first step in most document image analysis systems. Selection of an appropriate binarization method for an input image domain is a difficult problem. Typically, a human expert evaluates the binarized images according to his/her visual criteria. However, to conduct an objective evaluation, one needs to investigate how well the subsequent image analysis steps will perform on the binarized image. We call this approach goal-directed evaluation, and it can be used to evaluate other low-level image processing methods as well. Our evaluation of binarization methods is in the context of digit recognition, so we define the performance of the character recognition module as the objective measure. Eleven different locally adaptive binarization methods were evaluated, and Niblack's method gave the best performance."

Global thresholding is used in the first stage to give a preliminary result. A second stage then refines the threshold value based on local spatial characteristics of the regions formed in the first stage. It automatically customizes the thresholding of regions that have specific and consistent characteristics but are different to other regions in the image. This technique works well for both simple images, in which the background and foreground are distinct and separable and complex images containing multiple regions with different shading/textures. A typical application is postal envelope analysis. The results of evaluation show significant improvement compared to several other global and local thresholding techniques."

Digital cameras attached to cellular phones, PDAs, or as standalone still or video devices are highly mobile and easy to use; they can capture images of any kind of document including very thick books, historical pages too fragile to touch, and text in scenes; and they are much more versatile than desktop scanners. Should robust solutions to the analysis of documents captured with such devices become available, there is clearly a demand from many domains. Traditional scanner-based document analysis techniques provide us with a good reference and starting point, but they cannot be used directly on camera-captured images. Camera captured images can suffer from low resolution, blur, and perspective distortion, as well as complex layout and interaction of the content and background. In this paper we present a survey of application domains, technical challenges and solutions for recognizing documents captured by digital cameras. We begin by describing typical imaging devices and the imaging process. We discuss document analysis from a single camera-captured image as well as multiple frames and highlight some sample applications under development and feasible ideas for future development."

Chapter 3 focuses on selection of two-level factorial designs and discusses complementary design theory and related topics in the selection of designs. Chapter 4 covers the selection of three level designs followed by the general case of s-levels. Chapter 5 discusses estimation capacity, presenting the connections with complementary designs followed by the estimation capacity for two-level and s-level designs. Chapter 6 discusses and presents results for the construction of mixed-level designs. Giving many examples of the use of mixed two and four-level designs. The final unit of the book discusses designs where there are two-different groups of factors. Chapters 7 and 8 discuss factorial designs with restricted randomization. Focusing first on blocked designs for full factorials as well as blocked fractional factorial designs. Chapter 8 focuses on split-plot designs. The booked is concluded with a chapter on robust parameter designs. This book covers a broad range of topics for regular factorial designs and presents all of the material in very mathematical fashion. However, the authors do a wonderful job of keeping the statistical methodology at the forefront of the book and the mathematical detail is presented as the necessary tool to study these designs. The book will serve as a great text for an advanced graduate level course in design theory for students with the necessary mathematical background. The book will surely become an invaluable resource for researchers and graduate students doing research in the design of factorial experiments. In addition, practitioners will also find the book useful for the comprehensive collection of optimal designs presented at the end of many chapters. Overall, this is a very well written book and a necessary addition to the existing literature on the design of factorial experiments."

Despite the fact that this type of problem is well understood, there are many issues to be considered in designing an SVM learner. In particular, for large learning tasks with many training examples on the shelf optimization techniques for general quadratic programs quickly become intractable in their memory and time requirements. SVM light is an implementation of an SVM learner which addresses the problem of large tasks. This chapter presents algorithmic and computational results developed for SVM light V 2.0, which make large-scale SVM training more practical. The results give guidelines for the application of SVMs to large domains."
