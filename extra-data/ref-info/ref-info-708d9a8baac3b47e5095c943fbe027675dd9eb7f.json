Morphometric studies draw information from two sources: biological homology and geo\u00ad metric location. A biological homology is a spatial or developmental correspondence between indi\u00ad viduals, a correspondence among definable struc\u00ad tures or \"parts\"-separate bones, nerves, muscles, and the like. In the context of morpho\u00ad metries, it becomes a homology map, a correspon\u00ad dence not of parts to parts, but of points to points. For any choice of point or curve upon or inside ,my particular form, the homology map associates bio\u00ad logically acceptable counterparts, the homologues of the point or curve, on all the other geometric forms in the data set. Morphometries studies the empirical geometry of homology-variation in the relative locations of sets of homologous points over a sample of forms. The morphometric methods I recommend here . sample the homology function principally at land\u00ad marks: discrete points, reliably locatable from form to form, whose homology is assumed. The land\u00ad marks are a finite sample of the map we wish to study. The homology map relating any two forms is implicit in the two sets of landmark coordinates in\u00ad volved; it takes the form of a smooth interpolant (see Fig. 5) that need not be computed except when its picture is explicitly required. Morphometries is the close statistical study of these maps.

Perhaps one picture represents a statistical norm for an organ, the other the form observed in an individual patient; or perhaps one represents an organ prior to a treatment, the other the same after treatment or after growth. I and my colleagues have argued elsewhere (Bookstein, 1986a, 1986b; Bookstein et al., 1985) that the crux of the quantitative analysis of biological form is the, representation of its variation by means of such mappings: this is the mathematical model of shape change as deformation. The idea is not new\u2014it is most often associated with the name of the great British natural philosopher D\u2019Arcy Thompson\u2014but it is not familiar in the context of \u201cfeature extraction\u201d as currently applied in medical imaging. It is usual instead for features to pertain to images considered one at a time. In this paper I continue the elaboration of quantitative features for a pair of images viewed as corresponding biological scenes."

                "text": "Motivated by the need to locate and identify objects in three dimensional CT images, an optimal registration method for matching two and three dimensional deformed images has been developed. This method was used to find optimal mappings between CT images and an atlas image of the same anatomy. Using these mappings, object boundaries from the atlas was superimposed on the CT images. \nA cost function of the form DEFORMATION-SIMILARITY is associated with each mapping between the two images. The mapping obtained by our registration process is optimal with respect to this cost function. The registration process simulates a model in which one of the images made from an elastic material is deformed until it matches the other image. The cross correlation function which measures the similarity between the two images serves as a potential function from which the forces required to deform the image are derived. The deformation part of the cost function is measured by the strain energy of the deformed image. Therefore, the cost function of a mapping is given in this model by the total energy of the elastic image. \nThe optimal mapping is obtained by finding the equilibrium state of the elastic image, which by definition corresponds to a local minimum of the total energy. The equilibrium state is obtained by solving a set of partial differential equations taken from the linear theory of elasticity. These equations are solved iteratively using the finite differences approximation on a grid which describes the mapping. \nThe image function in a spherical region around each grid point is described by its projections on a set of orthogonal functions. The cross correlation function between the image functions in two regions is computed from these projections which, serve as the components of a feature vector associated with the grid points. In each iteration step of the process, the values of the projections are modified according to the currently approximated deformation. \nThe method was tested by registering several two and three dimensional image pairs. It can also be used to obtain the optimal mapping between two regions from a set of corresponding points (with and without error estimates) in these regions."

                "text": "Inverse problems, such as the reconstruction problems that arise in early vision, tend to be mathematically ill-posed. Through regularization, they may be reformulated as well-posed variational principles whose solutions are computable. Standard regularization theory employs quadratic stabilizing functionals that impose global smoothness constraints on possible solutions. Discontinuities present serious difficulties to standard regularization, however, since their reconstruction requires a precise spatial control over the smoothing properties of stabilizers. This paper proposes a general class of controlled-continuity stabilizers which provide the necessary control over smoothness. These nonquadratic stabilizing functionals comprise multiple generalized spline kernels combined with (noncontinuous) continuity control functions. In the context of computational vision, they may be thought of as controlled-continuity constraints. These generic constraints are applicable to visual reconstruction problems that involve both continuous regions and discontinuities, for which global smoothness constraints fail."

Input to the system consists of any digitized radiographic data. Computer assisted tomographic (CAT) scans of the head were used in this first implementation. Using these data and a predefined atlas picture representing an idealized view of the average normal image, an individualized atlas was created. From the individualized atlas, structure size, density, location displacement, and distortion may be calculated. The individualized atlas created using high resolution data, such as the CAT scan, may then be directly superimposed on pictures obtained using lower resolution modalities, such as positron emission tomographic scan images. This allows the precise location of structures poorly visualized by the secondary imaging modality. This system is capable of using either two- or three-dimensional data."

The proper abstract setting is a Hilbert function space whose reproducing kernel involves no functions more complicated than logarithms and is easily coded. Convenient representation formulas are given, as also a practical multivariate extension of the Peano kernel theorem. Owing to the numerical stability of Cholesky factorization of positive definite symmetric matrices, the whole construction process of a surface spline can be described as a recursive algorithm, the data relative to the various interpolation points being exploited in sequence.R\u00e9sum\u00e9La m\u00e9thode concr\u00e8te d'interpolation par surfaces-spline est \u00e9troitement li\u00e9e au probl\u00e8me classique de la minimisation d'une semi-norme de Soboleff sous des contraintes d'interpolation; la structure intrins\u00e8que des surfaces-spline est d\u00e8s lors celle d'une extension multivari\u00e9e des fonctions-spline naturelles.

We propose a modeling system for generic objects to recognize different objects from the same category with only one generic model. We base our design of the modeling system upon the current psychological theories of categorization and human visual perception. The representation consists of a prototype represented by parts and their configuration. Parts are modeled by superquadric volumetric primitives which can be combined via Boolean operations to form objects. Variations between objects within a category are described by changes in structure and shape deformations of prototypical parts. Recovery of deformed supequadric models from sparse 3-D points is developed and some results are shown."

                "text": "Biometric studies of the forms of organisms usually consider size and shape variations in the geometric configuration of landmarks, points that correspond biologically from form to form. The size variables may be usefully considered the linear vector space spanned by the set of all distances between pairs of landmarks. The shape of a single triangle AABC of landmarks may be reduced to a single pair of shape coordinates locating the vertex C in the coordinate system with landmark A sent to (0,O) and landmark B to (1,O). A useful space of shape variables is the span of all such shape coordinate pairs for various triples of landmarks. On a convenient null model of identical circular normal perturbations at each landmark independently, one size variable S , which may be taken as the mean square of all the interlandmark distances, has covariance zero with every shape variable. Then associations between shape and size may be tested by the F ratio for multiple regression of S on any basis for shape space. For a single triangle of landmarks, the existence of any mean difference or mean change in shape may be tested by Hotelling's T 2 applied to any pair of shape coordinates for that triangle. When such a difference is statistically significant, it may be interpreted as the ratio of a pair of size variables measured along directions a t an angle averaging 90\" in the samples of forms. One size variable will bear the greatest mean rate or ratio of change between the forms, the other the least. Analysis of configurations of more than three landmarks reduces to consideration of size variables involving at most three landmarks. These techniques are demonstrated in a study of the growth of the head in 62 normal Ann Arbor youth. Each comparison of interest is summarized in its own orthogonal coordinate system, the biorthogonal grid pair."

It starts with a definition of \"shape\" for a set of k points in m dimensions. The first task is to identify the shape spaces in which such objects naturally live, and then to examine the probability structures induced on such a shape space by corresponding structures in Rm. Against this theoretical background one formulates and solves statistical problems concerned with shape characteristics of empirical sets of points. Some applications (briefly sketched here) are to archeology, astronomy, geography and physical chemistry. We also outline more recent work on \"size-and-shape,\" on shapes of sets of points in riemannian spaces, and on shape-theoretic aspects of random Delaunay tessellations."
