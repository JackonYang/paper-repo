Other types of objects of amorphous spatial extent (e.g., trees, sky), however, are more naturally classified based on texture or color. In this paper, we seek to combine recognition of these two types of objects into a system that leverages \"context\" toward improving detection. In particular, we cluster image regions based on their ability to serve as context for the detection of objects. Rather than providing an explicit training set with region labels, our method automatically groups regions based on both their appearance and their relationships to the detections in the image. We show that our things and stuff (TAS) context model produces meaningful clusters that are readily interpretable, and helps improve our detection ability over state-of-the-art detectors. We also present a method for learning the active set of relationships for a particular dataset. We present results on object detection in images from the PASCAL VOC 2005/2006 datasets and on the task of overhead car detection in satellite images, demonstrating significant improvements over state-of-the-art detectors."

In this work we propose to incorporate semantic object context as a post-processing step into any off-the-shelf object categorization model. Using a conditional random field (CRF) framework, our approach maximizes object label agreement according to contextual relevance. We compare two sources of context: one learned from training data and another queried from Google Sets. The overall performance of the proposed framework is evaluated on the PASCAL and MSRC datasets. Our findings conclude that incorporating context into object categorization greatly improves categorization accuracy."

The model is scale and translation invariant. In the training phase, image regions that optimize an objective function are automatically located in the training images, without requiring any user annotation such as bounding boxes. The objective function measures visual similarity between training image pairs, using the spatial distribution of both appearance patches and edges. The optimization is initialized using discriminative features. The model enables the detection (localization) of multiple instances of the object class in test images, and can be used as a precursor to training other visual models that require bounding box annotation. The detection performance of the model is assessed on the PASCAL Visual Object Classes Challenge 2006 test set. For a number of object classes the performance far exceeds the current state of the art of fully supervised methods."

Whether BoF can naturally survive the challenges such as reliability and scalability of visual classification, nevertheless, remains uncertain due to various implementation choices. In this paper, we evaluate various factors which govern the performance of BoF. The factors include the choices of detector, kernel, vocabulary size and weighting scheme. We offer some practical insights in how to optimize the performance by choosing good keypoint detector and kernel. For the weighting scheme, we propose a novel soft-weighting method to assess the significance of a visual word to an image. We experimentally show that the proposed soft-weighting scheme can consistently offer better performance than other popular weighting methods. On both PASCAL-2005 and TRECVID-2006 datasets, our BoF setting generates competitive performance compared to the state-of-the-art techniques. We also show that the BoF is highly complementary to global features. By incorporating the BoF with color and texture features, an improvement of 50% is reported on TRECVID-2006 dataset."

To perform localization, one can take a sliding window approach, but this strongly increases the computational cost, because the classifier function has to be evaluated over a large set of candidate subwindows. In this paper, we propose a simple yet powerful branch-and-bound scheme that allows efficient maximization of a large class of classifier functions over all possible subimages. It converges to a globally optimal solution typically in sublinear time. We show how our method is applicable to different object detection and retrieval scenarios. The achieved speedup allows the use of classifiers for localization that formerly were considered too slow for this task, such as SVMs with a spatial pyramid kernel or nearest neighbor classifiers based on the chi2-distance. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of the resulting systems on the UIUC Cars dataset, the PASCAL VOC 2006 dataset and in the PASCAL VOC 2007 competition."

As supported by our human studies, this contextual information is necessary for accurate recognition in low resolution images. This scenario with impoverished appearance information, as opposed to using images of higher resolution, provides an appropriate venue for studying the role of context in recognition. In this paper, we explore the role of context for dense scene labeling in small images. Given a segmentation of an image, our algorithm assigns each segment to an object category based on the segmentpsilas appearance and contextual information. We explicitly model context between object categories through the use of relative location and relative scale, in addition to co-occurrence. We perform recognition tests on low and high resolution images, which vary significantly in the amount of appearance information present, using just the object appearance information, the combination of appearance and context, as well as just context without object appearance information (blind recognition). We also perform these tests in human studies and analyze our findings to reveal interesting patterns. With the use of our context model, our algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance on MSRC and Corel. datasets."

This paper presents a large-scale evaluation of an approach that represents images as distributions (signatures or histograms) of features extracted from a sparse set of keypoint locations and learns a Support Vector Machine classifier with kernels based on two effective measures for comparing distributions, the Earth Mover\u2019s Distance and the \u03c72 distance. We first evaluate the performance of our approach with different keypoint detectors and descriptors, as well as different kernels and classifiers. We then conduct a comparative evaluation with several state-of-the-art recognition methods on four texture and five object databases. On most of these databases, our implementation exceeds the best reported results and achieves comparable performance on the rest. Finally, we investigate the influence of background correlations on recognition performance via extensive tests on the PASCAL database, for which ground-truth object localization information is available. Our experiments demonstrate that image representations based on distributions of local features are surprisingly effective for classification of texture and object images under challenging real-world conditions, including significant intra-class variations and substantial background clutter."

Many different descriptors have been proposed in the literature. It is unclear which descriptors are more appropriate and how their performance depends on the interest region detector. The descriptors should be distinctive and at the same time robust to changes in viewing conditions as well as to errors of the detector. Our evaluation uses as criterion recall with respect to precision and is carried out for different image transformations. We compare shape context [Belongie, S, et al., April 2002], steerable filters [Freeman, W and Adelson, E, Setp. 1991], PCA-SIFT [Ke, Y and Sukthankar, R, 2004], differential invariants [Koenderink, J and van Doorn, A, 1987], spin images [Lazebnik, S, et al., 2003], SIFT [Lowe, D. G., 1999], complex filters [Schaffalitzky, F and Zisserman, A, 2002], moment invariants [Van Gool, L, et al., 1996], and cross-correlation for different types of interest regions. We also propose an extension of the SIFT descriptor and show that it outperforms the original method. Furthermore, we observe that the ranking of the descriptors is mostly independent of the interest region detector and that the SIFT-based descriptors perform best. Moments and steerable filters show the best performance among the low dimensional descriptors."

They evolved from texton methods in texture analysis. The basic idea is to treat images as loose collections of independent patches, sampling a representative set of patches from the image, evaluating a visual descriptor vector for each patch independently, and using the resulting distribution of samples in descriptor space as a characterization of the image. The four main implementation choices are thus how to sample patches, how to describe them, how to characterize the resulting distributions and how to classify images based on the result. We concentrate on the first issue, showing experimentally that for a representative selection of commonly used test databases and for moderate to large numbers of samples, random sampling gives equal or better classifiers than the sophisticated multiscale interest operators that are in common use. Although interest operators work well for small numbers of samples, the single most important factor governing performance is the number of patches sampled from the test image and ultimately interest operators can not provide enough patches to compete. We also study the influence of other factors including codebook size and creation method, histogram normalization method and minimum scale for feature extraction."

The resulting \"spatial pyramid\" is a simple and computationally efficient extension of an orderless bag-of-features image representation, and it shows significantly improved performance on challenging scene categorization tasks. Specifically, our proposed method exceeds the state of the art on the Caltech-101 database and achieves high accuracy on a large database of fifteen natural scene categories. The spatial pyramid framework also offers insights into the success of several recently proposed image descriptions, including Torralba\u2019s \"gist\" and Lowe\u2019s SIFT descriptors."

In this paper we examine the feasibility of a data- independent approach to construct such a visual vocabulary, where the feature space is discretized using a regular lattice. Using hashing techniques, only non-empty bins are stored, and fine-grained grids become possible in spite of the high dimensionality of typical feature spaces. Based on this representation, we can explore the structure of the feature space, and obtain state-of-the-art pixelwise classification results. In the case of image classification, we introduce a class-specific feature selection step, which takes the spatial structure of SIFT-like descriptors into account. Results are reported on the Graz02 dataset."

To increase discriminative power, color features have been proposed only recently. As many features exist, a structured overview is required of color features in the context of concept classification.\n Therefore, this paper studies 1. the invariance properties and 2. the distinctiveness of color features in a structured way. The invariance properties of color features with respect to photometric changes are summarized. The distinctiveness of color features is assessed experimentally using an image and a video benchmark: the PASCAL VOC Challenge 2007 and the Mediamill Challenge.\n Because color features cannot be studied independently from the points at which they are extracted, different point sampling strategies based on Harris-Laplace salient points, dense sampling and the spatial pyramid are also studied.\n From the experimental results, it can be derived that invariance to light intensity changes and light color changes affects concept classification. The results reveal further that the usefulness of invariance is concept-specific."

The efficiency and quality is exhibited in a live demonstration that recognizes CD-covers from a database of 40000 images of popular music CD\u2019s. The scheme builds upon popular techniques of indexing descriptors extracted from local regions, and is robust to background clutter and occlusion. The local region descriptors are hierarchically quantized in a vocabulary tree. The vocabulary tree allows a larger and more discriminatory vocabulary to be used efficiently, which we show experimentally leads to a dramatic improvement in retrieval quality. The most significant property of the scheme is that the tree directly defines the quantization. The quantization and the indexing are therefore fully integrated, essentially being one and the same. The recognition quality is evaluated through retrieval on a database with ground truth, showing the power of the vocabulary tree approach, going as high as 1 million images."

TRECVid completed its fifth annual cycle at the end of 2005 and in 2006 TRECVid will involve almost 70 research organizations, universities and other consortia. Throughout its existence, TRECVid has benchmarked both interactive and automatic/manual searching for shots from within a video corpus,automatic detection of a variety of semantic and low-level video features, shot boundary detection and the detection of story boundaries in broadcast TV news. This paper will give an introduction to information retrieval (IR) evaluation from both a user and a system perspective, high-lighting that system evaluation is by far the most prevalent type of evaluation carried out. We also include a summary of TRECVid as an example of a system evaluation bench-marking campaign and this allows us to discuss whether such campaigns are a good thing or a bad thing. There are arguments for and against these campaigns and we present some of them in the paper concluding that on balance they have had a very positive impact on research progress."

Codebooks are usually constructed by using a method such as k-means to cluster the descriptor vectors of patches sampled either densely ('textons') or sparsely ('bags of features' based on key-points or salience measures) from a set of training images. This works well for texture analysis in homogeneous images, but the images that arise in natural object recognition tasks have far less uniform statistics. We show that for dense sampling, k-means over-adapts to this, clustering centres almost exclusively around the densest few regions in descriptor space and thus failing to code other informative regions. This gives suboptimal codes that are no better than using randomly selected centres. We describe a scalable acceptance-radius based clusterer that generates better codebooks and study its performance on several image classification tasks. We also show that dense representations outperform equivalent keypoint based ones on these tasks and that SVM or mutual information based feature selection starting from a dense codebook further improves the performance."
