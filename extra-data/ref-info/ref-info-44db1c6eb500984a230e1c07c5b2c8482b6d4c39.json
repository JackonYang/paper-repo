The powerful cue of contour continuity is not exploited at all. In this paper, we provide a way of incorporating curvilinear grouping into region-based image segmentation. Soft contour information is obtained through orientation energy. Weak contrast gaps and subjective contours are completed by contour propagation. The normalized cut approach proposed by Shi and Malik is used for the segmentation. Results on a large variety of images are shown."

Rather than focusing on local features and their consistencies in the image data, our approach aims at extracting the global impression of an image. We treat image segmentation as a graph partitioning problem and propose a novel global criterion, the normalized cut, for segmenting the graph. The normalized cut criterion measures both the total dissimilarity between the different groups as well as the total similarity within the groups. We show that an efficient computational technique based on a generalized eigenvalue problem can be used to optimize this criterion. We have applied this approach to segmenting static images and found results very encouraging."

                "text": "The task of visual classification is thce recognition of an object in the image as belonging to a general class of similar objects, such as a face, a car, a dog, and the like. This is a fundamental and natural task for biological visual systems, but it has proven difficult to perform visual classification by artificial computer vision systems. The main reason for this difficulty is the variability of shape within a class: different objects vary widely in appearance, and it is difficult to capture the essential shape features that characterize the members of one category and distinguish them from another, such as dogs from cats. \n \nIn this paper we describe an approach to classification using a fragment-based representation. In this approach, objects within a class are represented in terms of common image fragments that are used as building blocks for representing a large variety of different objects that belong to a common class. The fragments are selected from a training set of images based on a criterion of maximizing the mutual information of the fragments and the class they represent. For the purpose of classification the fragments are also organized into types, where each type is a collection of alternative fragments, such as different hairline or eye regions for face classification. During classification, the algorithm detects fragments of the different types, and then combines the evidence for the detected fragments to reach a final decision. Experiments indicate that it is possible to trade off the complexity of fragments with the complexity of the combination and decision stage, and this tradeoff is discussed. \n \nThe method is different from previous part-based methods in using class-specific object fragments of varying complexity, the method of selecting fragments, and the organization into fragment types. Experimental results of detecting face and car views show that the fragment-based approach can generalize well to a variety of novel image views within a class while maintaining low mis-classification error rates. We briefly discuss relationships between the proposed method and properties of parts of the primate visual system involved in object perception"

                "text": "We describe an approach to object classification based on the conjunction of multiple classspecific object fragments detected in the image. The method represents members of a given class (such as a face, or a car) using combinations of common sub-structures, termed fragments. These fragments are partial 2-D patterns extracted from examples views of objects belonging to the class in question. An object view is covered by multiple, overlapping fragments of several types, and at multiple levels of complexity. We describe the detection of the individual fragments, and the combination of the fragments to detect complete objects. The combination of fragments to form a consistent overall arrangement is based in this scheme on a number of simple mechanisms: the use of overlapping fragments, a spatial `voting' scheme, and by imposing some constraints on the tolerated location of the fragments within the overall object view. We present experimental results of the application of the method to the detection of face and car views in cluttered scenes and to partially occluded objects. We present evidence that by combining fragments from different objects the method can deal successfully with intra-object variability within a class. The method is more economical and more resistant to occlusion and deformations than methods relying on global object views. Introduction In this paper we study the challenging task of detecting different objects from a given class (such as a face or a car) in an image. In addition to the unknown location and illumination of the object, the method must deal with intra-class variability between objects from the same class. The detection process must therefore cover a range of possible shapes, missing parts and additional clutter. To deal with the problem of shape variability and detect novel shapes of a given class, Turk & Pentland (1991) used the principal components of registered face views. Views of novel objects can be approximated by the superposition of several basis functions, or 'eigenfaces'. Poggio & Sung (1994) used a distribution-based modeling scheme for detecting faces in cluttered scenes. They represented a face view as a gray level vector with 283 components, and trained a multi-layered preceptron network to classify such data as face/non-face vectors. The generalization to novel shapes within the class is obtained in these schemes by the inherent generalization capacity of the neural network mechanism.

The channels are characterized by a bank of Gabor filters that nearly uniformly covers the spatial-frequency domain. A systematic filter selection scheme based on reconstruction of the input image from the filtered images is proposed. Texture features are obtained by subjecting each (selected) filtered image to a nonlinear transformation and computing a measure of energy in a window around each pixel. An unsupervised square-error clustering algorithm is then used to integrate the feature images and produce a segmentation. A simple procedure to incorporate spatial adjacency information in the clustering process is proposed. Experiments on images with natural textures as well as artificial textures with identical second and third-order statistics are reported. The algorithm appears to perform as predicted by preattentive texture discrimination by a human.<<ETX>>"

Our algorithm uses modern numeric techniques to find an approximate solution to normalized cut measures in time that is linear in the size of the image with only a few dozen operations per pixel. In just one pass the algorithm provides a complete hierarchical decomposition of the image into segments. The algorithm detects the segments by applying a process of recursive coarsening in which the same minimization problem is represented with fewer and fewer variables producing an irregular pyramid. During this coarsening process we may compute additional internal statistics of the emerging segments and use these statistics to facilitate the segmentation process. Once the pyramid is completed it is scanned from the top down to associate pixels close to the boundaries of segments with the appropriate segment. The algorithm is inspired by algebraic multigrid (AMG) solvers of minimization problems of heat or electric networks. We demonstrate the algorithm by applying it to real images."

We have proposed that some shape recognition processes can operate in parallel with processes assessing other variables relevant to figure-ground organization. The influence of these shape recognition processes should be observed only when shape edges can be detected early enough in visual processing so that the critical shape recognition operations can be finished before figure-ground computations are completed. In three experiments, we tested this prediction using stereograms portraying two regions equal in area, but unequal in denotivity (roughly, meaningfulness): One region was high in denotivity, the other region was low in denotivity. Binocular disparity specified that either the high denotative region or the low denotative region was in front (i.e., was figure). For some stereograms (random dot stereograms), no edge was visible between the two regions until after stereo fusion; for other stereograms (black-and-white stereograms), a luminance edge was visible before fusion. In black-and-white stereograms, but not in random-dot stereograms, high denotative regions could appear to be in front (i.e., to be figure) and the shapes they depicted could be recognized, even when this organization was inconsistent with the disparity. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that shape recognition processes can contribute to figure-ground computations, at least when the figure-ground border is a luminance contrast edge. Implications for shape recognition and perceptual organization are discussed."

Prior research (A. Needham & R. Baillargeon, 1998) showed that when infants see an object alone and then see it next to a novel object, this prior experience allows them to determine the location of a boundary between the two objects. The present experiments investigated whether infants would also use an object similar, but not identical, to a test object in the same kind of task. The results indicate that infants' use of a prior experience is disrupted by changes in the features of the object, but not by a change in its spatial orientation. These findings suggest that, like adults, infants may expect that changes in the features of an object are associated with a change in the identity of the object, but do not have the same expectation for changes in spatial orientation."
