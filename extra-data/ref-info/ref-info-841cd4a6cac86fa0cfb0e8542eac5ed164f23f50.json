                "text": "Interneurons exhibiting centre-surround antagonism within their receptive fields are commonly found in peripheral visual pathways. We propose that this organization enables the visual system to encode spatial detail in a manner that minimizes the deleterious effects of intrinsic noise, by exploiting the spatial correlation that exists within natural scenes. The antagonistic surround takes a weighted mean of the signals in neighbouring receptors to generate a statistical prediction of the signal at the centre. The predicted value is subtracted from the actual centre signal, thus minimizing the range of outputs transmitted by the centre. In this way the entire dynamic range of the interneuron can be devoted to encoding a small range of intensities, thus rendering fine detail detectable against intrinsic noise injected at later stages in processing. This predictive encoding scheme also reduces spatial redundancy, thereby enabling the array of interneurons to transmit a larger number of distinguishable images, taking into account the expected structure of the visual world. The profile of the required inhibitory field is derived from statistical estimation theory. This profile depends strongly upon the signal: noise ratio and weakly upon the extent of lateral spatial correlation. The receptive fields that are quantitatively predicted by the theory resemble those of X-type retinal ganglion cells and show that the inhibitory surround should become weaker and more diffuse at low intensities. The latter property is unequivocally demonstrated in the first-order interneurons of the fly\u2019s compound eye. The theory is extended to the time domain to account for the phasic responses of fly interneurons. These comparisons suggest that, in the early stages of processing, the visual system is concerned primarily with coding the visual image to protect against subsequent intrinsic noise, rather than with reconstructing the scene or extracting specific features from it. The treatment emphasizes that a neuron\u2019s dynamic range should be matched to both its receptive field and the statistical properties of the visual pattern expected within this field. Finally, the analysis is synthetic because it is an extension of the background suppression hypothesis (Barlow & Levick 1976), satisfies the redundancy reduction hypothesis (Barlow 1961 a, b) and is equivalent to deblurring under certain conditions (Ratliff 1965)."

The theory is formulated in the language of information theory and hypothesizes that the goal of this processing is to recode in order to reduce a generalized redundancy subject to a constraint that specifies the amount of average information preserved. In the limit of no noise, this theory becomes equivalent to Barlow's redundancy reduction hypothesis, but it leads to very different computational strategies when noise is present. A tractable approach for finding the optimal encoding is to solve the problem in successive stages where at each stage the optimization is performed within a restricted class of transfer functions. We explicitly find the solution for the class of encodings to which the parvocellular retinal processing belongs, namely linear and nondivergent transformations. The solution shows agreement with the experimentally observed transfer functions at all levels of signal to noise."

To understand the representation of images by the mammalian visual system, it might therefore be useful to consider the statistics of images from the natural environment (i.e., images with trees, rocks, bushes, etc). In this study, various coding schemes are compared in relation to how they represent the information in such natural images. The coefficients of such codes are represented by arrays of mechanisms that respond to local regions of space, spatial frequency, and orientation (Gabor-like transforms). For many classes of image, such codes will not be an efficient means of representing information. However, the results obtained with six natural images suggest that the orientation and the spatial-frequency tuning of mammalian simple cells are well suited for coding the information in such images if the goal of the code is to convert higher-order redundancy (e.g., correlation between the intensities of neighboring pixels) into first-order redundancy (i.e., the response distribution of the coefficients). Such coding produces a relatively high signal-to-noise ratio and permits information to be transmitted with only a subset of the total number of cells. These results support Barlow's theory that the goal of natural vision is to represent the information in the natural environment with minimal redundancy."

At each wavelength, data were obtained for a number of illuminance levels. All observations were taken at equal accommodation, and corrected for chromatic aberration. If the wavelength-dependent effects of diffraction on the modulation transfer are taken into account, no difference is found between the photopic contrast-sensitivity functions for red, green, or blue. For mean retinal illuminances B0 smaller than 300 td, threshold modulation M at a given frequency is found to increase in proportion to B0-12 (de Vries\u2013Rose law). For B0 greater than 300 td M remains a constant fraction of it (Weber\u2013Fechner law). After separation of the optical modulation transfer of the eye media from the measured psychophysical data, the remaining function can be considered as composed of a neural and a light-diffusion transfer function. The latter can be compared with the analytic transfer function of photographic film."

Since the measure of pixel-entropy has only a global minimum the algorithm is guaranteed to converge to the minimum entropy map. Such optimal maps have recently been shown to possess cognitively desirable properties and are likely to be used by the nervous system to organize sensory information. The algorithm derived here turns out to be one proposed by Goodall for pairwise decorrelation. It is biologically plausible since in a neural network implementation it requires only data available locally to a neuron. In training over ensembles of two-dimensional input signals with the same spatial power spectrum as natural scenes, networks develop output neurons with center-surround receptive fields similar to those of ganglion cells in the retina. Some technical issues pertinent to developmental algorithms of this sort, such as symmetry fixing, are also discussed."

The arrangement of the columns is highly ordered; in the great majority of oblique or tangential microelectrode penetrations the preferred orientations of cells changed systematically with electrode position, in a clockwise or counterclockwise direction. Graphs of orientation vs. electrode track distance were virtually straight lines over distances of up to several millimeters; such orderly sequences were often terminated by sudden changes in the direction of orientation shifts, from clockwise to counterclockwise or back. The orientations at which these reversals occurred were quite unpredictable. Total rotations of 180\u2013360\u00b0 were frequently seen between reversals. In tangential or almost tangential penetrations orientation shifts occurred almost every time the electrode was moved forward, indicating that the columns were either not discrete or had a thickness of less than 25\u201350 \u03bc, the smallest order of distance that our methods could resolve. In penetrations that were almost perpendicular to the surface, the graphs of orientation vs. track distance were relatively flatter, as expected if the surfaces of constant orientation are perpendicular to the cortical surface. Stepwise changes in orientation of about 10\u00b0 could sometimes be seen in perpendicular penetrations, each orientation persisting through several clear advances of the electrode, suggesting a set of discrete columnar subdivisions. The possibility of some kind of continuous variation in orientation with horizontal distance along the cortex was not, however, completely ruled out. Occasionally a highly ordered sequence was broken by an abrupt large shift in orientation of up to 90\u00b0. Shifts in ocular dominance occurred roughly every 0.25\u20130.5 mm and were independent of orientation shifts. In multiple parallel penetrations spaced closer than about 250 \u03bc the slopes of the orientation vs. track distance curves were almost the same; reconstruction of these penetrations indicated that the regions of constant orientation are parallel sheets. On crossing perpendicular to these sheets, a total orientation shift of 180\u00b0 took place over a distance of 0.5\u20131.0 mm. Column thickness, size of shifts in orientation, and the rate of change of orientation with distance along the cortex seemed to be independent of eccentricity, at least between 2\u00b0 and 15\u00b0 from the fovea. A few penetrations made in area 17 of the cat and in area 18 of the monkey showed similar orderly sequences of receptive\u2010field orientation shifts."

The method works best for inputs consisting of strongly correlated groups, that is features, with weaker statistical dependence between different features. This is the case for localized objects in an image or for words in a text. A local feature measure determining how much a single feature reduces the total redundancy is derived which turns out to depend only on the probability of the feature and of its components, but not on the statistical properties of any other features. The locality of this measure makes it ideal as the basis for a \"neural\" implementation of redundancy reduction, and an example of a very simple non-Hebbian algorithm is given.

Several models for the role of processing noise are analyzed, and the biological motivation for considering them is described.

This lends support to Barlow's argument for factorial sensory processing, by demonstrating how it can solve actual pattern recognition problems. Two techniques for supervised factorial learning are explored, one of which gives a novel distributed solution requiring only positive examples. Also, a new nonlinear technique for factorial learning is introduced that uses neural networks based on almost reversible cellular automata. Due to the special functional connectivity of these networkswhich resemble some biological microcircuitslearning requires only simple local algorithms. Also, supervised factorial learning is shown to be a viable alternative to backpropagation.
