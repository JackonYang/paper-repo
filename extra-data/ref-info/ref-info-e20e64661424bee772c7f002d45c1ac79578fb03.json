Examples include the early Presidential papers at the Library of Congress and the collected works of W. B. DuBois at the library of the University of Massachusetts. The standard technique for indexing documents is to scan them in, convert them to machine readable form (ASCII) using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and then index them using a text retrieval engine. However, OCR does not work well on handwriting. Here, an alternative scheme is proposed for indexing such texts. Each page of the document is segmented into words. The images of the words are then matched against each other to create equivalence classes (each equivalence classes contains multiple instances of the same word). The user then provides ASCII equivalents for say the top 2000 equivalence classes. The current paper deals with the matching aspects of this process. Due to variations in even a single person\u2019s handwriting, it is expected that the matching will be the most diff icult step in the whole process. Two different techniques for matching words are discussed. The first method, based on Euclidean distance mapping, matches words assuming that the transformation between the words may be modelled by a translation (shift). The second method, based on an algorithm developed by Scott and Longuet-Higgins, matches words assuming that the transformation between the words may be modelled by an affine transform. Experiments are shown demonstrating the feasibility of the approach for indexing handwriting."

A set of visual templates is used to define the keyword class of interest, and initiate a search for words exhibiting high shape similarity to the model set. Major problems of segmenting cursive script into individual words are avoided by applying line-oriented processing to the document pages. The use of profile-oriented features facilitates the application of dynamic programming techniques to pattern matching, and allows us to achieve high levels of recognition performance. Results of experiments with old Spanish manuscripts show a high recognition rate of the proposed approach."

The authors present a new approach to word recognition that uses a lexicon to \"drive\" the recognition process. Lexicon words are encoded in trie data structures, and recognition of a word image is done by searching a lexicon trie for a path whose node characters yield the best match to the word image. This approach has two important advantages. First, it is segmentation-free; there is no need to presegment the text image into isolated characters. Second, it performs recognition by verifying character hypotheses, as opposed to the classification method used in most conventional optical character recognition (OCR) systems. Hence, the recognition process is more efficient and the results are more accurate. They demonstrated the feasibility and the advantage of this approach with a lexicon size of more than 50000 words, on severely degraded images."

First, a general principle of time-normalization is given using time-warping function. Then, two time-normalized distance definitions, called symmetric and asymmetric forms, are derived from the principle. These two forms are compared with each other through theoretical discussions and experimental studies. The symmetric form algorithm superiority is established. A new technique, called slope constraint, is successfully introduced, in which the warping function slope is restricted so as to improve discrimination between words in different categories. The effective slope constraint characteristic is qualitatively analyzed, and the optimum slope constraint condition is determined through experiments. The optimized algorithm is then extensively subjected to experimental comparison with various DP-algorithms, previously applied to spoken word recognition by different research groups. The experiment shows that the present algorithm gives no more than about two-thirds errors, even compared to the best conventional algorithm."
