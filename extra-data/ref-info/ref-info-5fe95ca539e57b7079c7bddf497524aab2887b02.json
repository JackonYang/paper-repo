We propose a flexible probabilistic model for character recognition that integrates local language properties, such as bigrams, with lexical decision, having open and closed vocabulary modes that operate simultaneously. Lexical processing is accelerated by performing inference with sparse belief propagation, a bottom-up method for hypothesis pruning. We give experimental results on recognizing text from images of signs in outdoor scenes. Incorporating the lexicon reduces word recognition error by 42% and sparse belief propagation reduces the number of lexicon words considered by 97%."

Past methods enhanced recognition by using multiple frame averaging, image interpolation and lexicon correction, but recognition using multi-modality language models has not been explored. In this paper, we present a formal Bayesian framework for videotext recognition by combining multiple knowledge using mixture models, and describe a learning approach based on Expectation-Maximization (EM). In order to handle unseen words, a back-off smoothing approach derived from the Bayesian model is also presented. We exploited a prototype that fuses the model from closed caption and that from the British National Corpus. The model from closed caption is based on a unique time distance distribution model of videotext words and closed caption words. Our method achieves a significant performance gain, with word recognition rate of 76.8% and character recognition rate of 86.7%. The proposed methods also reduce false videotext detection significantly, with a false alarm rate of 8.2% without substantial loss of recall."

The algorithm is intended for use by blind and visually impaired subjects walking through city scenes. We first obtain a dataset of city images taken by blind and normally sighted subjects. From this dataset, we manually label and extract the text regions. Next we perform statistical analysis of the text regions to determine which image features are reliable indicators of text and have low entropy (i.e. feature response is similar for all text images). We obtain weak classifiers by using joint probabilities for feature responses on and off text. These weak classifiers are used as input to an AdaBoost machine learning algorithm to train a strong classifier. In practice, we trained a cascade with 4 strong classifiers containing 79 features. An adaptive binarization and extension algorithm is applied to those regions selected by the cascade classifier. Commercial OCR software is used to read the text or reject it as a non-text region. The overall algorithm has a success rate of over 90% (evaluated by complete detection and reading of the text) on the test set and the unread text is typically small and distant from the viewer."

To achieve maximum robustness, we use a machine learning approach based on a convolutional neural network.

Some works deal with text detection in the image while more recent ones point out the challenge of text extraction and recognition. We propose here an OCR correction system to handle traditional issues of recognizer errors but also the ones due to natural scene images, i.e. cut characters, artistic display, incomplete sentences (present in advertisements) and out- of-vocabulary (OOV) words such as acronyms and so on. The main algorithm bases on finite-state machines (FSMs) to deal with learned OCR confusions, capital/accented letters and lexicon look-up. Moreover, as OCR is not considered as a black box, several outputs are taken into account to intermingle recognition and correction steps. Based on a public database of natural scene words, detailed results are also presented along with future works."

When the writing style is unconstrained (written in a natural manner), recognition of individual components may be unreliable, so they must be grouped together into word hypotheses before recognition algorithms can be used. This paper describes a gap metrics based machine learning approach to separate a line of unconstrained handwritten text into words. Our approach uses a set of both local and global features, which is motivated by the ways in which human beings perform this kind of task. In addition, in order to overcome the disadvantage of different distance computation methods, we propose a combined distance measure computed using three different methods. The classification is done by using a three-layer neural network. The algorithm is evaluated using an unconstrained handwriting database that contains 50 pages (1026 line, 7562 words images) handwritten documents. The overall accuracy is 90.8%, which shows a better performance than a previous method."

                "text": "Many libraries, museums, and other organizations contain large collections of handwritten historical documents, for example, the papers of early presidents like George Washington at the Library of Congress. The first step in providing recognition/retrieval tools is to automatically segment handwritten pages into words. State of the art segmentation techniques like the gap metrics algorithm have been mostly developed and tested on highly constrained documents like bank checks and postal addresses. There has been little work on full handwritten pages and this work has usually involved testing on clean artificial documents created for the purpose of research. Historical manuscript images, on the other hand, contain a great deal of noise and are much more challenging. Here, a novel scale space algorithm for automatically segmenting handwritten (historical) documents into words is described. First, the page is cleaned to remove margins. This is followed by a gray-level projection profile algorithm for finding lines in images. Each line image is then filtered with an anisotropic Laplacian at several scales. This procedure produces blobs which correspond to portions of characters at small scales and to words at larger scales. Crucial to the algorithm is scale selection that is, finding the optimum scale at which blobs correspond to words. This is done by finding the maximum over scale of the extent or area of the blobs. This scale maximum is estimated using three different approaches. The blobs recovered at the optimum scale are then bounded with a rectangular box to recover the words. A post processing filtering step is performed to eliminate boxes of unusual size which are unlikely to correspond to words. The approach is tested on a number of different data sets and it is shown that, on 100 sampled documents from the George Washington corpus of handwritten document images, a total error rate of 17 percent is observed. The technique outperforms a state-of-the-art gap metrics word-segmentation algorithm on this collection."

Selecting a small number of features for these tasks is important to prevent over-fitting and reduce computation. However, when a system has such related or sequential tasks, selecting features for these tasks independently may not be optimal. We propose a framework for choosing features to be shared between object detection and recognition tasks. The result is a system that achieves better performance by joint training and is faster because some features for identification have already been computed for detection. We demonstrate with experiments in text detection and character recognition for images of scenes."

The output layer of the network is coupled to a Viterbi alignment module that chooses the best interpretation of the input. Training errors are propagated through the Viterbi module. The novelty in this procedure is that segmentation is done on the feature maps developed in the Space Displacement Neural Network (SDNN) rather than the input (pixel) space."

After discussing briefly the character recognition abilities of humans and computers, we present illustrated examples of recognition errors. The top level of our taxonomy of the causes of errors consists of Imaging Defects, Similar Symbols, Punctuation, and Typography. The analysis of a series of 'snippets' from this perspective provides insight into the strengths and weaknesses of current systems, and perhaps a road map to future progress. The examples were drawn from the large-scale tests conducted by the authors at the Information Science Research Institute of the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. By way of conclusion, we point to possible approaches for improving the accuracy of today's systems. The talk is based on our eponymous monograph, recently published in The Kluwer International Series in Engineering and Computer Science, Kluwer Academic Publishers, 1999."

Conditional training is even more difficult, because the partition function depends not only on the parameters, but also on the observed input, requiring repeated inference over each training example. An appealing idea for such models is to independently train a local undirected classifier over each clique, afterwards combining the learned weights into a single global model. In this paper, we show that this piecewise method can be justified as minimizing a new family of upper bounds on the log partition function. On three natural-language data sets, piecewise training is more accurate than pseudolikelihood, and often performs comparably to global training using belief propagation."

In large state spaces, however, training can be expensive, because it often requires many iterations of forward-backward. Beam search is a standard heuristic for controlling complexity during Viterbi decoding, but during forward-backward, standard beam heuristics can be dangerous, as they can make training unstable. We introduce sparse forward-backward, a variational perspective on beam methods that uses an approximating mixture of Kronecker delta functions. This motivates a novel minimum-divergence beam criterion based on minimizing KL divergence between the respective marginal distributions. Our beam selection approach is not only more efficient for Viterbi decoding, but also more stable within sparse forward-backward training. For a standard text-to-speech problem, we reduce CRF training time fourfold - from over a day to six hours - with no loss in accuracy"

Such a factorization can be visualized with a bipartite graph that we call a factor graph, In this tutorial paper, we present a generic message-passing algorithm, the sum-product algorithm, that operates in a factor graph. Following a single, simple computational rule, the sum-product algorithm computes-either exactly or approximately-various marginal functions derived from the global function. A wide variety of algorithms developed in artificial intelligence, signal processing, and digital communications can be derived as specific instances of the sum-product algorithm, including the forward/backward algorithm, the Viterbi algorithm, the iterative \"turbo\" decoding algorithm, Pearl's (1988) belief propagation algorithm for Bayesian networks, the Kalman filter, and certain fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithms."
