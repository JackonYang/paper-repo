Existing methods cannot handle well those texts with different contrast or embedded in a complex background. To handle these difficulties, this paper proposes an efficient text detection approach, which is based on invariant features, such as edge strength, edge density, and horizontal distribution. First, it applies edge detection and uses a low threshold to filter out definitely non-text edges. Then, a local threshold is selected to both keep low-contrast text and simplify complex background of high-contrast text. Next, two text-area enhancement operators are proposed to highlight those areas with either high edge strength or high edge density. Finally, coarse-to-fine detection locates text regions efficiently. Experimental results show that this approach is robust for contrast, font-size, font-color, language, and background complexity."

Most existing text extraction methods assume that the text color is always light (or dark). Obviously, this assumption restricts the application of these methods to some specific domains. Only a few methods can detect the color polarity on condition that the background is clear. However, many real video texts have various appearances and complex backgrounds that existing methods cannot handle. This paper proposes a statistic color polarity classification method that is robust to various background complexities, font styles, stroke widths, and languages. We discover the intrinsic relationships between text edges and background edges, and then develop an efficient measurement to detect the color polarity. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieves a much higher accuracy, 98.5%, than existing methods."

Video indexing by shot segmentation has been a proposed solution and several research efforts are seen in the literature. Shot segmentation alone cannot solve the problem of content based access to video. Recognition of text in video has been proposed as an additional feature. Several research efforts are found in the literature for text extraction from complex images and video with applications for video indexing. We present an update of our system for detection and extraction of an unconstrained variety of text from general purpose video. The text detection results from a variety of methods are fused and each single text instance is segmented to enable it for OCR. Problems in segmenting text from video are similar to those faced in detection and localization phases. Video has low resolution and the text often has poor contrast with a changing background. The proposed system applies a variety of methods and takes advantage of the temporal redundancy in video resulting in good text segmentation."

If these text occurrences could be detected, segmented, and recognized automatically, they would be a valuable source of high-level semantics for indexing and retrieval. We propose a novel method for localizing and segmenting text in complex images and videos. Text lines are identified by using a complex-valued multilayer feed-forward network trained to detect text at a fixed scale and position. The network's output at all scales and positions is integrated into a single text-saliency map, serving as a starting point for candidate text lines. In the case of video, these candidate text lines are refined by exploiting the temporal redundancy of text in video. Localized text lines are then scaled to a fixed height of 100 pixels and segmented into a binary image with black characters on white background. For videos, temporal redundancy is exploited to improve segmentation performance. Input images and videos can be of any size due to a true multiresolution approach. Moreover, the system is not only able to locate and segment text occurrences into large binary images, but is also able to track each text line with sub-pixel accuracy over the entire occurrence in a video, so that one text bitmap is created for all instances of that text line. Therefore, our text segmentation results can also be used for object-based video encoding such as that enabled by MPEG-4."

News captions generally provide vital search information about the video being presented, the names of people and places or descriptions of objects. In this paper, two difficult problems of character recognition for videos are addressed: low resolution characters and extremely complex backgrounds. We apply an interpolation filter, multi-frame integration and a combination of four filters to solve these problems. Segmenting characters is done by a recognition-based segmentation method and intermediate character recognition results are used to improve the segmentation. The overall recognition results are good enough for use in news indexing. Performing video OCR on news video and combining its results with other video understanding techniques will improve the overall understanding of the news video content."

It enables content- based browsing. We present our methods for automatic segmentation and recognition of text in digital videos. The algorithms we propose make use of typical characteristics of text in videos in order to enable and enhance segmentation and recognition performance. Especially the inter-frame dependencies of the characters provide new possibilities for their refinement. Then, a straightforward indexing and retrieval scheme is introduced. It is used in the experiments to demonstrate that the proposed text segmentation and text recognition algorithms are suitable for indexing and retrieval of relevant video scenes in and from a video data base. Our experimental results are very encouraging and suggest that these algorithms can be used in video retrieval applications as well as to recognize higher semantics in video."

It was observed that when a row of pixels across such a text region is clustered in perceptually uniform L*a*b* color space, the pixels of one of these clusters would belong to the text strokes. These pixels would appeal as a line of short streaks on the row since a typical text region has many vertical and diagonal strokes. The proposed method examines every third row of the the image and checks whether this row passes through a horizontal text region. For a given row R, the pixels of R are hierarchically clustered in L*a*b* space and each cluster is tested whether similar-colored pixels in R's vicinity are possibly part of a text region. Candidate text blocks are marked by heuristics using information about the cluster's line of shell streaks. The detected text blocks are fused with the text regions. The method was tested on key frames of several video sequences and was able to locate a wide variety of text."

Most documents contain graphics and images in addition to text. Thus, the document image has to be segmented to identify the text regions, so that OCR techniques may be applied only to those regions. In this paper, we present a simple method for document image segmentation in which text regions in a given document image are automatically identified. The proposed segmentation method for document images is based on a multichannel filtering approach to texture segmentation. The text in the document is considered as a textured region. Nontext contents in the document, such as blank spaces, graphics, and pictures, are considered as regions with different textures. Thus, the problem of segmenting document images into text and nontext regions can be posed as a texture segmentation problem. Two-dimensional Gabor filters are used to extract texture features for each of these regions. These filters have been extensively used earlier for a variety of texture segmentation tasks. Here we apply the same filters to the document image segmentation problem. Our segmentation method does not assume any a priori knowledge about the content or font styles of the document, and is shown to work even for skewed images and handwritten text. Results of the proposed segmentation method are presented for several test images which demonstrate the robustness of this technique."

In this work, we present algorithms for detecting and tracking text in digital video. Our system implements a scale-space feature extractor that feeds an artificial neural processor to detect text blocks. Our text tracking scheme consists of two modules: a sum of squared difference (SSD)-based module to find the initial position and a contour-based module to refine the position. Experiments conducted with a variety of video sources show that our scheme can detect and track text robustly."

These methods do not reflect characteristics of characters such that character regions can be extracted incorrectly. In this paper, we use topographical features of characters to extract the character points and use the density of those points to extract the candidate regions for captions. Character regions are determined by testing several conditions and verifying those candidate regions. Experimental results show that the candidate region extraction rate is 100%, and the character region extraction rate is 99%. Non-character regions can exist within the extracted character regions which are removed using the Isodata color clustering method."

First, we have integrated the image and audio analysis results in identifying news segments. Second, we use the video OCR technology to detect text from frames, which provides a good source of textual information for story classification when transcripts and close captions are not available. Finally, natural language processing (NLP) technologies are used to perform automated categorization of news stories based on the texts obtained from close caption or video OCR process. Based on these video structure and content analysis technologies, we have developed two advanced video browsers for home users: intelligent highlight player and HTML-based video browser."

This scale consistency thus provides us with a useful feature for text detection and segmentation. A new form of filter is derived from the Gabor filter, and it is shown that this filter can efficiently estimate the scales of these stripes. The contrast of text in video can then be increased by enhancing the edges of only those stripes found to correspond to a suitable scale. More specifically the algorithm presented here enhances the stripes in three pre-selected scale ranges. The resulting enhancement yields much better performance from the binarization process, which is the step required before character recognition."

As an actual example, we developed a system that associates faces and names in videos, called Name-It, which is given news videos as a knowledge source, then automatically extracts face and name association as content information. The system can infer the name of a given unknown face image, or guess faces which are likely to have the name given to the system. This paper explains the method with several successful matching results which reveal effectiveness in integrating heterogeneous techniques as well as the importance of real content information extraction from video, especially face-name association."

An optimal threshold is selected by the discriminant criterion, namely, so as to maximize the separability of the resultant classes in gray levels. The procedure is very simple, utilizing only the zerothand the first-order cumulative moments of the gray-level histogram. It is straightforward to extend the method to multithreshold problems. Several experimental results are also presented to support the validity of the method."
