Focussing on the extraction and the meticulous exploitation of the semantic structure of documents, we obtain a meaningful contextual tagging corresponding to different unit types (title, chapter, section, enumeration, etc.). Keywords \u2014 Information retrieval, document structures, symbolic grammars. I. I NTRODUCTION OCUMENT management (classification, indexation, storage) is practised for a long time, in particular in libraries. In recent years, due to technological progress and the transition from paper to numerical form, the amount of the textual resources has become gigantic [1], making it difficult to exploit manually. In order to make a better use of this large resource, information retrieval (henceforth IR) systems were created, aiming at improving the quality and efficiency of knowledge extraction. Our project objective is to produce the prototype of a system that would extract business rules from corporate texts and translate them into a visual software engineering model. Within this perspective, it is not only a question of extracting knowledge, but also to be able to visualize correctly extracted relevant information. The upstream of this project, object of this paper, is to extract knowledge characterized by document structure and contents. We will focus here on the extraction and exploitation of the semantic structure of documents in order to obtain a meaningful contextual tagging corresponding to different unit types (title, chapter, section, enumeration, etc.). This paper is organized as follow. First, we will underline previous researches in information retrieval that have taken into account document structure to improve results. Then, we will describe the models we propose for the detection of some"

We could also assign functional or logical labels such as sentences, titles, captions, author names, and addresses to some of these regions. The process of document structure and layout analysis tries to decompose a given document image into its component regions and understand their functional roles and relationships. The processing is carried out in multiple steps, such as preprocessing, page decomposition, structure understanding, etc. We will look into each of these steps in detail in the following sections. Document images are often generated from physical documents by digitization using scanners or digital cameras. Many documents, such as newspapers, magazines and brochures, contain very complex layout due to the placement of figures, titles, and captions, complex backgrounds, artistic text formatting, etc. (see Figure 1). A human reader uses a variety of additional cues such as context, conventions and information about language/script, along with a complex reasoning process to decipher the contents of a document. Automatic analysis of an arbitrary document with complex layout is an extremely difficult task and is beyond the capabilities of the state-of-the-art document structure and layout analysis systems. This is interesting since documents are designed to be effective and clear to human interpretation unlike natural images."

A large amount of research has focused on the problem of generating wrappers, i.e., software tools that allow easy and robust extraction of structured data from text and HTML sources. In many applications, such as comparison shopping, data has to be extracted from many different sources, making manual coding of a wrapper for each source impractical. On the other hand, fully automatic approaches are often not reliable enough, resulting in low quality of the extracted data.We describe a complete system for semi-automatic wrapper generation that can be trained on different data sources in a simple interactive manner. Our goal is to minimize the amount of user effort for training reliable wrappers through design of a suitable training interface that is implemented based on a powerful underlying extraction language and a set of training and ranking algorithms. Our experiments show that our system achieves reliable extraction with a very small amount of user effort."

This paper describes a key module in MARS called the Automated Labeling (AL) module, which labels all zones of interest (title, author, affiliation, and abstract) automatically. The AL algorithm is based on 120 rules that are derived from an analysis of journal page layouts and features extracted from OCR output. Experiments carried out on more than 11,000 articles in over 1,000 biomedical journals show the accuracy of this rule-based algorithm to exceed 96%."

A grammar corresponds to a document genre; our system may be adapted to a new genre simply by replacing the input grammar. The system incorporates an optical character recognition system that outputs characters, their positions and font sizes. These features are combined to form a document representation of lines of text and separators. Lines of text are labeled as tokens using regular expression matching. The maximum likelihood parse of this stream of tokens and separators yields a functional labeling of the document lines. We describe business card and business letter applications."
