Previous experiments with context have mostly been done on home-grown datasets, often with non-standard baselines, making it difficult to isolate the contribution of contextual information. In this work, we present our analysis on a standard dataset, using top-performing local appearance detectors as baseline. We evaluate several different sources of context and ways to utilize it. While we employ many contextual cues that have been used before, we also propose a few novel ones including the use of geographic context and a new approach for using object spatial support."

However, the cues available for recognizing a 300 pixel tall object are qualitatively different from those for recognizing a 3 pixel tall object. We argue that for sensors with finite resolution, one should instead use scale-variant, or multiresolution representations that adapt in complexity to the size of a putative detection window. We describe a multiresolution model that acts as a deformable part-based model when scoring large instances and a rigid template with scoring small instances. We also examine the interplay of resolution and context, and demonstrate that context is most helpful for detecting low-resolution instances when local models are limited in discriminative power. We demonstrate impressive results on the Caltech Pedestrian benchmark, which contains object instances at a wide range of scales. Whereas recent state-of-the-art methods demonstrate missed detection rates of 86%-37% at 1 false-positive-per-image, our multiresolution model reduces the rate to 29%."

Much of the progress of the past few years has been driven by the availability of challenging public datasets. To continue the rapid rate of innovation, we introduce the Caltech Pedestrian Dataset, which is two orders of magnitude larger than existing datasets. The dataset contains richly annotated video, recorded from a moving vehicle, with challenging images of low resolution and frequently occluded people. We propose improved evaluation metrics, demonstrating that commonly used per-window measures are flawed and can fail to predict performance on full images. We also benchmark several promising detection systems, providing an overview of state-of-the-art performance and a direct, unbiased comparison of existing methods. Finally, by analyzing common failure cases, we help identify future research directions for the field."

After reviewing existing edge and gradient based descriptors, we show experimentally that grids of histograms of oriented gradient (HOG) descriptors significantly outperform existing feature sets for human detection. We study the influence of each stage of the computation on performance, concluding that fine-scale gradients, fine orientation binning, relatively coarse spatial binning, and high-quality local contrast normalization in overlapping descriptor blocks are all important for good results. The new approach gives near-perfect separation on the original MIT pedestrian database, so we introduce a more challenging dataset containing over 1800 annotated human images with a large range of pose variations and backgrounds."

Our system is able to represent highly variable object classes and achieves state-of-the-art results in the PASCAL object detection challenges. While deformable part models have become quite popular, their value had not been demonstrated on difficult benchmarks such as the PASCAL data sets. Our system relies on new methods for discriminative training with partially labeled data. We combine a margin-sensitive approach for data-mining hard negative examples with a formalism we call latent SVM. A latent SVM is a reformulation of MI--SVM in terms of latent variables. A latent SVM is semiconvex, and the training problem becomes convex once latent information is specified for the positive examples. This leads to an iterative training algorithm that alternates between fixing latent values for positive examples and optimizing the latent SVM objective function."

[11] achieve state-of-the-art performance for a variety of object categories, but are still outperformed by simpler bag-of-words models for highly flexible objects such as cats and dogs. In these cases we propose to use the template-based model to detect a distinctive part for the class, followed by detecting the rest of the object via segmentation on image specific information learnt from that part. This approach is motivated by two ob- servations: (i) many object classes contain distinctive parts that can be detected very reliably by template-based detec- tors, whilst the entire object cannot; (ii) many classes (e.g. animals) have fairly homogeneous coloring and texture that can be used to segment the object once a sample is provided in an image. We show quantitatively that our method substantially outperforms whole-body template-based detectors for these highly deformable object categories, and indeed achieves accuracy comparable to the state-of-the-art on the PASCAL VOC competition, which includes other models such as bag-of-words."

We review the state-of-the-art in evaluated methods for both classification and detection, analyse whether the methods are statistically different, what they are learning from the images (e.g. the object or its context), and what the methods find easy or confuse.

They have been the chief reason for the considerable progress in the field, not just as source of large amounts of training data, but also as means of measuring and comparing performance of competing algorithms. At the same time, datasets have often been blamed for narrowing the focus of object recognition research, reducing it to a single benchmark performance number. Indeed, some datasets, that started out as data capture efforts aimed at representing the visual world, have become closed worlds unto themselves (e.g. the Corel world, the Caltech-101 world, the PASCAL VOC world). With the focus on beating the latest benchmark numbers on the latest dataset, have we perhaps lost sight of the original purpose? The goal of this paper is to take stock of the current state of recognition datasets. We present a comparison study using a set of popular datasets, evaluated based on a number of criteria including: relative data bias, cross-dataset generalization, effects of closed-world assumption, and sample value. The experimental results, some rather surprising, suggest directions that can improve dataset collection as well as algorithm evaluation protocols. But more broadly, the hope is to stimulate discussion in the community regarding this very important, but largely neglected issue."

The original Caltech-101 [1] was collected by choosing a set of object categories, downloading examples from Google Images and then manually screening out all images that did not fit the category. Caltech-256 is collected in a similar manner with several improvements: a) the number of categories is more than doubled, b) the minimum number of images in any category is increased from 31 to 80, c) artifacts due to image rotation are avoided and d) a new and larger clutter category is introduced for testing background rejection. We suggest several testing paradigms to measure classification performance, then benchmark the dataset using two simple metrics as well as a state-of-the-art spatial pyramid matching [2] algorithm. Finally we use the clutter category to train an interest detector which rejects uninformative background regions."

Our main contribution is a novel framework for combining object-level descriptions (such as position, shape, and color) with pixel-level appearance, boundary, and occlusion reasoning. In training, we exploit a rough 3D object model to learn physically localized part appearances. To find and segment objects in an image, we generate proposals based on the appearance and layout of local parts. The proposals are then refined after incorporating object-level information, and overlapping objects compete for pixels to produce a final description and segmentation of objects in the scene. A further contribution is a novel instance penalty, which is handled very efficiently during inference. We experimentally validate our approach on the challenging PASCAL'06 car database."

Over the years, two kinds of contextual models have emerged: models with contextual inference based on the statistical summary of the scene (we will refer to these as scene based context models, or SBC), and models representing the context in terms of relationships among objects in the image (object based context, or OBC). In designing object recognition systems, it is necessary to understand the theoretical and practical properties of such approaches. This work provides an analysis of these models and evaluates two of their representatives using the LabelMe dataset. We demonstrate a considerable margin of improvement using the OBC style approach."

We introduce edgelet features, which are a new type of silhouette oriented features. Part detectors, based on these features, are learned by a boosting method. Responses of part detectors are combined to form a joint likelihood model that includes cases of multiple, possibly inter-occluded humans. The human detection problem is formulated as maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation. We show results on a commonly used previous dataset as well as new data sets that could not be processed by earlier methods."

Two kinds of detectors, i.e., global detector for whole scanning windows and part detectors for local regions, are learned from the training data using linear SVM. For each ambiguous scanning window, we construct an occlusion likelihood map by using the response of each block of the HOG feature to the global detector. The occlusion likelihood map is then segmented by Mean-shift approach. The segmented portion of the window with a majority of negative response is inferred as an occluded region. If partial occlusion is indicated with high likelihood in a certain scanning window, part detectors are applied on the unoccluded regions to achieve the final classification on the current scanning window. With the help of the augmented HOG-LBP feature and the global-part occlusion handling method, we achieve a detection rate of 91.3% with FPPW= 10\u22126, 94.7% with FPPW= 10\u22125, and 97.9% with FPPW= 10\u22124 on the INRIA dataset, which, to our best knowledge, is the best human detection performance on the INRIA dataset. The global-part occlusion handling method is further validated using synthesized occlusion data constructed from the INRIA and Pascal dataset."

The method is based on a segmentation energy defined over all images at the same time, which can be optimized efficiently by techniques used before in interactive segmentation. Over iterations, our method progressively learns a class model by integrating observations over all images. In addition to appearance, this model captures the location and shape of the class with respect to an automatically determined coordinate frame common across images. This frame allows us to build stronger shape and location models, similar to those used in object class detection. Our method is inspired by interactive segmentation methods [1], but it is fully automatic and learns models characteristic for the object class rather than specific to one particular object/image. We experimentally demonstrate on the Caltech4, Caltech101, and Weizmann horses datasets that our method (a) transfers class knowledge across images and this improves results compared to segmenting every image independently; (b) outperforms Grabcut [1] for the task of unsupervised segmentation; (c) offers competitive performance compared to the state-of-the-art in unsupervised segmentation and in particular it outperforms the topic model [2]."

Repeatability rate evaluates the geometric stability under different transformations. Information content measures the distinctiveness of features. Different interest point detectors are compared using these two criteria. We determine which detector gives the best results and show that it satisfies the criteria well."

Objects are represented as a coherent ensemble of parts that are consistent under 3D viewpoint transformations. Each part is a collection of salient image features. A generative framework is used for learning a model that captures the relative position of parts within each of the discretized viewpoints. Contrary to most of the existing mixture of viewpoints models, our model establishes explicit correspondences of parts across different viewpoints of the object class. Given a new image, detection and classification are achieved by determining the position and viewpoint of the model that maximize recognition scores of the candidate objects. Our approach is among the first to propose a generative probabilistic framework for 3D object categorization. We test our algorithm on the detection task and the viewpoint classification task by using \u201ccar\u201d category from both the Savarese et al. 2007 and PASCAL VOC 2006 datasets. We show promising results in both the detection and viewpoint classification tasks on these two challenging datasets."

The goal of our method is to explore fine image statistics and identify the discriminative image patches for recognition. We achieve this goal by combining two ideas, discriminative feature mining and randomization. Discriminative feature mining allows us to model the detailed information that distinguishes different classes of images, while randomization allows us to handle the huge feature space and prevents over-fitting. We propose a random forest with discriminative decision trees algorithm, where every tree node is a discriminative classifier that is trained by combining the information in this node as well as all upstream nodes. Our method is tested on both subordinate categorization and activity recognition datasets. Experimental results show that our method identifies semantically meaningful visual information and outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms on various datasets."

To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel framework for visual object recognition where object classes are represented by assemblies of partial surface models (PSMs) obeying loose local geometric constraints. The PSMs themselves are formed of dense, locally rigid assemblies of image features. Since our model only enforces local geometric consistency, both at the level of model parts and at the level of individual features within the parts, it is robust to viewpoint changes and intra-class variability. The proposed approach has been implemented, and it outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms for object detection and localization recently compared in [14] on the Pascal 2005 VOC Challenge Cars Test 1 data."

Usually, these priors are used post-hoc in the process of resolving feature matches and obtaining final scene estimates, via `first get candidate matches, then resolve' consensus algorithms such as RANSAC. In this paper we show that the dramatically different approach of using priors dynamically to guide a feature by feature matching search can achieve global matching with much fewer image processing operations and lower overall computational cost. Essentially, we put image processing into the loopof the search for global consensus. In particular, our approach is able to cope with significant image ambiguity thanks to a dynamic mixture of Gaussians treatment. In our fully Bayesian algorithm, the choice of the most efficient search action at each step is guided intuitively and rigorously by expected Shannon information gain. We demonstrate the algorithm in feature matching as part of a sequential SLAM system for 3D camera tracking. Robust, real-time matching can be achieved even in the previously unmanageable case of jerky, rapid motion necessitating weak motion modelling and large search regions."

Our system achieves a two-fold improvement in average precision over the best performance in the 2006 PASCAL person detection challenge. It also outperforms the best results in the 2007 challenge in ten out of twenty categories. The system relies heavily on deformable parts. While deformable part models have become quite popular, their value had not been demonstrated on difficult benchmarks such as the PASCAL challenge. Our system also relies heavily on new methods for discriminative training. We combine a margin-sensitive approach for data mining hard negative examples with a formalism we call latent SVM. A latent SVM, like a hidden CRF, leads to a non-convex training problem. However, a latent SVM is semi-convex and the training problem becomes convex once latent information is specified for the positive examples. We believe that our training methods will eventually make possible the effective use of more latent information such as hierarchical (grammar) models and models involving latent three dimensional pose."

In recent years, \u201cnatural\u201d images have become popular in the study of vision and have been used to show apparently impressive progress in building such models. Here, we challenge the use of uncontrolled \u201cnatural\u201d images in guiding that progress. In particular, we show that a simple V1-like model\u2014a neuroscientist's \u201cnull\u201d model, which should perform poorly at real-world visual object recognition tasks\u2014outperforms state-of-the-art object recognition systems (biologically inspired and otherwise) on a standard, ostensibly natural image recognition test. As a counterpoint, we designed a \u201csimpler\u201d recognition test to better span the real-world variation in object pose, position, and scale, and we show that this test correctly exposes the inadequacy of the V1-like model. Taken together, these results demonstrate that tests based on uncontrolled natural images can be seriously misleading, potentially guiding progress in the wrong direction. Instead, we reexamine what it means for images to be natural and argue for a renewed focus on the core problem of object recognition\u2014real-world image variation."

These developments are being fueled by advances in computer vision techniques, computer design, sensor design, and interest in fielding face recognition systems. Such advances hold the promise of reducing the error rate in face recognition systems by an order of magnitude over Face Recognition Vendor Test (FRVT) 2002 results. The face recognition grand challenge (FRGC) is designed to achieve this performance goal by presenting to researchers a six-experiment challenge problem along with data corpus of 50,000 images. The data consists of 3D scans and high resolution still imagery taken under controlled and uncontrolled conditions. This paper describes the challenge problem, data corpus, and presents baseline performance and preliminary results on natural statistics of facial imagery."

A user photographs an isolated leaf on a blank background, and the system extracts the leaf shape and matches it to the shape of leaves of known species. In a few seconds, the sys- tem displays the top matching species, along with textual descriptions and additional images. This system is currently in use by botanists at the Smithsonian Institution National Museum of Natural History. The primary contributions of this paper are: a description of a working com- puter vision system and its user interface for an important new applica- tion area; the introduction of three new datasets containing thousands of single leaf images, each labeled by species and verified by botanists at the US National Herbarium; recognition results for two of the three leaf datasets; and descriptions throughout of practical lessons learned in constructing this system."
