Given the directed graph for a particular model, a factorization of the joint distribution of the random variables can be written down and rules given for reading the conditional independence relations amongst the variables. The definition does not depend on any particular distributional form and hence can be applied to models with both discrete and continuous random variables. However, the most tractable examples are those for which the joint distribution is normal, or a product of multinomials, and these are considered in detail."

These models are hierarchical models that can be represented by a simple, undirected graph on as many vertices as the dimension of the corresponding table. Further all these models can be given an interpretation in terms of conditional independence and the interpretation can be read directly off the graph in the form of a Markov property. The class of graphical models contains that of decomposable models and we give a simple criterion for decomposability of a given graphical model. To some extent we discuss estimation problems and give suggestions for further work."

This collection of articles is a course book on the causal modeling approach to theory construction and data analysis. H. M. Blalock, Jr. summarizes the then-current developments in causal model utilization in sociology, political science, economics, and other disciplines. This book provides a comprehensive multidisciplinary picture of the work on causal models. It seeks to address the problem of measurement in the social sciences and to link theory and research through the development of causal models.Organized into five sections (Simple Recursive Models, Path Analysis, Simultaneous Equations Techniques, The Causal Approach to Measurement Error, and Other Complications), this volume contains twenty-seven articles (eight of which were specially commissioned). Each section begins with an introduction explaining the concepts to be covered in the section and links them to the larger subject. It provides a general overview of the theory and application of causal modeling.Blalock argues for the development of theoretical models that can be operationalized and provide verifiable predictions. Many of the discussions of this subject that occur in other literature are too technical for most social scientists and other scholars who lack a strong background in mathematics. This book attempts to integrate a few of the less technical papers written by econometricians such as Koopmans, Wold, Strotz, and Fisher with discussions of causal approaches in the social and biological sciences. This classic text by Blalock is a valuable source of material for those interested in the issue of measurement in the social sciences and the construction of mathematical models."

We show that a reducible zero pattern is the condition under which parameters as well as least squares estimates in recursive equations are one-to-one transformations of parameters and of maximum likelihood estimates, respectively, in a decomposable covariance selection model. As a consequence, (a) we can give a closed-form expression for the maximum likelihood estimate of a decomposable covariance matrix, (b) we can derive Wright's rule for computing implied correlations in path analysis, and (c) we can describe a search procedure for fitting recursive equations."

For a given path diagram, we provide methods for estimating the magnitude of the various effects represented in the diagram and also methods for determining whether the path-diagram model (described by a given system of equations) is congruent with the data. We present an overall test of the entire system of equations in the model, as well as separate tests of each equation in the system, and we also provide methods for comparing the merits and demerits ofa variety of path diagrams pertaining to the data. To illustrate the various advantages of the techniques proposed, we shall reanalyze three sets of data: (a) The famous two-attribute turnover table (the 16-fold table) on voting intention analyzed earlier by Lazarsfeld (1948), Lipset et al. (1954), Campbell (1963), Lazarsfeld, Berelson, and Gaudet (1968), Boudon (1968), and Lazarsfeld (1970); (b) a two-attribute turnover table on student attitudes analyzed earlier by Coleman (1964); and (c) the four-way cross-classification pertaining to the \"contact hypothesis\" analyzed earlier by Wilner, Walkley, and Cook (1955), Davis(1971), and Goodman (1972b).

Unfortunately, causes of variation often seem to be beyond control. In the biological sciences, especially, one often has to deal with a group of characteristics or conditions which are correlated because of a complex of interacting, uncontrollable, and often obscure causes. The degree of correlation between two variables can be calculated by well-known methods, but when it is found it gives merely the resultant of all connecting paths of influence. The present paper is an attempt to present a method of measuring the direct influence along each separate path in such a system and thus of finding the degree to which variation of a given effect is determined by each particular cause. The method depends on the combination of knowledge of the degrees of correlation among the variables in a system with such knowledge as may be possessed of the causal relations. In cases in which the causal relations are uncertain the method can be used to find the logical consequences of any particular hypothesis in regard to them. CORRELATION"

                "text": "SUMMARY This paper considers a wide class of latent structure models. These models can serve as possible explanations of the observed relationships among a set of m manifest polytomous variables. The class of models considered here includes both models in which the parameters are identifiable and also models in which the parameters are not. For each of the models considered here, a relatively simple method is presented for calculating the maximum likeli- hood estimate of the frequencies in the m-way contingency table expected under the model, and for determining whether the parameters in the estimated model are identifiable. In addition, methods are presented for testing whether the model fits the observed data, and for replacing unidentifiable models that fit by identifiable models that fit. Some illus- trative applications to data are also included. This paper deals with the relationships among m polytomous variables, i.e. with the analysis of an m-way contingency table. These m variables are manifest variables in that, for each observed individual in a sample, his class with respect to each of the m variables is observed. We also consider here polytomous variables that are latent in that an individ- ual's class with respect to these variables is not observed. The classes of a latent variable will be called latent classes. Consider first a 4-way contingency table which cross-classifies a sample of n individuals with respect to four manifest polytomous variables A, B, C and D. If there is, say, some latent dichotomous variable X, so that each of the n individuals is in one of the two latent classes with respect to this variable, and within the tth latent class the manifest variables (A, B, C, D) are mutually independent, then this two-class latent structure would serve as a simple explanation of the observed relationships among the variables in the 4-way con- tingency table for the n individuals. There is a direct generalization when the latent variable has T classes. We shall present some relatively simple methods for determining whether the observed relationships among the variables in the m-way contingency table can be explained by a T-class structure, or by various modifications and extensions of this latent structure. To illustrate the methods we analyze Table 1, a 24 contingency table presented earlier by Stouffer & Toby (1951, 1962, 1963), which cross-classifies 216 respondents with respect to whether they tend towards universalistic values ( + ) or particularistic values (-) when confronted by each of four different situations of role conflict.

The method has been applied in quite a variety of cases. It seems desirable now to make a restatement of the theory and to review the types of application, especially as there has been a certain amount of misunderstanding both of purpose and of procedure."

The techniques proposed here yield 'path diagrams' that are somewhat analogous to those used in path analysis. Earlier path analysis models are not suited to the case where the variables are polytomous, or dichotomous, but the models proposed herein are. For each of our models, methods are presented for (a) testing whether the model fits the data, (b) partitioning the test statistic into components that can be used to test submodels within the overall model, and (c) estimating the parameters in the model. An illustrative application is also included."
