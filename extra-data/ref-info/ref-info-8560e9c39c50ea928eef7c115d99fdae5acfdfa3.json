In the learning phase, a scene containing a single object is shown one at a time. The range data of a scene are obtained by a range finder. The description of each scene is built in terms of properties of regions and relations between them. This description is stored as an object model. In the recognition phase, an unknown scene is described in the same way as in the learning phase. Then the description is matched to the object models so that the stacked objects are recognized sequentially. Efficient matching is achieved by a combination of data-driven and model-driven search processes. Experimental results for blocks and machine parts are shown."

Laser ranging systems measure the surface depth directly and therefore avoid the computation required for construction of a depth map from multiple camera views. Since the physical level knowledge of the surfaces is directly available, the capability for real time object recognition in complex scenes is introduced. This paper discusses some elements of a real time 3D pattern recognition system for sensor based robot applications. The investigation includes a conceptual discussion of the sensor and techniques for feature extraction."

One of the most successful techniques is that based on the surfaces of objects. We describe several methods for obtaining such surface representations from various types of intrinsic images. In particular, previous work is reviewed and an algorithm based on region growing is investigated in terms of its efficiency in segmenting a set of points in 3-D space into planar faces. Information on the neighborhood structure of the points in the form of a spatial proximity graph is used to direct the segmentation. Applications to industrial objects are demonstrated."

Objects are represented in terms of canonic 2D models which can be used to determine the identity, location and orientation of an unknown object. The reduction in dimensionality is achieved by factoring the space of all possible perspective projections of an object into a set of characteristic views, where each such view defines a characteristic-view domain within which all projections are topologically identical and related by a linear transformation. The characteristic views of an object can then be hierarchically structured for efficient classification. The line-junction labelling constraints are used to match a characteristic view to a given unknown-object projection, and determination of the unknown-object projection-to-characteristic view transformation then provides information about the identity as well as the location and orientation of the object."

                "text": "Computer vision is difficult both in problem formulation and in computational methodology. Traditional approaches either emphasize too much on the bottom-up process or on the use of complete a priori knowledge about the images under study. It is felt that a proper integration of the two approaches is necessary to design a general computer vision system. Based on this concept, a computer vision system is proposed and partially implemented. The emphasis is on the problem of dealing with imperfect segmentation and recovering the 3-D shape of an object from a single image. \nAn image representation, called the Gray Level Geographic Structure image representation, is proposed for preliminary segmentation and preattentive visual search. Edge extraction, edge linking, and edge description procedures are implemented with efficient algorithms. Regions for describing surface orientations are then extracted from the resulted edge map. Special primitives, such as parallelograms, ellipses, symmetric arcs, and corners, are also extracted using different procedures. These primitives are treated as projections of some regular space contours. The relations between the space contours and their projections can be used to computer the range of possible surface orientations for an extracted region. Based on the computed surface orientations of each region, the 3-D shape of an object can be generated. \nMathematically speaking, the information available in a single image is always ambiguous. Under certain regularity assumptions, local evidences about the shape of an object can often be derived. However, these local evidences, though rich in amount, are often inconsistent and not precise. A process called \"Selective Confirmation\" is proposed to resolve the ambiguities among the local evidences. The results of this process are a useful shape description of the object, and can be used as keys for associative recalls to retrieve proper object models and knowledge about them. the models and knowledge can then be used to guide the vision system to complete its interpretation processes."

The general 3-D object recognition task can be thought of as building a description of the object that must have at least two parts: 1) the internal description of the object itself (with respect to an object-centered frame); and 2) the transformation of the object-centered frame to the viewer-centered (image) frame. The reason for this decomposition is parsimony: different views of the object should have minimal impact on its description. This is achieved by factoring the object's description into two sets of parameters, one which is view-independent (the object-centered component) and one which is view-varying (the viewing transformation). Often a description of the object is known beforehand and the task reduces to finding the objectframe to viewer-frame transformation. This paper describes a method for handling this case: a known object is detected by finding changes in orientation, translation, and scale of the object from its canonical description. The method is a Hough technique and has the characteristic insensitivity to occlusion and noise."

See Figure 16 for an example of triangulation range-finder geometry. Depth resolution depends on how well positions, distances, and angles are measured. Triangulation methods always suffer from the \u201cmissing parts\u201d (or shadowing) problem owing to the necessary separation of the source and detectors, whereas laser range sensors with coaxial source and detector are not subject to this problem.

Various issues related to representation and modeling of 3-D objects are addressed. A new method for the approximation of 3-D objects by a set of planar faces is discussed. The major advantage of this method is that it is applicable to a complete object and not restricted to single range view which was the limitation of the previous work in 3-D scene analysis. The method is a sequential region growing algorithm. It is not applied to range images, but rather to a set of 3-D points. The 3-D model of an object is obtained by combining the object points from a sequence of range data images corresponding to various views of the object, applying the necessary transformations and then approximating the surface by polygons. A stochastic labeling technique is used to do the shape matching of 3-D objects. The technique matches the faces of an unknown view against the faces of the model. It explicitly maximizes a criterion function based on the ambiguity and inconsistency of classification. It is hierarchical and uses results obtained at low levels to speed up and improve the accuracy of results at higher levels. The objective here is to match the individual views of the object taken from any vantage point. Details of the algorithm are presented and the results are shown on several unknown views of a complicated automobile casting."

Running computer programs implement the methods and many examples illustrate their behavior. The input is a two-dimensional line-drawing of the scene, assumed to contain three-dimensional bodies possessing flat faces (polyhedra); some of them may be partially occluded. Suggestions are made for extending the work to curved objects. Some comparisons are made with human visual perception.

Stereo is an attractive technique for depth perception because, compared with monocular techniques, it leads to more direct, unambiguous, and quantitative depth measurements, and unlike \"active\" approaches such as radar and laser ranging, it is suitable in almost all application domains. Computational stereo is broadly defined as the recovery of the three-dimensional characteristics of a scene from multiple images taken from different points of view. First, each of the functional components of the computational stereo paradigm--image acquLsition, camera modeling, feature acquisition, image matching, depth determination, and interpolation--is identified and discussed. Then, the criteria that are important for evaluating the effectiveness of various computational stereo techniques are presented. Finally a representative sampling of computational stereo research is provided."

The EGI is constructed by mapping each surface normals of an object to the Gaussian sphere. \n \nThe freedom in viewer directions caused by incomplete observation Is greatly reduced by applying constraints derived from a global distribution of surface normals on the EGI. One constraint on the viewer direction is derived from the ratio of the projected area to the original surface area. The other constraint comes from the direction of the principal axis. After reducing the possible viewing directions with these constraints, we will apply a matching function to ESls of a candidate set for a final decision. \n \nWe also propose an algorithm for reconstruction of the original shape of a convex polyhedron from its EGI. This algorithm is based on the analysis-by-synthesis method."

This paper is addressed to the latter problem and is specifically concerned with automatic recognition of aircraft types from optical images. An experimental system is described in which certain features called moment invariants are extracted from binary television images and are then used for automatic classification. This experimental system has exhibited a significantly lower error rate than human observers in a limited laboratory test involving 132 images of six aircraft types. Preliminary indications are that this performance can be extended to a wider class of objects and that identification can be accomplished in one second or less with a small computer."

The goal of the model retrieval process is to generate a proper structural description of the object in the input image, and use the description to retrieve candidate object models from the associative memory of the vision system. The present study explores one way of deriving such an object shape description from a single image. Regularity constraints and a preference rule are used to restrict the solutions to a preferred interpretation of geometric contours. Local interpretation is then propagated to neighboring regions. Through a proper control on the interaction between constraints and consistency checking, a rough object description in terms of visible surface orientations can be gener-ated. A computer vision system using this approach has been imple-mented and it is described in some details."

Accordingly, an image is partitioned into small square windows, each of which is a view of a piece of a sphere, or of a cylinder, or of a plane. Windows are processed in parallel for recognition of content. New concepts and techniques include approximations of the image within a window by 2-D quadric polynomials where each approximation is constrained by one of the hypotheses that the 3-D surface shape seen is either planar, cylindrical, or spherical; a recognizer based upon these approximations to determine whether the object patch viewed is a piece of a sphere, or a piece of a cylinder, or a piece of a plane; lowpass filtering of the image by the approximation. The shape recognition is computationally simple, and for large windows is approximately Bayesian minimum-probability-of-error recognition. These classifications are useful for many purposes. One such purpose is to enable a following processor to use an appropriate estimator to estimate shape, and orientation and location parameters for the 3-D surface seen within a window."

The primary objective of this representation scheme is to reduce a 3D model into a canonic 2D model that can be used to determine object identity, orientation and location in 3D space. The reduction in dimensionality is based on the notion of factoring the space of all possible perspective projections of an object into a set of characteristic views, where each such view defines a family of projections which are topologically identical. Each characteristic view may be associated with one or more stable positions of the object. A linear transformation is then developed that allows mapping some member of the set of characteristic views to any arbitrary projection of the object to determine orientation and location of the object in 3D space. This transformation is used both for identification and for determining the stable position of the CV into which the arbitrary projection can be transformed. \nA line and junction labeling scheme is developed that is used for classifying the characteristic views into a hierarchy, based on the degeneracy of the projection. The labeling constraints are used at a later stage for guiding the search for matching two line structures. \nThe problem of matching and correlating points between the characteristic view and an arbitrary projection is accomplished in two stages. In the first stage the gray-level image is reduced into a binary image describing the object line-structure. The line-structure is chain-encoded, labeled and the junctions classified. In the second stage a stage-space technique is used for matching silhouettes of the extracted line-structure to the stored characteristic-views. The semantics associated with the lines and junctions are used to prune the search space. Once the silhouettes are matched, one proceeds to determine the transformation that best maps the projection to the stored characteristic view. The transformation is then used for verifying other junction and line labels in the extracted line structure."

The input to either algorithm is a two-dimensional array in which the boundaries of the surfaces of the object are marked. Both algorithms use a library of known objects. The learning algorithm sees the whole object to be learned and computes a description of the object. The output of the learning program is an updated library of known objects in which the description and name of the new object have been added to the names and descriptions of all the other known objects in the library. The recognition algorithm sees only a partial view of a known object. The algorithm computes a description of the partial view and compares this description to the descriptions of known objects. The output of the recognition algorithm is a list of possible names of the partial view with a measure of how well each object named matches the partial view. Figures illustrating the descriptions of the objects in the library of known objects are given. To help the reader evaluate the performance of the algorithm, figures of partial views are given. These figures illustrate how the recognition algorithm matched the partial view of an object to different known objects. A table summarizing the results of tests of the recognition algorithm is given. (Author)"

This information can be used to extract jump boundaries which correspond to occluding boundaries of objects in a scene and ``edges'' which correspond to points lying between significantly different regions on the surface of objects. We are mainly interested in range data obtained from sensors such as lasers. The main problem with this type of range finder is the fact that the accuracy of the measurements depends on the power of the signal that reaches the receiver. This study describes how a range edge detection procedure can be designed that has low sensitivity to noise and imbeds all the knowledge available on the range measurement accuracy."

                "text": "A recurring problem in computer vision and related fields is that of generating computer models of physical objects. This thesis presents a method for constructing such models in the form of three-dimensional surface or volume descriptions. The surface models are composed of curved, topologically rectangular, parametric patches. The data required to define these patches are obtained from multiple photographic images of the object illuminated by a rectangular pattern of lines. The projection of the pattern on the surface of the object traces curves which define the boundaries of the patches. The 3D description of the patches is reconstructed by photogrammetric techniques from two or more images of the projected pattern. A calibration stand, in which the object is placed, permits determination of the camera geometry directly from image data. \nThis method generates 3D surface descriptions of only those parts of the object that are illuminated by the projected pattern, and also are visible in at least two images. A complete model of the object is obtained by repeating this reconstruction process for various arbitrary orientations of the object until descriptions covering the entire surface have been obtained. Since each description is defined in its own 3D object space and 2D parameter space, a surface-matching procedure is developed to register spatially the surface descriptions in a common object space. This procedure searches for a 3D rigid transformation of the surface descriptions which minimizes their shape difference. Once the surface descriptions are in the same object space, they are also merged into a common parameter space. This match-and-merge process is iteratively repeated for pairs of surface descriptions until a complete model of the object is assembled."

The technique is fast because it concentrates on key features that are automatically se lected on the basis of a detailed analysis of computer- aided design (CAD) models of the objects. The automatic analysis applies general-purpose routines for building and analyzing representations of clusters of local features that could be used in procedures to select features for other lo cational strategies.

It discusses the object modeling, model-driven prediction, and feature-to-model matching aspects of the problem. The model objects are represented by a viewpoint-independent volumetric model based on generalized cylinders. Predictions of 3-D image features and their relations are generated from object models on multiple levels. These predictions give guidance for goal-directed shape extraction from low level image features. Interpretation proceeds by comparing the extracted image features with object models in a coarse to fine hierarchy. Since the 3-D information is available from the range image, the actual measurements are used for feature-to-model matching. A limited prototype system has been developed, preliminary results on prediction and interpretation are shown, and future research directions are discussed."

It uses a recognition cone, a segmentation algorithm for dividing a scene into similar regions and a routine for constructing a three dimensional world model. Visual inference routines interpret perspective, shadows, highlights, occlusions, shading and texture gradients, and monocular motion parallax. Other visual knowledge is added with long term models and short term object representations. \n \nThe final program will be tested on color photographs of outdoor scenes using as input a series of views of the same scene from different angles which approximates what an automaton would \"see\" as it moves down a street."

The use of three-dimensional moment invariants is proposed as a solution. The generalization of the results of two-dimensional moment invariants which had linked two-dimensional moments to binary quantics is done by linking three-dimensional moments to ternary quantics. The existence and number of nth order moments in two and three dimensions is explored. Algebraic invariants of several ternary forms under different orthogonal transformations are derived by using the invariant property of coefficients of ternary forms. The result is a set of three-dimensional moment invariants which are invariant under size, orientation, and position change. This property is highly significant in compressing the data which are needed in three-dimensional object recognition. Empirical examples are also given."

They can be computed easily from: 1. needle maps obtained using photometric stereo; or 2. depth maps generated by ranging devices or binocular stereo. Importantly, they can also be determined simply from geometric models of the objects. Extended Gaussian images can be of use in at least two of the tasks facing a machine vision system: 1. recognition, and 2. determining the attitude in space of an object. Here, the extended Gaussian image is defined and some of its properties discussed. An elaboration for nonconvex objects is presented and several examples are shown."

The instrument uses active triangulation and employs an optical bandpass filter to minimize the effects of ambient illumination. Its use of a single photodetecting element, a photomultiplier, is a unique feature among scanning triangulation rangefinders. A novel scanning configuration based on spherical coordinates is employed, resulting in an extremely large field of view. Nearly 75% of the surrounding solid angle is accessible. Reasonably high speed and accuracy are obtained. The typical error in range at a range of 50 in. is .12 in. The typical error in either of the two angular coordinates is .03\u00b0. The maximum instantaneous rate of acquisition of range samples is 500 Hz. Much higher speed and accuracy appear achievable with various modifications and improvements. This type of rangefinder appears most useful in automatic surveillance and robot navigation applications, because of its large field of view."

However, at the current state of development, 100 samples/point are required to achieve a range accuracy of approxi-mately \u00b1\u00bf cm, with a scan time of 40 s. Returned signal amplitude de-pendency is also apparent in the range determination, the dynamic range of intensity being considerable. Improved accuracy can be traded for tine. The vision/robotics laboratory environment within which the range scanner operates is briefly touched upon and some preliminary rangepic results presented."

Two basic tools are employed: the photometric stereo method and the extended Gaussian image. The photometric stereo method generates the surface normal distribution of a scene. The extended Gaussian image allows us to determine the attitude of the object based on the normal distribution. visual analysis of an image consists of two stages. The first stage segments the image into regions and determines the target region.The photometric stereo system provides the surface normal distribution of the scene. The sytem segments the scene into isolated regions using ghe surface normal distribution rathan than the brightness distribuiton. The second stage determines the object attitude and position by comparing the surface normal distribution with the extended-Gaussian-image. Fingers, with LED sensor, mounted on the PUMA arm can successfully pick an object from a pile based on the information from the vision part. (Author)"

The shape of a curved object is considered as a surface which is an accumulation of horizontal section boundaries. This is described by the coefficients of a Fourier series expansion of the proposed representative function. Each complicated feature of the shape of the object is decomposed into five simple features: elongatedness, horizontal strain, section shape, torsion, and displacement. Differences of objects as patterns are defined as pseudodistances of corresponding features. Some essential properties such as completeness of the pseudodistance family are explained theoretically. Finally, experimental results of identification of wooden block models and a doll are displayed."

The approach is to use three-dimensional models of the objects to find them in range data. The matching strategy starts with a distinctive edge feature, such as the edge at the end of a cylindrical part, and then \"grows\" a match by add ing compatible features one at a time. (The order of features to be considered is predetermined by an interactive, off-line, feature-selection process.) Once a sufficient number of com patible features has been detected to allow a hypothesis to be formed, the verification procedure evaluates it by comparing the measured range data with data predicted according to the hypothesis. When all the objects in the scene have been hy pothesized and verified in this manner, a configuration- understanding procedure determines which objects are on top of others by analyzing the patterns of range data predicted from all the hypotheses. We also present experimental results of the system's performance in recognizing and locating castings in a bin."

The spherical representation can be useful for graphical display, and perhaps as an intermediate representation for conversions to representations with other primitives. The spherical decomposition also permits the computation of points on the symmetric surface of an object, the three-dimensional analog of Blum's symmetric axis.

The representation, based on the notion of \"skeleton\" of an object leads to a scheme for comparing two given object views for shape relations. The objects are composed of long, thin, rectangular prisms joined at their ends. The input picture to the program is the digitized line drawing portraying the three-dimensional object. To compare two object views, two characteristic vertices called \"cardinal point\" and \"end-cardinal point,\" occurring consistently at the bends and open ends of the object are detected. The skeletons are then obtained as a connected path passing through these points. The shape relationships between the objects are then obtained from the matching characteristics of their skeletons. The method explores the possibility of a more detailed and finer analysis leading to detection of features like symmetry, asymmetry and other shape properties of an object."

Planar and quadric surface primitives describe the object's surface in an object-centered reference frame. The extent of a primitive is defined by the intersection of the primitive with its neighbors. An edge graph defined by these intersections implicitly expresses spatial relationships between surface primitives. \nThe model builder's input consists of groups of data points corresponding to different views. Each data point contains spatial and orientation information about the object's surface at a discrete location. A set of registered arrays is used to summarize input information in local areas. Mathematical principles from differential geometry are applied to determine local surface properties. A region-growing technique is applied to this information to identify data points which then are represented by a surface primitive. Edges and corners are computed based on the intersections of surface primitives. The results from the analysis of the various views are transformed to a common, arbitrary reference frame for integration into a global model. The final object-centered reference frame is established based on the center of gravity and moments of inertia of the object as determined from the complete model. \nThe goal of model building has applications in the fields of pattern recognition, computer vision, robotics, computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing. A model using surface primitives appears as a natural first step in describing an object because surfaces are obvious visual features. The strengths and weaknesses of this surface model are explored."

The adaptive matching technique requires that sufficient silhouettes be added to modify the structure of the unknown object until consistent and steady matching results are obtained. The library for matching is based on three primary silhouettes of the model objects.

Equations are derived to relate the mean and variance of both the intensity and the range data to the physical properties of the target and the parameters of the sensor. Experimental results that verify these equations are given. Adaptive data smoothing and normalization procedures are presented. These procedures reduce photon noise and correct the intensity data for inverse square-law effects. The resulting intensity data give the product of the diffuse surface reflectance and the cosine of the angle of incidence for each picture element in the scene. Simple procedures are given for finding outlines of occluding objects, obtaining normal views of obliquely sensed planar surfaces, and extracting the images of horizontal surface regions from a scene. These procedures demonstrate the advantages of having registered reflectance and range data for scene analysis."

Ambiguity arises in such a task not only in the case of two views but also with three-view inputs, due to coinciding projections of vertices. The main effort consists in heuristically reducing this ambiguity. The general strategy is a bottom-up identification of the objects starting with the tablet-coordinates and aggregating them into vertices, then faces and finally polyhedra. The program does not contain any high level geometrical concepts or probable properties of 3-D objects but only some basic definitions of polyhedra (as expressed by Euler and Mobius). By applying these definitions to different parts of the scene to recognize, it defines local sets of alternatives and then chooses the right ones by running a mini theorem prover over these sets. A major issue in writing this program has been to limit the drawing constraints imposed on the user. In case that it gets blocked in the recognition process, however, the program can require the user's help."

The device works on the same triangulation principle as an ordinary stereo camera, but involves an active camera (coded-laser-beam-array projector), a passive camera (TV), and the software for pattern synchronization and analysis. The system involves (1) a single laser beam; (2) interference optics to transform the single beam into an array of laser beams; (3) a programmable electro-optic shutter which can block or transmit various subsets of the laser beams in the array; (4) a TV camera to view the environmental surfaces illuminated by the laser beam array; and (5) a processor which controls the shutter, synchronizes the shutter with the TV camera, and decodes the contents of the TV images of the different coded patterns projected on the environment. The system is being developed for rapid biomedical surface mapping but can also be used in vision aid for the blind, robot vision, assembly-line inspection, data acquisition for 3-D pattern recognition, and the monitoring of large surfaces and volumes (dams, construction processes, security areas, etc.)."

A surface segment of a solid object is a partial description of the object's surface, usually limited to the surface area that can be reconstructed from two corresponding images of the object in an arbitrary orientation. Each surface segment is defined in its 3D coordinate system. The matching algorithm uses heuristic search to align overlapping surface segments of an object into a common 3D coordinate system. It searches for a rigid 3D transformation which minimizes shape differences between a pair of surface segments. Once this transformation is determined, the surface segments are merged into a new segment. This match-and-merge process is iteratively repeated for pairs of available surface segments until a complete model of the object is assembled."

                "text": "A new industrial revolution is in the making, produced by a marriage of two versatile technologies, the computer and the robot. This combination of control and manipulation produces a machine with enormous potential for performing useful tasks-yet such potential has not been fully realized. One way to improve the capabilities of current industrial robots is to add visual sensors. Robots that are deaf or dumb or that have no sense of force or touch perform only manually trainable tasks that can be dangerous in some working environments. Many applications call for an \"intelligent\" robot, a stand-alone machine-usually with its own visual, contact, or auditory sensory perception system-that can detect changes in its work environment and adapt to them. Such a detection process requires a large number of computations on the sensory data to distinguish features, recognize patterns, or compare input data with logical expectations. With the low cost of microprocessors and the increasing use of dedicated computers, intelligent systems for robots are becoming more and more sophisticated,\"2 and we have no shortage of potential applications: sensorybased robots can be used in space exploration, deep-sea mining, and industrial automation, for example.3'4 Computer vision, the collection of techniques, software, and hardware for measurements and inferences from images,3,6 appears to offer the richest source of sensory information for intelligent robotic manipulation in the greatest number of environments. A simple computer vision system usually consists of an image-processing unit interfaced with a minicomputer or mainframe,' but many kinds of systems are available, some for as little as $5000.8 However, most of these are low-level processing systems,9\"10 consisting of image acquisition, edge detection, feature extraction, template matching, and object recognition.* High-level processing is time consuming, since it requires a lot of computation. Nevertheless, image-processing algorithms can be implemented on minicomputers or mainframes.'3 In fact, imaging devices have been widely used in many automated visual inspection systems to perform pattern recognition and image processing for a specific task.'4\"l5 This article describes a technique that uses a recorded image of a projected pattern to measure 3-D surface points on simple, curved objects. The measured points are then fit to a quadric surface equation from which location, orientation, and surface recognition are extracted. For many man-made objects, this extracted information is sufficient to permit a robot hand to pick up the object, and results indicate that curved, featureless objects can be located."

A sensor has been designed with data rates of 30 kHz for orightness, 2 kHz for range in the scanning mode, and 250 Hz for range in tne random access mode. Range data accuracy is aoout .1A of tne field of view. The main components of the sensor are a low power laser (1 mW), a 1024 element COD linear array camera, a galvanometer scanner, and a special interface to a minicomputer. Alternative designs include stereo without using projected energy, white light projection, ultrasound, time-of-flignt measurements, multiple detectors, projecting planes versus oeams, two-dimensional array cameras and \"position\" sensors, and a variety of scanning mechanisms."

The author has analyzed the computations performed in the course of visual motion analysis. Workable schemes able to perform certain tasks performed by the visual system have been constructed and used as vehicles for investigating the problems faced by the visual system and its methods for solving them.Two major problems are treated: first, the correspondence problem, which concerns the identification of image elements that represent the same object at different times, thereby maintaining the perceptual identity of the object in motion or in change. The second problem is the three-dimensional interpretation of the changing image once a correspondence has been established.The author's computational approach to visual theory makes the work unique, and it should be of interest to psychologists working in visual perception and readers interested in cognitive studies in general, as well as computer scientists interested in machine vision, theoretical neurophysiologists, and philosophers of science."

The representation is designed to facilitate matching of image curves to completely specified model plane curves and estimation of their orientation in space, despite the presence of noise, variable resolution, or partial occlusion. This is an important subproblem of model-based vision. A curve may be represented at a variety of scales, and a strategy for selecting natural scales is proposed. At each scale, the representation is simply a list of positions in the plane, with tangent directions and curvatures specified at each position; each curvature is cither a zero or an extremum (hereafter critical points). The algorithm for computing the representation involves smoothing with gaussians at different scales, extracting the critical points from the smoothed curves, and using dynamic programming to construct a list of critical points which best approximate the curve for each length of list possible. We propose to examine the tradeoff between the error of the approximation and length of the lists to find natural scales."

                "text": "Recently, Marr & Poggio (1979) presented a theory of human stereo vision. An implementation of that theory is presented, and consists of five steps. (i) The left and right images are each filtered with masks of four sizes that increase with eccentricity; the shape of these masks is given by delta 2G, the Laplacian of a Gaussian function. (ii) Zero crossings in the filtered images are found along horizontal scan lines. (iii) For each mask size, matching takes place between zero crossings of the same sign and roughly the same orientation in the two images, for a range of disparities up to about the width of the mask's central region. Within this disparity range, it can be shown that false targets pose only a simple problem. (iv) The output of the wide masks can control vergence movements, thus causing small masks to come into correspondence. In this way, the matching process gradually moves from dealing with large disparities at a low resolution to dealing with small disparities at a high resolution. (v) When a correspondence is achieved, it is stored in a dynamic buffer, called the 2 1/2-dimensional sketch. To support the adequacy of the Marr-Poggio model of human stereo vision, the implementation was tested on a wide range of stereograms from the human stereopsis literature. The performance of the implementation is illustrated and compared with human perception. Also statistical assumptions made by Marr & Poggio are supported by comparison with statistics found in practice. Finally, the process of implementing the theory has led to the clarification and refinement of a number of details within the theory; these are discussed in detail."

The numerous applications of surface methods include modeling physical phenomena (e.g., combustion) and designing objects such as airplanes and cars. In addition to these 3D surfaces, there are interesting 4D \"surfaces\" such as temperature as a function of the three spatial variables. Because the geometric information for these problems can be located arbitrarily in 3D or 4-Dimensional space, the schemes must be able to handle arbitrarily located data. The standard (and easier) approach to surfacesusing tensor products of curve methods-restricts the surface method's applicability to rectangularly \"gridded\" data. Two broad classes of methods suitable for solving these problems (i.e., problems for which simplifying geometric assumptions cannot be made) are (1) surface interpolants defined over triangles or tetrahedra and (2) distanceweighted interpolants. Users ordinarily want smoother surfaces than their data imply directly, so additional information must usually be created. (A notable feature of the methods shown here is that the smoothness of the surface is always greater than or equal to the smoothness of the defining data. The author covers Surface form selection (Interpolation versus approximation; Representation versus design; Smoothness; Shape fidelity; Local versus global methods; and Rendering), and Interpolation surfaces. It is noted that triangular interpolants and distance-weighted interpolants excel as surface methods because of their smooth interpolation of arbitrarily located data."

However, research involving generalized cylinders has been hampered by a lack of analytical results at all levels, even including a lack of a precise definition of these shapes. In this paper, a definition is presented for Generalized Cylinders and for several subclasses. Straight Generalized Cylinders, with a linear axis, are important because the natural object-centered coordinates are not curved. The bulk of the paper is concerned with Straight Homogeneous Generalized Cylinders, in which the cross-sections have constant shape but vary in size. The results begin with deriving formulae for points and surface normals for these shapes. Theorems are presented concerning the conditions under which multiple descriptions can exist for a single solid shape. Then, projections, contour generators, shadow lines, and surface normals are analyzed for some subclasses of shapes. The strongest results are obtained for solids of revolution (which we name Right Circular SHGCs), for which several closed-form methods for analyzing images are presented.

Each picture element is independently classified and assigned a unique descriptive label, invariant under monotonically increasing gray tone transformations from the set (peak, pit, ridge, ravine, saddle, flat, and hillside), with hillside having subcategories (inflection point, slope, convex hill, concave hill, and saddle hill). The topographic classification is based on the first and second directional derivatives of the estimated image- intensity surface. A local, facet model, two-dimensional, cubic polynomial fit is done to estimate the image-intensity surface. Zero-crossings of the first directional derivative are identified as locations of interest in the image."

At the heart of such systems are symbol structures (representations) designating \"abstract solids\" (subsets of Euclidean space) that model physical solids. Representations are the sources of data for procedures which compute useful properties of objects. The variety and uses of systems embodying representations of solids are growing rapidly, but so are the difficulties in assessing current designs, specifying the characteristics that future systems should exhibit, and designing systems t9 meet such specifications. This paper resolves many of these difficulties by providing a coherent view, based on sound theoretical principles, of what is presently known about the representation of solids. The paper is divided into three parts. The first introduces a simple mathematical framework for characterizing certain important aspects of representations, for example, their semantic (geometric) integrity. The second part uses the framework to describe and compare all of the major knownschemes fo~ representing solids. The third part briefly surveys extant geometric modeling systems and then applies the concepts developed in the paper to the high-level design of a multiple*representation geometric modeling system which exhibits a level of reliability and versatility supermr to that of systems currently used in industrial computer-aided design and manufacturing."

The method uniquely decomposes an object into a collection of sub-objects each drawn from three separate, but not completely independent, primitive sets defined in the paper: width primitives, based on radius function properties; axis primitives, based on symmetric axis curvatures; and boundary primitives, based on boundary surface curvatures. Width primitives are themselves comprised of two components: slope districts and curvature districts. Visualizing the radius function as if it were the height function of some mountainous terrain, each slope district corresponds to a mountain face together with the valley below it. Curvature districts further partition each slope district into regions that are locally convex, concave, or saddle-like. Similarly, axis (boundary) primitives are regions of the symmetric surface where the symmetric surface (boundary surfaces) are locally convex, concave, or saddle-like. Relations among the primitive sets are discussed."

The essence of the facet model is that any analysis made on the basis of the pixel values in some neighborhood has its final authoritative interpretation relative to the underlying gray tone intensity surface of which the neighborhood pixel values are observed noisy samples. With regard to edge detection, we define an edge to occur in a pixel if and only if there is some point in the pixel's area having a negatively sloped zero crossing of the second directional derivative taken in the direction of a nonzero gradient at the pixel's center. Thus, to determine whether or not a pixel should be marked as a step edge pixel, its underlying gray tone intensity surface must be estimated on the basis of the pixels in its neighborhood. For this, we use a functional form consisting of a linear combination of the tensor products of discrete orthogonal polynomials of up to degree three. The appropriate directional derivatives are easily computed from this kind of a function. Upon comparing the performance of this zero crossing of second directional derivative operator with the Prewitt gradient operator and the Marr-Hildreth zero crossing of the Laplacian operator, we find that it is the best performer; next is the Prewitt gradient operator. The Marr-Hildreth zero crossing of the Laplacian operator performs the worst."

We describe a device that is at once a special-purpose parallel computer and a high-resolution tactile array sen sor. The passive substrates of earlier tactile sensors have been replaced with a custom-designed very large scale in tegration (VLSI) device that performs transduction, tactile image processing, and communication. Forces are trans duced using a conductive plastic technique in conjunction with metal electrodes on the surface of an integrated cir cuit. An array of processors implemented within the inte grated circuit perform parallel two-dimensional convolu tions between programmable filtering masks and a binary tactile image. Data are then read from the array serially, so they can be transmitted to a control computer. A 6 x 3 array sensor with 1 mm2 tactile cells has been designed and tested. It is fully functional. In preparation for constructing large sensor arrays with hundreds of elements, the possibility of constructing defect tolerant tactile cells was explored. Analyses based on the Poisson model indicate that working arrays with 1,000 functional cells are possible if computing elements are rep licated within each tactile cell. Experiments on a 3 x 3 array sensor with redundant pairs of computing elements suggest that large tactile sensing arrays are within reach."

We shall also survey work aimed at enhancing the geometric coverage, the applications coverage, and the performance of solid modeling systems.

                "text": "Abstract : In recent years, Binford's generalized cylinders have become an important tool for imagine understanding. However, research has been hampered by a lack of analytical results for these shapes. In this paper, a definition is presented for Straight Homogeneous Generalized Cylinders, those generalized cylinders, with a straight axis and with cross-sections which have constant shape but vary in size. This class of shapes, while still quite large, has properties which make considerable analysis possible. The results begin with deriving formulae for points and surface normals for these shapes. Theorems are presented concerning the conditions under which multiple descriptions can exist for a single solid shape. Then projections and contour generators are analyzed for some subclasses of shapes. The strongest results are obtained for solids of revolution (which the authors name Right Circular SHGCs), for which a closed-form method for analyzing image contours is presented. It is seen that a picture of the contours of a solid of revolution is ambiguous, with one degree of freedom related to the angle between the line of sight and the solid's axis. (Author)"

Common defects are identified in solder joints and a joint is classified as being good or belonging to one of the defective classes. The motivation for this classification is not just the detection of defective joints, but the desire to automatically take corrective action on the assembly line. The features used for classification are based on characteristics of intensity surfaces. It is shown that features derived from facets and Gaussian curvature are effective in the classification of solder joints using a minimum-distance classification algorithm. Class separation plots are shown to be useful for quickly studying individual effectiveness of a feature or pair of features in classification. Results show the efficacy of the described approach."

Examples are primarily from the domain of manufacturing and design of discrete goods, but the results reported here have wider significance. Mathematical definitions can formalize many of our intuitions about three-dimensional (3-D) objects and operations on them. Representation-free (mathematical) models and functions allow formal properties to be defined for characterizing geometric representations. Three common representation schemes for 3-D objects are described briefly, along with some of their formal and informal properties. A rigorous, as opposed to ad hoc, approach to modeling has several advantages. Broadly, the conceptual complications and ambiguities which are endemic to ad hoc problem statements and solutions may be avoided by appealing to a precise mathematical semantics. Mathematical rigor is mandatory in applications such as automatic manufacturing in which correctness must be guaranteed and consistency and validity maintained."

We call the representation the Curvature Primal Sketch because of the close analogy to the primal sketch representation advocated by Marr for describing significant intensity changes. We define a set of primitive parameterized curvature discontinuities, and derive expressions for their convolutions with the first and second derivatives of a Gaussian. We describe an implemented algorithm that computes the Curvature Primal Sketch by matching the multiscale convolutions of a shape, and illustrate its performance on a set of tool shapes. Several applications of the representation are sketched."

                "text": "C onsider the fine coordination between the eye and the hand of a young child who picks a cookie out of a jar. Although the cookies are roughly uniform in size and shape, the pile of cookies at the top of the jar is a jumble of visual cues, a rugged topography from which the child must extract enough information to determine what part of the visual or tactile field can be ascribed to the single, target cookie. As the child learns to take a cookie without crushing or breaking the ones around it, the child comes to realize that not every 4 orientation of the hand can be successful. For example, seizing the edge of the cookie between thumb and forefinger works only if the center of the cookie is 1 on or near the line connecting the opposing points of pressure. A much more reliable strategy is to determine the attitude, or orientation, of the cookie visually and then turn the hand to one of the positions best suited for picking it up. Finally, having grasped the cookie in one attitude or another, the child must transform the spatial coordinates of the cookie that pertain to the hand into the coordinates that pertain to the mouth. Until recently such a complex set of coordinated actions was beyond the capability of mechanization that seeks to replicate some of the functions of factory workers. The robot now working in the factory is fundamentally a playback machine for motions in space. T o carry out a task the robot must f i s t be \"trained\" by a person already skilled in the task. The \"arm\" of the robot is guided through a series of motions, and the sequence of robot configurations needed to follow the trainer is recorded on a tape or other memory devid-When the tape is played back, it directs the robot to execute the same sequence of motions. The ability of the robot to record spatial motion has been exploited by choreographers to make a permanent record of dance movements, but without notable success. Nevertheless, the playback robot has found a niche in the factory because many industrial tasks are so highly repetitive that they can be done as a sequence of fixed motions. Mechanical manipulators have therefore been applied to spot welding, machine loading, painting, deburring. seam welding, sealing and other tasks that are boring or hazardous. There is much factory work that cannot readily be adapted to a fixed routine of movement. In manual assembly, for example, it is common to have parts stored in trays or bins surrounding the work station. There the blind playback robot is virtually useless because it can tolerate very little uncertainty in the position of a part it must handle. An obvious solution to the problem is to avoid jumbling the parts together in the first place, or in other words to maintain a controlled orientation from the time they are made. There is a trend among manufacturers in favor of this solution: parts can be organized on carriers or attached to pallets on which they can be mechanically manipulated without the need for sensing. Nevertheless, the solution has its costs. The carriers or pallets must be designed and manufactured, often to close tolerances. Moreover, the pallets are usually heavy, they take up a large amount of space and they often have to be redesigned when the part they carry is modified. Indeed, the design of the part itself may have to be altered for the sake of automatic feeding. Suffice it to say there are many circumstances in which the volume of production has not presented enough economic incentive for the manufacturer to depart from more traditional, manual methods. We have now developed a computer system that can determine the position of a part with an arbitrary shape in a randomly arranged pile. The system requires only a few electronic images of the pile of parts. The images are mathematically transformed by the computer into a form that is readily compared with a mathematical model of the part stored in the computer memory. The mathematical model is rotated by the computer until it closely matches the attitude of the object to be grasped. The results are applied to direct a mechanical arm to pick up the part. Such a flexible sensing system may be able to substantially extend the range of applications of industrial robots."

A critical point configuration graph (CPCG) is derived from the critical points, ridge lines, and course lines of the function. Then a result from the theory of critical points of Morse functions is applied to obtain several constraints on the number and type of critical points that appear on cycles of a CPCG. These constraints yield a catalog of equivalent CPCG cycles containing four entries. The slope districts induced by a critical point configuration graph appear useful for describing the behavior of smooth functions of two variables, such as surfaces, images, and the radius function of three-dimensional symmetric axes."

These points are stored randomly in a list with no topological connectivity information. The points are then organized into a 3-D binary tree, which can be done in O(NlogN) time (where N is the number of points). Second, each point\u2019s neighbors are determined with the aid of the 3-D tree, and the results are stored in a 3-D spatial proximity graph. Third, a spiraling sequential planar-region-growing algorithm, known as the three-point seed method [Henderson and Bhanu 19821, is used to create convex planar faces using the spatial proximity graph as input. The union of these faces form the polyhedral object representation as extracted from the range data. Several processing steps mentioned above are required because of the (x, y, z) list format of the input data. Neighbors are given explicitly in standard rangeimage formats. This method can be used for either range data segmentation or object reconstruction. It can also work on dense range data or a sparse collection of points. Curved surfaces are approximated by many polygons. Wong and Hayrapetian [1982] suggest the use of range-image histograms to segment corresponding registered intensity images. All pixels in the intensity image that correspond to pixels in the range image with depth values not in a certain range are set to zero, segmenting all objects in that particular range. This segmentation trick is useful in specific applications, but it hardly begins to take advantage of the explicit range data information. Also, it cannot work on long objects that span the dynamic range of the range image. Gil et al. [1983] have demonstrated the usefulness of combining intensity and range edges from registered range and intensity images to obtain more reliable edges. Hebert and Ponce [1982] propose a method of segmenting depth maps into plane, cylindrical, and conical primitives. Surface normals are computed at each depth pixel using the best-fit plane in 3 X 3 windows. These normals are mapped to the Gaussian sphere where planar regions become very small clusters, cylinders become unit radius semicircles, and cones become smaller radius semicircles. (This orientation histogram is often referred, to as the extended Gaussian image, or EGI.) The Hough transform is used to detect these circles and clusters. Regions are then refined into labeled, connected components. Although somewhat restricted, this technique handles at least certain types of curved surfaces, in addition to handling planes. Inokuchi et al. [1982] present an edgeregion segmentation ring operator for depth maps."

Faugeras [1984], Faugeras and Hebert [1983], and their group at INRIA have devised a 3-D object-recognition algorithm based on geometrical matching between primitive surfaces. The primitive surfaces currently implemented in the INRIA computer vision system are planes, but quadricsurface algorithms are presented in these papers. Each geometric primitive has an associated parameter vector that determines its degrees of freedom. For a plane, there are three independent degrees of freedom: two independent direction parameters and one distance-from-the-origin parameter. Range data are processed to obtain lists of planar regions that correspond to an object. Object models are created and stored as polyhedra. Matches between the extracted primitives list and model primitives lists are hypothesized and verified using an approach that minimizes the meansquare-error criterion over all plane-toplane transformation matches. Techniques are used to incrementally drop and add primitives in the lists. The rotation and translation matching are decoupled into two separate independent least-squares problems. Quaternions are used to convert the nonlinear 3-D rotation problem into a four-dimensional eigenvalue problem, which can be solved directly. The translation problem permits a standard linear least-squares solution. The rotation and translation matching errors are combined to provide a quantitative measure of the goodness of the match between the data and a hypothetical model; the best match represents the recognized object. Local consistency tests are used to avoid full computation on strongly inconsistent plane lists. These ideas result in a computationally efficient method of identifying objects and determining their translation and rotation parameters. Experimental results are shown in Faugeras [1984] for the same Horn [1984], Horn and Ikeuchi [1984], Ikeuchi [1981], and Ikeuchi et al."

The description process (D) acts on the sensor data and extracts relevant application-independent features. This process should be completely data driven and incorporate only the knowledge of the image-formation process and rudimentary facts about the real world. No a priori assumptions about real-world object shapes should be incorporated. The modeling process (iV) provides object models for realworld objects. Object reconstruction from sensor data is one method for building models automatically. This method is preferred for a fully automated system but is not required by our problem definition, ,which addresses visual recognition, not .modeling per se. Hence, object models could #also be constructed manually using geo:metric solid modeling programs. The unIderstanding, or recognition, process (U) involves an algorithm to perform matching lbetween models and data descriptions. This Iprocess might include interacting data- and :model-driven subprocesses, where seg:mented sensor data regions seek explanations in terms of models and hypothesized :models seek verification from the data. The rendering process (R) produces synthetic sensor data from object models. A vision system should be able to communicate its understanding of a scene verbally and uisu&y to any person querying the system. Rendering also provides an important feedback link because it allows an autonomous system to check on its own understanding of the sensor data by comparing synthetic images to the sensed images. It is proposed that any object-recognition system can be discussed within the framework of this system model. This description is in agreement with the ideas brought forth by Brooks [1982], except for the addition of the rendering process."

A critical point configuration graph (CPCG) is derived from the critical points, ridge lines, and course lines of the function. Then a result from the theory of critical points of Morse functions is applied to obtain several constraints on the number and type of critical points that appear on cycles of a CPCG. These constraints yield a catalog of equivalent CPCG cycles containing four entries. The slope districts induced by a critical point configuration graph appear useful for describing the behavior of smooth functions of two variables, such as surfaces, images, and the radius function of tbree-dimensional symmetric axes."

The various surfaces of an object to be shown in hidden-surface or hidden-line form must be sorted to find out which ones are visible at various places on the screen. Surfaces may be sorted by lateral position in the picture (XY), by depth (Z), or by other criteria. The paper shows that the order of sorting and the types of sorting used form differences among the existing hidden-surface algorithms. (Modified author abstract)"
