The problem considered is that of a rigid body undergoing unknown rotational and translational motion. The measurement data consists of a sequence of noisy image coordinates of two or more object correspondence points. By modeling the object dynamics as a function of time, estimates of the model parameters (including motion parameters) can be extracted from the data using recursive and/or batch techniques. This permits a desired degree of smoothing to be achieved through the use of an arbitrarily large number of images. Some assumptions regarding object structure are presently made. Results are presented for a recursive estimation procedure: the case considered here is that of a sequence of one dimensional images of a two dimensional object. Thus, the object moves in one transverse dimension, and in depth, preserving the fundamental ambiguity of the central projection image model (loss of depth information). An iterated extended Kalman filter is used for the recursive solution. Noise levels of 5-10 percent of the object image size are used. Approximate Cramer-Rao lower bounds are derived for the model parameter estimates as a function of object trajectory and noise level. This approach may be of use in situations where it is difficult to resolve large numbers of object match points, but relatively long sequences of images (10 to 20 or more) are available."

Computational studies of this capacity have established that 3-D shape can be extracted correctly from a brief presentation, provided the moving objects are rigid. The human visual system requires a longer temporal extension, but it can cope with considerable deviations from rigidity. It is shown how the 3-D structure of rigid as well as nonrigid objects can be recovered by maintaining an internal model of the viewed object and modifying it at each instant by the minimal nonrigid change that is sufficient to account for the observed transformation. The results of applying this incremental rigidity scheme to rigid and nonrigid objects in motion are described and compared with human perception."

We describe a system which uses polynomial deformation mappings to couple a vibration-mode (\"modal\") representation of object dynamics together with volumetric models of object geometry. By use of such a hybrid representation we have been able to gain up to two orders of magnitude in efficiency, control temporal aliasing, and obtain simple, closed-form solutions to common (non-rigid) inverse dynamics problems. Further, this approach to dynamic simulation naturally lends itself to the emphasis and exaggeration techniques used in traditional animation."

Given a sufficient number of independent measurements, the solution is overconstrained and unique except for rotational symmetries. The proposed approach is based on the finite element method (FEM) and parametric solid modeling using implicit functions. This approach provides both the convenience of parametric modeling and the expressiveness of the physically based mesh formulation and, in addition, can provide great accuracy at physical simulation. A physically based object-recognition method that allows simple, closed-form comparisons of recovered 3-D solid models is presented. The performance of these methods is evaluated using both synthetic range data with various signal-to-noise ratios and using laser rangefinder data. >"

The solution of this \"variance equation\" completely specifies the optimal filter for either finite or infinite smoothing intervals and stationary or nonstationary statistics. The variance equation is closely related to the Hamiltonian (canonical) differential equations of the calculus of variations. Analytic solutions are available in some cases. The significance of the variance equation is illustrated by examples which duplicate, simplify, or extend earlier results in this field. The Duality Principle relating stochastic estimation and deterministic control problems plays an important role in the proof of theoretical results. In several examples, the estimation problem and its dual are discussed side-by-side. Properties of the variance equation are of great interest in the theory of adaptive systems. Some aspects of this are considered briefly."

We introduce the idea of a Realistic Uncertain Description of the Environment (RUDE) which is local, i.e attached to a specific reference frame, and incorporates both, information about the geometry and about the parameters measuring this geometry. We also relate this uncertainty to the pixel uncertainty and show how the RUDE corresponding to different frames can be used to relate these frames by a rigid displacement which we describe both by a rotation and translation and a measure of their uncertainty. Finally, we use the relations between frames to update the associated RUDE and decrease their uncertainty."

The system is implemented by simulating real materials as they react to user-supplied forces. Unlike other physically-based modeling approaches, the Thingworld system allows the user to restrict forming action to simple global deformations during the initial \"roughing in\" phase of modeling, and then later concern themselves with detailing. The Thingworld system also allows users to automatically model existing objects by using measurements taken from the object's surface. These measurements are used to generate artificial forces that mold the computer model much as a human would mold a clay model. Timed examples for constructing solid models are shown."
