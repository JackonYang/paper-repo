Random-dot images of black and white dots with various area fractions and tesselations (square and triangular lattices) were used as stimuli. The constructs of random geometry are correlation functions of n-th order and some functionals defined on them. The only parameter which is independent of the tesselation used is the first-order correlation which is the area fraction. It was first conjectured and then experimentally verified that figure-ground perception is not affected by the various tesselations used. Thus, figure-ground phenomena depend only on the area fraction of the white and black dots in the stimulus. There is a perceptual bias for white, that is, figure-ground reversal is easiest at 40 percent white-black area fraction. It was also experimentally shown that size-constancy prevails in figure-ground perception, but brightness-constancy does not."

It would be astonishing if such a structure did not profoundly modify the response patterns of fibres coming into it. In the cat's visual cortex, the receptive field arrangements of single cells suggest that there is indeed a degree of complexity far exceeding anything yet seen at lower levels in the visual system. In a previous paper we described receptive fields of single cortical cells, observing responses to spots of light shone on one or both retinas (Hubel & Wiesel, 1959). In the present work this method is used to examine receptive fields of a more complex type (Part I) and to make additional observations on binocular interaction (Part II). This approach is necessary in order to understand the behaviour of individual cells, but it fails to deal with the problem of the relationship of one cell to its neighbours. In the past, the technique of recording evoked slow waves has been used with great success in studies of functional anatomy. It was employed by Talbot & Marshall (1941) and by Thompson, Woolsey & Talbot (1950) for mapping out the visual cortex in the rabbit, cat, and monkey. Daniel & Whitteiidge (1959) have recently extended this work in the primate. Most of our present knowledge of retinotopic projections, binocular overlap, and the second visual area is based on these investigations. Yet the method of evoked potentials is valuable mainly for detecting behaviour common to large populations of neighbouring cells; it cannot differentiate functionally between areas of cortex smaller than about 1 mm2. To overcome this difficulty a method has in recent years been developed for studying cells separately or in small groups during long micro-electrode penetrations through nervous tissue. Responses are correlated with cell location by reconstructing the electrode tracks from histological material. These techniques have been applied to"

                "text": "In two recent studies of the cat's striate cortex (Hubel, 1959; Hubel & Wiesel, 1959) single units were shown to react to light stimuli in a highly specific manner. Most units responded either feebly or not at all to stimulation of the retina with diffuse light, but gave brisk responses to stationary or moving restricted spots of light. Responses to moving spots often varied with the direction of movement. It was clear that such responses must be the result of complex integrative mechanisms. The present study was undertaken to find out whether similar responses occur in retinal ganglion cells or cells of the dorsal lateral geniculate body. Lateral geniculate units have not previously been studied with restricted light stimulation, and although the cat's retinal ganglion cell has been extensively investigated by Kuffler and his co-workers (Kuffler, 1953; iKuffler, FitzHugh & Barlow, 1957), responses to moving spots were not examined. Thus it has not been possible to say whether the complex activity of cortical units originates in the cortex itself, or at lower levels. Methods for stereotaxic depth recordings in the unanaesthetized unrestrained animal were developed in order to make cortical and depth studies under similar conditions. These techniques make it possible to record from single units from virtually any part of the brain of the freely moving animal."

All fields mapped with white light had a concentric arrangement sililar to that of the cat retinal ganglion cells, with a sharply demarcated 'on' centre surrounded by an antagonistic 'off' periphery, or the reverse. The smallest receptive field centres were found near the fovea, and the size of centres tended to increase with increasing distance from the fovea. The smallest centre had a diameter of 4 minutes of arc (corresponding to about 20 microns on the retina) and was located 4 degrees from the fovea; the largest centre had a diameter of 2 degrees. Three ganglion cells out of about 100 responded in a specific way to coloured stimuli. In these cells light of short wave-length produced an 'on' response and light of long wave-length evoked inhibition followed by an 'off' response. Transition between the two types of response occurred at about 500 millimicrons, light of this wave-length evoked only feebel 'off' responses. Very weak responses were obtained to white light, presumably owing to the antagonism between light of short and long wavelengths. (Author)"

                "text": "THE DISCHARGES carried in the optic nerve fibers contain all the information which the central nervous system receives from the retina. A correct interpretation of discharge patterns therefore constitutes an important step in the analysis of visual events. Further, investigations of nervous activity arising in the eye reveal many aspects of the functional organization of the neural elements within the retina itself. Following studies of discharges in the optic nerve of the eel\u2019s eye by Adrian and Matthews (2,3), Hartline and his colleagues described the discharge pattern in the eye of the Limulus in a series of important and lucid papers (for a summary see 20). In the Limulus the relationship between the stimulus to the primary receptor cell and the nerve discharges proved relatively simple, apparently because the connection between sense cell and nerve fiber was a direct one. Thus, when stimulation is confined to one receptor the discharge in a single Limulus nerve fiber will provide a good indication of excitatory events which take place as a result of photochemical processes. Discharges last for the duration of illumination and their frequency is a measure of stimulus strength. Lately, however, it was shown by Hartline et al. (22) that inhibitory interactions may be revealed when several receptors are excited. On the whole, the Limulus preparation shows many features which are similar to other simple sense organs, for instance, stretch receptors. In the latter, however, instead of photochemical events, stretch-deformation acts as the adequate stimulus on sensory terminals and is translated into a characteristic discharge pattern. The discharge from the cold-blooded vertebrate retina (mainly frogs) proved much more complex. Hartline found three main types when recording from single optic nerve fibers: (i) \u201con\u201d discharges, similar to those in the Limulus, firing for the duration of the light stimulus, (ii) \u201coff\u201d discharges appearing when a light stimulus was withdrawn, and (iii) \u2018con-off\u201d discharges, a combination of the former two, with activity confined mainly to onset and cessation of illumination. The mammalian discharge patterns were studied in a number of species by Granit and his co-workers in the course of their extensive work on the physiology of the visual system (summaries in 13, 15). On the whole, they did not observe any fundamental differences between frog and mammalian discharge types (see later)."

Our principal result concerns the determination of the average number of interparticle contacts in a randomly packed aggregate of monodisperse hard spheres. We indicate how this number can be determined, in principle, from the analysis of large angle scattering of radiation. We discuss the bearing of our result on the Debye ``random scatterers'' and the study of models of random close packing of spheres. We give a brief list of possible applications and open problems suggested by this field."
