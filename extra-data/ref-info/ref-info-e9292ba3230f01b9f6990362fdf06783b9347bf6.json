Much of the framework for hidden understanding models derives from statistical models used in speech recognition, especially the use of hidden Markov models. These techniques are applied to the central problem of determining meaning directly from a sequence of spoken or written words. We present an overall description of the hidden understanding methodology, and discuss some of the critical implementation issues. Finally, we report on experimental results, including results of the December 1993 ARPA evaluation."

This paper reports our experiments in predicting parts of speech of highly ambiguous words, predicting the intended interpretation of an utterance when more than one interpretation satisfies all known syntactic and semantic constraints, and learning caseframe informationfor verbsfrom example uses.From these experiments, we are convinced that probabilistic models based on annotated corpora can effectively reduce the ambiguity in processing text and can be used to acquire lexical informationfrom a corpus, by supplementing knowledge-based techniques.Based on the results of those experiments, we have constructed a new natural language system (PLUM) for extracting data from text, e.g., newswire text."

The proof of our contention now follows by letting plo, . . . , 10~0 in the above argument be a distribution for which channel capacity is attained. It should be remarked that this proof provides (via the Simplex Method of linear programming) a means for reducing any transmitter with more than r symbols, to another, equally good or better, with at most T symbols.

The FASTUS system was originally developed for participation in the MUC-4 evaluation [3] in 1992, and the performance of FASTUS in MUC-4 helped demonstrate the viability of finite state technologies in constrained natural-language understanding tasks. The system has undergone significant revision since MUC-4, and it is safe to say that the current system does not share a single line of code with the original. The fundamental ideas behind FASTUS, however, are retained in the current system: an architecture consisting of cascaded finite state transducers, each providing an additional level of analysis of the input, together with merging of the final results."
