Descriptions of texture are formalized from natural language descriptions; local descriptors are obtained from the directional and nondirectional components of the Fourier transform power spectrum. Analytic expressions are obtained for orientation, contrast, size, spacing, and in periodic cases, the locations of the choice of sizes is made by a simple higher-level program. The process of region growing is represented by a sheaf-theoretical model which formalizes the operation of pasting local structure (over a window) into global structure (over a region). Programs were implemented which form regions of similar color and similar texture with respect to the local descriptors."

The results showed that changes in shape or orientation which leave the component lines of the figures vertical and horizontal do not facilitate grouping as readily as changes which alter the direction of the component lines to 45\u00b0 and 135\u00b0. These results corroborate and extend the findings of Beck (l966a, 1966b) and are discussed in relation to the problem of specifying the properties of line figures that produce grouping by similarity."
