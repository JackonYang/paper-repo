Tables, as a specific document component, are ubiquitous everywhere. Accurately detecting the table boundary plays a crucial role for the later table structure decomposition and table data collection. In this paper, we propose an easy but effective table boundary detection method. Our method has two unique advantages comparing with other works in this field: 1) Because most tables are text-based, we claim that the text object of PDF itself is good enough for table detection. In addition, we believe that the font information is not so reliable as other works stated. 2) Based on the nature of the table cells, we notice the sparse-line property of table rows. By filtering out the non-sparse lines initially, the table boundary detection problem can be simplified into the sparse line analysis problem easily. The experimental results not only confirm the importance of the coordinate information, but also demonstrate the effectiveness of sparse lines in the table boundary detection. Combining with other keywords, our method is even applicable to detect other document components (e.g., mathematical formula or the references)."

However, often, the most important information being reported in an article is presented in tabular form in a digital document. If the data reported in tables can be extracted and stored in a database, the data can be queried and joined with other data using database management systems. In order to prepare the data source for table search, accurately detecting the table boundary plays a crucial role for the later table structure decomposition. Table boundary detection and content extraction is a challenging problem because tabular formats are not standardized across all documents. In this paper, we propose a simple but effective preprocessing method to improve the table boundary detection performance by considering the sparse-line property of table rows. Our method easily simplifies the table boundary detection problem into the sparse line analysis problem with much less noise. We design eight line label types and apply two machine learning techniques, Conditional Random Field (CRF) and Support Vector Machines (SVM), on the table boundary detection field. The experimental results not only compare the performances between the machine learning methods and the heuristics-based method, but also demonstrate the effectiveness of the sparse line analysis in the table boundary detection."

Researchers have worked from decades on this topic, as witnessed by the scientific literature. The main purpose of the present report is to describe the current status of DIU with particular attention to two subprocesses: document skew angle estimation and page decomposition. Several algorithms proposed in the literature are synthetically described. They are included in a novel classification scheme. Some methods proposed for the evaluation of page decomposition algorithms are described. Critical discussions are reported about the current status of the field and about the open problems. Some considerations about the logical layout analysis are also reported."

Table understanding on the web has many potential applications including web mining, knowledge management, and web content summarization and delivery to narrow-bandwidth devices. Although in HTML documents tables are generally marked as ?table? elements, a ?table? element does not necessarily indicate the presence of a genuine relational table. Thus the important first step in table understanding in the web domain is the detection of the genuine tables. In our earlier work we designed a basic rule-based algorithm to detect genuine tables in major news and corporate home pages as part of a web content filtering system. In this paper we investigate a machine learning based approach that is trainable and thus can be automatically generalized to including any domain. Various features reflecting the layout as well as content characteristics of tables are explored. The system is tested on a large database which consists of 1, 393 HTML files collected from hundreds of different web sites from various domains and contains over 10,000 leaf ?table? elements. Experiments were conducted using the cross validation method. The machine learning based approach outperformed the rule-based system and achieved an F-measure of 95.88%."

A generic model is designed to support the different stages of tabular composition, including the editing of logical structure, the specification of layout structure, and the formatting of concrete tables. The model separates table's logical structure from its layout structure, which consists of tabular topology and typographic style. The notion of an abstract table, which describes the logical relationships among tabular items, is formally defined and a set of logical operations is proposed to manipulate tables based on these logical relationships. An abstract table can be visualized through a layout structure specified by a set of topological rules, which determine the relative placement of tabular items in two dimensions, and a set of style rules, which determine the final appearance of different items. The absolute placement of a concrete table can be automatically generated by applying a layout specification to an abstract line. An NP-complete problem arises in the formatting process that uses automatic line breaking and determines the physical dimension of a table to satisfy user-specified size constraints. An algorithm has been designed to solve the formatting problem in polynomial time for typical tables. Based on the tabular model, a prototype tabular composition system has been implemented in a UNIX, X Windows environment. This prototype provides an interactive interface to edit the logical structure, the topology and the styles of tables. It allows us to manipulate tables based on the logical relationships tabular items, regardless of where the items are placed in the layout structure, and capable of presenting a table in different topologies and styles so that we can select a high-quality layout structure."
