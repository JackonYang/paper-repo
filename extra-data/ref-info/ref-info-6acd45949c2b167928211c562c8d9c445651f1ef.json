The contingency table contains data acquired for patients in the same diagnostic category as the intended application area of the expert system. The knowledge base of the expert system is created by combining expert knowledge and a statistical model search in a model conversion scheme based on a theory developed by Lauritzen & Spiegelhalter and using exact tests as suggested by Kreiner.

We consider both Bayes factor and significance testing techniques for such a prior/data comparison, both in nonsequential and sequential forms. The common basis as alternative standardizations of the logarithm of the predictive ordinate of the observed data is emphasised, and a Bayesian discrepancy statistic with a variety of interpretations provides a formal means of discounting the..."

By exploiting the graphical structure, the updating can be performed locally, either approximately or exactly, and the setup makes it possible to take advantage of a range of well-established statistical techniques.

This paper outlines an implementation the HUGIN shell - for handling a domain model expressed by a causal probabilistic network. The only topological restriction imposed on the network is that, it must not contain any directed loops. The approach is illustrated step by step by solving a genetic breeding problem. A graph representation of the domain model is interactively created by using instances of the basic network components-- nodes and arcs--as building blocks. This structure, together with the quantitative relations between nodes and their immediate causes expressed as conditional probabilities, are automatically transformed into a tree structure, a junction tree. Here a computationally efficient and conceptually simple algebra of Bayesian belief universes supports incorporation of new evidence, propagation of information, and calculation of revised beliefs in the states of the nodes in the network. Finally, as an exam ple of a real world application, MUNIN an expert system for electromyography is discussed."

The models assume that the conditional distribution of the quantitative variables, given the qualitative, is multivariate Gaussian. The computational architecture is set up by forming a tree of belief universes, and the calculations are then performed by local message passing between universes. The asymmetry between the quantitative and qualitative variables sets some additional limitations for the specification and propagation structure. Approximate methods when these are not appropriately fulfilled are sketched. It has earlier been shown how to exploit the local structure in the specification of a discrete probability model for fast and efficient computation, thereby paving the way for exploiting probability-based models as parts of realistic systems for planning and decision support.

                "text": "I address practical issues concerning the construction of normative expert systems--expert systems that encode knowledge within a decision-theoretic framework. In particular, I examine the similarity network and partition, two extensions to the influence diagram. A similarity network is a tool for building an influence diagram, whereas a partition is a tool for assessing the probabilities associated with an influence diagram. Both representations encode asymmetric forms of conditional independence that are not represented conveniently in an ordinary influence diagram. Similarity networks and partitions exploit these forms of conditional independence to facilitate the construction and assessment of influence diagrams for problems of diagnosis. \nThe representations aided considerably the construction of Pathfinder, a large normative expert system for the diagnosis of lymph-node diseases (the domain contains approximately 60 diseases and 110 disease findings). In an early version of the system, I encoded the knowledge of the expert using an erroneous assumption that all disease findings were conditionally independent, given each disease. When the expert and I attempted to build an influence diagram for the domain to capture the dependencies among the disease findings, we failed. Using a similarity network, however, we were able to construct the influence diagram for the entire domain in approximately 40 hours. Furthermore, using the partition representation, the expert was able to decrease the time required to assess a probability--on average--by almost one order of magnitude. Most important, through a comparison procedure based in decision theory, I found that the improvements in diagnostic accuracy afforded by the more sophisticated model of the domain were well worth the additional effort that we had invested to build the revised version of the system. \nIn this work, I examine in detail the theoretical properties of similarity networks and partitions, and discuss the application of these representations to the construction of Pathfinder. This research suggests strongly that, by identifying specific forms of conditional independence, and by developing representations that exploit these forms of independence for knowledge acquisition, knowledge engineers can construct normative expert systems for domains of larger scope and greater complexity than the domains previously through to be amenable to the decision-theoretic approach."

The domain is modeled in a CPN by use of a directed graph where the nodes represent concepts in the domain and the arcs represent causal relations. Furthermore, the quantitative relation between a node and its immediate causes is expressed as conditional probabilities. During the last few years, several schemes based on probability theory for incorporating and propagating new information throughout a CPN has emerged. As long as the domain can be modeled by use of a singly connected CPN (i. e., no more than one path between any pair of nodes), the schemes operate directly in the CPN and perform conceptually simple operations in this structure. When it comes to more complicated structures such as multiply connected CPNs (i. e., more than one path is allowed between pairs of nodes), the schemes operate in derived structures where the embedded domain knowledge no longer is as explicit and transparent as in the CPN. Furthermore, the simplicity in the operations is lost also. This report outlines a scheme-the algebra of Bayesian belief universes-for absorbing and propagating evidence in multiply connected CPNs. The scheme provides a secondary structure, a junction tree, and a simple set of algebraic operations between objects in this structure, Collect Evidence and Distribute Evidence. These are the basic tools for making inference in a CPN domain model and yield a calculus as simple as in the case of singly connected CPNs."

This paper discusses properties of the EM algorithm in such contexts, concentrating on rates of conver- gence, and presents an alternative that is usually more practical and converges at least as quickly. The EM algorithm is a general approach to maximum likelihood estimation, rather than a specific algorithm. Dempster et al. (1977) discussed the method and derived basic properties, demonstrating that a variety of procedures previously developed rather informally could be unified. The common strand to problems where the approach is applicable is a notion of 'incomplete data'; this includes the conventional sense of 'missing data' but is much broader than that. The EM algorithm demon- strates its strength in situations where some hypothetical experiment yields data from which estimation is particularly convenient and economical: the 'incomplete' data actually at hand are regarded as observable functions of these 'complete' data. The resulting algorithms, while usually slow to converge, are often extremely simple and remain practical in large problems where no other approaches may be feasible. Dempster et al. (1977) briefly refer to the use of the same approach to the problem of finding the posterior mode (maximum a posteriori estimate) in a Bayesian estima-"

Both technologies are designed to improve human decision making; they attempt to do this by formalizing human expert knowledge so that it is amenable to mechanized reasoning. However, the technologies are based on rather different principles. Decision analysis is the application of the principles of decision theory supplemented with insights from the psychology of judgment. Expert systems, at least as we use this term here, involve the application of various logical and computational techniques of AI to the representation of human knowledge for automated inference. AI and decision theory both emerged from research on systematic methods for problem solving and decision making that first blossomed in the 1940s. They even share a common progenitor, John von Neumann, who was a coauthor with Oscar Morgenstern of the best-known formulation of decision theory as well a key player in the development"

A network of this sort can be used to represent the generic knowledge of a domain expert, and it turns into a computational architecture if the links are used not merely for storing factual knowledge but also for directing and activating the data flow in the computations which manipulate this knowledge. The first part of the paper deals with the task of fusing and propagating the impacts of new information through the networks in such a way that, when equilibrium is reached, each proposition will be assigned a measure of belief consistent with the axioms of probability theory. It is shown that if the network is singly connected (e.g. tree-structured), then probabilities can be updated by local propagation in an isomorphic network of parallel and autonomous processors and that the impact of new information can be imparted to all propositions in time proportional to the longest path in the network. The second part of the paper deals with the problem of finding a tree-structured representation for a collection of probabilistically coupled propositions using auxiliary (dummy) variables, colloquially called \"hidden causes.\" It is shown that if such a tree-structured representation exists, then it is possible to uniquely uncover the topology of the tree by observing pairwise dependencies among the available propositions (i.e., the leaves of the tree). The entire tree structure, including the strengths of all internal relationships, can be reconstructed in time proportional to n log n, where n is the number of leaves."

It is outlined how causal probabilistic networks (CPNs) together with strict and efficient Bayesian methods can be used for modeling contexts and for interpretation of findings. For illustration purposes a 2-agent system consisting of an interpreter using a CPN and a findings catcher using an image processor is designed. It is argued that the architecture should be a system of agents with instincts, each of them acting to improve their own situation. Going through an interpretation session, it is shown how the Bayesian paradigm very neatly supports the agents-with-instincts control paradigm such that the system through private benefit maximizing in an efficient way reaches its goal."

The first of these is a subclass of hierarchical log linear models. Each of its models can be represented by an undirected graph. In the second class each model corresponds to a particular kind of a directed graph instead and can be characterized by a nontrivial factorization of the joint distribution in terms of response variables. We derive decomposable or multiplicative models as the intersecting class. This result has useful consequences for exploratory types of analysis as well as for the model interpretation: we can give an aid for detecting well-fitting decomposable models in a transformation of the observed contingency table and each decomposable model may be interpreted with the help of an undirected or directed graph."

High-quality decompositions are essential for performing efficient inference in probabilistic networks. Optimum decomposition of probabilistic networks is known to be NP-hard (Wen, 1990). The paper proves that cost-function changes can be computed locally, which is essential to the efficiency of the annealing algorithm. Pragmatic control schedules which reduce the running time of the annealing algorithm are presented and evaluated. Apart from the conventional temperature parameter, these schedules involve the radius of the search space as a new control parameter. The evaluation suggests that the inclusion of this new parameter is important for the success of the annealing algorithm for the present problem."

It is based on two rules: first, that if a model is accepted, then all models that include it are considered to be accepted, and secondly, that if a model is rejected, then all its submodels are considered to be rejected. Two versions are described, one for the class of graphical models, and the other for the class of hierarchical log linear models. Application of both versions to a six-dimensional table is illustrated. The procedure can be regarded as an alternative to fitting all possible models, made computationally feasible by application of the two rules. It is a generalization of the procedure proposed by Havr'anek (1984), but is in many cases considerably faster."

Moreover, the U.S. National Weather Service (NWS) initiated a nationwide program in 1965 in which precipitation probability forecasts were formulated on an operational basis and routinely disseminated to the general public. In addition, the NWS now prepares objective probability forecasts for many variables, using statistical procedures. Hence probability forecasting in meteorology is unique in that very large sets of probability forecasts that have been subjected to detailed evaluation are available. This article has four objectives: (a) to review the history of probability forecasting in meteorology to acquaint statisticians with this body of literature; (b) to describe recent methodological, experimental, and operational activities in this field; (c) to exa..."

Next, we describe a propagation scheme for computing marginals of a valuation when we have a factorization of the valuation on a hypertree.

Pixel gray levels and the presence and orientation of edges are viewed as states of atoms or molecules in a lattice-like physical system. The assignment of an energy function in the physical system determines its Gibbs distribution. Because of the Gibbs distribution, Markov random field (MRF) equivalence, this assignment also determines an MRF image model. The energy function is a more convenient and natural mechanism for embodying picture attributes than are the local characteristics of the MRF. For a range of degradation mechanisms, including blurring, nonlinear deformations, and multiplicative or additive noise, the posterior distribution is an MRF with a structure akin to the image model. By the analogy, the posterior distribution defines another (imaginary) physical system. Gradual temperature reduction in the physical system isolates low energy states (``annealing''), or what is the same thing, the most probable states under the Gibbs distribution. The analogous operation under the posterior distribution yields the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the image given the degraded observations. The result is a highly parallel ``relaxation'' algorithm for MAP estimation. We establish convergence properties of the algorithm and we experiment with some simple pictures, for which good restorations are obtained at low signal-to-noise ratios."

It is closely related to the all possible models approach but is considerably faster. It is based on two principles: first, if a model is accepted, then all models that include it are considered to be accepted; second, if a model is rejected, then all of its submodels are considered to be rejected. Application of the procedure to variable selection in multiple regression is illustrated. General algorithms are described that enable the procedure to be applied to any family of models that forms a lattice. As an example, a problem in multiple comparisons is considered."

As Wermuth and Lauritzen (1983) were exploring the relationship between undirected and directed graphs, Pearl (1982) and Kim and Pearl (1983) were introducing simple computational schemes that showed probabilistic reasoning was quite feasible when the computations were governed by the conditional independencies expressed by particular simple directed graphical structures."

A measure of conflict is defined, and it is used in the medical diagnostic system MUNIN. Finally it is discussed how to dis\u00ad tinguish between conflicting data and a rare case. quacy of the model and the reliability of data used. Therefore, no expert will blindly accept what the system comes up with. At least there will be kept a critical eye on the data, and mainly one will look for conflicts in the data or conflicts with the model. In this paper we present a way of building such a critical eye into a system with a CPN model. Our suggestion requires an easy way of calculating probabilities for specific configurations. We start with a brief introduction to the HUGIN approach. In section 3 we discuss CPN's and data conflict. In section 4 a measure of conflict is defined, and it is shown that this measure is easy to calculate in HUGIN and that it supports a decomposition of global conflict into local conflicts .. Section 5 reports on experience with a large CPN, and in section 6 we discuss how to distinguish between conflicts in data and data originating from a rare case."

It differs from most other programs for computer-assisted diagnosis in the generality of its approach and the size and diversity of its knowledge base. To document the strengths and weaknesses of the program we performed a systematic evaluation of the capabilities of INTERNIST-I. Its performance on a series of 19 clinicopathological exercises (Case Records of the Massachusetts General Hospital) published in the Journal appeared qualitatively similar to that of the hospital clinicians but inferior to that of the case discussants. The evaluation demonstrated that the present form of the program is not sufficiently reliable for clinical applications. Specific deficiencies that must be overcome include the program\u2019s inability to reason anatomically or temporally, its inability to construct differential diagnoses spanning multiple problem areas, its occasional attribution of findings to improper causes, and its inability to explain its \u201cthinking.\u201d (N Engl J Med. 1982; 307:468\u201376."

On the other hand, a rogue anti-matter asteroid may be on a collision course with Earth, and \" boom, \" the Earth disintegrates tonight; ergo, no sunrise tomorrow. In the first case, the probability that the Sun will rise tomorrow is so high that it might as well be a fact. In the latter case, the Earth being annihilated, never to revolve again, is so vanishingly small, that it might as well be impossible. The range between what we consider to be fact and what we consider to be impossible constitutes, in human terms, \" the realm of probability. \" It also marks the full range of our uncertainty or the unknown. Any new knowledge we acquire is necessarily a direct function of how well we can characterize this realm. Bayes' Theorem is uniquely designed to do this. Bayesian probability theory can be seen as formalizing the mechanics of human reasoning on uncertain issues. i Bayesian probability theory is based on a simple mathematical formula for updating our confidence in the probability of some uncertain hypothesis or phenomenon considering some new or recurrent evidence at hand. Essentially, Bayes' Theorem formalizes the logic that each time we observe the Sun rise we can be a little more confident that it will continue to rise in the same fashion, or in more prosaic terms, \" what goes around comes around. \" Bayes Theorem combines some new evidence associated with a given hypothesis or phenomenon to assess the increase or decrease in the probability of the hypothesis or phenomenon being true. In the case of the Sun rising, Bayes' Theorem might be employed every time the Sun is observed to rise across a given span of time to formalize the likelihood of the Sun rising again the following day. The more times it is seen to rise, the more likely it will continue to rise. Bayes' Theorem can be applied in either direction along a continuum by the same line of reasoning that every day the Sun rises increases the likelihood that it rose the day before we started checking on it. It can also be applied at various scales to establish a more comprehensive view. We can determine, after only a few hours of \u2026"

It is argued that our criterion is easy to use, it is sharper than that given by Kiiveri, Speed, and Carlin and equivalent to that of Pearl. It follows that our criterion cannot be sharpened."

Performance in diagnosis and decision making was compared over two periods: a test period (when a small computer system was provided to aid diagnosis) and a baseline period (before the system was installed). The two periods were well matched for type of case and rate of accrual. The system proved reliable and was used in 75.1% of possible cases. User reaction was broadly favourable. During the test period improvements were noted in diagnosis, decision making, and patient outcome. Initial diagnostic accuracy rose from 45.6% to 65.3%. The negative laparotomy rate fell by almost half, as did the perforation rate among patients with appendicitis (from 23.7% to 11.5%). The bad management error rate fell from 0.9% to 0.2%, and the observed mortality fell by 22.0%. The savings made were estimated as amounting to 278 laparotomies and 8,516 bed nights during the trial period--equivalent throughout the National Health Service to annual savings in resources worth over 20m pounds and direct cost savings of over 5m pounds. Computer aided diagnosis is a useful system for improving diagnosis and encouraging better clinical practice."

We used a different approach, which requires the surgeon to categorise patients into management pathways at the time ofadmission (definitely needs operation, definitely does not require operation, uncertain). Laparoscopy was done in the uncertain group. We consider that this management approach to acute abdominal pain is more appropriate than a system based on diagnostic accuracy. We emphasise the point made by the authors that improved results during the study period are due not to the use of a computer but to accurate collection ofinformation and feedback of results to the doctors concerned. Improvement in this important area stems from interest, analysis, and feedback. Computers are one way of achieving this, rigorous analysis of decision making is another. We prefer the latter."

                "text": "OBJECTIVE--To develop, test, and validate an algorithm for diagnosing disease in neonates during an over the telephone referral to a specialist cardiac centre. DESIGN--A draft algorithm requiring only data available to a referring paediatrician was generated. This was modified in the light of a retrospective review of case records. A questionnaire to elicit all the data required by the algorithm was then generated. There followed a prospective three phase evaluation during consecutive over the telephone referrals. This consisted of (a) a conventional phase with unstructured referral consultations, (b) a phase with referrals structured around the questionnaire but independent of the algorithm, and (c) a validation phase with the algorithm (and its previous errors) available during the referral consultation. SETTING--59 paediatric centres in south east England and a central specialist paediatric cardiology unit. PATIENTS--Consecutive neonates (aged less than 31 days) referred with suspected heart disease. The retrospective review was of records of 174 neonates from 1979. In the prospective evaluation (1987-90) the conventional phase comprised 71 neonates (over 5.5 months), the structured phase 203 neonates (over 14 months), and the validation phase 195 neonates (over 12 months). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Diagnostic accuracy (assigning patients to the correct diagnostic category (out of 27)), of the referring paediatrician, the specialist after the referral consultation, and the algorithm as compared with the definitive diagnosis by echocardiography at the specialist centre, and score for the appropriateness of management in transit. RESULTS--Simply structuring the consultation by questionnaire (that is, proceeding from the conventional phase to the structured phase) improved the diagnostic accuracy of both paediatricians (from 34% (24/71 cases) to 48% (97/203) correct) and specialists (from 54% (38/71 cases) to 64% (130/203) correct). The algorithm (structured phase) would have been even more accurate (78% (158/203 cases); p less than 0.01). Management scores in the structured phase were also better than in the conventional phase (80%(162/203 cases)v 58% (41/71) appropriate; p less than 0.01). Management scores would have improved to 91% appropriate (185/203; p less than 0.001) had the algorithmic diagnoses dictated management. The superiority of the algorithm was maintained but not bettered in the validation phase. CONCLUSIONS--Applying the algorithm should reduce the morbidity and mortality of neonates with critical heart disease by aiding clinicians in therapeutic decisions for in transit care."

The method has been applied in quite a variety of cases. It seems desirable now to make a restatement of the theory and to review the types of application, especially as there has been a certain amount of misunderstanding both of purpose and of procedure."

The reel is mounted in a casing which receives the tee when the spring rotates the reel to wind the spring onto it. The reel is normally locked by a one-way ratchet but is released to wind in the string by a push-button which has a spike and is detachable from the casing so as to be usable as a ball marker. When practising, the cord can be aligned with the green or hole and used as an aid in swinging the club face in the correct direction. The casing has a spring-clip so that the article can be clipped into the golfer's pocker when he is not using it."

For example, it is quite feasible for the total precision a to decrease on receipt of certain incomplete evidence: this seems quite reasonable. However, they also show that with systematic missing data on intermediate nodes such as in the CHILD network, the estimation procedure may be inconsistent and strongly reliant on the prior distribution. Therefore considerable care is required when specifying priors for nodes that are not observed, and it may be preferable to marginalise over nodes that are not to be observed and learn on this collapsed graph. Olesen, Lauritzen and Jensen (1992) report similar experiments, adding the feature that precision is gradually decreased so as to put less weight on early cases."

Such a probabilistic system needs to be based on considering the true disease and possible clinical findings as a set of random variables and requires the specification of a full joint distribution over these variables to represent clinical understanding of the disease process. It is tasks of this nature that have been considered challenging to constructors of expert systems. The framework of a graphical model allows experts to concentrate on building up the qualitative structure of a problem, before even beginning to address issues of quantitative specification. As emphasised by Pearl (1988), such models are intended to encode natural judgements of relevance and irrelevance and can be formed prior to any probabilistic considerations."
