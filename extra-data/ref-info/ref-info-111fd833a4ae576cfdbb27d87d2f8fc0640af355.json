The authors show how one of the most salient features of problem solving, sequentiality, can emerge naturally within a parallel model that has no explicit knowledge of how to sequence analysis. This model exploits a new type of parallel distributed processing that employs stochastic processors and is based on a formal mapping between parallel computation and thermal physics. The mathematical theory is this type of processing-harmony theory-is discussed in the second and third papers. (Author)"

An algorithm is given for simulating this computation once schemas encoding the modules of the environment have been selected. The concept of computational temperature is introduced. As this temperature is lowered, the system appears to display a dramatic tendency to coherently interpret input, even if the evidence for any particular interpretation is very weak. (Author)"

These tasks are called associative reinforcement learning tasks. An algorithm is presented, called the associative reward-penalty, or AR-P algorithm for which a form of optimal performance is proved. This algorithm simultaneously generalizes a class of stochastic learning automata and a class of supervised learning pattern-classification methods related to the Robbins-Monro stochastic approximation procedure. The relevance of this hybrid algorithm is discussed with respect to the collective behaviour of learning automata and the behaviour of networks of pattern-classifying adaptive elements. Simulation results are presented that illustrate the associative reinforcement learning task and the performance of the AR-P algorithm as compared with that of several existing algorithms."

Examples of analogical manipulation of knowledge schemata are presented from several domains, including turtle geometry, kinship terms, and the learning of a computer text editor. The view presented in this paper has a number of implications for instruction and for performance. In particular, the learner or user of a system should be presented with a conceptual model that has the following properties: (a) It is based on a domain with which the student is already knowledgeable and for which the student can reason readily; (b) The target and source domains should differ by a minimum number of spcifiable dimensions; (c) Operations that are natural in one domain should also be natural within the other domain; (d) Operations inappropriate within the target domain should be also by inappropriate within the source domain."

In the approach presented here, however, each network component, or adaptive element, is a self-interested agent that prefers some inputs over others and \"works\" toward obtaining the most highly preferred inputs. Here we describe an adaptive element that is robust enough to learn to cooperate with other elements like itself in order to further its self-interests. It is argued that some of the longstanding problems concerning adaptation and learning by networks might be solvable by this form of cooperativity, and computer simulation experiments are described that show how networks of self-interested components that are sufficiently robust can solve rather difficult learning problems. We then place the approach in its proper historical and theoretical perspective through comparison with a number of related algorithms. A secondary aim of this article is to suggest that beyond what is explicitly illustrated here, there is a wealth of ideas from game theory and allied disciplines such as mathematical economics that can be of use in thinking about cooperative computation in both nervous systems and man-made systems."

                "text": "The differentiation of figure from ground plays an important role in the perceptual organization of visual stimuli. The rapidity with which we can discriminate the inside from the outside of a figure suggests that at least this step in the process may be performed in visual cortex by a large number of neurons in several different areas working together in parallel. We have attempted to simulate this collective computation by designing a network of simple processing units that receives two types of information: bottom-up input from the image containing the outlines of a figure, which may be incomplete, and a top-down attentional input that biases one part of the image to be the inside of the figure. No presegmentation of the image was assumed. Two methods for performing the computation were explored: gradient descent, which seeks locally optimal states, and simulated annealing, which attempts to find globally optimal states by introducing noise into the computation. For complete outlines, gradient descent was faster, but the range of input parameters leading to successful performance was very narrow. In contrast, simulated annealing was more robust: it worked over a wider range of attention parameters and a wider range of outlines, including incomplete ones. Our network model is too simplified to serve as a model of human performance, but it does demonstrate that one global property of outlines can be computed through local interactions in a parallel network. Some features of the model, such as the role of noise in escaping from nonglobal optima, may generalize to more realistic models."

The second paper, 'A Psychologist Views Human Processing: Human Errors and other Phenomena Suggest Processing Mechanisms' discusses the differences between conventional digital processing structures (the Von Neumann machine) and the mechanism of the human. The third paper, 'Steps toward a Cognitive Engineering,' shows how analysis of error can lead to design principles. The fourth paper, 'The Trouble with UNIX,' is an informal critique of the UNIX operating systems. The final paper, 'The Trouble with Networks,' describes some of the computer interactions that resulted from the distribution of the fourth paper. (Author)"

In the previous part we developed the basic form of the model and showed how it accounts for several of the fundamental phenomena of work perception. In this part, we first present a number of new experiments and show how the model accounts for these experiments. Then we propose a number of extensions of the model to such cases as spoken input, pronunciation tasks, and words embedded in sentential context. Finally, we discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the model, pointing out further possible extensions of the model to account for aspects of word perception currently ignored. The new experiments all revolve around what we call the 'context enhancement effect.' These experiments are designed to assess the roles of direct and indirect evidence concerning the identity of a letter in an input string."

The major focus of the research effort was devoted to the study of human error, especially those made by highly skilled operators in complex, high-demand systems.

The summed response of these neurons comes to match the whole time-amplitude profile of nictitating membrane movement, whereas some individual neurons respond only to part of this profile.

The activity of some of these units is known to be governed by the configuration of a small set of discrete landmarks. In order to respond in this fashion, these neurons must, in effect, be able to recognize particular locations. A model of this recognition process is described which is able to make quantitative predictions about how the response of these place-field units varies as properties of the environmental landmarks are manipulated. Computer simulations of the model show that it is consistent with the available quantitative data. These simulations also predict large, characteristic changes in place-field location and size with manipulations of the environmental landmarks. Comparison of this kind of prediction with actual experiments will serve as a test of the validity of the model."

                "text": "The study of typing comprises a fascinating mixture of elements from motor skills, typewriter mechanics, anatomy, and cognitive control structures. Our research group initially started to study typing because it seemed an ideal example of highly skilled performance, with readily available experimental subjects and, with the advent of computer-controlled keyboards, a possibility of collecting large amounts of response time data. We expected the topic to be interesting, but were unprepared for the complexity of the phenomenon. Typing brings together many different functions, some of them heretofore ignored in cognitive psychology, yet that are of critical importance in understanding human performance. In particular, some of the problems of typing force us to confront issues of the control structures involved in highly skilled parallel-output performance, as well as questions relating to the representation of skilled motor acts within the human memory and motor control systems, all of which apply to a much more general range of concerns than typing."

The model is based upon an Activation-Trigger-Schema system in which a hierarchical structure of schemata directs the selection of the letters to be typed and, then, controls the hand and finger movements by a cooperative, relaxation algorithm. The interactions of the patterns of activation and inhibition among the schemata determine the temporal ordering for launching the keystrokes. To account for the phenomena of doubling errors, the model has only \u201ctype\u201d schemata\u2014no \u201ctoken\u201d schemata\u2014with only a weak binding between the special schema that signals a doubling, and its argument. The model exists as a working computer simulation and produces an output display of the hands and fingers moving over the keyboard. It reproduces some of the major phenomena of typing, including the interkeystroke interval times, the pattern of transposition errors found in skilled typists, and doubling errors. Although the model is clearly inadequate or wrong in some of its features and assumptions, it serves as a useful first approximation for the understanding of skilled typing."

According to the model context aids the perception of target letters as they are processed in the perceptual system. The implication that the duration and timing of the context in which a letter occurs should greatly influence the perceptibility of the target is confirmed by a series of experiments demonstrating that early or enhanced presentations of word and pronounceablepseudoword contexts greatly increase the perceptibility of target letters. Also according to the model, letters in strings that share several letters with words should be equally perceptible whether they are orthographically regular and pronounceable (SLET) or irregular (SLNT) and should be much more perceptible than letters in contexts that share few letters with any word (XLQJ). This prediction is tested and confirmed. The basic results of all the experiments are accounted for, with some modification of parameters, although there are some discrepancies in detail. Several recent findings that seem to challenge the model are considered and a number of extensions are proposed."

Professional typists spend about a year learning to type and accumulate thousands of hours of practice during their working lives. I studied 18 typists, ranging from beginning students in a typing class (about 1 keystroke/second) to expert professional typists (about 20 keystrokes/second). All typists became faster with practice, but the rate and amount of improvement varied for different classes of keystroke sequences, and the pattern of keystroke times displayed qualitative changes with the development of typewriting skill. For example, double letters, such as dd, were the fastest keystroke sequences for student typists, but they were among the slowest sequences for professional typists. In addition, the relative variability of the interstroke intervals decreased with learning. The most striking changes were for one-finger non-doubles, such as de, which were the most variable intervals for beginners and the lest variable intervals for experts. Finally, the correlation between successive interstroke intervals for some letter sequences became more negative with learning. (Author)"

In this article we seek a cognitive account of both the advantages and disadvantages of direct manipulation interfaces. We identify two underlying phenomena that give rise to the feeling of directness. One deals with the information processing distance between the user's intentions and the facilities provided by the machine. Reduction of this distance makes the interface feel direct by reducing the effort required of the user to accomplish goals. The second phenomenon concerns the relation between the input and output vocabularies of the interface language. In particular, direct manipulation requires that the system provide representations of objects that behave as if they are the objects themselves. This provides the feeling of directness of manipulation."

In the first paper, I discuss how the decisions about the design of MENUNIX were made: based on my intuitions and user comments, but also on psychological theory and data whenever available. MENUNIX presents both the programs and files of UNIX in two menus from which users can make selections with single keypresses. The FILE menu presents the UNIX file hierarchy that allows users to organize files into directories by subject (e.g. writing and programming). The PROGRAM menu presents UNIX programs in a hierarchy organized into workbenches according to the tasks for which they are used (e.g. writing and programming) much as files can be organized in directories. Special facilities are provided for: finding out about useful commands; using variables to set options, to save commands, and to avoid typing long strings; and for editing strings (including recent commands). The second paper is a tutorial user manual for MENUNIX, in which the features of the program are more fully explained. (Author)"

The typists showed stable patterns of performance, but with significant individual differences among the typists. Inter-Keypress latencies for 2-finger digraphs (typed by two fingers on the same hand) were particularly variable among typists. Two typists showed large differences in 2-finger digraph latencies, but similar overall typing speeds. Finger movement trajectories, determined from analysis of videotapes of these typists, indicated that the differences in 2-finger digraph latencies correspond to differences in the independence of within-hand finger movements. A high-speed film of one typist showed that finger movements of this typist almost always overlapped. The starting times of movements were six times as variable as the ending times, suggesting that it is the completion rather than the initiation of the movements that is controlled in skilled typing. These studies demonstrate the importance of considering individual differences in constructing a theory of skilled human performance, even in a highly automatized task such as transcription typing.

Differences in overall time to type a given word are attributed to a multiplicative rate parameter, constant for a given typing of the word, but varying from one typing to another. Three major lines of evidence are cited for this model: (a) keystroke times expand or contract proportionally when words are typed slower or faster; (b) in a word; (c) the times to type a given digraph exhibit word-specific differences. My analyses show that (a) keystroke times do not expand proportionally; (b) the apparent constancy of variances is an artifact of the method that Terzuolo and Viviani used to transform the keystroke times; (c) the effects of surrounding character context are sufficient to explain differences in digraph latencies and these effects cross word boundaries, showing that they are not word-specific.

Use of the alphabetic keyboard requires considerable mental processing; the novice is faced with a trade-off between mental processing and visual search, and this makes different keyboard layouts equivalent. Comparison of different keyboard layouts by computer simulation of expert typing shows surprisingly little effect of keyboard arrangement for a wide class of keyboards. Performance with some alphabetical layouts is quite slow, but with others, it is within 2% of the speed achieved when using the Sholes keyboard. Performance with the Dvorak keyboard is only improved by about 5% over performance on the Sholes keyboard. The conclusion is that it is not worthwhile to use alphabetic keyboards for novice typists, nor to change to the Dvorak layout for experts. Keyboards can probably be improved, but only through radical redesign of the present physical key configuration."

One way to view the procedure we have been describing is as a parallel computer that, having been shown the appropriate input/output exemplars specifying some function, programs itself to compute that function in general. Parallel computers are notoriously difficult to program. Here we have a mechanism whereby we do not actually have to know how to write the program in order to get the system to do it. Parker (1985) has emphasized this point."

There have been three basic responses to this lack. One response is represented by competitive learning (Chapter 5) in which simple unsupervised learning rules are employed so that useful hidden units develop. Although these approaches are promising, there is no external force to insure that hidden units appropriate for the required mapping are developed. The second response is to simply asswne an internal representation that, on some a priori grounds, seems reasonable. This is the tack taken in the chapter on verb learning (Chapter 18) and in theinteractive activation model of word perception (McClelland & Rumelhart, 1981; Rumelhart & McClelland, 1982). The third approach is to attempt to develop a learning procedure capable of learning an internal representation adequate for performing the task at hand. One such development is presented in the discussion of Boltzmann machines in Chapter 7. As we have seen, this procedure involves the use of stochastic units, requires the network to reach equilibrium in two different phases, and is limited to symmetric networks. Another recent approach, also employing stochastic units, has been developed by Barto (1985) and various of his colleagues (cf."
