The algorithm used for changing a weight depends on collecting statistics about the behavior of the two units that the weight connects. The success and speed of the algorithm depends on the accuracy of the statistics, the size of the weight changes, and the way in which the accuracy of the machine's model varies as the weights are changed. This paper presents theoretical analysis and empirical results that can be used to select more effective parameters for the learning algorithm. The Boltzmann Machine learns to make its model of its environment correspond to the actual environment in which it is placed. An environment is a probability distribution of patterns over a subset of the units called the visible units. The environment can be specified explicitly as a list of ordered pairs, giving a pattern, V a' over the visible units, and a probability for the occurrence of the pattern. The machine's model is just the probability distribution it would produce over the visible units if it were allowed to run freely without any environmental input. This probability distribution is not stored directly. Instead, it is specified implicitly by the magnitude of the weights in the machine. For a machine architecture with v visible units, there are 2(v) possible patterns. A machine whose weights were all zero would implicitly specify an environment where each of these patterns had probability 2-v, since the energy of all states would be the same."

We wish to treat the outputs of the network as probabilities of alternatives (e.g. pattern classes), conditioned on the inputs. We look for appropriate output non-linearities and for appropriate criteria for adaptation of the parameters of the network (e.g. weights). We explain two modifications: probability scoring, which is an alternative to squared error minimisation, and a normalised exponential (softmax) multi-input generalisation of the logistic non-linearity. The two modifications together result in quite simple arithmetic, and hardware implementation is not difficult either. The use of radial units (squared distance instead of dot product) immediately before the softmax output stage produces a network which computes posterior distributions over class labels based on an assumption of Gaussian within-class distributions. However the training, which uses cross-class information, can result in better performance at class discrimination than the usual within-class training method, unless the within-class distribution assumptions are actually correct."

As a result of the weight adjustments, internal \u2018hidden\u2019 units which are not part of the input or output come to represent important features of the task domain, and the regularities in the task are captured by the interactions of these units. The ability to create useful new features distinguishes back-propagation from earlier, simpler methods such as the perceptron-convergence procedure1."

First we give a concise review of the literature with emphasis on the Baum-Welch algorithm. This is followed by a detailed discussion of three issues not treated in the literature: alternatives to the Baum-Welch algorithm; critical facets of the implementation of the algorithms, with emphasis on their numerical properties; and behavior of Markov models on certain artificial but realistic problems. Special attention is given to a particular class of Markov models, which we call \u201cleft-to-right\u201d models. This class of models is especially appropriate for isolated word recognition. The results of the application of these methods to an isolated word, speaker-independent speech recognition experiment are given in a companion paper."

The nodes correspond to variables which can be constants, uncertain quantities, decisions, or objectives. The arcs reveal the probabilistic dependence of the uncertain quantities and the information available at the time of the decisions. The detailed data about the variables are stored within the nodes, so the diagram graph is compact and focuses attention on the relationships among the variables. Influence diagrams are effective communication tools and recent developments also allow them to be used for analysis. We develop algorithms to address questions of inference within a probabilistic model represented as an influence diagram. We use the conditional independence implied by the diagram's structure to determine the information needed to solve a given problem. When there is enough information we can solve it, exploiting that conditional independence. These same results are applied to problems of decision analysis. This methodology allows the construction of computer tools to maintain and evaluate complex models."
