In particular, our goal is to develop algorithms that can accurately reflect character class ambiguities and that can detect non-character inputs. Two specific hybrid models were developed in this study. We designed, implemented, and successfully demonstrated a hybrid neural network model for character confidence assignment using a cascade of a Kohonen self-organizing feature map (SOFM) and a multi-layer feedforward network (MLFN). The other novel hybrid neural network/fuzzy integral model for character confidence assignment use a cascade of the SOFM and a set of Choquet fuzzy integrals (FI). These new methodologies have resulted in significant improvements in handwritten word recognition performance. Recognition rates of over 90% were achieved using a single word recognizer and an average lexicon size of 100."

The word recognition system requires a module that assigns character class membership values to segments of images of handwritten words. The module must accurately represent ambiguities between character classes and assign low membership values to a wide variety of noncharacter segments resulting from erroneous segmentations. Each hybrid is a cascaded system. The first stage of both is a self-organizing feature map (SOFM). The second stages map distances into membership values. The third stage of one system is a multilayer perceptron (MLP). The third stage of the other is a bank of Choquet fuzzy integrals (FI). The two systems are compared individually and as a combination to the baseline system. The new systems each perform better than the baseline system. The MLP system slightly outperforms the FI system, but the combination of the two outperforms the individual systems with a small increase in computational cost over the MLP system. Recognition rates of over 92% are achieved with a lexicon set having average size of 100. Experiments were performed on a standard test set from the SUNY/USPS CD-ROM database."

Neural networks and fuzzy logic are complementary tools for solving such problems. Neural networks, which are highly nonlinear and highly interconnected for processing imprecise information, can finely approximate complicated decision boundaries. Fuzzy set methods can represent degrees of truth or belonging. Fuzzy logic encodes imprecise knowledge and naturally maintains multiple hypotheses that result from the uncertainty and vagueness inherent in real problems. By combining the complementary strengths of neural and fuzzy approaches into a hybrid system, we can attain an increased recognition capability for solving handwriting recognition problems.

The data were unconstrained for the writer, style, and method of preparation. These characteristics help overcome the limitations of earlier databases that contained only isolated characters or were prepared in a laboratory setting under prescribed circumstances. Also, the database is divided into explicit training and testing sets to facilitate the sharing of results among researchers as well as performance comparisons. >"

Different experimental approaches for incorporating these recognition methods into a more powerful system are also presented. The resulting multiple-expert system proves that the consensus of these methods tends to compensate for individual weaknesses, while preserving individual strengths. It is shown that it is possible to reduce the substitution rate to a desired level while maintaining a fairly high recognition rate in the classification of totally unconstrained handwritten ZIP code numerals. If reliability is of the utmost importance, substitutions can be avoided completely (reliability=100%) while retaining a recognition rate above 90%.

Several component processes of a recognition system for isolated offline cursive script words are described. A word image is transformed through a hierarchy of representation levels: points, contours, features, letters, and words. A unique feature representation is generated bottom-up from the image using statistical dependences between letters and features. Ratings for partially formed words are computed using a stack algorithm and a lexicon represented as a trie. Several novel techniques for low- and intermediate-level processing for cursive script are described, including heuristics for reference line finding, letter segmentation based on detecting local minima along the lower contour and areas with low vertical profiles, simultaneous encoding of contours and their topological relationships, extracting features, and finding shape-oriented events. Experiments demonstrating the performance of the system are also described. >"

Decisions by the classifiers can be represented as rankings of classifiers and different instances of a problem. The rankings can be combined by methods that either reduce or rerank a given set of classes. An intersection method and union method are proposed for class set reduction. Three methods based on the highest rank, the Borda count, and logistic regression are proposed for class set reranking. These methods have been tested in applications of degraded machine-printed characters and works from large lexicons, resulting in substantial improvement in overall correctness. >"
