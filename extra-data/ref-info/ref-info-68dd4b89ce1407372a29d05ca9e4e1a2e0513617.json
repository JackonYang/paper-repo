                "text": "An evaluation is presented of a method of vocabulary assessment, called the yes/no method, in which students indicate the words they know from among a list of words and nonwords. Preliminary evidence indicates that the yes/no method is much better in several respects than the multiple choice method. Analysis of \"false alarms,\" cases in which children say they know the meanings of nonwords, reveals that good readers aggressively apply morphological rules to hypothecate meanings for unfamiliar items whereas poor readers engage in phonemic experimentation with unfamiliar items to transform them into common words. Studies are summarized that show that vocabulary difficulty is a factor in text comprehension, but not as important a one as studies of readability suggest. Word Knowledge 2 Reading Comprehension and the Assessment and Acquisition of Word Knowledge Our intuitions about how our native language works are strong: Even subtle violations of grammar or conventions of usage ring loudly in our ears; we make rapid and usually accurate predictions about the content and interest value of a speech on the basis of the speaker's first few sentences; we also make generally appropriate estimates of the intellectual abilities of a speaker or writer based on a similarly small sample of language. One of our stronger intuitions is that familiarity with the words used in an utterance is a reliable touchstone from which we can infer how manageable we will find the meaning of an utterance. That is, from knowledge of the vocabulary, we infer the accessibility of the message. It is true, of course, that exotic words can be used to dress up a banal message. Deliberate pomposity in language is not uncommon. The intuition that there is a close relation between familiarity of the vocabulary and the difficulty of the conceptual content in a message is rattled frequently by social scientists. Consider this piece from one of the major social theorists of this century: The paoblem of oAdeA, and thus of the natu&e of the integiation of stable ayatems o bsociat inteAaction, that is, of social stAructume, focuses on the integration of the motivation of actoas with the normative clturala standadtz which integrate the action system, in ouA context inteA-personally. These standards ane patterAn o6 value-ouientation, and as such arte a panticuLLatty cAuLciat pact o the cuttLat tradition o the sociat system. (Patsons, 1951, p. 37)"

Weaving together issues in cognitive development, philosophy, and cognitive psychology, he reconciles numerous theories, backed by empirical evidence from nominal kinds studies, natural-kinds studies, and studies of fundamental categorical distinctions. He shows that all this evidence, when put together, leads to a better understanding of semantic and conceptual development.The book opens with an analysis of the problems of modeling qualitative changes in conceptual development, investigating how concepts of natural kinds, nominal kinds, and artifacts evolve.The studies on nominal kinds document a powerful and unambiguous developmental pattern indicating a shift from a reliance on global tabulations of characteristic features to what appears to be a small set of defining ones. The studies on natural kinds document an analogous shift toward a core theory instead of simple definition. Both sets of studies are strongly supported by cross cultural data.While these patterns seem to suggest that the young child organizes concepts according to characteristic features, Kell argues that there is a framework of conceptual categories and causal beliefs that enables even very young children to understand kinds at a deeper, theoretically guided, level. This account suggests a new way of understanding qualitative change and carries strong implications for how concepts are represented at any point in development.Frank Keil is Professor of Psychology at Cornell University and Co Director of the Cognitive Studies Program at Cornell. \"Concepts, Kinds, and Cognitive Development\" is included in the series Learning, Development, and Conceptual Change.

                "text": "\"Any adequate psychology of man must provide some way to understand the human capacity for language,\" the editors of this volume write. \"It was a belief shared by quite a few among us that developments in linguistics and psychology were leading to similar conclusions by separate routes and that this was an appropriate time to explore the implications of these apparently parallel developments for future, perhaps joint, work. This volume represents a few initial steps in the direction of that goal.\" The nine chapters of this book were written by linguists and psychologists, after extended collaboration and exchange of ideas. In the first chapter, \"A Realistic Transformational Grammar,\" Joan Bresnan (MIT) explores some of the consequences of her proposal that the role of many transformations in generative grammar should be subsumed by the lexical component. The character of lexical entries is the central topic of \"Semantic Relations Among Words,\" by George A. Miller (Rockefeller University); he reports views and suggestions that he has developed since the publication of his and Johnson-Laird's monumental Language and Perception (1976). The chapter by Eric Wanner (Rockefeller University) and Michael Maratsos (University of Minnesota), \"An ATN Approach to Comprehension,\" presents a nontransformational model of language processing that uses concepts developed in automatic parsing systems. The relations between their psychological model and Bresnan's lexical-transformational model is outlined in Chapter 1. \"Anaphora as an Approach to Pragmatics\" by Keith Stenning (University of Liverpool) explores the central problem of pragmatics: a sentence can express different meanings in different contexts. He proposes that a successful account of antecedent-anaphor relations must recognize the relation between a linguistic entity and its context, linguistic or nonlinguistic. Ray Jackendoff (Brandeis), in \"Grammar as Evidence for Conceptual Structure,\" attempts to use the information about semantic structure that is provided by the interpretation of various syntactic configurations in order to gain insights into basic attributes of human cognition. The remaining chapters deal with ways knowledge of a language is acquired and lost. In \"Language and the Brain,\" Edgar B. Zurif (Boston University Medical School) and Sheila E. Blumstein (Brown University and Boston University Medical School) survey some recent work on aphasia in the light of different theoretical models of language. Michael Maratsos, in \"New Models in Linguistics and Language Acquisition,\" inquires into the implications that a language model with restricted transformational component has for understanding of the way children acquire syntax. In \"The Child as Word Learner\" Susan Carey (MIT) examines the rapidity with which children learn words; she proposes that the process involves two stages: an almost instantaneous assignment of a new world to a field of related words, followed by a slow working out of its place in that field. Finally, Morris Halle (MIT), in \"Knowledge Unlearned and Untaught: What speakers know about the sounds of their language,\" cites facts that normal speakers of English demonstrably know but could never have been explicitly taught, nor in some cases even learned. Halle suggests this is a manifestation of innate knowledge that is genetically programmed into organisms."

These general, processes and mechanisms were investigated using a simple framework Gernsbacher (1990) refers to as the 'Structure Building Framework'. According to the Structure Building Framework, the goal of comprehension is to build a coherent, mental representation of 'structure'. To do this, comprehenders must first lay a foundation. Next, they develop the structure by mapping on information when that incoming information is coherent or related to previous information. However, if the incoming information is less coherent or related, comprehenders shift to initiate a new substructure. Thus, most representations comprise several branching substructures. These structure building processes are accomplished by two mechanisms: enhancement, which boosts the activation of some representations, and suppression, which dampens the activation of other representations."

                "text": "A simulation model of episodic memory, MINERVA 2, is applied to the learning of concepts, as represented by the schema-abstraction task. The model assumes that each experience produces a separate memory trace and that knowledge of abstract concepts is derived from the pool of episodic traces at the time of retrieval. A retrieval cue contacts all traces simultaneously, activating each according to its similarity to the cue, and the information retrieved from memory reflects the summed content of all activated traces responding in parallel. The MINERVA 2 model is able to retrieve an abstracted prototype of the category when cued with the category name and to retrieve and disambiguate a category name when cued with a category exemplar. The model successfully predicts basic findings from the schema-abstraction literature (e.g., differential forgetting of prototypes and old instances, typicality, and category size effects), including some that have been cited as evidence against exemplar theories of concepts. The model is compared to other classification models, and its implications regarding the abstraction problem are discussed. How is abstract knowledge related to specific experience? In present-day terms, this question concerns the relationship between episodic and generic memories. This article explores the possibility that there is only one memory system, which stores episodic traces, and that abstract knowledge as such does not have to be stored but can be derived from the pool of traces of specific experiences at the time of retrieval. I demonstrate how this might work by applying a simulation model of a multipletrace memory theory to the sehema-abstraction experimental paradigm, which is widely believed to capture in the laboratory the processes by which generic or abstract ideas are formed. Multiple-trace theories assume that each event to which one attends gives rise to its own memory trace. Thus, repetition of an item such as a word in a list does not strengthen a prior representation (i.e., one predating the experiment or one laid down by the item's first experimental occurrence); rather, it produces a new trace that coexists in memory with traces of other occurrences of the same item. Experiments supporting the multiple-trace assumption have been primarily concerned with the ability of subjects to remember an item's presentation frequency, list membership, presentation modality, exposure duration, serial position, and so forth (e.g., Hintzman, 1976; Hintzman & Block, 1971; Hintzman, Block, & Summers, 1973;"

As Quine (1969) puts it: \"There is nothing more basic to thought and language than our sense of similarity ; our sorting of things into kinds [p . 1161 .\" Indeed, the notion of similarity that appears under such different names as proximity, resemblance, communality, representativeness, and psychological distance is fundamental to theories of perception, learning, and judgment . This chapter outlines a new theoretical analysis of similarity and investigates some of its empirical consequences . The theoretical analysis of similarity relations has been dominated by geometric models. Such models represent each object as a point in some coordinate space so that the metric distances between the points reflect the observed similarities between the respective objects . In general, the space is assumed to be Euclidean, and the purpose of the analysis is to embed the objects in a space of minimum dimensionality on the basis of the observed similarities, see Shepard (1974) . In a recent paper (Tversky, 1977), the first author challenged the dimensionalmetric assumptions that underlie the geometric approach to similarity and developed an alternative feature-theoretical approach to the analysis of similarity relations. In this approach, each object a is characterized by a set of features, denoted A, and the observed similarity of a to b, denoted s(a, b), is expressed as a function of their common and distinctive features (see Fig . 4.1) . That is, the observed similarity s(a, b) is expressed as a function of three arguments : A f1B, the features shared by a and b ;A B, the features of a that are not shared by b ; B A, the features of b that are not shared by a .

In this article we review accounts based on similarity, feature correlations, and various theories of categorization. We find that each theory provides an inadequate account of conceptual coherence (or no account at all) because none provides enough constraints on possible concepts. We propose that concepts are coherent to the extent that they fit people's background knowledge or naive theories about the world. These theories help to relate the concepts in a domain and to structure the attributes that are internal to a concept. Evidence of the influence of theories on various conceptual tasks is presented, and the possible importance of theories in cognitive development is discussed."

In general, we found that the event name itself combined most readily with superordinate noun categories; thus, one gets dressed with clothes and needs various kitchen utensils to make breakfast. When such activities were analyzed into their script elements, the basic level appeared as the level of abstraction of objects necessary to script the events; e.g., in getting dressed, one puts on pants, sweater, and shoes, and in making breakfast, one cooks eggs in a frying pan. With respect to prototypes, it appears to be those category members judged the more prototypical that have attributes that enable them to fit into the typical and agreed upon script elements. We are presently collecting normative data on the intersection of common events, the objects associated with those events and the other sets of events associated with those objects.2 In addition, object names for eliciting events are varied in level of abstraction and in known prototypicality in given categories. Initial results show a similar pattern to that obtained in the earlier research in which it was found that the more typical members of superordinate categories could replace the superordinate in sentence frames generated by subjects told to \"make up a sentence\" that used the superordinate (Rosch, 1977). That is, the task of using a given concrete noun in a sentence appears to be an indirect method of eliciting a statement about the events in which objects play a part; that indirect method showed clearly that prototypical category members are those that can play the role in events expected of members of that category. The use of deviant forms of object names in narratives accounts for several recently explored effects in the psychological literature. Substituting object names at other than the basic level within scripts results in obviously deviant descriptions. Substitution of superordinates produces just those types of narrative that Bransford and Johnson (1973) have claimed are not comprehended; for example, \" The procedure is actually quite simple. First you arrange things into different groups. Of course, one pile may be sufficient [p. 400].\" It should be noted in the present context that what Bransford and Johnson call context cues are actually names of basic-level events (e.g., washing clothes) and that one function of hearing the event name is to enable the reader to translate the superordinate terms into basic-level objects and actions. Such a translation appears to be a necessary aspect of our ability to match linguistic descriptions to world knowledge in a way that produces the \"click of comprehension.\" On the other hand, substitution of subordinate terms for basic-level object names in scripts gives the effect of satire or snobbery. For example, a review ( Garis, 1975) of a pretentious novel accused of actually being about nothing more than brand-name snobbery concludes, \"And so, after putting away my 10"

Many have hypothesized that a large proportion of this growth occurs through incidental learning from written context. However, experimental research has until now failed to provide unequivocal support of this hypothesis. The present study attempted to determine whether students do acquire measurable knowledge about unfamiliar words while reading natural text. Fifty-seven eighth-grade students of average and above average reading ability read either an expository or a narrative text about 1,000 words in length. After reading, subjects completed two vocabulary assessment tasks on 15 target words from each passage (thus serving as controls for the passage not read), an individual interview and a multiple-choice test, both designed to tap partial knowledge of word meanings. Results of within-subject, hierarchical regression analyses showed small but statistically reliable gains in word knowledge from context. Tentative extrapolations from the results and current estimates of the volume of children's reading lead us to believe that incidental learning from context accounts for a substantial proportion of the vocabulary growth that occurs during the school years."

(Generally speaking, subjects respond quicker than normal to the word nurse if it follows a highly associated word such as doctor. ) We will extend the term to provide the basis for a statistical description of a variety of interesting linguistic phenomena, ranging from semantic relations of the doctor/nurse type (content word/content word) to lexico-syntactic co-occurrence constraints between verbs and prepositions (content word/function word). This paper will propose an objective measure based on the information theoretic notion of mutual information, for estimating word association norms from computer readable corpora. (The standard method of obtaining word association norms, testing a few thousand subjects on a few hundred words, is both costly and unreliable.) The proposed measure, the association ratio, estimates word association norms directly from computer readable corpora, making it possible to estimate norms for tens of thousands of words."

In acquiring it we have to depend entirely on intersubjectively available cues as to what to say and when.\" As Patricia Smith Churchland notes in her foreword to this new edition, with Word and Object Quine challenged the tradition of conceptual analysis as a way of advancing knowledge. The book signaled twentieth-century philosophy's turn away from metaphysics and what Churchland calls the \"phony precision\" of conceptual analysis. In the course of his discussion of meaning and the linguistic mechanisms of objective reference, Quine considers the indeterminacy of translation, brings to light the anomalies and conflicts implicit in our language's referential apparatus, clarifies semantic problems connected with the imputation of existence, and marshals reasons for admitting or repudiating each of various categories of supposed objects. In addition to Churchland's foreword, this edition offers a new preface by Quine's student and colleague Dagfinn Follesdal that describes the never-realized plans for a second edition of Word and Object, in which Quine would offer a more unified treatment of the public nature of meaning, modalities, and propositional attitudes."

Some considerations on formalisation of language suggests that the more formalised it is, the less information it contains. If it is true, it is not reasonable to hope that a formalised language like that used by computers may be a model for thought. Finally, the lack of status of thought, as far as it is a subjective experience and the impossibility of giving it a definition as far as it exceeds language, make it clear that in spite of progress in scientific psychology, thought, per se, is not an object for science."

Evidence for the universality of Evaluation, Potency, and Activity as affective features of M is given, along with a discussion of the powers and limitations of this technique.

                "text": "Since it was introduced to the English-speaking world in 1962, Lev Vygotsky's highly original exploration of human mental development has become recognized as a classic foundational work of cognitive science. Vygotsky analyzes the relationship between words and consciousness, arguing that speech is social in its origins and that only as children develop does it become internalized verbal thought.Now Alex Kozulin has created a new edition of the original MIT Press translation by Eugenia Hanfmann and Gertrude Vakar that restores the work's complete text and adds materials that will help readers better understand Vygotsky's meaning and intentions. Kozulin has also contributed an introductory essay that offers new insight into the author's life, intellectual milieu, and research methods.Lev S. Vygotsky (1896-1934) studied at Moscow University and acquired in his brief lifespan a nearly encyclopedic knowledge of the social sciences, psychology, philosophy, linguistics, literature, and the arts. He began his systematic work in psychology at the age of 28, and within a few years formulated his theory of the development of specifically human higher mental functions. He died of tuberculosis ten years later, and Thought and Language was published posthumously in 1934.Alex Kozulin studied at the Moscow Institute of Medicine and the Moscow Institute of Psychology, where he began his investigation of Vygotsky and the history of Soviet psychology. He emigrated in 1979 and is now Associate Professor of Psychiatry (Psychology) at Boston University. He is the author of Psychology in Utopia: Toward a Social History of Soviet Psychology (MIT Press 1984)."

As a background we shall present in the following sections some fundamental clarifications and remarks on our specific view of lemmatization and disambiguation. Our starting point is the double assertion that we believe would be shared by many workers in applied computational linguistics and large text-processing projects, to wit: that on the one hand lemmatization is one of the most important and crucial steps in many non-trivial text-processing cycles, but on the other hand, no operational, reasonably general, fully automatic and high-quality context-sensitive text-lemmatization system nowadays is easily accessible for any natural language. Given these two premises, the problem is how to introduce a partial element (at least) of machineaided work in the process of text-lemmatization, so as to avoid the extremely laborious and frustrating task of a word-per-word manual lemmatization of large corpora as was done in the early days of automatic text-processing projects. (For a thorough report on mechanical lemmatization programs, see ref. 4.) In this paper we focus on the analysis and experimental testing of one idea that fits naturally into this framework, namely that of disambiguation by short contexts. (The somewhat unexpected shift from \"lemmatization\" to \"disambiguation\" will be justified in the sections to come.) Based on"

In Experiment 1, junior high school students' comprehension of one of three versions of a biology text was examined via free recall, written questions, and a key-word sorting task. This study demonstrates advantages for globally coherent text and for more explanatory text. In Experiment 2, interactions among local and global text coherence, readers' background knowledge, and levels of understanding were examined. Using the same methods as in Experiment 1, we examined students' comprehension of one of four versions of a text, orthogonally varying local and global coherence. We found that readers who know little about the domain of the text benefit from a coherent text, whereas high-knowledge readers benefit from a minimally coherent text. We argue that the poorly written text forces the knowledgeable readers t..."

People were asked to name things in a variety of domains: instructions for text-editing operations, index words for cooking recipes, categories for \u201cwant ads,\u201d and descriptions of common objects. We found that random pairs of people used the same word for an object only 10 to 20 percent of the time. But we also found that hit rates could be increased threefold by using norms on naming to pick optimal names, by recognizing as many of the users' various words as possible, and by allowing the user and the system several guesses in trying to hit upon the desired target."

In three experiments, subjects read texts presented by a rapid serial visual procedure and performed a lexical decision on visually presented targets that followed ambiguous prime words. When the target was a word, it was either an associate of the prime word, a probable inference suggested by the discourse, or an unrelated word. For associates, lexical decisions that related to either the appropriate or the inappropriate sense of the ambiguous word were generally facilitated at short (200-400 msec) prime-target stimulus onset asynchronies (SOAs). At longer SOAs, responses were faster to appropriate than to inappropriate associates. For the thematic inferences, there was no difference between these (appropriate) inferences and (inappropriate) control words at short SOAs. At long SOAs (1,000 and 1,500 msec), however, inference words were facilitated. The results are interpreted as consistent with a model of lexical processing in which sense activation functions independently of context. Discourse context effects, whether on sense selection (suppression of inappropriate associates) or on sense elaboration (creation of inferences), are seen as postlexical."

This is done by simultaneously modeling all the interrelationships among terms and documents. We assume that there is some underlying or \"latent\" structure in the pattern of word usage across documents, and use statistical techniques to estimate this latent structure. A description of terms, documents and user queries based on the underlying, \"latent semantic\", structure (rather than surface level word choice) is used for representing and retrieving information. One advantage of the LSI representation is that a query can be very similar to a document even when they share no words."

A new set-theoretical approach to similarity is developed in which objects are represented as collections of features, and similarity is described as a feature-matching process. Specifically, a set of qualitative assumptions is shown to imply the contrast model, which expresses the similarity between objects as a linear combination of the measures of their common and distinctive features. Several predictions of the contrast model are tested in studies of similarity with both semantic and perceptual stimuli. The model is used to uncover, analyze, and explain a variety of empirical phenomena such as the role of common and distinctive features, the relations between judgments of similarity and difference, the presence of asymmetric similarities, and the effects of context on judgments of similarity. The contrast model generalizes standard representations of similarity data in terms of clusters and trees. It is also used to analyze the relations of prototypicality and family resemblance"

Uses of causal and temporal terms in private speech by a child studied longitudinally from 1;9 to 3;0 are analysed from this perspective. Evidence is presented that words are first constrained to uses in specific discourse contexts, and later used more flexibly and with greater control over the semantics of the terms. Derivation of meaning from discourse is described as a dialectical process, and as such it is claimed to be more consistent with the full range of observational data, and with theories of word learning applicable to older children and adults, than other current theories of lexical acquisition in early childhood."

For success without extensive training, or in first-tries for new targets, the system must recognize terms that will be chosen spontaneously. We studied spontaneous word choice for objects in five application-related domains, and found the variability to be surprisingly large. In every case two people favored the same term with probability <0.20. Simulations show how this fundamental property of language limits the success of various design methodologies for vocabulary-driven interaction. For example, the popular approach in which access is via one designer's favorite single word will result in 80-90 percent failure rates in many common situations. An optimal strategy, unlimited aliasing, is derived and shown to be capable of several-fold improvements."

Foundations of Cognitive Science answers this question in a way that gives a feeling for the excitement, ferment, and accomplishments of this new field. It is the first broad treatment of cognitive science at an advanced level.

Items, represented as sets of features, are associated by the operation of convolution. The associations are stored by being superimposed in a composite memory trace. Retrieval occurs when a cue item is correlated with the composite trace. The retrieved items are intrinsically noisy, may be ambiguous, and may under certain conditions be systematically distorted from their encoded form. A discrete response is selected by matching the retrieved item to all of the items in semantic memory. The model yields several new predictions about errors in single-trial cued recall that depend on similarity relations among the to-be-remembered items, and also about the efficacy of extralist cues. Experiments are presented that test these predictions against human recall. The model is then applied to several well-known results: prototype abstraction, the A-B A-D paradigm\u2014including the independence of the B and D responses\u2014 and the Osgood transfer surface."

In two experiments, we attempted to eliminate this subordinate bias effect by increasing the contextual bias in favor of the homograph\u2032s subordinate meaning. In both experiments, subjects\u2032 eye movements were recorded as they read target sentences containing biased homographs in which immediate prior context instantiated the subordinate meaning of the word. In the first experiment, subjects were familiarized with the subordinate sense of the critical homograph via a paired-associate task prior to reading the target sentence. In the second experiment, the target sentence formed the last line of an extended passage whose global discourse biased the subordinate meaning of the critical homograph. In addition, the presence or absence of a prior instance of the critical homograph (instantiated in its subordinate sense) at an earlier location in the passage was manipulated. In neither experiment did the increase in contextual bias result in a reduction of the subordinate bias effect. We argue that these results are inconsistent with a selective account of lexical access."

Five related experiments that integrate and expand the findings of this previous color research are reported. The relationship between memory and (1) color stimuli discriminability, (2) focality, (3) two-person communication accuracy, (4) group communication accuracy, and (5) referential confusability is assessed. What we discover is that the color array previously used to demonstrate the influence of focality on memory is discriminatively biased in favor of focal chips. Results show that when perceptual discriminability is controlled for, the various linguistic indices are better predictors of memory accuracy in both short-term and long-term recognition memory tasks than is focality. Memory for color stimuli seems to be mediated by basic color descriptions, which may include, but are not restricted to, basic color terms. The discussion takes up the implications of the findings for previous research and for Whorf's hierarchical view of the relationship between language and sublinguistic universale.

It diiers from standard approaches by allowing for as ne grained distinctions as is warranted by the information at hand, rather than supposing a xed number of senses per word, and by allowing for more than one sense to be assigned to a given word occurrence. The algorithm is applied to the standard vector-space information retrieval model and an evaluation is performed over the Category B TREC-1 corpus (WSJ subcollection). Results show that this sense disambiguation algorithm improves performance by between 7% and 14% on average ."

The chunking model extended the basic convolution-correlation formalism by using multiple convolutions, n-grams (multiple autoassociations of sums of item vectors), and chunks (sums of n-grams) to account for chunking and serial organization. TODAM2 extends the chunking model by including rn-grams (reduced n-grams), labels, and \"lebals\" (the involution or mirror image of a label) to provide a general model for episodic memory. For paired associates, it is assumed that subjects store only labeled n-grams and lebaled rn-grams. It is shown that the model is broadly consistent with a number of major empirical paired-associate and serial-order effects."

The author proposes that the semantics of words and contexts in a text be represented as vectors. The dimensions of the space are words and the initial vectors are determined by the words occurring close to the entity to be represented, which implies that the space has several thousand dimensions (words). This makes the vector representations (which are dense) too cumbersome to use directly. Therefore, dimensionality reduction by means of a singular value decomposition is employed. The author analyzes the structure of the vector representations and applies them to word sense disambiguation and thesaurus induction. >"

Or are the cognitive differences between young children and adults merely a matter of accumulation of knowledge? In this book, Susan Carey develops an alternative to these two ways of thinking about childhood cognition, putting forth the idea of conceptual change and its relation to the development of knowledge systems.Conceptual Change in Childhood is a case study of children's acquisition of biological knowledge between ages 4-10. Drawing on evidence from a variety of sources, Carey analyzes the ways that knowledge is restructured during this development, comparing them to the ways that knowledge is restructured by an adult learner, and to the ways that conceptual frameworks have shifted in the history of science. Susan Carey is Professor of Psychology at MIT."

The separate statements have in [act differed more in the language of their expression than in their substance. The major intent of the present paper is to explicate a more precise version of the form of theory involved, and to indicate how it may be usefully applied to a variety of phenomena in\u00b7 volving asso('iative learning. The impetus for a new theoretical model is not generally a new datum which dearly disconfirms existing theory. It is more likely to be the accumulation of a salient pattern of data, separate portions of which may be ade(luately handled by separate existing theories, but which apo pears to invite a more integrated theoretical account. Such, at least, is the better description of the background of the present work. In the sections which follow we will first describe certain data from our laboratories which exemplify the kind of observations which have encouraged the present theorizing. The theory will then be presented in sufficient detail to show how it may be applied to experimental situations involving a variety of Pavlovian conditioning arrangements. Finally, we will briefly discuss the theory in relationship to more conventional approaches."

The approach is to take advantage of implicit higher-order structure in the association of terms with documents (\u201csemantic structure\u201d) in order to improve the detection of relevant documents on the basis of terms found in queries. The particular technique used is singular-value decomposition, in which a large term by document matrix is decomposed into a set of ca. 100 orthogonal factors from which the original matrix can be approximated by linear combination. Documents are represented by ca. 100 item vectors of factor weights. Queries are represented as pseudo-document vectors formed from weighted combinations of terms, and documents with supra-threshold cosine values are returned. initial tests find this completely automatic method for retrieval to be promising."

For similarity to be a useful construct, one must be able to specify the ways or respects in which two things are similar. One solution to this problem is to restrict the notion of similarity to hard-wired perceptual processes. It is argued that this view is too narrow and limiting. Instead, it is proposed that an important source of constraints derives from the similarity comparison process itself. Both new experiments and other evidence are described that support the idea that respects are determined by processes internal to comparisons"

The design of a vocabulary program for intermediate grades is then discussed. The emphasis here is that activities developed depend on the goal of instruction, the nature of the words taught, and the characteristics of the learners."

LSI uses a reduced-dimension vector space to represent words and documents. An important aspect of this representation is that the association between terms is automatically captured, explicitly represented, and used to improve retrieval. We used LSI for both TREC-3 routing and adhoc tasks. For the routing tasks an LSI space was constructed using the training documents. We compared profiles constructed using just the topic words (no training) with profiles constructed using the average of relevant documents (no use of the topic words). Not surprisingly, the centroid of the relevant documents was 30% better than the topic words. This simple feedback method was quite good compared to the routing performance of other systems. Various combinations of information from the topic words and relevant documents provide small additional improvements in performance. For the adhoc task we compared LSI to keyword vector matching (i.e. using no dimension reduction). Small advantages were obtained for LSI even with the long TREC topic statements."

In the proposed theoretical framework cognitive processes are viewed as a sequence of stable states representing end products of processing. In skilled activities, acquired memory skills allow these end products to be stored in long-term memory and kept directly accessible by means of retrieval cues in short-term memory, as proposed by skilled memory theory. These theoretical claims are supported by a review of evidence on memory in text comprehension and expert performance in such domains as mental calculation, medical diagnosis, and chess."

The physical meaning of content-addressable memory is described by an appropriate phase space flow of the state of a system. A model of such a system is given, based on aspects of neurobiology but readily adapted to integrated circuits. The collective properties of this model produce a content-addressable memory which correctly yields an entire memory from any subpart of sufficient size. The algorithm for the time evolution of the state of the system is based on asynchronous parallel processing. Additional emergent collective properties include some capacity for generalization, familiarity recognition, categorization, error correction, and time sequence retention. The collective properties are only weakly sensitive to details of the modeling or the failure of individual devices."

                "text": "Few studies have provided precise data on how much reading school children do. Fewer still have examined the relation between amount of reading and reading achievement. In the studies reported here, 155 fifth graders wrote down every day on activity forms how many minutes they spent on a wide range of out-ofschool activities. Forms were completed for periods ranging from 8 to 26 weeks. The distribution of times for most activities was positively skewed. Among all the ways children spent their time, reading books was the best predictor of several measures of reading achievement, including gains in reading achievement between second and fifth grade. However, on most days most children did little or no book reading. An implication of these facts is that parents and teachers ought to give a higher priority to promoting book reading."

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of time spent reading at school and at home on intermediate grade students\u2019 reading achievement. One hundred and ninety-five students in Grades 5 and 6 kept daily reading logs from mid-January through mid-May. A stepwise multiple regression analysis, in which standardized reading comprehension scores prior to the study served as a covariate, revealed that amount of time spent on reading during the reading period contributed significantly to gains in students\u2019 reading achievement. Time spent on reading at home was not significantly related to reading achievement gains. Findings provide needed research support for the idea that time engaged in silent reading at school is beneficial to intermediate grade students."

Recently Pinker (1994) has summarized the broad spectrum of evidence on the origins of language-- in evolution, history, anatomy, physiology, and development. In accord with Chomsky's dictum, he concludes that language learning must be based on a very strong and specific innate foundation, a set of general rules and predilections that need parameter setting and filling in, but not acquisition as such, from experience. Although this \"language instinct\" position is debatable as stated, it rests on an idea that is surely correct, that some powerful mechanism exists in the minds of children that can use the finite information they receive to turn them into competent users of human language. What we want to know, of course, is what this mechanism is, what it does, how it works. Unfortunately the rest of the instinctivist answers are as yet of limited help. The fact that the mechanism is given by biology or that it exists as an autonomous mental or physical \"module\" (if it does), tells us next to nothing about how the mind solves the basic inductive problem. Shepard's (1987) answer to the induction problem in stimulus generalization is equally dependent on biological givens, but offers a more precise description of some parts of the proposed mechanism."
