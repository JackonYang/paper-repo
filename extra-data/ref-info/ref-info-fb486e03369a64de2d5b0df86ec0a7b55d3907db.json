This probabilistic language model extends trigrams by allowing a word to be predicted not only from the two immediately preceeding words, but potentially from any preceeding pair of adjacent words that lie within the same sentence. In this way, the trigram model can skip over less informative words to make its predictions. The underlying \"grammar\" is nothing more than a list of pairs of words that can be linked together with one or more intervening words; this word-pair grammar is automatically inferred from a corpus of training text. We present a novel technique for indexing the model parameters that allows us to avoid all sorting in the M-step of the training algorithm. This results in significant savings in computation time, and is applicable to the training of a general probabilistic link grammar. Results of preliminary experiments carried out for this class of models are presented."

The learning paradigm builds increasingly complex fields by allowing potential functions, or features, that are supported by increasingly large subgraphs. Each feature has a weight that is trained by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the model and the empirical distribution of the training data. A greedy algorithm determines how features are incrementally added to the field and an iterative scaling algorithm is used to estimate the optimal values of the weights. The random field models and techniques introduced in this paper differ from those common to much of the computer vision literature in that the underlying random fields are non-Markovian and have a large number of parameters that must be estimated. Relations to other learning approaches, including decision trees, are given. As a demonstration of the method, we describe its application to the problem of automatic word classification in natural language processing."

Specifically, the problem is to estimate the probability that a given word will be the next word uttered. Algorithms are presented for automatically constructing a binary decision tree designed to estimate these probabilities. At each node of the tree there is a yes/no question relating to the words already spoken, and at each leaf there is a probability distribution over the allowable vocabulary. Ideally, these nodal questions can take the form of arbitrarily complex Boolean expressions, but computationally cheaper alternatives are also discussed. Some results obtained on a 5000-word vocabulary with a tree designed to predict the next word spoken from the preceding 20 words are included. The tree is compared to an equivalent trigram model and shown to be superior. >"

A simple triclass Markov model is used, and the best way to estimate the parameters of this model, depending on the kind and amount of training data that is provided, is found. Two approaches are compared: the use of text that has been tagged by hand and comparing relative frequency counts; and use text without tags and training the model as a hidden Markov process, according to a maximum likelihood principle. Experiments show that the best training is obtained by using as much tagged text as is available, a maximum likelihood training may improve the accuracy of the tagging.<<ETX>>"

HBG incorporates lexical, syntactic, semantic, and structural information from the parse tree into the disambiguation process in a novel way. We use a corpus of bracketed sentences, called a Treebank, in combination with decision tree building to tease out the relevant aspects of a parse tree that will determine the correct parse of a sentence. This stands in contrast to the usual approach of further grammar tailoring via the usual linguistic introspection in the hope of generating the correct parse. In head-to-head tests against one of the best existing robust probabilistic parsing models, which we call P-CFG, the HBG model significantly outperforms P-CFG, increasing the parsing accuracy rate from 60% to 75%, a 37% reduction in error."

We define a concept of word-by-word alignment between such pairs of sentences. For any given pair of such sentences each of our models assigns a probability to each of the possible word-by-word alignments. We give an algorithm for seeking the most probable of these alignments. Although the algorithm is suboptimal, the alignment thus obtained accounts well for the word-by-word relationships in the pair of sentences. We have a great deal of data in French and English from the proceedings of the Canadian Parliament. Accordingly, we have restricted our work to these two languages; but we feel that because our algorithms have minimal linguistic content they would work well on other pairs of languages. We also feel, again because of the minimal linguistic content of our algorithms, that it is reasonable to argue that word-by-word alignments are inherent in any sufficiently large bilingual corpus."

                "text": "There is no need to stress the importance of variational problems in mathematics and its applications. The list of variational problems, of different degrees of difficulty, is very long, and it stretches from famous minimum and maximum problems of antiquity, through the variational problems of analytical mechanics and theoretical physics, all the way to the variational problems of modern opera t ions research. While maximizing or minimizing a function or a functional is a routine procedure, some special variational problems give solutions which either unify previously unconnected results or match surprisingly well the results of our experiments. Such variational problems are called variational principles. Whether or not the architecture of our world is based on variational principles is a philosophical problem. But it is a sound strategy to discover and apply variational principles in order to acquire a better understanding of a part of this architecture. In applied mathematics we get a model by taking into account some connections and, inevitably, ignoring others. One way of making a model convincing and useful is to obtain it as the solution of a variational problem. The aim of the present paper is to bring some arguments in favour of the promotion of the variational problem of entropy maximization to the rank of a variational principle."

Institute of Mathematical Statistics is collaborating with JSTOR to digitize, preserve and extend access to The Annals of Probability. Some geometric properties of PD's are established, Kullback's I-divergence playing the role of squared Euclidean distance. The minimum discrimination information problem is viewed as that of projecting a PD onto a convex set of PD's and useful existence theorems for and characterizations of the minimizing PD are arrived at. A natural generalization of known iterative algorithms converging to the minimizing PD in special situations is given; even for those special cases, our convergence proof is more generally valid than those previously published. As corollaries of independent interest, generalizations of known results on the existence of PD's or nonnegative matrices of a certain form are obtained. The Lagrange multiplier technique is not used."
