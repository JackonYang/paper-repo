Errors that result from incorrectly integrating features are called conjunction errors. The present study uses conjunction errors to investigate the principles used by the visual system to integrate features. The research tests whether the visual system is more likely to integrate features located close together in visual space (the location principle) or whether the visual system is more likely to integrate features from stimulus items that come from the same perceptual group or object (the perceptual group principle). In four target-detection experiments, stimuli were created so that feature integration by the location principle and feature integration by the perceptual group principle made different predictions for performance. In all of the experiments, the perceptual group principle predicted feature integration even though the distance between stimulus items and retinal eccentricity were strictly controlled."

The present experiments measured discriminability of these simple parts when presented either in isolation or within configural contexts that provided no formal information useful for the discrimination. Certain contexts either impaired or did not affect performance. Other contexts were found, however, which dramatically improved discriminability. Thus, two patterns which differed only in a single part could be discriminated from each other more quickly than could their distinguishing parts shown in isolation. Further experiments suggest that this \"configural superiority\" effect influences perceptual components of processing rather than memorial components. The mechanism underlying configural superiority appears to be the detection of novel and distinguishing features, such as corners and intersections, which emerge when parts are placed in close proximity to each other. The outlines of a model for preattentive feature discrimination are presented."

The first two experiments show that a target is detected more poorly if it is arranged in good form (a perceptual Gestalt) with noise elements than if it is not. This effect is not confounded with target-noise proximity or display size, and it holds for stimuli terminated by the subject\u2019s response as well as for stimuli of very brief duration. Increasing the number of noise elements can actually improve performance if the added noise elements increase the degree to which the noise elements form perceptual groups separately from the target. A third experiment tries out a new method for scaling the perceptual structure of an array, and it shows that the main features of the first two experiments can be predicted from the scaled perceptual structure of the arrays they used."

Concentrated attention was necessary for perceiving line arrangement differences, while line slant differences could be detected with distributed attention. However, experiments with foveal presentation showed no facilitation by concentrating attention. Experiment I replicated these results. Experiment II showed that distributed attention did degrade foveal line arrangement discrimination if the attention system was overloaded by increasing the number of elements in the array. Experiment III demonstrated that high element density was not a sufficient condition for these effects to occur. Line arrangement discrimination was reduced as letter number increased even when maximum density was held constant. In Experim~ent IV, it was shown that concentrating attention facilitated line arrangement discrimination relative to line slant discrimination in foveal vision when element number and density were held constant. The results are discussed in terms of several models postulating a difference between spread-out and concentrated attention systems."

The results showed that: (a) an L and a tilted T were equal in discriminability when attention was focused or concentrated on one display position, (b) the discriminability of an L decreased while the discriminability of a tilted T was not statistically significantly affected as the number of display positions that attention needed to be paid to increased, and (c) the reaction time to find a disparate tilted T was less than that to find a disparate L. The results are interpreted as supporting the hypothesis that, under distributed attention in peripheral vision, the visual system is more sensitive to differences in line slope than to differences in line arrangement The results are discussed in connection with hypotheses of how selective attention affects the discriminability of a target."

In Experiment 2, the retinal area (a manipula- tion of letter size and spacing) covered by the display also failed to affect the influence of letter number. The results indicate that the type of discrimination to be made determines whether or not processing is parallel, even when as few as four letters are presented."

                "text": "The effectiveness of several configurational or textural variables in producing similarity grouping was investigated by measuring the time it took Ss to locate the disparate quadrant in a circular array. The 'figure' and 'ground' quadrants differed in (1) slope of elements, (2) linearity of elements, or (3) the way in which the same slopes were combined into angles. Differences in slope produced excellent grouping; differences in linearity were less effective; and differences in arrangement of slopes were generally quite ineffective. Grouping was also dependent on orientation of the whole array: horizontals and verticals gave better grouping than diagonals, and even arrangement of slopes gave moderately effective grouping when angles with horizontal and vertical axes of symmetry were opposed to each other. Conditions of head tilt were used to determine whether the grouping effects were dependent on retinal or gravitational orientation. For the angles, only retinal orientation seemed important; but for line segments and paired dots varying in slope, both retinal and gravitational orientation had significant effects. The results disconfirm the hypothesis that grouping occurs entirely on a projection level, independently of constancy mechanisms. It is suggested that grouping and segregation depend on identities and differences between descriptors which in turn represent relationships between the stimulus array and an internal Cartesian reference system. Similarity is one of the most important of Wertheimer's principles of perceptual grouping, but only recently, with the work of Julesz and Beck, has any appreciable curiosity been displayed about the kinds of similarity that are effective in this respect.' It should, of course, be understood that grouping always implies the complementary process of segregation. Grouped items must be at once similar to one another and different from extraneous items; in analysis-of-variance terminology, within-group variance must be Received for publication September 22, 1969.

These aftereffects suggest the presence of neural structures for the discrimination of sequential changes in spatial position which are subject to adaptation and respond with decreased sensitivity to the repetitive presentation of the two lights in a given spatial direction. The results are interpreted to support the hypothesis that the perception of apparent movement involves the excitation of specific neural mechanisms selectively responsive to sequential changes in stimulus position. An alternative hypothesis is that the perception of apparent movement involves an inference based on the separate registrations of the position of a stimulus at one point in time and the position of that stimulus at an earlier point in time."

Since second-order (dipole) statistics determine the autocorrelation functions and hence the power spectra, this observation also meant that in preattentive perception of texture the phase (position) spectra were ignored. In the last two decades many new classes of texture pairs with identical power spectra have been invented that were not effortlessly discriminable; however, recently (Caelli & Julesz 1978; Caelli et al. 1978; Julesz et al. 1978) several counterexamples were found. In these texture pairs with identical power spectra some local structures of 'quasi-collinearity', 'corner', 'closure' and 'granularity' yielded strong discrimination. These features can be regarded as the fundamental building blocks of form, that is, the essential nonlinearities of the preattentive perceptual system. Here, it will be shown that these counter-examples are not independent of each other, but can be described by two elementary units; bars (line segments) and their terminators. Furthermore, the preattentive texture perception system can count the number of terminators but ignores their positions."
