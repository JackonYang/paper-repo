                "text": "The main object of this study was to see whether ordered sequences of orientation columns are present in very young visually naive monkeys. Recordings were made from area 17 in two macaque monkeys three and four weeks of age, whose eyes had been closed near the time of birth. The first monkey was born normally, but one day elapsed before eye closure could be done. The second was delivered by Cesarean section and the lids sutured shut immediately. The results in these two animals were very similar; in both, highly ordered sequences of orientation shifts were present, and were in no obvious way different from those seen in the adult. For example, average values for the size of orientation shifts, for the horizontal component of the distance between shifts, and for the slopes of orientation vs. track distance curves, were all similar to adult values. This indicates that the ordered column system is innately determined and not the result of early visual experience. In these two monkeys and a third one, sutured at two days and examined at 38 days, most of the cells seemed normal by adult standards, with simple, complex or hypercomplex receptive fields, showing about the same range in orientation specificity as is found in adults. About 10\u201315% of cells showed abnormalities similar to those seen in monkeys binocularly deprived of vision for longer periods. Furthermore, all three deprived monkeys showed a decided lack of cells that could be influenced from both eyes, whereas a normal three\u2010week\u2010old control animal seemed similar to the adult, with binocular cells comprising over half of the total population. A monkey deprived by binocular closure from the third to the seventh week also showed a diminution in number of binocularly influenced cells, suggesting that the deprivation from birth resulted in a deterioration of innate connections subserving binocular convergence. To be sure that the abnormalities in the deprived animals represented a deterioration of connections, we recorded from 23 cells in a normal two\u2010day\u2010old monkey: here the ocular dominance distribution of cells was about the same as in the adult, and the response characteristics of the cells were normal by adult standards."

                "text": "Cells in the cat's striate cortex show marked specificity in their responses to restricted retinal stimulation (Hubel & Wiesel, 1959, 1962). The most effective stimulus shapes are long narrow rectangles of light ('slits'), dark bars against a light background ('dark bars'), and straight-line borders separating areas of different brightness ('edges'). A given cell responds vigorously when an appropriate stimulus is shone on the receptive field or moved across it, provided the stimulus is presented in a specific orientation. This orientation is termed the 'receptive-field axis orientation'. It is critical, and constant for any particular cell, but may differ for different cells. The visual cortex is subdivided into discrete regions or columns extending from surface to white matter, in which all cells have the same receptivefield axis orientation (Hubel & Wiesel, 1962). The present experiments were undertaken with the object of learning more about the anatomical configuration of the columns. We wished to have a clearer idea of their shape, especially if the walls of a column were, as previous work suggested, parallel to the radial fibre bundles of the cortex and perpendicular to the cortical layers, and whether the columns were uniform or irregular in their cross-sectional shape and size. Furthermore, we were curious to know if there was any relationship between the receptive-field axis orientations of neighbouring columns, or whether, on the contrary, the different columns were intermixed in a random way throughout the cortex. These questions were approached: (1) by making several deep, closely spaced, parallel micro-electrode penetrations, placing electrolytic lesions at every shift in receptive-field orientation, and(2) by making many short penetrations in a small cortical area, noting the axis orientation of cells lying in the upper one or two layers of cortex."

Talbot & Marshall (1941) used physiological methods to map the central part of the visual field on to the posterolateral surface ofthe cortex in the monkey. They devised an index of cortical representation expressed as the increment of the angle, measured radially from the centre of gaze, which is represented on each millimetre of cortex. We have confirmed their observations and have extended the mapping to the buried visual cortex in the horizontal and vertical calcarine fissures. We have preferred to use the reciprocal of their index and to call it the cortical magnification, M. When this is measured along radii and at right angles to them, it provides the empirical quantitative relation which Polyak wanted. It also defines the shape and size of the visual receptive field. We have made such a surface, folded it and compared it with the calcarine cortex of the monkey. A preliminary account of this work has been published (Daniel & Whitteridge, 1959)."

It would be astonishing if such a structure did not profoundly modify the response patterns of fibres coming into it. In the cat's visual cortex, the receptive field arrangements of single cells suggest that there is indeed a degree of complexity far exceeding anything yet seen at lower levels in the visual system. In a previous paper we described receptive fields of single cortical cells, observing responses to spots of light shone on one or both retinas (Hubel & Wiesel, 1959). In the present work this method is used to examine receptive fields of a more complex type (Part I) and to make additional observations on binocular interaction (Part II). This approach is necessary in order to understand the behaviour of individual cells, but it fails to deal with the problem of the relationship of one cell to its neighbours. In the past, the technique of recording evoked slow waves has been used with great success in studies of functional anatomy. It was employed by Talbot & Marshall (1941) and by Thompson, Woolsey & Talbot (1950) for mapping out the visual cortex in the rabbit, cat, and monkey. Daniel & Whitteiidge (1959) have recently extended this work in the primate. Most of our present knowledge of retinotopic projections, binocular overlap, and the second visual area is based on these investigations. Yet the method of evoked potentials is valuable mainly for detecting behaviour common to large populations of neighbouring cells; it cannot differentiate functionally between areas of cortex smaller than about 1 mm2. To overcome this difficulty a method has in recent years been developed for studying cells separately or in small groups during long micro-electrode penetrations through nervous tissue. Responses are correlated with cell location by reconstructing the electrode tracks from histological material. These techniques have been applied to"

He described a woman suffering from blindness of the lower left quadrants of both visual fields who was subsequently found to have a lesion limited to the dorsal half of the right LGN. Actually these early observations are not in accord with the later experimental studies on primates by Brouwer and subsequent workers (see below). Further early human clinico-pathological observations were made by Wilbrand & Saenger (1904), Ronne (1913, 1914) and Winkler (1912), but the extreme rarity of sufficiently restricted lesions, particularly in the nucleus itself, made it unlikely that the details of the retinotopic projection in the LGN would be unravelled in this way. By enucleating the eye of a cat and studying the distribution of the secondary degeneration in each LGN, Minkowski (1913) provided the first direct experimental evidence that the crossed and uncrossed optic fibres were distributed differently in the nucleus (cf. Minkowski, 1920) and that the binocular part of a visual field projected only to the medial part. The first detailed study of the retinotopic projection in the LGN was, however, carried out by Brouwer and his colleagues (Brouwer, Zeeman & Houwer, 1923). By making small retinal lesions and subsequently studying the degenerating fibres in Marchi preparations they established the quadrantic projections ofthe retina in the rabbit and cat and the quadrantic and intraquandrantic projections of the central and peripheral retinal segments in the monkey (Brouwer & Zeeman, 1925, 1926; Overbosch, 1927). Further details in respect to the monkey were added by Brody (1934), Penman"

The two most massive connections originate mainly from layer III. These are the interlaminar fibers terminating in the underlying layer V, and the systematically arranged projection upon area 18. Another cortical projection upon a narrow region in the superior temporal sulcus originates mainly from the infragranular layers, from which originate also the fibers passing to three subcortical structures, viz. the colliculus superior, the medial pulvinar and the griseum pontis. These subcortical projections are sparse compared to the interlaminar and cortico\u2010cortical connections. In particular, no evidence was obtained that the lateral geniculate nucleus receives fibers from the lateral striate cortex. Lesions injuring the white matter, however, produced, in addition, anterograde degeneration in the nucleus praetectalis, three pulvinar nuclei, the lateral geniculate nucleus and the pregeniculate nucleus. This degeneration must have resulted from the interruption of fibers originating in areas other than the lateral striate cortex, and passing beneath the site of the lesion."
