The need to analyze large amounts of multivariate data raises the fundamental problem of dimensionality reduction: how to discover compact representations of high-dimensional data. Here, we introduce locally linear embedding (LLE), an unsupervised learning algorithm that computes low-dimensional, neighborhood-preserving embeddings of high-dimensional inputs. Unlike clustering methods for local dimensionality reduction, LLE maps its inputs into a single global coordinate system of lower dimensionality, and its optimizations do not involve local minima. By exploiting the local symmetries of linear reconstructions, LLE is able to learn the global structure of nonlinear manifolds, such as those generated by images of faces or documents of text."

We also present an error analysis of our algorithm showing that reconstruction errors can be quite small in some cases. We illustrate our algorithm using curves and surfaces both in 2D/3D Euclidean spaces and higher dimensional Euclidean spaces.

The human brain confronts the same problem in everyday perception, extracting from its high-dimensional sensory inputs-30,000 auditory nerve fibers or 10(6) optic nerve fibers-a manageably small number of perceptually relevant features. Here we describe an approach to solving dimensionality reduction problems that uses easily measured local metric information to learn the underlying global geometry of a data set. Unlike classical techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA) and multidimensional scaling (MDS), our approach is capable of discovering the nonlinear degrees of freedom that underlie complex natural observations, such as human handwriting or images of a face under different viewing conditions. In contrast to previous algorithms for nonlinear dimensionality reduction, ours efficiently computes a globally optimal solution, and, for an important class of data manifolds, is guaranteed to converge asymptotically to the true structure."

Whereas spectral embedding methods provided only coordinates for the training points, the analysis justifies a simple extension to out-of-sample examples (the Nystrm formula) for multidimensional scaling (MDS), spectral clustering, Laplacian eigenmaps, locally linear embedding (LLE), and Isomap. The analysis provides, for all such spectral embedding methods, the definition of a loss function, whose empirical average is minimized by the traditional algorithms. The asymptotic expected value of that loss defines a generalization performance and clarifies what these algorithms are trying to learn. Experiments with LLE, Isomap, spectral clustering, and MDS show that this out-of-sample embedding formula generalizes well, with a level of error comparable to the effect of small perturbations of the training set on the embedding."

This paper provides a unified framework for extending Local Linear Embedding (LLE), Isomap, Laplacian Eigenmaps, Multi-Dimensional Scaling (for dimensionality reduction) as well as for Spectral Clustering. This framework is based on seeing these algorithms as learning eigenfunctions of a data-dependent kernel. Numerical experiments show that the generalizations performed have a level of error comparable to the variability of the embedding algorithms due to the choice of training data."

                "text": "Graph structures have proven computationally cumbersome for pattern analysis. The reason for this is that, before graphs can be converted to pattern vectors, correspondences must be established between the nodes of structures which are potentially of different size. To overcome this problem, in this paper, we turn to the spectral decomposition of the Laplacian matrix. We show how the elements of the spectral matrix for the Laplacian can be used to construct symmetric polynomials that are permutation invariants. The coefficients of these polynomials can be used as graph features which can be encoded in a vectorial manner. We extend this representation to graphs in which there are unary attributes on the nodes and binary attributes on the edges by using the spectral decomposition of a Hermitian property matrix that can be viewed as a complex analogue of the Laplacian. To embed the graphs in a pattern space, we explore whether the vectors of invariants can be embedded in a low-dimensional space using a number of alternative strategies, including principal components analysis (PCA), multidimensional scaling (MDS), and locality preserving projection (LPP). Experimentally, we demonstrate that the embeddings result in well-defined graph clusters. Our experiments with the spectral representation involve both synthetic and real-world data. The experiments with synthetic data demonstrate that the distances between spectral feature vectors can be used to discriminate between graphs on the basis of their structure. The real-world experiments show that the method can be used to locate clusters of graphs."

First. there are a wide variety of algorithms that use the eigenvectors in slightly different ways. Second, many of these algorithms have no proof that they will actually compute a reasonable clustering. In this paper, we present a simple spectral clustering algorithm that can be implemented using a few lines of Matlab. Using tools from matrix perturbation theory, we analyze the algorithm, and give conditions under which it can be expected to do well. We also show surprisingly good experimental results on a number of challenging clustering problems."

As compared with previous approaches to principal curves and surfaces, the new method offers several advantages: first, it provides a practical solution to the model selection problem because all parameters can be estimated by leave-one-out cross-validation without additional computational cost. In addition, our approach allows for a convenient incorporation of nonlinear spectral methods for parameter initialization, beyond classical initializations based on linear PCA. Furthermore, it shows a simple way to fit principal surfaces in general feature spaces, beyond the usual data space setup. The experimental results illustrate these convenient features on simulated and real data."

Rather than focusing on local features and their consistencies in the image data, our approach aims at extracting the global impression of an image. We treat image segmentation as a graph partitioning problem and propose a novel global criterion, the normalized cut, for segmenting the graph. The normalized cut criterion measures both the total dissimilarity between the different groups as well as the total similarity within the groups. We show that an efficient computational technique based on a generalized eigenvalue problem can be used to optimize this criterion. We have applied this approach to segmenting static images and found results very encouraging."

                "text": "In this paper we give approximation algorithms for several proximity problems in high dimensional spaces. In particular, we give the first Las Vegas data structure for (1 + e)nearest neighbor with polynomial space and query time polynomial in dimension d and log n, where n is the database size. We also give a deterministic 3-approximation algorithm with similar bounds; this is the first deterministic constant factor approximation algorithm (with polynomial space) for any norm. For the closest pair problem we give a roughly n I+p time Las Vegas algorithm with approximation factor O(1/plog l/p); this is the first Las Vegas algorithm for this problem. Finally, we show a general reduction from the furthest point problem to the nearest neighbor problem. As a corollary, we improve the running time for the (1 + e)approximate diameter problem from n 2-\u00b0(~2) to n 2-\u00b0(~). Our results are unified by the fact that their key component is a dimensionality reduction technique for Hamming spaces. 1 I n t r o d u c t i o n The proximity problems is a class of geometric problems which involve the notion of a distance between points in a d-dimensional space. For example, the closest pair problem, furthest pair (or diameter) problem and nearest neighbor search all belong to this class. If the dimension d is low, these problems have very efficient solutions [13, 3, 12]. However, the running time and/or space requirements of these algorithms grow exponentially with the dimension. This is unfortunate, since the high-dimensional versions of the above problems are of major and growing importance to a variety of applications, usually involving similarity search or clustering; some examples are information retrievM, image and video databases, vector quantization, data mining and pattern recognition. Therefore, a lot of recent ~ p o r t e d by Stanford Graduate Fellowship and NSF Grant IIS-9811904 research focused on approximate algorithms for these problems [4, 10, 7, 11, 6, 2]; this relaxation enables to overcome the \"curse of dimensional i ty ' . In this paper we present several new results for the aforementioned proximity problems. They are unified by the fact that their key component is a dimensionality reduction technique for Hamming spaces (which we describe in more detail at the end of this Section). O u r r esu l t s . The first problem we address is the cnearest neighbor problem. In this problem the goal is to construct (for a given set P of n points from R d) a data structure, which given a query point q, finds any c-approximate nearest neighbor of q in P; the latter is defined as any point p/whose distance to q is bounded by c times the distance from q to its nearest neighbor in P. Several algorithms have been proposed recently for this problem for the cases when the similarity between points is measured by a dot-product [4], ll or 12 norm [10, 7, 11] and lc~ norm [6]. The intriguing common property of almost all of them [4, 10, 7, 11] is that they are randomized Monte Carlo, i.e. have small probability of returning an incorrect answer (the solution of [6] is deterministic, but unlike other solutions does not allow arbitrarily small approximation error). This situation stands in the contrast with the state of the art in lowdimensional Computat ion Geometry, where virtually almost all randomized algorithms are of Las Vegas type (i.e. whose correctness is always guaranteed). Thus one may ask if randomization, in particular of Monte Carlo type, is an inherent property of algorithms for high-dimensional proximity problems. We mention that from the practical perspective the Las Vegas algorithms offer a significant advantage over the Monte Carlo ones (if their running times is comparable) for the following reason: it was observed [1, 5] tha t the average error incurred by the algorithms is much lower than predicted by theoretical analysis. Therefore, one can significantly speed them up by setting artificiMly high upper bound for the error. However, a Monte Carlo algorithm canno~"

The method is based on approximating the netlist or hypergraph by a weighted graph G, such that the sum of the cut edges in G tightly underestimates the number of cut nets in any netlist partition. An eigenvector technique is used to partition the graph G into k blocks of fixed module size. Another feature of this graph underestimation model of the netlist is that it allows one to obtain lower bounds on the actual number of cut nets. A multiblock node interchange heuristic is tested on the one resulting netlist partition obtained by this eigenvector approach on a variety of small to large sized benchmark netlist partitioning problems (between 300 to 12000 modules and nets). Test results on the larger netlists show that in most cases this eigenvector-node interchange approach yields netlist partitions with comparable or fewer cut nets than the best netlist partitions obtained by using node interchange heuristics alone on many random initial netlist partitions. >"

Encoded in DNA and active only in genetically specified target cells, these proteins provide selective optical interfaces for observing and controlling signaling by defined groups of neurons in functioning circuits, in vitro and in vivo. Light-emitting sensors of neuronal activity (reporting calcium increase, neurotransmitter release, or membrane depolarization) have begun to reveal how information is represented by neuronal assemblies, and how these representations are transformed during the computations that inform behavior. Light-driven actuators control the electrical activities of central neurons in freely moving animals and establish causal connections between the activation of specific neurons and the expression of particular behaviors. Anchored within mathematical systems and control theory, the combination of finely resolved optical field sensing and finely resolved optical field actuation will open new dimensions for the analysis of the connectivity, dynamics, and plasticity of neuronal circuits, and perhaps even for replacing lost--or designing novel--functionalities."

                "text": "The increased incidence of Type I and Type II diabetes among adults and adolescents is a growing public health concern worldwide. The primary objective of diabetes mellitus management involves keeping glycemia levels within the euglycemic range to prevent a variety of serious health complications. Unfortunately, daily self-monitoring is both a requirement and a problem for many patients with diabetes, particularly children and adolescents. Studies have shown that as many as 43% of adolescents and 30% of children (<14 years old) regularly forget to use glycemic tests and are significantly poorer at recognizing and reporting symptoms and signs of hypoglycemia/hyperglycemia. For this reason, methods for noninvasive, continuous monitoring that can signal glycemic status to a parent, teacher, or other caregiver would improve the care and management of symptoms of diabetes among these individuals. The goal of this review is to describe and evaluate electronic olfaction technology (\"electronic nose\") for monitoring the presence and levels of volatile chemicals from human body and breath that can be used to evaluate status of diabetes. The review is organized in four sections. The first section reviews the chemistry of the volatile signals that are produced by the body that are indicative of metabolic status. The second section provides an overview of novel sensor technology, e.g., \"electronic olfaction,\" that mimics the biological olfactory system and can be used to monitor and identify complex plumes of volatiles that are signatures of metabolic states. The third section reviews studies that have employed electronic \"nose\" technology for diagnosis and monitoring of diabetes via urine and breath, and the final section discusses needed future directions for the development of olfactory-based metabolic monitoring, particularly among noncompliant populations."

                "text": "0 Introduction In [1] Tenenbaum, de Silva and Langford consider the problem of non-linear dimensionality reduction: discovering intrinsically low-dimensional structures embedded in high-dimensional data sets. They describe an algorithm, called Isomap, and demonstrate its successful application to several real and synthetic data sets. In this paper, we discuss some of the theoretical claims for Isomap made in [1]. In particular, we give a full proof of the asymptotic convergence theorem referred to in that paper. Isomap deals with finite data sets of points in R n which are assumed to lie on a smooth submanifold M d of low dimension d < n. The algorithm attempts to recover M given only the data points. A crucial stage in the algorithm involves estimating the unknown geodesic distance in M between data points in terms of the graph distance with respect to some graph G constructed on the data points. We show that the two distance metrics approximate each other arbitrarily closely, as the density of data points tends to infinity. Main Theorem A * The authors are listed alphabetically."
