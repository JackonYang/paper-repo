We propose to model this process using hierarchical Markov random field (HMRF), and suggest a broader view that clique potentials in MRF models can be used to encode any local decision rules. A topology-dependent multiscale hierarchy is used to introduce long range interaction. The operations within each level are identical across the hierarchy. The clique parameters that encode the relative importance of these decision rules are estimated using an optimization technique called learning from rehearsals based on 2-object training samples. We find that this model generalizes successfully to 5-object test images, and that depth segregation can be completed within two traversals across the hierarchy. This computational framework therefore provides an interesting platform for us to investigate the interaction of local decision rules and global representations, as well as to reason about the rationales underlying some of recent psychological and neurophysiological findings related to figure-ground segregation."

Convexity has a stronger influence on figural organization than other global shape properties, such as symmetry (G. Kanizsa, 1979), and yet there has been very little work on convexity properties in computer vision. We present a model for figure/ground segregation which exhibits a preference for convex regions as the figure (i.e., the foreground). The model also shows a preference for smaller regions to be selected as figures, which is also known to hold for human visual perception (K. Koffka, 1935). The model is based on the machinery of Markov random fields/random walks/diffusion processes, so that the global shape properties are obtained via local and stochastic computations. Experimental results demonstrate that our model performs well on ambiguous figure/ground displays which were not captured before. In particular in ambiguous displays where neither region is strictly convex, the model shows preference to the \"more convex\" region, thus offering a continuous measure of convexity in agreement with human perception."

Potential completions are generated by building a constrained Delaunay triangulation (CDT) over the set of contours found by a local edge detector. Maximum likelihood parameters for the model are learned from human labeled ground truth. Using held out test data, we measure how the model, by incorporating continuity structure, improves boundary detection over the local edge detector. We also compare performance with a baseline local classifier that operates on pairs of edgels. Both algorithms consistently dominate the low-level boundary detector at all thresholds. To our knowledge, this is the first time that curvilinear continuity has been shown quantitatively useful for a large variety of natural images. Better boundary detection has immediate application in the problem of object detection and recognition"

For any given visual scene, a sparse graph is constructed whose nodes are salient visual events such as contrast edges, and L-type and T-type junctions of contrast edges and whose arcs are coincidence and geometric configurational relations among node elements. An interpretation of the scene consists of choices among a small set of labels for graph elements reflecting physical events such as corners, visible surface occlusion, amodal continuation, and surface occlusion sans visible contrast edge (which perceptually give rise to illusory contours). Any given labeling induces an energy, or cost, associated with physical consistency and figural interpretation biases. Using the technique of deterministic annealing, optimization is performed such that local cues propagate smoothly to give rise to a global solution. We demonstrate that this approach leads to correct interpretations (in the sense of agreeing with human percepts) of popular simple \u201ccolorforms\u201d, figures known to induce illusory contours, as well as more difficult figures where interpretations acknowledging accidental alignment are preferred."

Amodal completions emerge at the overlapping surfaces. We address the problem of selecting the best image organization (set of hypothesis). We propose an optimization criteria based on a coherence measure between pairs of junctions (correlation between the diffusion of each pair). A statistical physics approach to select the best organization is applied.

The authors present a computational model of contour processing that was suggested by neurophysiological recordings from the monkey visual cortex. The model uses convolutions and nonlinear operations, but no feedback loops. Contours are defined by the local maxima of the responses of a contour operator that sums a representation of contrast borders and a grouping signal. The grouping consists of convolving a representation of key-points, such as T-junctions, corners, and line ends, with a set of orientation selective kernels, and a nonlinear pairing operation. The grouping scheme is selective based on whether the configuration of key-points is consistent with the interpretation of occlusion. The resulting contour representation includes an indicator of figure-ground direction. It is shown that the model reproduces illusory contours in accurate agreement with perception and generates representations of occluding contours on images of natural scenes that are more complete and less cluttered by spurious connections of foreground and background than those obtained by conventional edge detection operators.<<ETX>>"

The rapidity with which we can discriminate the inside from the outside of a figure suggests that at least this step in the process may be performed in visual cortex by a large number of neurons in several different areas working together in parallel. We have attempted to simulate this collective computation by designing a network of simple processing units that receives two types of information: bottom-up input from the image containing the outlines of a figure, which may be incomplete, and a top-down attentional input that biases one part of the image to be the inside of the figure. No presegmentation of the image was assumed. Two methods for performing the computation were explored: gradient descent, which seeks locally optimal states, and simulated annealing, which attempts to find globally optimal states by introducing noise into the computation. For complete outlines, gradient descent was faster, but the range of input parameters leading to successful performance was very narrow. In contrast, simulated annealing was more robust: it worked over a wider range of attention parameters and a wider range of outlines, including incomplete ones. Our network model is too simplified to serve as a model of human performance, but it does demonstrate that one global property of outlines can be computed through local interactions in a parallel network. Some features of the model, such as the role of noise in escaping from nonglobal optima, may generalize to more realistic models."

Some focus on the image-label mapping, while others focus solely on patterns within the label field. Components also differ in their scale, as some focus on fine-resolution patterns while others on coarser, more global structure. A supervised version of the contrastive divergence algorithm is applied to learn these features from labeled image data. We demonstrate performance on two real-world image databases and compare it to a classifier and a Markov random field."

The interest in junctions can be attributed in part to the notion that they are local image features that are easy to detect but that nonetheless provide valuable information about important events in the world, such as occlusion and transparency. Here I test the notion that there are locally defined junctions in real images that might be detected with simple, early visual mechanisms. Human observers were used as a tool to measure the visual information available in local regions of real images. One set of observers was made to label all the points in a set of real images where one edge occluded another. A second set of observers was presented with variable-size circular subregions of these images, and was asked to judge whether the regions were centered on an occlusion point. This task is easy if junctions are visible, but I found performance to be poor for small regions, not approaching ceiling levels until observers were given fairly large (approximately 50 pixels in diameter) regions over which to make the judgment. Control experiments ruled out the possibility that the effects are just due to junctions at multiple scales. Experiments reported here suggest that, although some junctions in real images are locally defined and can be detected with simple mechanisms, a substantial fraction necessitate the use of more complex and global processes. This raises the possibility that junctions in such cases may not be detected prior to scene interpretation."

Our representation for a shape is a discrete set of n points sampled from its internal and external contours. For each of these points, the shape context is a histogram of the relative positions of the n - 1 remaining points. We present two methods for rapid shape retrieval: one that does comparisons based on a small number of shape contexts and another that uses vector quantization in the space of shape contexts. We verify the discriminative power of these methods with tests on the Columbia (COIL-100) 3D object database and the Snodgrass and Vanderwart line drawings. The shape context-based methods are shown to quickly produce an accurate shortlist of candidates suitable for a more exact matching engine in spite of pose variation and occlusion."

The discriminative random fields offer several advantages over the conventional Markov random field (MRF) framework. First, the DRFs allow to relax the strong assumption of conditional independence of the observed data generally used in the MRF framework for tractability. This assumption is too restrictive for a large number of applications in vision. Second, the DRFs derive their classification power by exploiting the probabilistic discriminative models instead of the generative models used in the MRF framework. Finally, all the parameters in the DRF model are estimated simultaneously from the training data unlike the MRF framework where likelihood parameters are usually learned separately from the field parameters. We illustrate the advantages of the DRFs over the MRF framework in an application of man-made structure detection in natural images taken from the Corel database."

A square patch of the screen was made to perceptually pop out as a circumscribed figure by virtue of differences between the orientation or the direction of motion of the texture elements within that patch and the surround. The animals were trained to identify the figure patches by making saccadic eye movements towards their positions. Almost every cell gave a significantly larger response to elements belonging to the figure than to similar elements belonging to the background. The figure- ground response enhancement was present along the entire extent of the patch and was absent as soon as the receptive field was outside the patch. The strength of the effect had no relation with classical receptive field properties like orientation or direction selectivity or receptive field size. The response enhancement had a latency of 30\u201340 msec relative to the onset of the neuronal response itself. The results show that context modulation within primary visual cortex has a highly sophisticated nature, putting the image features the cells are responding to into their fully evaluated perceptual context."

                "text": "Areas V1 and V2 of the visual cortex have traditionally been conceived as stages of local feature representations. We investigated whether neural responses carry information about how local features belong to objects. Single-cell activity was recorded in areas V1, V2, and V4 of awake behaving monkeys. Displays were used in which the same local feature (contrast edge or line) could be presented as part of different figures. For example, the same light\u2013dark edge could be the left side of a dark square or the right side of a light square. Each display was also presented with reversed contrast. We found significant modulation of responses as a function of the side of the figure in >50% of neurons of V2 and V4 and in 18% of neurons of the top layers of V1. Thus, besides the local contrast border information, neurons were found to encode the side to which the border belongs (\u201cborder ownership coding\u201d). A majority of these neurons coded border ownership and the local polarity of luminance\u2013chromaticity contrast. The others were insensitive to contrast polarity. Another 20% of the neurons of V2 and V4, and 48% of top layer V1, coded local contrast polarity, but not border ownership. The border ownership-related response differences emerged soon (<25 msec) after the response onset. In V2 and V4, the differences were found to be nearly independent of figure size up to the limit set by the size of our display (21\u00b0). Displays that differed only far outside the conventional receptive field could produce markedly different responses. When tested with more complex displays in which figure-ground cues were varied, some neurons produced invariant border ownership signals, others failed to signal border ownership for some of the displays, but neurons that reversed signals were rare. The influence of visual stimulation far from the receptive field center indicates mechanisms of global context integration. The short latencies and incomplete cue invariance suggest that the border-ownership effect is generated within the visual cortex rather than projected down from higher levels."

Conditional random fields also avoid a fundamental limitation of maximum entropy Markov models (MEMMs) and other discriminative Markov models based on directed graphical models, which can be biased towards states with few successor states. We present iterative parameter estimation algorithms for conditional random fields and compare the performance of the resulting models to HMMs and MEMMs on synthetic and natural-language data."

Results in wide baseline stereo correspondence, face detection, and feature correspondence are included."
