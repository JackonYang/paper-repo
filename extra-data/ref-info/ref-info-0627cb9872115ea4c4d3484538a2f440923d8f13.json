First, a general principle of time-normalization is given using time-warping function. Then, two time-normalized distance definitions, called symmetric and asymmetric forms, are derived from the principle. These two forms are compared with each other through theoretical discussions and experimental studies. The symmetric form algorithm superiority is established. A new technique, called slope constraint, is successfully introduced, in which the warping function slope is restricted so as to improve discrimination between words in different categories. The effective slope constraint characteristic is qualitatively analyzed, and the optimum slope constraint condition is determined through experiments. The optimized algorithm is then extensively subjected to experimental comparison with various DP-algorithms, previously applied to spoken word recognition by different research groups. The experiment shows that the present algorithm gives no more than about two-thirds errors, even compared to the best conventional algorithm."

The parallel processing simulator, originally written for an IBM 7094 system, has now been rewritten for a CDC 3600 system. This paper describes briefly the structure of syntactic descriptive models by considering their specific application to bubble chamber pictures. How the description generated in this phase can be embedded in a larger \u201cconversation\u201d program is explained by means of a certain specific example that has been worked out. A partial generative grammar for \u201chandwritten\u201d English letters is given, as are also a few computer-generated outputs using this grammar and the parallel processing simulator mentioned earlier."

The resulting strokes and other shapes are mapped, using a shape-clustering approach, into binary features which are then fed into a statistical Bayesian classifier. Large-scale trials have shown better than 97 percent top choice correct performance on mixtures of six dissimilar fonts, and over 99 percent on most single fonts, over a range of point sizes. Certain remaining confusion classes are disambiguated through contour analysis, and characters suspected of being merged are broken and reclassified. Finally, layout and linguistic context are applied. The results are illustrated by sample pages."

This program consists of two subroutines: (1) to search for logic circuits having certain constraints on hardware design, and (2) to evaluate these logics in terms of their discriminating ability over samples of the character set they are expected to recognize. An executive routine is used to apply these subroutines to select a complete logic with a given performance and complexity. This logic consists of 39 to 96 AND gates connected to a shift register and a table look-up or resistance network comparison system. \n \nThe methods were applied to the design of recognitionl ogics for the 52 upper and lower case characters of IBM Electric Modern Pica type font and lower case Cyrillic characters scanned from Russian text. In both cases when the logics were tested on data different from that used to design the logics, the substitution rate was about one error per thousand. A single logic was designed to read two different Cyrillic fonts. For this design, an error rate of one error per hundred characters was observed. \n \nSeveral experiments are reported ona number of logics designed for typewritten data, and single- and two-font Cyrillic data. The performances of different recognitionsy stems are compared as a function of the complexity of the recognition logics."

One classifies samples based on structural features extracted from their skeletons; the other makes use of their contours. Both methods achieve high recognition rates (86.05%, 93.90%) and low substitution rates (2.25%, 1.60%). To take advantage of the inherent complementarity of the two methods, different ways of combining them are studied. It is shown that it is possible to reduce the substitution rate to 0.70%, while the recognition rate remains as high as 92.00% . Furthermore, if reliability is of utmost importance, one can avoid substitutions completely (reliability 100%) and still retain a fairly high recognition rate (84.85%).<<ETX>>"

Each of these simulated machines has read documents containing rows of handwritten Arabic numbers. Sample numbers were produced by at least 20 people for each simulation study. The three machines simulated differ in the control required of the writer during document preparation and in the complexity of the machines. Writing controls were required for the preparation of the first two types of documents. A section of this paper concerns experiments with and a mathematical model of controlled writing. The third simulated machine was applied both to numbers written within preprinted boxes and to numbers written without any guide marks. About one per cent of 2180 of these numbers were misread as the wrong character. This error rate is based on a sequential experiment in which the recognition logic is constructed from all characters not recognized and thus rejected prior to each input character. Numbers, when rejected, cause the programn to identify them from a table. Their structure is then entered into the recognition logic. The rejection rate decreased throughout the experiment. The last rejection rate was about 10 per cent."

Next a number of regular expressions are defined which characterize each class of symbols, and the final recognition is performed by a finite automaton.

Given a high-resolution image of a handwritten address block, the solution invokes routines capable of hypothesizing the location of the ZIP code, segmenting and recognizing ZIP code digits, locating and recognizing city and state names, and looking up the results in a dictionary. The control structure is not strictly sequential, but rather in the form of a blackboard architecture that opportunistically invokes routines as needed. An implementation of the methodology is described as well as results with a database of grey-level images of handwritten addresses (taken from live mail in a US Postal Service mail processing facility). Future extensions of the approach are discussed.<<ETX>>"

                "text": "The paper describes a new method for the automatic recognition of patterns. The method may be applied to any form of spatial pattern, but in the present instance, patterns consisting of line figures are considered. The pattern is presented to a flying-spot scanner connected to a digital computer. The shape of the pattern is analysed and a statement is prepared describing the basic features of the pattern. The pattern is then recognized by comparing this statement with a number of others already stored in the computer which relate to named patterns. Patterns are recognized independently of the angle at which they are presented to the scanner, and may be of any size provided that limits imposed by the resolution of the scanner are not exceeded. The average time to recognize a character is 60 seconds with the system programmed on a medium-speed computer. Special-purpose equipment built to perform certain of the stages of the process, together with the use of higher-speed computers now envisaged, will reduce this time by at least a thousandfold. If a new pattern is presented to the machine it will indicate its inability to recognize the pattern, but by giving the machine the name of the pattern, it may become one of the standard patterns which it can subsequently recognize. All the patterns recognized by the machine are hand-drawn and consist of such symbols as the capital letters of the alphabet and numerals, although the system is in no way limited to any special set of characters. Using exactly the same method but with an increase in the degree of complexity, it will be possible for machines to read handwriting. Special allowances are made for imperfections in the patterns, including breaks and general ill-definition. Where there is some confusion and an unknown pattern resembles two or more of the standard patterns, the relative degrees of similarity of the unknown to each of these standard patterns is printed out by the machine."

This processing is done manually in many applications. Thus, such inputs as punched cards, magnetic tape, and punched paper tape often are the result of a manual processing operation in which a human being is required to inspect visually an array of printed characters and to describe these data in a form capable of being processed by machine. In recognition of the importance of automating such operations, many investigations have been undertaken to devise automatic character sensing equipment. Suppose, however, that we attempt to view such efforts in proper perspective. We find a more fundamental problem that has, heretofore, failed to receive the attention that it warrants. The problem is one of making directly available to a computer pictorial information which would ordinarily be visually processed by human beings before being fed to a data processing system. This pictorial information may range from such highly stylized forms as printed characters, diagrams, schematic drawings, emblems, and designs through less stylized forms in cartoons and handwritten characters to such highly amorphous forms as photographs of real objects, e.g., people, aerial views, and microscopic and telescopic images."

For isolated and possibly broken numerals, a syntactic recognition algorithm that utilizes features derived from the left and right profiles of the numerals is shown to yield fast and accurate recognition. Finally, an algorithm for segmenting connected handwritten numeral strings has been developed and is shown to yield accurate segmentation. The segmented numerals are then identified by the syntactic recognition system."

Since the SSA has no control over the means used by employers to prepare the reports, many variations in print quality present. This paper discusses the problems involved in planning and developing a system to read these reports and summarizes the design of the specialized video signal processing circuits and the character recognition logic that are used in the system. Two companion papers treat the latter topics in more detail. Also discussed in the paper is a management information system that permitted detailed analysis of experimental data and accelerated the development process."

The ordinary Fourier coefficients are difficult to use as input to categorizers because they contain factors dependent upon size and rotation as well as an arbitrary phase angle. From these Fourier coefficients, however, other more useful features can easily be derived. By using these derived property constants, a distinction can be made between genuine shape constants and constants representing size, location, and orientation. The usefulness of the method has been tested with a computer program that was used to classify 175 samples of handprinted letters, e.g., 7 sets of the 25 letters A to Z. In this test, 98 percent were correctly recognized when a simple nonoptimized decision method was used. The last section contains some considerations of the technical realizability of a fast preprocessing system for reading printed text."

It is usually assumed that the patterns considered are of bounded size, say each contained in a given rectangle. Thus a pattern may be defined as any subset of the points in the rectangle, namely, the subset of \"black\" points. The information given to the computer must be of finite length; usually the rectangle is covered by a finite number of cells, and the information to the computer amounts to signals indicating whether any given cell is white or black. Patterns used as prototypes may be, for example, a ring, the letter \"A\", or the like. The recognition of alphabetic and numerical characters is of particular practical importance. What constitutes \"similarity\" varies widely from ease to case, and the methods which the machine uses in recognizing similarity must vary accordingly. To give two extreme examples, one might call two patterns similar only if they agree point for point (or rather, cell for cell) ; or else, one might admit as similar two patterns which are topo-logically equivalent (after defining a suitable topology in the space of cells), so that e.g. any simple closed curve would be called similar to a circle. 3/fany intermediate definitions are possible. In particular, for the recognition of printed characters one will wish to admit as similar two patterns if they differ at most in the following respects: (A) Location (B) Size (C) \"Stretching\" and \"Squeezing\" in either X-or Y-direction. Mathematically , these are affine transformations preserving the X-and Y-directions, i.e., transformations of the form X* = aX + b, Y* = cY + d. The special ease a = c = 1 corresponds to translations, i.e. to (A). (D) While one might consider rotation through a small angle as admissible, rotations through large angles are obviously not; e.g. the characters \"6\" and \"9\" should be recognized as different. It seems preferable to omit rotation entirely and admit in its place \"slanting\" such as occurs in italic type by comparison with roman. Mathematically, this is characterized as an affine transformation which leaves the points of the X-axis fixed. Combinations of the transformations (A) and (D) ex-240"

The receptor makes certain measurements on the unknown pattern to be recognized; the categorizer determines from these measurements the particular allowable pattern class to which the unknown pattern belongs. This paper is concerned with the study of a particular class of categorizers, the linear decision function. The optimum linear decision function is the best linear approximation to the optimum decision function in the following sense: 1) \"Optimum\" is taken to mean minimum loss (which includes minimum error systems). 2) \"Linear\" is taken to mean that each pair of pattern classes is separated by one and only one hyperplane in the measurement space. This class of categorizers is of practical interest for two reasons: 1) It can be empirically designed without making any assumptions whatsoever about either the distribution of the receptor measurements or the a priori probabilities of occurrence of the pattern classes, providing an appropriate pattern source is available. 2) Its implementation is quite simple and inexpensive. Various properties of linear decision functions are discussed. One such property is that a linear decision function is guaranteed to perform at least as well as a minimum distance categorizer. Procedures are then developed for the estimation (or design) of the optimum linear decision function based upon an appropriate sampling from the pattern classes to be categorized."

                "text": "xThe ideas of information theory are at present stimulating many different areas of psychological inquiry. In providing techniques for quantifying situations which have hitherto been difficult or impossible to quantify, they suggest new and more precise ways of conceptualizing these situations (see Miller [12] for a general discussion and bibliography). Events ordered in time are particularly amenable to informational analysis; thus language sequences are being extensively studied, and other sequences, such as those of music, plainly invite research. In this paper I shall indicate some of the ways in which the concepts and techniques of information theory may clarify our understanding of visual perception. When we begin to consider perception as an information-handling process, it quickly becomes clear that much of the information received by any higher organism is redundant. Sensory events are highly interdependent in both space and time: if we know at a given moment the states of a limited number of receptors (i.e., whether they are firing or not firing), we can make better-than-chance inferences with respect to the prior and subsequent states of these receptors, and also with respect to the present, prior, and subsequent states of other receptors. The preceding statement, taken in its broadest im1 The experimental work for this study was performed as part of the United States Air Force Human Resources Research and Development Program.

In the present discussion, however, we shall restrict our attention to special types of lawfulness which may exist in space at a fixed time, and which seem particularly relevant to processes of visual perception."

Recognition of handwritten arabic numerals requires sufficient system flexibility to cope with both unlimited variations in character shape and a large number of writing instruments. This flexibility has been achieved by combining the use of a stored recognition table and a hardware microprogram. The recognition logic obtained by computer simulation is immediately stored in the core memory as a table. The numerals are recognized by extracting a sequence of the geometrical features in horizontal zones of the character after normalization of the height of the character and the width of the strokes. The use of sequential recognition logic helps reduce the capacity of core memory required to obtain the desired high rate of recognition. The correct recognition rate of a single digit for a large sample of letters averaged 95 percent. For a three-digit sorting with 13 stackers the sorter incorrectly recognized approximately 0.1 percent, a rate of error consistent with manual sorting."

A fundamental problem of statistical neurodynamics is considered in a way that is different from the spin-glass approach. A dynamic analysis of associative memory models and a general theory of neural learning, in which the learning potential function plays a role, are given. An advanced theory of learning and self-organization is proposed, covering backpropagation and its generalizations as well as the formation of topological maps and neural representations of information. >"

In dealing with a human being and a human society, we enjoy the luxury of being irrational, illogical, inconsistent, and incomplete, and yet of coping. In operating a computer, we must meet the rigorous requirements for detailed instructions and absolute precision. If we understood the ability of the human mind to make effective decisions when confronted by complexity, uncertainty, and irrationality then we could use computers a million times more effectively than we do. Recognition of this fact has been a motivation for the spurt of research in the field of neurophysiology. The more we study the information processing aspects of the mind, the more perplexed and impressed we become. It will be a very long time before we understand these processes sufficiently to reproduce them. In any case, the mathematician sees hundreds and thousands of formidable new problems in dozens of blossoming areas, puzzles galore, and challenges to his heart's content. He may never resolve some of these, but he will never be bored. What more can he ask?"

The starting point is a transparency, converted by a flying spot scanner into an array of about 6*105 points, with a six-bit grey scale. Preprocessing applies to each grey level a Laplacian operator extended to a suitable region, corresponding to a high pass filter. This makes the threshold selection less critical and partially restores the degradation of the imaging process. The boundary algorithm isolates connected regions of the array by following isodensity contours and codes the boundary using three successive chains. From these chains the arm tips and centromeres are localized. A symmetry index is defined to check the reliability of the localizations."

A curve is represented parametrically as a function of arc length by the accumulated change in direction of the curve since the starting point. This function is expanded in a Fourier series and the coefficients are arranged in the amplitude/phase-angle form. It is shown that the amplitudes are pure form invariants as well as are certain simple functions of phase angles. Rotational and axial symmetry are related directly to simple properties of the Fourier descriptors. An analysis of shape similarity or symmetry can be based on these relationships; also closed symmetric curves can be synthesized from almost arbitrary Fourier descriptors. It is established that the Fourier series expansion is optimal and unique with respect to obtaining coefficients insensitive to starting point. Several examples are provided to indicate the usefulness of Fourier descriptors as features for shape discrimination and a number of interesting symmetric curves are generated by computer and plotted out."

                "text": "A theory of edge detection is presented. The analysis proceeds in two parts. (1) Intensity changes, which occur in a natural image over a wide range of scales, are detected separately at different scales. An appropriate filter for this purpose at a given scale is found to be the second derivative of a Gaussian, and it is shown that, provided some simple conditions are satisfied, these primary filters need not be orientation-dependent. Thus, intensity changes at a given scale are best detected by finding the zero values of \u22072G(x, y)* I(x, y) for image I, where G(x, y) is a two-dimensional Gaussian distribution and \u22072 is the Laplacian. The intensity changes thus discovered in each of the channels are then represented by oriented primitives called zero-crossing segments, and evidence is given that this representation is complete. (2) Intensity changes in images arise from surface discontinuities or from reflectance or illumination boundaries, and these all have the property that they are spatially localized. Because of this, the zero-crossing segments from the different channels are not independent, and rules are deduced for combining them into a description of the image. This description is called the raw primal sketch. The theory explains several basic psychophysical findings, and the operation of forming oriented zero-crossing segments from the output of centre-surround \u22072G filters acting on the image forms the basis for a physiological model of simple cells (see Marr & Ullman 1979)."

A fundamental theorem is established to relate such moment invariants to the well-known algebraic invariants. Complete systems of moment invariants under translation, similitude and orthogonal transformations are derived. Some moment invariants under general two-dimensional linear transformations are also included. Both theoretical formulation and practical models of visual pattern recognition based upon these moment invariants are discussed. A simple simulation program together with its performance are also presented. It is shown that recognition of geometrical patterns and alphabetical characters independently of position, size and orientation can be accomplished. It is also indicated that generalization is possible to include invariance with parallel projection."

The representation, which has practical storage requirements, provides a rapid means of searching large files for data associated with geometric position as well as with attribute value. An application of this representation to handling terrain information illustrates its utility. The algebraic properties of the data structure make it computationally easy to determine whether a point lies within a closed boundary; compute the area contained by a closed boundary; generate the closed boundary representing the union or intersection of two closed boundaries; and determine the neighboring boundaries to a point and the minimum distances between them and the point."

The quasi-topological structure is analyzed in a hierarchical way, and algebraic structure is presented explicitly on each representation level. The lower-level representations are integrated into the higher-level one in the systematic way. When a curve has singular points (branch points), the curve is decomposed into components each of which is a simple arc or a simple closed curve by decomposing each singular point. The description scheme is applied to character recognition."
