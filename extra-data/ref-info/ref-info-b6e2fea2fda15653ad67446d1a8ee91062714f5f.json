It has been suggested2 that the after-effect of exposing an eye to a moving stimulus (the waterfall illusion; see preceding communication) may be caused by the reduction of maintained discharge of the directionally sensitive retinal ganglion cells which were stimulated during the period of inspection, leaving the maintained activity of those which would signal the reverse motion unbalanced. If this is correct, then pressure blinding the eye during the period immediately following stimulation should abolish the effect. Unfortunately, one is not clearly aware of the movement illusion if there are no objects that one can see as moving, and pressure blinding prevents seeing. One therefore has to perform the test on the illusion transferred to objects seen with the other eye. Incidentally, it is interesting to note that the existence of this transfer has often been taken as convincing evidence for the central origin of the after-effects, but the transfer would be explicable on the hypothesis that it is due to suppression of maintained discharge even if this occurred only in the retina."

It would be astonishing if such a structure did not profoundly modify the response patterns of fibres coming into it. In the cat's visual cortex, the receptive field arrangements of single cells suggest that there is indeed a degree of complexity far exceeding anything yet seen at lower levels in the visual system. In a previous paper we described receptive fields of single cortical cells, observing responses to spots of light shone on one or both retinas (Hubel & Wiesel, 1959). In the present work this method is used to examine receptive fields of a more complex type (Part I) and to make additional observations on binocular interaction (Part II). This approach is necessary in order to understand the behaviour of individual cells, but it fails to deal with the problem of the relationship of one cell to its neighbours. In the past, the technique of recording evoked slow waves has been used with great success in studies of functional anatomy. It was employed by Talbot & Marshall (1941) and by Thompson, Woolsey & Talbot (1950) for mapping out the visual cortex in the rabbit, cat, and monkey. Daniel & Whitteiidge (1959) have recently extended this work in the primate. Most of our present knowledge of retinotopic projections, binocular overlap, and the second visual area is based on these investigations. Yet the method of evoked potentials is valuable mainly for detecting behaviour common to large populations of neighbouring cells; it cannot differentiate functionally between areas of cortex smaller than about 1 mm2. To overcome this difficulty a method has in recent years been developed for studying cells separately or in small groups during long micro-electrode penetrations through nervous tissue. Responses are correlated with cell location by reconstructing the electrode tracks from histological material. These techniques have been applied to"
