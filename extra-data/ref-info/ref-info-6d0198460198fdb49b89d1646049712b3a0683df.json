Robert Louis Stevenson, in an essay on Talk and Talkers, uses the phrase \" flies of obvious error in the amber of truth \", and such a phrase would seem to sum up this book, since it is bound in amber paper and contains a series of twenty experiments designed to show that things are not always what they seem. Some of these experiments are complex and difficult to describe without the accompanying figures; a simple one, however, is the radial motion demonstration. In this, an illuminated white square whose size can be varied is mounted on a black background, and observed monocularly as it is moved forwards and backwards through a distance of 6 ft. in a darkened room. Different effects can be produced according to the relationship between the movement and the size of the square and it is possible-among other effects -to produce the illusion that the square is motionless when it is actually coming towards the observer. Each demonstration is fully described and is accompanied by scale drawings to show how the apparatus for producing it is made. After reading the descriptions, one is left with the hope that some enterprising physiologist with a taste for carpentry will be tempted into making at any rate some of the models, because they show in convincing fashion the bases of visual judgment. One of these models, the \" leaf room \", which was demonstrated at the 1950 International Congress, showed the distortion produced by aniseikonic lenses."

The rapid increase in the amount of published experimental work has made all such books out of date, and the teacher of experimental psychology has been forced to use seriously incomplete text-books and to supplement them in his teaching by his own knowledge of the technical journals. The task of making a single volume representive of the present position of experimental psychology seemed too laborious for accomplishment. This, however, has now been done by Prof. R. S. Woodworth, and his book will be welcomed by all students of the subject.Experimental PsychologyBy Robert S. Woodworth. Pp. xi + 889. (London: Methuen and Co., Ltd., 1938.) 18s. net."
