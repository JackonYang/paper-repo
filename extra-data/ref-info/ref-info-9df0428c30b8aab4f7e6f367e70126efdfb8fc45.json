                "text": "This paper reports the first phase of a research program on visual perception of motion patterns characteristic of living organisms in locomotion. Such motion patterns in animals and men are termed here as biological motion. They are characterized by a far higher degree of complexity than the patterns of simple mechanical motions usually studied in our laboratories. In everyday perceptions, the visual information from biological motion and from the corresponding figurative contour patterns (the shape of the body) are intermingled. A method for studying information from the motion pattern per se without interference with the form aspect was devised. In short, the motion of the living body was represented by a few bright spots describing the motions of the main joints. It is found that 10\u201312 such elements in adequate motion combinations in proximal stimulus evoke a compelling impression of human walking, running, dancing, etc. The kinetic-geometric model for visual vector analysis originally developed in the study of perception of motion combinations of the mechanical type was applied to these biological motion patterns. The validity of this model in the present context was experimentally tested and the results turned out to be highly positive."

The author has analyzed the computations performed in the course of visual motion analysis. Workable schemes able to perform certain tasks performed by the visual system have been constructed and used as vehicles for investigating the problems faced by the visual system and its methods for solving them.Two major problems are treated: first, the correspondence problem, which concerns the identification of image elements that represent the same object at different times, thereby maintaining the perceptual identity of the object in motion or in change. The second problem is the three-dimensional interpretation of the changing image once a correspondence has been established.The author's computational approach to visual theory makes the work unique, and it should be of interest to psychologists working in visual perception and readers interested in cognitive studies in general, as well as computer scientists interested in machine vision, theoretical neurophysiologists, and philosophers of science."

                "text": "The need to visualize and interpret human body movement data from experiments and simulations has led to the development of a new, computerized, three-dimensional representation for the human body. Based on a skeleton of joints and segments, the model is manipulated by specifying joint positions with respect to arbitrary frames of reference. The external form is modelled as the union of overlapping spheres which define the surface of each segment. The properties of the segment and sphere model include: an ability to utilize any connected portion of the body in order to examine selected movements without computing movements of undesired parts , a naming mechanism for describing parts within a segment, and a collision detection algorithm for finding contacts or illegal intersections of the body with itself or other objects. One of the most attractive features of this model is the simple hidden surface removal algorithm. Since spheres always project onto a plane as disks, a solid, shaded, realistically-formed raster display of the model can be efficiently generated by a simple overlaying of the disks from the backmost to the frontmost. A three-dimensional animated display on a line-drawing device is based on drawing circles. Examples of the three-dimensional figure as viewed on these different display media are presented. The flexibility of the representation is enhanced by a method for decomposing an object into spheres, given one or more of its cross-sections, so that the data input problem is significantly simplified, should other models be desired. Using data from existing simulation programs, movements of the model have been computed and displayed, yielding very satisfactory results. Various transportation related applications are proposed.

We examine diverse theoretical and empirical approaches to visual motion analysis, perception, and understanding. We survey the literature applicable to visual motion perception as discussed in scene analysis techniques, hardware-based vision systems, computer animation, artificial intelligence techniques, and human motion perception. We focus primarily on issues of observed object and image sequence description, representation, and perceptual control strategies. We next introduce two concepts in visual motion perception: motion vantage perspective and object motion coherence. We then suggest the emerging trends, problem areas, and alternative directions for research in visual motion perception by intelligent systems."

Finding correspondence of regions and their segments in a sequence of input frames by a new flexible template matching method, the analyzer tracks moving regions and their segments in the dynamic images. Next, a similarity test of segment movements detects the background movement, and classifies the regions into stationary and non-stationary ones. Each in the latter group is further labeled as partly occluded, false, or moving, by examining motion patterns of its segments. Finally, the analyzer merges segments of each moving object into groups having similar motion patterns in order to obtain a meaningful partition corresponding to its components such as hands or legs."

The surface of the body model is formed from overlapping spheres, yielding a realistically formed and shaded body image on a raster graphics display. An experimental model consisting of 310 spheres is articulated with 19 joints and 20 body segments. The properties of this model include joints which do not deform during movement, simple hidden surface removal, and efficient collision and contact detection. The model may also be placed in a planar polygon environment, displayed in shaded form, and tested for collisions with the environment. Applications in crash simulation and human movement simulation are indicated."

Analysis of this FODP provides a separate estimate for images of moving objects and of stationary scene components. We start from the hypothesis that the first frame represents the stationary scene component. Once it has been recognized that a subarea of this initial estimate corresponds to the image of a moving object, the grey values in this subarea are replaced by later estimates of the stationary background at this position. No knowledge specific to a particular scene is utilized in the algorithm. The results for two scene sequences are presented."

The thesis of the research is that the geometric structure inherent in the definition of the shapes of three-dimensional objects and environments must be used not just to define their relative motion and placement but also to assist in solving many other problems of systems for producing pictures by computer.The implications are that by using an extension of traditional structure information, or a geometric hierarchy, five significant improvements to current techniques are possible. First, the range of complexity of an environment is greatly increased while the visible complexity of any given scene is kept within a fixed upper limit. Second, a meaningful way is provided to vary the amount of detail presented in a scene both according to the screen area occupied by the objects in the scene and according to camera and object motions. Third, by using the geometric hierarchy, \"clipping\" becomes a very fast logarithmic search for the resolvable parts of the environment within the field-of-view. Fourth, by using this positional hierarchy in conjunction with a storage hierarchy of the sort used in virtual memory computing systems, frame-to-frame coherence and clipping define a graphical \"working set\", or fraction of the total structure that should be present in primary store for immediate access by the visible-surface algorithms. Finally, the proposed structural framework suggests a new recursive descent visible-surface algorithm in which the computation time grows almost linearly with a scene's visible complexity rather than as a worse than linear function of its object-space complexity."

                "text": "An introduction is given to a theory of early visual information processing. The theory has been implemented, and examples are given of images at various stages of analysis. It is argued that the first step of consequence is to compute a primitive but rich description of the grey-level changes present in an image. The description is expressed in a vocabulary of kinds of intensity change (EDGE, SHADING-EDGE, EXTENDED-EDGE, LINE, BLOB etc.). Modifying parameters are bound to the elements in the description, specifying their POSITION, ORIENTATION, TERMINATION points, CONTRAST, SIZE and FUZZINESS. This description is obtained from the intensity array by fixed techniques, and it is called the primal sketch. For most images, the primal sketch is large and unwieldy. The second important step in visual information processing is to group its contents in a way that is appropriate for later recognition. From our ability to interpret drawings with little semantic content, one may infer the presence in our perceptual equipment of symbolic processes that can define \"place-tokens\" in an image in various ways, and can group them according to certain rules. Homomorphic techniques fail to account for many of these grouping phenomena, whose explanations require mechanisms of construction rather than mechanisms of detection. The necessary grouping of elements in the primal sketch may be achieved by a mechanism that has available the processes inferred from above, together with the ability to select items by first order discriminations acting on the elements' parameters. Only occasionally do these mechanisms use downward-flowing information about the contents of the particular image being processed. It is argued that \"non-attentive\" vision is in practice implemented by these grouping operations and first order discriminations acting on the primal sketch. The class of computations so obtained differs slightly from the class of second order operations on the intensity array. The extraction of a form from the primal sketch using these techniques amounts to the separation of figure from ground. It is concluded that most of the separation can be carried out by using techniques that do not depend upon the particular image in question. Therefore, figure-ground separation can normally precede the description of the shape of the extracted form. Up to this point, higher-level knowledge and purpose are brought to bear on only a few of the decisions taken during the processing. This relegates the widespread use of downward-flowing information to a later stage than is found in current machine-vision programs, and implies that such knowledge should influence the control of, rather than interfering with, the actual data-processing that is taking place lower down."

The ultimate goal of the visual process is to provide the viewer with a \"meaning\" description of the external world. One form of visual communication involves the type of information people convey to one another via the visual modality (such as the ideas communicated visually by sculptors, artists, and actors). A subset of this form deals with communication via body language, in particular, body postures. \nThe theory examines the kinds of information conveyed by gross body postures, as well as ways of representing this information and generating it from images. \nThe human body is represented as a stick figure, since it eliminates the problems involved in processing fleshed-out human figures without sacrificing the overall form conveyed by the gross body posture. The specific goal of the research, then, has been to develop a theory of stick figure understanding, i.e., generating descriptions of what is occurring in a 2-D scene consisting of static, human stick figures. \nAccording to the theory, three important levels at which a scene must be described are: (1) Data -- a low level description of the 2-D input scene. (2) Meaning Space Description -- a description in terms of the information communicated by the figures. (3) Physical Space Description -- a description of the 3-D configuration of the figures. \nThe understanding process involves obtaining physical and meaning space descriptions from the data. Heuristic inference rules are required for this process, along with knowledge of the external human physical structure. \nSince the set of meaning space concepts and some physical space concepts are open-ended, the inference rules must be represented in a manner such that new rules can easily be added to the model. It is proposed that the rules be represented in the form of discrimination structures, which, in addition to discriminating the input, have the following properties important for learning: (1) All related knowledge rules are grouped together. (2) Similarities and differences among rules in a group are made explicit. \nMany of the ideas in the theory have been implemented in the form of a computer program (SKELETUN), which provides context-sensitive descriptions of 2-D, static, human stick figures. To demonstrate SKELETUN's flexibility and extensibility, it has been provided with enough knowledge to make it relatively adequate in the domain of baseball. \nSKELETUN has shown the theory to be successful in understanding body postures, and in permitting easy addition of knowledge in limited domains."

In three-dimensional shape analysis, it is essential to preserve all information to achieve good performance. In the real-time situation it is, of course, equally important to use a computationally efficient method. The method of three-dimensional shape analysis using normalized Fourier descriptors is information preserving, yet is as fast as previous suboptimum methods. In addition, the feature vector has a linear property, allowing to interpolate between library projections and effectively define a continuum of library projections rather than a finite set. This method is applied to the analysis of sequential data varying in resolution and orientation relative to the camera. Computational considerations are discussed, and it is seen that real-time implementation of the method is feasible."

Support for this idea comes from three sources: the obvious utility of intrinsic characteristics for higher-level scene analysis; the apparent ability of humans to determine these characteristics, regardless of viewing conditions or familiarity with the scene; and a theoretical argument that such a description is obtainable, by a noncognitive and nonpurposive process, at least, for simple scene domains. The central problem in recovering intrinsic scene characteristics is that the information is confounded in the original light-intensity image: a single intensity value encodes all the characteristics of the corresponding scene point. Recovery depends on exploiting constraints, derived from assumptions about the nature of the scene and the physics of the imaging process."

In this paper, we apply this approach to the problem of representing three-dimensional shapes for the purpose of recognition. 1. Three criteria, accessibility, scope and uniqueness, and stability and sensitivity, are presented for judging the usefulness of a representation for shape recognition. 2. Three aspects of a representation\u2019s design are considered, (i) the representation\u2019s coordinate system, (ii) its primitives, which are the primary units of shape information used in the representation, and (iii) the organization the representation imposes on the information in its descriptions. 3. In terms of these design issues and the criteria presented, a shape representation for recognition should: (i) use an object-centred coordinate system, (ii) include volumetric primitives of varied sizes, and (iii) have a modular organization. A representation based on a shape\u2019s natural axes (for example the axes identified by a stick figure) follows directly from these choices. 4. The basic process for deriving a shape description in this representation must involve: (i) a means for identifying the natural axes of a shape in its image and (ii) a mechanism for transforming viewer-centred axis specifications to specifications in an object-centred coordinate system. 5. Shape recognition involves: (i) a collection of stored shape descriptions, and (ii) various indexes into the collection that allow a newly derived description to be associated with an appropriate stored description. The most important of these indexes allows shape recognition to proceed conservatively from the general to the specific based on the specificity of the information available from the image. 6. New constraints supplied by a conservative recognition process can be used to extract more information from the image. A relaxation process for carrying out this constraint analysis is described."

The model consists of superimposed planes of rigid moving polygons. The problem is to determine from a sequence of scenes the linear and angular velocities of the figures, and to decompose the scene into its component figures. Study of the model reveals a number of fundamental relations that form the basis for an analysis program. In particular, a systematic anaylsis is given of the topological changes that can occur when overlapping figures move together or apart. A computer program based on these results is described, and experimental results are presented."

Static versions of these abstract displays do not permit accurate recognition of sex. Variation in the degree of armswing or in walking speed generally interferes with recognition, except that faster speeds are associated somewhat with improved recognition of females. Lights on upper-body joints permit more accurate guesses than do Lights on lower-body joints, but identification is possible even from minimal displays, with lights placed only on the ankles. No feedback was given to observers. Confidence judgments of sex relate to the accuracy of responses in a manner that suggests that viewers know what they are doing."

Several different models of the process are developed, convergence properties of these models are established, and simple examples are given."

The algorithm recursively subdivides the image into polygon shaped windows until the depth order within the window is found. Accuracy of the input data is preserved.The approach is based on a two-dimensional polygon clipper which is sufficiently general to clip a concave polygon with holes to the borders of a concave polygon with holes.A major advantage of the algorithm is that the polygon form of the output is the same as the polygon form of the input. This allows entering previously calculated images to the system for further processing. Shadow casting may then be performed by first producing a hidden surface removed view from the vantage point of the light source and then resubmitting these tagged polygons for hidden surface removal from the position of the observer. Planar surface detail also becomes easy to represent without increasing the complexity of the hidden surface problem. Translucency is also possible.Calculation times are primarily related to the visible complexity of the final image, but can range from a linear to an exponential relationship with the number of input polygons depending on the particular environment portrayed. To avoid excessive computation time, the implementation uses a screen area subdivision preprocessor to create several windows, each containing a specified number of polygons. The hidden surface algorithm is applied to each of these windows separately. This technique avoids the difficulties of subdividing by screen area down to the screen resolution level while maintaining the advantages of the polygon area sort method."

We show that Latin square puzzles, finding N-ary relations, graph or auto-mata homomorphisms, graph colorings, as well as determining satisfiability of propositional logic statements and solving scene and edge labeling problems, are all special cases of the general consistent labeling problem. We then discuss the various approaches that researchers have used to speed up the tree search required to find consistent labelings. Each of these approaches uses a particular look-ahead operator to help eliminate backtracking in the tree search. Finally, we define the \u00bfKP two-parameter class of look-ahead operators which includes, as special cases, the operators other researchers have used."
