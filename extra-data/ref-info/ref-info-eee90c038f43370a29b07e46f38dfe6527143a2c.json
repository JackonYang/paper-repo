We develop a robust estimation framework for improving the reliability of motion estimates and an incremental minimization framework for recovering flow estimates over time. \nAttempts to improve the robustness of optical flow have focused on detecting and accounting for motion discontinuities in the optical flow field. We show that motion discontinuities are one example of a more general class of model violations and that by formulating the optical flow problem as one of robust estimation the problems posed by motion discontinuities can be reduced, and the violations can be detected. Additionally, robust estimation provides a powerful framework for early vision problems that generalizes the popular \"line process\" approaches. \nWe formulate a temporal continuity constraint, which reflects the fact that the motion of a surface changes gradually over time. We exploit this constraint to develop a new incremental minimization framework and show how it is related to standard recursive estimation techniques. Within this framework we implement two incremental algorithms for minimizing non-convex objective functions over time; Incremental Stochastic Minimization (ISM) and Incremental Graduated Non-Convexity (IGNC). \nWith this approach, motion estimates are always available; they are refined over time, the algorithm adapts to scene changes, and the amount of computation between frames is kept fixed. The psychophysical implications of temporal continuity are discussed and the power of the incremental minimization framework is demonstrated by extending image feature extraction over time."

Many of the methods that recover this information require the determination of optical flow-the velocity, on the image, of visible points on object surfaces. An important class of techniques for estimating optical flow depend on the relationship between the gradients of image brightness. While gradient-based methods have been widely studied, little attention has been paid to accuracy and reliability of the approach. Gradient-based methods are sensitive to conditions commonly encountered in real imagery. Highly textured surfaces, large areas of constant brightness, motion boundaries, and depth discontinuities can all be troublesome for gradient-based methods. Fortunately, these problematic areas are usually localized can be identified in the image. In this paper we examine the sources of errors for gradient-based techniques that locally solve for optical flow. These methods assume that optical flow is constant in a small neighborhood. The consequence of violating in this assumption is examined. The causes of measurement errors and the determinants of the conditioning of the solution system are also considered. By understanding how errors arise, we are able to define the inherent limitations of the technique, obtain estimates of the accuracy of computed values, enhance the performance of the technique, and demonstrate the informative value of some types of error."

This merging process raises many issues. These include the treatment of outliers in component velocity measurements and the modeling of multiple motions within a patch which arise from occlusion boundaries or transparency. A new approach for dealing with these issues is presented. It is based on the use of a probabilistic mixture model to explicitly represent multiple motions within a patch. A simple extension of the EM-algorithm is used to compute a maximum likelihood estimate for the various motion parameters. Preliminary experiments indicate that this approach is computationally efficient, and that it can provide robust estimates of the optical flow values in the presence of outliers and multiple motions.<<ETX>>"

The image sequence can be decomposed into a set of overlapping layers, where each layer's motion is described by a smooth flow field. The discontinuities in the description are then attributed to object opacities rather than to the flow itself, mirroring the structure of the scene. A set of techniques is devised for segmenting images into coherently moving regions using affine motion analysis and clustering techniques. It is possible to decompose an image into a set of layers along with information about occlusion and depth ordering. The techniques are applied to a flower garden sequence.

The theory not only produces multiple-motion versions of the existing algorithms, but also provides tools for the theoretical analysis of multiple motion. Since the approach is not at the algorithm level as are conventional segmentation paradigms, but at the level of computational theory, i.e. of constraints, theoretical results derived also contribute to psychophysical and physiological studies on the preattentive stages of biological motion vision systems.

An algorithm that can estimate the image flow velocity field when there are discontinuities due to occlusions is described. The constraint line clustering algorithm uses a statistical test to estimate the image flow velocity field in the presence of step discontinuities in the image irradiance or velocity field. Particular emphasis is placed on motion estimation and segmentation in situations such as random dot patterns where motion is the only cue to segmentation. Experimental results on a demanding synthetic test case and a real image are presented. A smoothing algorithm for improving the velocity field estimate is also described. The smoothing algorithm constructs a smooth estimate of the velocity field by approximating a surface between step discontinuities. It is noted that the velocity field estimate can be improved using surface reconstruction between velocity field boundaries. >"

The method is based on a generalized Hough transform technique. Some of the problems of this technique are addressed and appropriate solutions are proposed. A modified multipass Hough transform appraoch has been implemented, where i each pass windows are lkocated around objects and the transform is applied only to the displacement vectors contained in these windows. The windows are determined by the degree to which the displacement field is locally inconsistent with previously found motion transformations. Thus, the sensitivity of the Hough transform to local events is increased and the motion parameters of small objects can be detected even in a noisy displacement field. The author also use a multi-resolution scheme in both the image plane and the parameter space and thus reduce the computational cost of the technique. The method is demonstrated by experiments based on artifical images with four parameters of 2-d motion: rotation, expansion and tranlation in both axes."

In this paper we develop methods for extracting these deformation param eters from evolving contours in an image sequence, the image contours being manifestations of surface texture seen in perspective projection. Our results follow directly from the analytic structure of the underlying image flow; no heuristics are imposed. The deformation parameters we seek are actu ally linear combinations of the Taylor series coefficients (through second derivatives) of the local image flow field. Thus, a by-product of our approach is a second-order polyno mial approximation to the image flow in the neighborhood of a contour. For curved surfaces this approximation is only locally valid, but for planar surfaces it is globally valid (i.e., it is exact). Our analysis reveals an \"aperture problem in the large\" in which insufficient contour structure leaves the set of 12 deformation parameters underdetermined. We also assess the sensitivity of our method to the simulated effects of noise in the \"normal flow\" around contours as well as the angular field of view subtended by contours. The sensitivity analysis is carried out in the context of planar surfaces executing general rigid-body motions in space. Future work will address the additional considerations relevant to curved surface patches."

But the solution must not smooth over discontinuities in the image, and allowance must be made for the fact that the probability distributions of the smoothness measures are unknown. The authors apply the theory of robust statistics (M-statistics) to obtain a convex regularization that is also maximally robust against misspecification of the probability distribution of large jumps in the unknown. This theory is applied to the optical flow constraint, which is known to be noisy and inaccurate. The authors present some preliminary results showing that convex regularization theory seems to accurately preserve depth boundary information.<<ETX>>"

An alternative formulation of the local motion assumption in which there may be two distinct patterns undergoing coherent (e.g. affine) motion within a given local analysis region is proposed. An algorithm for the analysis of two-component motion in which tracking and nulling mechanisms applied to three consecutive image frames separate and estimate the individual components is given. Precise results are obtained, even for components that differ only slightly in velocity as well as for a faint component in the presence of a dominant, masking component. The algorithm provides precise motion estimates for a set of elementary two-motion configurations and is robust in the presence of noise. >"

The maximum a posteriori (MAP) criterion is used to formulate what the best segmentation or interpretation of the scene should be, where the scene is assumed to be made up of some fixed number of moving planar surface patches. The Bayesian approach requires, first, specification of prior expectations for the optic flow field, which here is modeled as spatial and temporal Markov random fields; and, secondly, a way of measuring how well the segmentation predicts the measured flow field. The Markov random fields incorporate the physical constraints that objects and their images are probably spatially continuous, and that their images are likely to move quite smoothly across the image plane. To compute the flow predicted by the segmentation, a recent method for reconstructing the motion and orientation of planar surface facets is used. The search for the globally optimal segmentation is performed using simulated annealing."

The method allows for gradual changes in the way an object appears in the image sequence, and allows for flow discontinuities at object boundaries. We find velocity fields that give estimates of the velocities of objects in the image plane. These velocities are computed from a series of images using information about the spatial and temporal brightness gradients. A constraint on the smoothness of motion within an object's boundaries is used. The method can be applied to interpretation of both reflectance and x-ray images. Results arc shown for models of ellipsoids undergoing expansion, as well as for an x-ray image sequence of a beating heart."

It is shown that in the application of this method, care must be taken in the estimation of image derivatives using finite difference methods to prevent biases in the solution.

In most situations, the mere gray value variations do not provide sufficient information in order to estimate such a displacement vector field. Supplementary constraints are necessary, for example the postulate that a displacement vector field varies smoothly as a function of the image position. Taken as a general requirement, this creates difficulties at gray value transitions which correspond to occluding contours. Nagel therefore introduced the ``oriented smoothness'' requirement which restricts variations of the displacement vector field only in directions with small or no variation of gray values. This contribution reports results of an investigation about how such an ``oriented smoothness'' constraint may be formulated and evaluated."

We derive an edge detection algorithm sensitive to changes in flow fields likely to be associated with occlusion. The algorithm is patterned after the Marr-Hildreth zero-crossing detectors currently used to locate boundaries in scalar fields. Zero-crossing detectors are extended to identify changes in direction and/or magnitude in a vector-valued flow field. As a result, the detector works for flow boundaries generated due to the relative motion of two overlapping surfaces, as well as the simpler case of motion parallax due to a sensor moving through an otherwise stationary environment. We then show how the approach can be extended to identify which side of a dynamic occlusion boundary corresponds to the occluding surface. The fundamental principal involved is that at an occlusion boundary, the image of the surface boundary moves with the image of the occluding surface. Such information is important in interpreting dynamic scenes. Results are demonstrated on optical flow fields automatically computed from real image sequences."

A second constraint is needed. A method for finding the optical flow pattern is presented which assumes that the apparent velocity of the brightness pattern varies smoothly almost everywhere in the image. An iterative implementation is shown which successfully computes the optical flow for a number of synthetic image sequences. The algorithm is robust in that it can handle image sequences that are quantized rather coarsely in space and time. It is also insensitive to quantization of brightness levels and additive noise. Examples are included where the assumption of smoothness is violated at singular points or along lines in the image."

                "text": "This thesis presents algorithms for the efficient computation of image motions using hierarchical multiresolution methods operating on image data pyramids in the processing cone architecture. Three topics are addressed: (1) fast construction of image pyramids; (2) hierarchical motion detection algorithms: correlation-based and gradient-based; and (3) multilevel relaxation algorithms. \nPyramid building is the first step in hierarchical motion detection. A family of discrete Gaussian low pass filters for building low pass pyramids is presented that provide good anti-aliasing characteristics, efficient computation, and a good hierarchical Gaussian approximation. Frequency space analysis, using Fourier Transform theory, is used to compare alternative filters. \nHierarchical correlation overcomes two disadvantages of correlation matching: large search areas which require expensive searches, and repeating features which cause incorrect matches. Coarse-to-fine control provides speed and efficiency when search spaces are large, and accuracy when repeating details can be confused. \nHierarchical gradient-based algorithms extend single level gradient-based algorithms to the computation of large disparities. They use a coarse-to-fine method in which approximate disparities are refined at each level by computing relatively small updates. This allows the gradient-based method's assumption of local linearity to apply in spite of the large total disparities. Experiments show the failure of single level methods (for large disparities) and the success of hierarchical methods. \nThe two hierarchical algorithms are shown to have comparable accuracy. Comparison of the computational costs, both arithmetic and data transfer, show that the gradient-based algorithm are, in general, less costly. \nMultilevel relaxation algorithms for the computation of optic flow are developed and experiments show the expected increased convergence rate over single level relaxation, although some experiments present a problem of divergence at coarse levels. A local mode analysis of the relaxation equations shows that convergence is at least as fast as simple smoothing, and that, with strong gradients, convergence is accelerated towards the constraint line. The local mode analysis does not account for coarse level divergence. Divergence is then shown to be due to spatial variation in the image data. Fixed up/down cycling schemes are used to overcome the divergence problem."

Pixel gray levels and the presence and orientation of edges are viewed as states of atoms or molecules in a lattice-like physical system. The assignment of an energy function in the physical system determines its Gibbs distribution. Because of the Gibbs distribution, Markov random field (MRF) equivalence, this assignment also determines an MRF image model. The energy function is a more convenient and natural mechanism for embodying picture attributes than are the local characteristics of the MRF. For a range of degradation mechanisms, including blurring, nonlinear deformations, and multiplicative or additive noise, the posterior distribution is an MRF with a structure akin to the image model. By the analogy, the posterior distribution defines another (imaginary) physical system. Gradual temperature reduction in the physical system isolates low energy states (``annealing''), or what is the same thing, the most probable states under the Gibbs distribution. The analogous operation under the posterior distribution yields the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the image given the degraded observations. The result is a highly parallel ``relaxation'' algorithm for MAP estimation. We establish convergence properties of the algorithm and we experiment with some simple pictures, for which good restorations are obtained at low signal-to-noise ratios."

This outlier-processes approach provides a general framework which subsumes the traditional line-process approaches as well as a wide class of robust estimation problems.

The diffusion coefficient is chosen to vary spatially in such a way as to encourage intraregion smoothing rather than interregion smoothing. It is shown that the 'no new maxima should be generated at coarse scales' property of conventional scale space is preserved. As the region boundaries in the approach remain sharp, a high-quality edge detector which successfully exploits global information is obtained. Experimental results are shown on a number of images. Parallel hardware implementations are made feasible because the algorithm involves elementary, local operations replicated over the image. >"

We present a new image registration technique that makes use of the spatial intensity gradient of the images to find a good match using a type of Newton-Raphson iteration. Our technique is taster because it examines far fewer potential matches between the images than existing techniques Furthermore, this registration technique can be generalized to handle rotation, scaling and shearing. We show how our technique can be adapted tor use in a stereo vision system."
