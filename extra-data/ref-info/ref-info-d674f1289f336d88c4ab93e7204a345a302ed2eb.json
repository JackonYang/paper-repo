In Gobbledoc, image processing, document analysis, and OCR operations take place in batch mode when the documents are acquired. The document image acquisition process and the knowledge base that must be entered into the system to process a family of page images are described. The process by which the X-Y tree data structure converts a 2-D page-segmentation problem into a series of 1-D string-parsing problems that can be tackled using conventional compiler tools is also described. Syntactic analysis is used in Gobbledoc to divide each page into labeled rectangular blocks. Blocks labeled text are converted by OCR to obtain a secondary (ASCII) document representation. Since such symbolic files are better suited for computerized search than for human access to the document content and because too many visual layout clues are lost in the OCR process (including some special characters), Gobbledoc preserves the original block images for human browsing. Storage, networking, and display issues specific to document images are also discussed.<<ETX>>"

The key idea is to exploit underlying structure at various levels of granularity to build high-level indices with task-specific interpretations. Information agents construct such indices and are configured as a network of reusable modules called structure detectors and segmenters. We illustrate our architecture with the design and implementation of smart information filters in two contexts: retrieving stock market data from Internet newsgroups and retrieving technical reports from Internet FTP sites."

Connected pattern components are extracted, and spatial interrelations between components are measured and grouped into meaningful character patterns. Stroke shapes are analyzed and a method of finding the touching positions that separates about 95% of connected numerals correctly is described. Ambiguities are handled by multiple hypotheses and verification by recognition. An extended form of pattern-oriented segmentation, tabular form recognition, is considered. Images of tabular forms are analyzed, and frames in the tabular structure are extracted. By identifying semantic relationships between label frames and data frames, information on the form can be properly recognized. >"
