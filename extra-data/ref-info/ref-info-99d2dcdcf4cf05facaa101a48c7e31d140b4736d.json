Especially important is knowledge about verbs, which are the primary source of relational information in a sentence-the predicate-argument structure that relates an action or state to its participants (i.e., who did what to whom). In this work, we report on supervised learning experiments to automatically classify three major types of English verbs, based on their argument structure-specifically, the thematic roles they assign to participants. We use linguistically-motivated statistical indicators extracted from large annotated corpora to train the classifier, achieving 69.8 accuracy for a task whose baseline is 34, and whose expert-based upper bound we calculate at 86.5. A detailed analysis of the performance of the algorithm and of its errors confirms that the proposed features capture properties related to the argument structure of the verbs. Our results validate our hypotheses that knowledge about thematic relations is crucial for verb classification, and that it can be gleaned from a corpus by automatic means. We thus demonstrate an effective combination of deeper linguistic knowledge with the robustness and scalability of statistical techniques."

We argue that, in interpreting PPs, both knowledge about the site of the attachment (the traditional noun-verb attachment distinction) and the nature of the attachment (the distinction of arguments from adjuncts) are needed. We introduce a method to learn arguments and adjuncts based on a definition of arguments as a vector of features. In a series of supervised classification experiments, first we explore the features that enable us to learn the distinction between arguments and adjuncts. We find that both linguistic diagnostics of argumenthood and lexical semantic classes are useful. Second, we investigate the best method to reach the four-way classification of potentially ambiguous prepositional phrases. We find that whereas it is overall better to solve the problem as a single four-way classification task, verb arguments are sometimes more precisely identified if the classification is done as a two-step process, first choosing the attachment site and then labeling it as argument or adjunct."

It is concluded that the best theory for describing this domain is not a traditional system of discrete roles (Agent, Patient, Source, etc.) but a theory in which the only roles are two cluster-concepts called PROTO-AGENT and PROTO-PATIENT, each characterized by a set of verbal entailments: an argument of a verb may bear either of the two proto-roles (or both) to varying degrees, according to the number of entailments of each kind the verb gives it. Both fine-grained and coarse-grained classes of verbal arguments (corresponding to traditional thematic roles and other classes as well) follow automatically, as do desired 'role hierarchies'. By examining occurrences of the 'same' verb with different argument configurations\u2014e.g. two forms of psych predicates and object-oblique alternations as in the familiar spray/load class\u2014it can also be argued that proto-roles act as defaults in the learning of lexical meanings. Are proto-role categories manifested elsewhere in language or as cognitive categories? If so, they might be a means of making grammar acquisition easier for the child, they might explain certain other typological and acquisitional observations, and they may lead to an account of contrasts between unaccusative and unergative intransitive verbs that does not rely on deriving unaccusatives from underlying direct objects."

Our thesis is that the computation of linguistic structure can be localized if lexical items are associated with rich descriptions (supertags) that impose complex constraints in a local context. The supertags are designed such that only those elements on which the lexical item imposes constraints appear within a given supertag. Further, each lexical item is associated with as many supertags as the number of different syntactic contexts in which the lexical item can appear. This makes the number of different descriptions for each lexical item much larger than when the descriptions are less complex, thus increasing the local ambiguity for a parser. But this local ambiguity can be resolved by using statistical distributions of supertag co-occurrences collected from a corpus of parses. We have explored these ideas in the context of the Lexicalized Tree-Adjoining Grammar (LTAG) framework. The supertags in LTAG combine both phrase structure information and dependency information in a single representation. Supertag disambiguation results in a representation that is effectively a parse (an almost parse), and the parser need \"only\" combine the individual supertags. This method of parsing can also be used to parse sentence fragments such as in spoken utterances where the disambiguated supertag sequence may not combine into a single structure."

How can easily recognized, surface grammatical facts be used to extract from a corpus as much syntactic information as possible about individual words? This paper describes an approach based on two principles. First, rely on local morpho-syntactic cues to structure rather than trying to parse entire sentences. Second, treat these cues as probabilistic rather than absolute indicators of syntactic structure. Apply inferential statistics to the data collected using the cues, rather than drawing a categorical conclusion from a single occurrence of a cue. The effectiveness of this approach for inferring the syntactic frames of verbs is supported by experiments on an English corpus using a program called Lerner. Lerner starts out with no knowledge of content words---it bootstraps from determiners, auxiliaries, modals, prepositions, pronouns, complementizers, coordinating conjunctions, and punctuation."

The models extend methods from probabilistic context-free grammars to lexicalized grammars, leading to approaches in which a parse tree is represented as the sequence of decisions corresponding to a head-centered, top-down derivation of the tree. Independence assumptions then lead to parameters that encode the X-bar schema, subcategorization, ordering of complements, placement of adjuncts, bigram lexical dependencies, wh-movement, and preferences for close attachment. All of these preferences are expressed by probabilities conditioned on lexical heads. The models are evaluated on the Penn Wall Street Journal Treebank, showing that their accuracy is competitive with other models in the literature. To gain a better understanding of the models, we also give results on different constituent types, as well as a breakdown of precision/recall results in recovering various types of dependencies. We analyze various characteristics of the models through experiments on parsing accuracy, by collecting frequencies of various structures in the treebank, and through linguistically motivated examples. Finally, we compare the models to others that have been applied to parsing the treebank, aiming to give some explanation of the difference in performance of the various models."

The largest and the most widely deployed classification in English is Levin's (1993) taxonomy of verbs and their classes. While this resource is attractive in being extensive enough for some NLP use, it is not comprehensive. In this paper, we present a substantial extension to Levin's taxonomy which incorporates 57 novel classes for verbs not covered (comprehensively) by Levin. We also introduce 106 novel diathesis alternations, created as a side product of constructing the new classes. We demonstrate the utility of our novel classes by using them to support automatic subcategorization acquisition and show that the resulting extended classification has extensive coverage over the English verb lexicon."

Levin starts with the hypothesis that a verb's meaning influences its syntactic behavior and develops it into a powerful tool for studying the English verb lexicon. She shows how identifying verbs with similar syntactic behavior provides an effective means of distinguishing semantically coherent verb classes, and isolates these classes by examining verb behavior with respect to a wide range of syntactic alternations that reflect verb meaning. The first part of the book sets out alternate ways in which verbs can express their arguments. The second presents classes of verbs that share a kernel of meaning and explores in detail the behavior of each class, drawing on the alternations in the first part. Levin's discussion of each class and alternation includes lists of relevant verbs, illustrative examples, comments on noteworthy properties, and bibliographic references. The result is an original, systematic picture of the organization of the verb inventory. Easy to use, \"English Verb Classes and Alternations\" sets the stage for further explorations of the interface between lexical semantics and syntax. It will prove indispensable for theoretical and computational linguists, psycholinguists, cognitive scientists, lexicographers, and teachers of English as a second language. Beth Levin is associate professor of linguistics at Northwestern University."

                "text": "This article considers approaches which rerank the output of an existing probabilistic parser. The base parser produces a set of candidate parses for each input sentence, with associated probabilities that define an initial ranking of these parses. A second model then attempts to improve upon this initial ranking, using additional features of the tree as evidence. The strength of our approach is that it allows a tree to be represented as an arbitrary set of features, without concerns about how these features interact or overlap and without the need to define a derivation or a generative model which takes these features into account. We introduce a new method for the reranking task, based on the boosting approach to ranking problems described in Freund et al. (1998). We apply the boosting method to parsing the Wall Street Journal treebank. The method combined the log-likelihood under a baseline model (that of Collins [1999]) with evidence from an additional 500,000 features over parse trees that were not included in the original model. The new model achieved 89.75 F-measure, a 13 relative decrease in F-measure error over the baseline model's score of 88.2. The article also introduces a new algorithm for the boosting approach which takes advantage of the sparsity of the feature space in the parsing data. Experiments show significant efficiency gains for the new algorithm over the obvious implementation of the boosting approach. We argue that the method is an appealing alternative-in terms of both simplicity and efficiency-to work on feature selection methods within log-linear (maximum-entropy) models. Although the experiments in this article are on natural language parsing (NLP), the approach should be applicable to many other NLP problems which are naturally framed as ranking tasks, for example, speech recognition, machine translation, or natural language generation."

We propose an additional set of features and our experiments show that these features lead to fairly significant improvements in the tasks we performed. We further show that different features are needed for different subtasks. Finally, we show that by using a Maximum Entropy classifier and fewer features, we achieved results comparable with the best previously reported results obtained with SVM models. We believe this is a clear indication that developing features that capture the right kind of information is crucial to advancing the stateof-the-art in semantic analysis."

Each dictionary entry encodes the relative frequency of occurrence of a comprehensive set of subcategorization classes for English. An initial experiment, on a sample of 14 verbs which exhibit multiple complementation patterns, demonstrates that the technique achieves accuracy comparable to previous approaches, which are all limited to a highly restricted set of subcategorization classes. We also demonstrate that a subcategorization dictionary built with the system improves the accuracy of a parser by an appreciable amount1."

According to an evaluation of unlabeled word-word dependencies, our best model achieves a performance of 89.9%, comparable to the figures given by Collins (1999) for a linguistically less expressive grammar. In contrast to Gildea (2001), we find a significant improvement from modeling word-word dependencies."

It works essentially as a cascaded, nondeterministic finite-state automaton. There are five stages in the operation of FASTUS. In Stage 1, names and other fixed form expressions are recognized. In Stage 2, basic noun groups, verb groups, and prepositions and some other particles are recognized. In Stage 3, certain complex noun groups and verb groups are constructed. Patterns for events of interest are identified in Stage 4 and corresponding ``event structures'' are built. In Stage 5, distinct event structures that describe the same event are identified and merged, and these are used in generating database entries. This decomposition of language processing enables the system to do exactly the right amount of domain-independent syntax, so that domain-dependent semantic and pragmatic processing can be applied to the right larger-scale structures. FASTUS is very efficient and effective, and has been used successfully in a number of applications."

Evaluating the algorithm on the output of Charniak's parser (Charniak, 2000) and the Penn treebank (Marcus et al., 1993) shows that the pattern-matching algorithm does surprisingly well on the most frequently occuring types of empty nodes given its simplicity."

                "text": "The decision to schedule sessions on \u201cformulating the target\u201d for the first day of this conference, based undoubtedly on the simple wisdom that knowing what a thing is like is a prerequisite to asking how it got that way, was probably also made in the hope that the target-formulating contributions might actually lead to some sort of consensus on the nature of language. Scholars inquiring into the origin of language will surely want to agree on at least some of the details of the last scene of the evolutionary scenario they are trying to construct. Unfortunately, the problem of describing this last scene is a notoriously difficult one: making clear the true nature of language is no trivial assignment, as I think everybody here is well aware. As a contribution to a t least a part of the understanding we need, I will present for your consideration a way of talking about one aspect of the process of communicating in a human language, something I will refer to as \u201cframing.\u201d 1 choose this, not because I find it intrinsically more important than the formal structures of messages or meanings, or more important than the many global properties by which, from a more purely comparative perspective, human languages can be shown to differ from other communicating systems; I choose framing because 1 think it is important and because 1 suspect that it might not get mentioned, or that it might not be sufficiently highlighted, in the other papers to be read at this conference. I mean by framing the appeal, in perceiving, thinking, and communicating, to structured ways of interpreting experiences. It is an alternative to the view that concepts or categories are formed through the process of matching sets of perceptual features with, say, words. 1 plan in this paper to justify the frames notion, to give a number of examples, mostly from English, of different kinds of frame structures, to suggest informally and intuitively how the frame concept can figure in the explanation of the communication and comprehension processes, and in the end to offer some hedged speculations on how the study of frames might appear in research on evolution toward language and on the evolution of language."

The contributing authors comprise an impressive collection -- essentially the originating sources for much of the important recent work in this area.\" \n-- Philip Resnik, Assistant Professor, Department of Linguistics and Institute for Advanced Computer Studies, University of Maryland at College Park Finite-state devices, which include finite-state automata, graphs, and finite-state transducers, are in wide use in many areas of computer science. Recently, there has been a resurgence of the use of finite-state devices in all aspects of computational linguistics, including dictionary encoding, text processing, and speech processing. This book describes the fundamental properties of finite-state devices and illustrates their uses. Many of the contributors pioneered the use of finite-automata for different aspects of natural language processing. The topics, which range from the theoretical to the applied, include finite-state morphology, approximation of phrase-structure grammars, deterministic part-of-speech tagging, application of a finite-state intersection grammar, a finite-state transducer for extracting information from text, and speech recognition using weighted finite automata. The introduction presents the basic theoretical results in finite-state automata and transducers. These results and algorithms are described and illustrated with simple formal language examples as well as natural language examples. \nContributors: Douglas Appelt, John Bear, David Clemenceau, Maurice Gross, Jerry R.

Within the context of MUC-7, the SIFT system for extraction of template entities (TE) and template relations (TR) used a novel, integrated syntactic/semantic language model to extract sentence level information, and then synthesized information across sentences using in part a trained model for cross-sentence relations. At the named entity (NE) level as well, in both MET-1 and MUC-7, BBN employed a trained, HMM-based model.The results in these TIPSTER evaluations are evidence that such trained systems, even at their current level of development, can perform roughly on a par with those based on rules hand-tailored by experts. In addition, such trained systems have some significant advantages:\u2022 They can be easily ported to new domains by simply annotating fresh data.\u2022 The complex interactions that make rule-based systems difficult to develop and maintain can here be learned automatically from the training data.We believe that improved and extended versions of such trained models have the potential for significant further progress toward practical systems for information extraction."

The parser itself requires very little human intervention, since the information it uses to make parsing decisions is specified in a concise and simple manner, and is combined in a fully automatic way under the maximum entropy framework. The observed running time of the parser on a test sentence is linear with respect to the sentence length. Furthermore, the parser returns several scored parses for a sentence, and this paper shows that a scheme to pick the best parse from the 20 highest scoring parses could yield a dramatically higher accuracy of 93% precision and recall."

Such trained systems have some significant advantages: 1. They can be easily ported to new domains by simply annotating data with semantic answers. 2. The complex interactions that make rule-based systems difficult to develop and maintain can here be learned automatically from the training data. We believe that the results in this evaluation are evidence that such trained systems, even at their current level of development, can perform roughly on a par with rules hand-tailored by experts. Since MUC-3, BBN has been steadily increasing the proportion of the information extraction process that is statistically trained. Already in MET-1, our name-finding results were the output of a fully statistical, HMM-based model, and that statistical Identifinder(trademark) model was also used for the NE task in MUC-7. For the MUC-7 TE and TR tasks, BBN developed SIFT, a new model that represents a significant further step along this path, replacing PLUM, a system requiring handwritten patterns, with SIFT, a single integrated trained model."

We see verb classes as the key to making generalizations about regular extensions of meaning. Current approaches to English classification, Levin classes and WordNet, have limitations in their applicability that impede their utility as general classification schemes. We present a refinement of Levin classes, intersective sets, which are a more fine-grained classification and have more coherent sets of syntactic frames and associated semantic components. We have preliminary indications that the membership of our intersective sets will be more compatible with WordNet than the original Levin classes. We also have begun to examine related classes in Portuguese, and find that these verbs demonstrate similarly coherent syntactic and semantic properties."
