For all but pathological channels the bounds are asymptotically (exponentially) tight for rates above R_{0} , the computational cutoff rate of sequential decoding. As a function of constraint length the performance of optimal convolutional codes is shown to be superior to that of block codes of the same length, the relative improvement increasing with rate. The upper bound is obtained for a specific probabilistic nonsequential decoding algorithm which is shown to be asymptotically optimum for rates above R_{0} and whose performance bears certain similarities to that of sequential decoding algorithms."

Upper and lower bounds for both time-varying and fixed codes are obtained. A comparison is made between bounds for nonsystematic and systematic codes which shows that more free distance is available with nonsystematic codes. This result is important when selecting codes for use with sequential or maximum-likelihood (Viterbi) decoding since the probability of decoding error is closely related to the free distance of the code. An ancillary result, used in proving the lower bound on free distance for time-varying nonsystematic codes, furnishes a generalization of two earlier bounds on the definite decoding minimum distance of convolutional codes."

The typical minimum distance of these codes increases linearly with block length for a fixed rate and fixed j . When used with maximum likelihood decoding on a sufficiently quiet binary-input symmetric channel, the typical probability of decoding error decreases exponentially with block length for a fixed rate and fixed j . A simple but nonoptimum decoding scheme operating directly from the channel a posteriori probabilities is described. Both the equipment complexity and the data-handling capacity in bits per second of this decoder increase approximately linearly with block length. For j > 3 and a sufficiently low rate, the probability of error using this decoder on a binary symmetric channel is shown to decrease at least exponentially with a root of the block length.

Fifty years of efforts and invention have finally produced coding schemes that closely approach Shannon's channel capacity limit on AWGN channels, both power-limited and band-limited. Similar gains are being achieved in other important applications, such as wireless channels. This course is divided in two parts. In the first part, we remind students of the basics of the theory of linear codes for conventional memoryless ergodic channels. We then introduce more advanced notions so as to make comprehensible some of the most recent coding schemes proposed in the literature. In the second part, we expound the principles of coded modulations for the Gaussian channel and, if time permits, for Rician and Rayleigh fading channels (fully interleaved).

The associated code is the set of all output sequences resulting from any set of input sequences beginning at any time. Encoders are called equivalent if they generate the same code. The invariant factor theorem is used to determine when a convolutional encoder has a feedback-free inverse, and the minimum delay of any inverse. All encoders are shown to be equivalent to minimal encoders, which are feedback-free encoders with feedback-free delay-free inverses, and which can be realized in the conventional manner with as few memory elements as any equivalent encoder, Minimal encoders are shown to be immune to catastrophic error propagation and, in fact, to lead in a certain sense to the shortest decoded error sequences possible per error event. In two appendices, we introduce dual codes and syndromes, and show that a minimal encoder for a dual code has exactly the complexity of the original encoder; we show that systematic encoders with feedback form a canonical class, and compare this class to the minimal class."

This problem of \u201cdoing things right\u201d on a large scale is not essentially new; in a telephone central office, for example, a very large number of operations are performed while the errors leading to wrong numbers are kept well under control, though they have not been completely eliminated. This has been achieved, in part, through the use of self-checking circuits. The occasional failure that escapes routine checking is still detected by the customer and will, if it persists, result in customer complaint, while if it is transient it will produce only occasional wrong numbers. At the same time the rest of the central office functions satisfactorily. In a digital computer, on the other hand, a single failure usually means the complete failure, in the sense that if it is detected no more computing can be done until the failure is located and corrected, while if it escapes detection then it invalidates all subsequent operations of the machine. Put in other words, in a telephone central office there are a number of parallel paths which are more or less independent of each other; in a digital machine there is usually a single long path which passes through the same piece of equipment many, many times before the answer is obtained."
