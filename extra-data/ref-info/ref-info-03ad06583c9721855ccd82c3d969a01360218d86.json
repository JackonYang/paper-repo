To date, most of its applications focused on only one task and not much work explored this framework for multiple tasks. This paper examines three multi-task learning (MTL) settings for sequence to sequence models: (a) the oneto-many setting - where the encoder is shared between several tasks such as machine translation and syntactic parsing, (b) the many-to-one setting - useful when only the decoder can be shared, as in the case of translation and image caption generation, and (c) the many-to-many setting - where multiple encoders and decoders are shared, which is the case with unsupervised objectives and translation. Our results show that training on a small amount of parsing and image caption data can improve the translation quality between English and German by up to 1.5 BLEU points over strong single-task baselines on the WMT benchmarks. Furthermore, we have established a new state-of-the-art result in constituent parsing with 93.0 F1. Lastly, we reveal interesting properties of the two unsupervised learning objectives, autoencoder and skip-thought, in the MTL context: autoencoder helps less in terms of perplexities but more on BLEU scores compared to skip-thought."

Recently, \u201cdepth in space\u201d \u2014 as an orthogonal notion to \u201cdepth in time\u201d \u2014 in RNNs has been investigated by stacking multiple layers of RNNs and shown empirically to bring a temporal hierarchy to the architecture. In this work we apply these deep RNNs to the task of opinion expression extraction formulated as a token-level sequence-labeling task. Experimental results show that deep, narrow RNNs outperform traditional shallow, wide RNNs with the same number of parameters. Furthermore, our approach outperforms previous CRF-based baselines, including the state-of-the-art semi-Markov CRF model, and does so without access to the powerful opinion lexicons and syntactic features relied upon by the semi-CRF, as well as without the standard layer-by-layer pre-training typically required of RNN architectures."

We first propose a simple yet powerful semi-supervised discriminative model appropriate for handling large scale unlabeled data. Then, we describe experiments performed on widely used test collections, namely, PTB III data, CoNLL\u201900 and \u201903 shared task data for the above three NLP tasks, respectively. We incorporate up to 1G-words (one billion tokens) of unlabeled data, which is the largest amount of unlabeled data ever used for these tasks, to investigate the performance improvement. In addition, our results are superior to the best reported results for all of the above test collections."

This versatility is achieved by trying to avoid task-specific engineering and therefore disregarding a lot of prior knowledge. Instead of exploiting man-made input features carefully optimized for each task, our system learns internal representations on the basis of vast amounts of mostly unlabeled training data. This work is then used as a basis for building a freely available tagging system with good performance and minimal computational requirements."

In thispaper, we definethe tasksof the different tracks and describe how the data sets were created from existing treebanks for ten languages. In addition, we characterize the different approaches of the participating systems, report the test results, and provide a first analysis of these results."

The BRNN can be trained without the limitation of using input information just up to a preset future frame. This is accomplished by training it simultaneously in positive and negative time direction. Structure and training procedure of the proposed network are explained. In regression and classification experiments on artificial data, the proposed structure gives better results than other approaches. For real data, classification experiments for phonemes from the TIMIT database show the same tendency. In the second part of this paper, it is shown how the proposed bidirectional structure can be easily modified to allow efficient estimation of the conditional posterior probability of complete symbol sequences without making any explicit assumption about the shape of the distribution. For this part, experiments on real data are reported."

In order to make it as self-contained as possible, I spend much time on describing basics of machine learning and neural networks, only after which how they are used for natural languages is introduced. On the language front, I almost solely focus on language modelling and machine translation, two of which I personally find most fascinating and most fundamental to natural language understanding."

In this paper, we present a multi-task deep learning scheme to enhance the detection performance. More specifically, we build a deep convolutional neural network that can simultaneously learn the face/nonface decision, the face pose estimation problem, and the facial landmark localization problem. We show that such a multi-task learning scheme can further improve the classifier's accuracy. On the challenging FDDB data set, our detector achieves over 3% improvement in detection rate at the same false positive rate compared with other state-of-the-art methods."

We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O. 1. Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms."

Zhu et al. [26] changed all arbitrary pose and illumination images to the frontal view image to use for the invariant feature. In this scheme, preserving identity while rotating pose image is a crucial issue. This paper proposes a new deep architecture based on a novel type of multitask learning, which can achieve superior performance in rotating to a target-pose face image from an arbitrary pose and illumination image while preserving identity. The target pose can be controlled by the user's intention. This novel type of multi-task model significantly improves identity preservation over the single task model. By using all the synthesized controlled pose images, called Controlled Pose Image (CPI), for the pose-illumination-invariant feature and voting among the multiple face recognition results, we clearly outperform the state-of-the-art algorithms by more than 4~6% on the MultiPIE dataset."

One approach is to represent time implicitly by its effects on processing rather than explicitly (as in a spatial representation). The current report develops a proposal along these lines first described by Jordan (1986) which involves the use of recurrent links in order to provide networks with a dynamic memory. In this approach, hidden unit patterns are fed back to themselves; the internal representations which develop thus reflect task demands in the context of prior internal states. A set of simulations is reported which range from relatively simple problems (temporal version of XOR) to discovering syntactic/semantic features for words. The networks are able to learn interesting internal representations which incorporate task demands with memory demands; indeed, in this approach the notion of memory is inextricably bound up with task processing. These representations reveal a rich structure, which allows them to be highly context-dependent while also expressing generalizations across classes of items. These representations suggest a method for representing lexical categories and the type/token distinction."

Rademacher complexity measures a learner's ability to fit random labels, and can be used to bound the learner's true error based on the observed training sample error. We first review the definition of Rademacher complexity and its generalization bound. We then describe a \"learning the noise\" procedure to experimentally measure human Rademacher complexities. The results from empirical studies showed that: (i) human Rademacher complexity can be successfully measured, (ii) the complexity depends on the domain and training sample size in intuitive ways, (iii) human learning respects the generalization bounds, (iv) the bounds can be useful in predicting the danger of overfitting in human learning. Finally, we discuss the potential applications of human Rademacher complexity in cognitive science."
