This setup has hardly been studied in computer vision research, but it is the rule rather than the exception, because the world contains tens of thousands of different object classes and for only a very few of them image, collections have been formed and annotated with suitable class labels. In this paper, we tackle the problem by introducing attribute-based classification. It performs object detection based on a human-specified high-level description of the target objects instead of training images. The description consists of arbitrary semantic attributes, like shape, color or even geographic information. Because such properties transcend the specific learning task at hand, they can be pre-learned, e.g. from image datasets unrelated to the current task. Afterwards, new classes can be detected based on their attribute representation, without the need for a new training phase. In order to evaluate our method and to facilitate research in this area, we have assembled a new large-scale dataset, \u201cAnimals with Attributes\u201d, of over 30,000 animal images that match the 50 classes in Osherson's classic table of how strongly humans associate 85 semantic attributes with animal classes. Our experiments show that by using an attribute layer it is indeed possible to build a learning object detection system that does not require any training images of the target classes."

We approach this problem by transferring knowledge from known categories (a.k.a source categories) to new categories (a.k.a target categories) via object attributes. Object attributes are high level descriptions of object categories, such as color, texture, shape, etc. Since they represent common properties across different categories, they can be used to transfer knowledge from source categories to target categories effectively. Based on this insight, we propose an attribute-based transfer learning framework in this paper. We first build a generative attribute model to learn the probabilistic distributions of image features for each attribute, which we consider as attribute priors. These attribute priors can be used to (1) classify unseen images of target categories (zero-shot learning), or (2) facilitate learning classifiers for target categories when there is only one training examples per target category (one-shot learning). We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches using the Animal with Attributes data set and show state-of-the-art performance in both zero-shot and one-shot learning tests."

One-shot recognition aims to apply the knowledge gained from a set of categories with plentiful data to categories for which only a single exemplar is available for each. As with earlier efforts motivated by transfer learning, we seek an internal representation for the domain that generalizes across classes. However, in contrast to existing work, we formulate the problem in a fundamentally new manner by optimizing the internal representation for the one-shot task using the notion of micro-sets. A micro-set is a sample of data that contains only a single instance of each category, sampled from the pool of available data, which serves as a mechanism to force the learned representation to explicitly address the variability and noise inherent in the one-shot recognition task. We optimize our learned domain features so that they minimize an expected loss over micro-sets drawn from the training set and show that these features generalize effectively to previously unseen categories. We detail a discriminative approach for optimizing one-shot recognition using micro-sets and present experiments on the Animals with Attributes and Caltech-101 datasets that demonstrate the benefits of our formulation."

Traditional approaches require applying a battery of different classifiers to the image, at multiple locations and scales. This can be slow and can require a lot of training data since each classifier requires the computation of many different image features. In particular, for independently trained detectors, the (runtime) computational complexity and the (training-time) sample complexity scale linearly with the number of classes to be detected. We present a multitask learning procedure, based on boosted decision stumps, that reduces the computational and sample complexity by finding common features that can be shared across the classes (and/or views). The detectors for each class are trained jointly, rather than independently. For a given performance level, the total number of features required and, therefore, the runtime cost of the classifier, is observed to scale approximately logarithmically with the number of classes. The features selected by joint training are generic edge-like features, whereas the features chosen by training each class separately tend to be more object-specific. The generic features generalize better and considerably reduce the computational cost of multiclass object detection"

But as the visual recognition tasks become more challenging, the semantic gap between low-level feature representation and the meaning of the scenes increases. In this paper, we propose to use objects as attributes of scenes for scene classification. We represent images by collecting their responses to a large number of object detectors, or \"object filters\". Such representation carries high-level semantic information rather than low-level image feature information, making it more suitable for high-level visual recognition tasks. Using very simple, off-the-shelf classifiers such as SVM, we show that this object-level image representation can be used effectively for high-level visual tasks such as scene classification. Our results are superior to reported state-of-the-art performance on a number of standard datasets."

However, existing techniques restrict these properties to categorical labels (for example, a person is \u2018smiling\u2019 or not, a scene is \u2018dry\u2019 or not), and thus fail to capture more general semantic relationships. We propose to model relative attributes. Given training data stating how object/scene categories relate according to different attributes, we learn a ranking function per attribute. The learned ranking functions predict the relative strength of each property in novel images. We then build a generative model over the joint space of attribute ranking outputs, and propose a novel form of zero-shot learning in which the supervisor relates the unseen object category to previously seen objects via attributes (for example, \u2018bears are furrier than giraffes\u2019). We further show how the proposed relative attributes enable richer textual descriptions for new images, which in practice are more precise for human interpretation. We demonstrate the approach on datasets of faces and natural scenes, and show its clear advantages over traditional binary attribute prediction for these new tasks."

The descriptor is the output of a large number of weakly trained object category classifiers on the image. The trained categories are selected from an ontology of visual concepts, but the intention is not to encode an explicit decomposition of the scene. Rather, we accept that existing object category classifiers often encode not the category per se but ancillary image characteristics; and that these ancillary characteristics can combine to represent visual classes unrelated to the constituent categories' semantic meanings. \n \nThe advantage of this descriptor is that it allows object-category queries to be made against image databases using efficient classifiers (efficient at test time) such as linear support vector machines, and allows these queries to be for novel categories. Even when the representation is reduced to 200 bytes per image, classification accuracy on object category recognition is comparable with the state of the art (36% versus 42%), but at orders of magnitude lower computational cost."

Describable visual attributes are labels that can be given to an image to describe its appearance. This paper focuses on images of faces and the attributes used to describe them, although the concepts also apply to other domains. Examples of face attributes include gender, age, jaw shape, nose size, etc. The advantages of an attribute-based representation for vision tasks are manifold: They can be composed to create descriptions at various levels of specificity; they are generalizable, as they can be learned once and then applied to recognize new objects or categories without any further training; and they are efficient, possibly requiring exponentially fewer attributes (and training data) than explicitly naming each category. We show how one can create and label large data sets of real-world images to train classifiers which measure the presence, absence, or degree to which an attribute is expressed in images. These classifiers can then automatically label new images. We demonstrate the current effectiveness-and explore the future potential-of using attributes for face verification and image search via human and computational experiments. Finally, we introduce two new face data sets, named FaceTracer and PubFig, with labeled attributes and identities, respectively."

We introduce an approach to define a vocabulary of attributes that is both human understandable and discriminative. The system takes object/scene-labeled images as input, and returns as output a set of attributes elicited from human annotators that distinguish the categories of interest. To ensure a compact vocabulary and efficient use of annotators' effort, we 1) show how to actively augment the vocabulary such that new attributes resolve inter-class confusions, and 2) propose a novel \"nameability\" manifold that prioritizes candidate attributes by their likelihood of being associated with a nameable property. We demonstrate the approach with multiple datasets, and show its clear advantages over baselines that lack a name-ability model or rely on a list of expert-provided attributes."

However, fusing multiple attribute scores - as required during multi-attribute queries or similarity searches - presents a significant challenge. Scores from different attribute classifiers cannot be combined in a simple way; the same score for different attributes can mean different things. In this work, we show how to construct normalized \u201cmulti-attribute spaces\u201d from raw classifier outputs, using techniques based on the statistical Extreme Value Theory. Our method calibrates each raw score to a probability that the given attribute is present in the image. We describe how these probabilities can be fused in a simple way to perform more accurate multiattribute searches, as well as enable attribute-based similarity searches. A significant advantage of our approach is that the normalization is done after-the-fact, requiring neither modification to the attribute classification system nor ground truth attribute annotations. We demonstrate results on a large data set of nearly 2 million face images and show significant improvements over prior work. We also show that perceptual similarity of search results increases by using contextual attributes."

We show that it is possible to learn much information about a category from just one, or a handful, of images. The key insight is that, rather than learning from scratch, one can take advantage of knowledge coming from previously learned categories, no matter how different these categories might be. We explore a Bayesian implementation of this idea. Object categories are represented by probabilistic models. Prior knowledge is represented as a probability density function on the parameters of these models. The posterior model for an object category is obtained by updating the prior in the light of one or more observations. We test a simple implementation of our algorithm on a database of 101 diverse object categories. We compare category models learned by an implementation of our Bayesian approach to models learned from by maximum likelihood (ML) and maximum a posteriori (MAP) methods. We find that on a database of more than 100 categories, the Bayesian approach produces informative models when the number of training examples is too small for other methods to operate successfully."

A more realistic scenario for vision applications is \u201copen set\u201d recognition, where incomplete knowledge of the world is present at training time, and unknown classes can be submitted to an algorithm during testing. This paper explores the nature of open set recognition and formalizes its definition as a constrained minimization problem. The open set recognition problem is not well addressed by existing algorithms because it requires strong generalization. As a step toward a solution, we introduce a novel \u201c1-vs-set machine,\u201d which sculpts a decision space from the marginal distances of a 1-class or binary SVM with a linear kernel. This methodology applies to several different applications in computer vision where open set recognition is a challenging problem, including object recognition and face verification. We consider both in this work, with large scale cross-dataset experiments performed over the Caltech 256 and ImageNet sets, as well as face matching experiments performed over the Labeled Faces in the Wild set. The experiments highlight the effectiveness of machines adapted for open set evaluation compared to existing 1-class and binary SVMs for the same tasks."

In order to scale the use of these describable visual attributes to a large number of categories, especially those not well studied by psychologists or linguists, it will be necessary to find alternative techniques for identifying attribute vocabularies and for learning to recognize attributes without hand labeled training data. We demonstrate that it is possible to accomplish both these tasks automatically by mining text and image data sampled from the Internet. The proposed approach also characterizes attributes according to their visual representation: global or local, and type: color, texture, or shape. This work focuses on discovering attributes and their visual appearance, and is as agnostic as possible about the textual description."

As an example we tackle recognition of butterfly species, learning models from descriptions in an online nature guide. We propose natural language processing methods for extracting salient visual attributes from these descriptions to use as \u2018templates\u2019 for the object categories, and apply vision methods to extract corresponding attributes from test images. A generative model is used to connect textual terms in the learnt templates to visual attributes. We report experiments comparing the performance of humans and the proposed method on a dataset of ten butterfly categories."

Our attribute database spans more than 700 categories and 14,000 images and has potential for use in high-level scene understanding and fine-grained scene recognition. We use our dataset to train attribute classifiers and evaluate how well these relatively simple classifiers can recognize a variety of attributes related to materials, surface properties, lighting, functions and affordances, and spatial envelope properties."

We propose a unified framework wherein manually specified attributes are: i) selected in a discriminative fashion so as to account for intra-class variability; ii) coherently integrated with data-driven attributes to make the attribute set more descriptive. Data-driven attributes are automatically inferred from the training data using an information theoretic approach. Our framework is built upon a latent SVM formulation where latent variables capture the degree of importance of each attribute for each action class. We also demonstrate that our attribute-based action representation can be effectively used to design a recognition procedure for classifying novel action classes for which no training samples are available. We test our approach on several publicly available datasets and obtain promising results that quantitatively demonstrate our theoretical claims."

Doing so allows us not only to name familiar objects, but also: to report unusual aspects of a familiar object (\u201cspotty dog\u201d, not just \u201cdog\u201d); to say something about unfamiliar objects (\u201chairy and four-legged\u201d, not just \u201cunknown\u201d); and to learn how to recognize new objects with few or no visual examples. Rather than focusing on identity assignment, we make inferring attributes the core problem of recognition. These attributes can be semantic (\u201cspotty\u201d) or discriminative (\u201cdogs have it but sheep do not\u201d). Learning attributes presents a major new challenge: generalization across object categories, not just across instances within a category. In this paper, we also introduce a novel feature selection method for learning attributes that generalize well across categories. We support our claims by thorough evaluation that provides insights into the limitations of the standard recognition paradigm of naming and demonstrates the new abilities provided by our attribute-based framework."

The evaluation is usually done within each dataset, therefore it is questionable if such results are a reliable indicator of true generalization ability. We propose here an algorithm to exploit the existing data resources when learning on a new multiclass problem. Our main idea is to identify an image representation that decomposes orthogonally into two subspaces: a part specific to each dataset, and a part generic to, and therefore shared between, all the considered source sets. This allows us to use the generic representation as un-biased reference knowledge for a novel classification task. By casting the method in the multi-view setting, we also make it possible to use different features for different databases. We call the algorithm MUST, Multitask Unaligned Shared knowledge Transfer. Through extensive experiments on five public datasets, we show that MUST consistently improves the cross-datasets generalization performance."

Attributes are visual qualities of objects, such as 'red', 'striped', or 'spotted'. The model sees attributes as patterns of image segments, repeatedly sharing some characteristic properties. These can be any combination of appearance, shape, or the layout of segments within the pattern. Moreover, attributes with general appearance are taken into account, such as the pattern of alternation of any two colors which is characteristic for stripes. To enable learning from unsegmented training images, the model is learnt discriminatively, by optimizing a likelihood ratio. \n \nAs demonstrated in the experimental evaluation, our model can learn in a weakly supervised setting and encompasses a broad range of attributes.

Objects are modeled as flexible constellations of parts. A probabilistic representation is used for all aspects of the object: shape, appearance, occlusion and relative scale. An entropy-based feature detector is used to select regions and their scale within the image. In learning the parameters of the scale-invariant object model are estimated. This is done using expectation-maximization in a maximum-likelihood setting. In recognition, this model is used in a Bayesian manner to classify images. The flexible nature of the model is demonstrated by excellent results over a range of datasets including geometrically constrained classes (e.g. faces, cars) and flexible objects (such as animals)."

First, we introduce a descriptor that represents local image shape and its spatial layout, together with a spatial pyramid kernel. These are designed so that the shape correspondence between two images can be measured by the distance between their descriptors using the kernel. Second, we generalize the spatial pyramid kernel, and learn its level weighting parameters (on a validation set). This significantly improves classification performance. Third, we show that shape and appearance kernels may be combined (again by learning parameters on a validation set).\n Results are reported for classification on Caltech-101 and retrieval on the TRECVID 2006 data sets. For Caltech-101 it is shown that the class specific optimization that we introduce exceeds the state of the art performance by more than 10%."

Zero-data learning is useful for problems where the set of classes to distinguish or tasks to solve is very large and is not entirely covered by the training data. The main contributions of this work lie in the presentation of a general formalization of zero-data learning, in an experimental analysis of its properties and in empirical evidence showing that generalization is possible and significant in this context. The experimental work of this paper addresses two classification problems of character recognition and a multitask ranking problem in the context of drug discovery. Finally, we conclude by discussing how this new framework could lead to a novel perspective on how to extend machine learning towards AI, where an agent can be given a specification for a learning problem before attempting to solve it (with very few or even zero examples)."

We introduce LOCUS (learning object classes with unsupervised segmentation) which uses a generative probabilistic model to combine bottom-up cues of color and edge with top-down cues of shape and pose. A key aspect of this model is that the object appearance is allowed to vary from image to image, allowing for significant within-class variation. By iteratively updating the belief in the object's position, size, segmentation and pose, LOCUS avoids making hard decisions about any of these quantities and so allows for each to be refined at any stage. We show that LOCUS successfully learns an object class model from unlabeled images, whilst also giving segmentation accuracies that rival existing supervised methods. Finally, we demonstrate simultaneous recognition and segmentation in novel images using the learned models for a number of object classes, as well as unsupervised object discovery and tracking in video."

However, scene understanding research has been constrained by the limited scope of currently-used databases which do not capture the full variety of scene categories. Whereas standard databases for object categorization contain hundreds of different classes of objects, the largest available dataset of scene categories contains only 15 classes. In this paper we propose the extensive Scene UNderstanding (SUN) database that contains 899 categories and 130,519 images. We use 397 well-sampled categories to evaluate numerous state-of-the-art algorithms for scene recognition and establish new bounds of performance. We measure human scene classification performance on the SUN database and compare this with computational methods. Additionally, we study a finer-grained scene representation to detect scenes embedded inside of larger scenes."

Our system achieves a two-fold improvement in average precision over the best performance in the 2006 PASCAL person detection challenge. It also outperforms the best results in the 2007 challenge in ten out of twenty categories. The system relies heavily on deformable parts. While deformable part models have become quite popular, their value had not been demonstrated on difficult benchmarks such as the PASCAL challenge. Our system also relies heavily on new methods for discriminative training. We combine a margin-sensitive approach for data mining hard negative examples with a formalism we call latent SVM. A latent SVM, like a hidden CRF, leads to a non-convex training problem. However, a latent SVM is semi-convex and the training problem becomes convex once latent information is specified for the positive examples. We believe that our training methods will eventually make possible the effective use of more latent information such as hierarchical (grammar) models and models involving latent three dimensional pose."

The detector uses a cascade that unites the handling of similar object classes while separating off classes at appropriate levels of the cascade. No prior knowledge about the relationship between classes is needed as the classifier structure is automatically determined during the training phase. The detection nodes in the cascade use Haar wavelet features and Gentle AdaBoost, however the approach is not dependent on the specific features used and can easily be extended to other cases. Experiments are presented for several numbers of object classes and the approach is compared to other classifying schemes. The results demonstrate a large efficiency gain that is particularly prominent for a greater number of classes. Also the complexity of the training scales well with the number of classes."

We treat attributes of an object as latent variables in our model and capture the correlations among attributes using an undirected graphical model built from training data. The advantage of our model is that it allows us to infer object class labels using the information of both the test image itself and its (latent) attributes. Our model unifies object class prediction and attribute prediction in a principled framework. It is also flexible enough to deal with different performance measurements. Our experimental results provide quantitative evidence that attributes can improve object naming."

The resulting feature extractor consists of multiple convolution filters, followed by a feature-pooling layer that computes the max of each filter output within adjacent windows, and a point-wise sigmoid non-linearity. A second level of larger and more invariant features is obtained by training the same algorithm on patches of features from the first level. Training a supervised classifier on these features yields 0.64% error on MNIST, and 54% average recognition rate on Caltech 101 with 30 training samples per category. While the resulting architecture is similar to convolutional networks, the layer-wise unsupervised training procedure alleviates the over-parameterization problems that plague purely supervised learning procedures, and yields good performance with very few labeled training samples."

In this method, experience with already learned classes is used to facilitate the learning of novel classes. Our classification scheme employs features that discriminate between class and non-class images. For a novel class, new features are derived by selecting features that proved useful for already learned classification tasks, and adapting these features to the new classification task. This adaptation is performed by replacing the features from already learned classes with similar features taken from the novel class. A single example of a novel class is sufficient to perform feature adaptation and achieve useful classification performance. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can learn a novel class from a single training example, using 10 additional familiar classes. The performance is significantly improved compared to using no feature adaptation. The robustness of the proposed feature adaptation concept is demonstrated by similar performance gains across 107 widely varying object categories."

At the interface, the user specifies a set of vehicle characteristics (such as color, direction of travel, speed, length, height, etc.) and the system automatically retrieves video events that match the provided description. A key differentiating aspect of our system is the ability to handle challenging urban conditions such as high volumes of activity and environmental factors. This is achieved through a novel multi-view vehicle detection approach which relies on what we call motionlet classifiers, i.e. classifiers that are learned with vehicle samples clustered in the motion configuration space. We employ massively parallel feature selection to learn compact and accurate motionlet detectors. Moreover, in order to deal with different vehicle types (buses, trucks, SUVs, cars), we learn the motionlet detectors in a shape-free appearance space, where all training samples are resized to the same aspect ratio, and then during test time the aspect ratio of the sliding window is changed to allow the detection of different vehicle types. Once a vehicle is detected and tracked over the video, fine-grained attributes are extracted and ingested into a database to allow future search queries such as \"Show me all blue trucks larger than 7ft length traveling at high speed northbound last Saturday, from 2pm to 5pm\"."

The idea lies in augmenting an existing attribute-based representation with additional dimensions for which an autoencoder model is coupled with a large-margin principle. This construction allows a smooth transition between the zero-shot regime with no training example, the unsupervised regime with training examples but without class labels, and the supervised regime with training examples and with class labels. The resulting optimization problem can be solved efficiently, because several of the necessity steps have closed-form solutions. Through extensive experiments we show that the augmented representation achieves better results in terms of object categorization accuracy than the semantic representation alone."

For example, perusing image results for a query \u201cblack shoes\u201d, the user might state, \u201cShow me shoe images like these, but sportier.\u201d Offline, our approach first learns a set of ranking functions, each of which predicts the relative strength of a nameable attribute in an image (`sportiness', `furriness', etc.). At query time, the system presents an initial set of reference images, and the user selects among them to provide relative attribute feedback. Using the resulting constraints in the multi-dimensional attribute space, our method updates its relevance function and re-ranks the pool of images. This procedure iterates using the accumulated constraints until the top ranked images are acceptably close to the user's envisioned target. In this way, our approach allows a user to efficiently \u201cwhittle away\u201d irrelevant portions of the visual feature space, using semantic language to precisely communicate her preferences to the system.

It is based upon minimizing the summed component-wise (pixel-wise) entropies over a continuous set of transforms on the data. One of the biproducts of this minimization is a set of transform, one associated with each original training sample. We then demonstrate a procedure for effectively bringing test data into correspondence with the data-defined model produced in the congealing process. Subsequently; we develop a probability density over the set of transforms that arose from the congealing process. We suggest that this density over transforms may be shared by many classes, and demonstrate how using this density as \"prior knowledge\" can be used to develop a classifier based on only a single training example for each class."

The teacher then provides a label for only that instance. This is quite restrictive. In this paper, we propose a learning paradigm in which the learner communicates its belief (i.e. predicted label) about the actively chosen example to the teacher. The teacher then confirms or rejects the predicted label. More importantly, if rejected, the teacher communicates an explanation for why the learner's belief was wrong. This explanation allows the learner to propagate the feedback provided by the teacher to many unlabeled images. This allows a classifier to better learn from its mistakes, leading to accelerated discriminative learning of visual concepts even with few labeled images. In order for such communication to be feasible, it is crucial to have a language that both the human supervisor and the machine learner understand. Attributes provide precisely this channel. They are human-interpretable mid-level visual concepts shareable across categories e.g. \"furry\", \"spacious\", etc. We advocate the use of attributes for a supervisor to provide feedback to a classifier and directly communicate his knowledge of the world. We employ a straightforward approach to incorporate this feedback in the classifier, and demonstrate its power on a variety of visual recognition scenarios such as image classification and annotation. This application of attributes for providing classifiers feedback is very powerful, and has not been explored in the community. It introduces a new mode of supervision, and opens up several avenues for future research."

The goal of our method is to explore fine image statistics and identify the discriminative image patches for recognition. We achieve this goal by combining two ideas, discriminative feature mining and randomization. Discriminative feature mining allows us to model the detailed information that distinguishes different classes of images, while randomization allows us to handle the huge feature space and prevents over-fitting. We propose a random forest with discriminative decision trees algorithm, where every tree node is a discriminative classifier that is trained by combining the information in this node as well as all upstream nodes. Our method is tested on both subordinate categorization and activity recognition datasets. Experimental results show that our method identifies semantically meaningful visual information and outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms on various datasets."

We study the influence of each stage of the computation on performance, concluding that fine-scale gradients, fine orientation binning, relatively coarse spatial binning, and high-quality local contrast normalization in overlapping descriptor blocks are all important for good results. The new approach gives near-perfect separation on the original MIT pedestrian database, so we introduce a more challenging dataset containing over 1800 annotated human images with a large range of pose variations and backgrounds."

Faces in our database have been extracted and aligned from images downloaded from the internet using a commercial face detector, and the number of images and attributes continues to grow daily. Our classification approach uses a novel combination of Support Vector Machines and Adaboost which exploits the strong structure of faces to select and train on the optimal set of features for each attribute. We show state-of-the-art classification results compared to previous works, and demonstrate the power of our architecture through a functional, large-scale face search engine. Our framework is fully automatic, easy to scale, and computes all labels off-line, leading to fast on-line search performance. In addition, we describe how our system can be used for a number of applications, including law enforcement, social networks, and personal photo management. Our search engine will soon be made publicly available."

The definition is acquired by studying collections of training examples of the form (xi, f(xi)). Existing approaches to multiclass learning problems include direct application of multiclass algorithms such as the decision-tree algorithms C4.5 and CART, application of binary concept learning algorithms to learn individual binary functions for each of the k classes, and application of binary concept learning algorithms with distributed output representations. This paper compares these three approaches to a new technique in which error-correcting codes are employed as a distributed output representation. We show that these output representations improve the generalization performance of both C4.5 and backpropagation on a wide range of multiclass learning tasks. We also demonstrate that this approach is robust with respect to changes in the size of the training sample, the assignment of distributed representations to particular classes, and the application of overfitting avoidance techniques such as decision-tree pruning. Finally, we show that--like the other methods--the error-correcting code technique can provide reliable class probability estimates. Taken together, these results demonstrate that error-correcting output codes provide a general-purpose method for improving the performance of inductive learning programs on multiclass problems."

Scalability to large numbers of classes however remains an important challenge for today's recognition methods. Several authors have promoted knowledge transfer between classes as a key ingredient to address this challenge. However, in previous work the decision which knowledge to transfer has required either manual supervision or at least a few training examples limiting the scalability of these approaches. In this work we explicitly address the question of how to automatically decide which information to transfer between classes without the need of any human intervention. For this we tap into linguistic knowledge bases to provide the semantic link between sources (what) and targets (where) of knowledge transfer. We provide a rigorous experimental evaluation of different knowledge bases and state-of-the-art techniques from Natural Language Processing which goes far beyond the limited use of language in related work. We also give insights into the applicability (why) of different knowledge sources and similarity measures for knowledge transfer."

The fundamental assumption of the proposed theory, recognition-by-components (RBC), is that a modest set of generalized-cone components, called geons (N \u00a3 36), can be derived from contrasts of five readily detectable properties of edges in a two-dimensiona l image: curvature, collinearity, symmetry, parallelism, and cotermination. The detection of these properties is generally invariant over viewing position an$ image quality and consequently allows robust object perception when the image is projected from a novel viewpoint or is degraded. RBC thus provides a principled account of the heretofore undecided relation between the classic principles of perceptual organization and pattern recognition: The constraints toward regularization (Pragnanz) characterize not the complete object but the object's components. Representational power derives from an allowance of free combinations of the geons. A Principle of Componential Recovery can account for the major phenomena of object recognition: If an arrangement of two or three geons can be recovered from the input, objects can be quickly recognized even when they are occluded, novel, rotated in depth, or extensively degraded. The results from experiments on the perception of briefly presented pictures by human observers provide empirical support for the theory. Any single object can project an infinity of image configurations to the retina. The orientation of the object to the viewer can vary continuously, each giving rise to a different two-dimensional projection. The object can be occluded by other objects or texture fields, as when viewed behind foliage. The object need not be presented as a full-colored textured image but instead can be a simplified line drawing. Moreover, the object can even be missing some of its parts or be a novel exemplar of its particular category. But it is only with rare exceptions that an image fails to be rapidly and readily classified, either as an instance of a familiar object category or as an instance that cannot be so classified (itself a form of classification)."

These color chips are labeled with color names within a well-defined experimental setup by human test subjects. However, naming colors in real-world images differs significantly from this experimental setting. In this paper, we investigate how color names learned from color chips compare to color names learned from real-world images. To avoid hand labeling real-world images with color names, we use Google image to collect a data set. Due to the limitations of Google image, this data set contains a substantial quantity of wrongly labeled data. We propose several variants of the PLSA model to learn color names from this noisy data. Experimental results show that color names learned from real-world images significantly outperform color names learned from labeled color chips for both image retrieval and image annotation."

What is correlated across images (or across video sequences) is the internal layout of local self-similarities (up to some distortions), even though the patterns generating those local self-similarities are quite different in each of the images/videos. These internal self-similarities are efficiently captured by a compact local \"self-similarity descriptor\"', measured densely throughout the image/video, at multiple scales, while accounting for local and global geometric distortions. This gives rise to matching capabilities of complex visual data, including detection of objects in real cluttered images using only rough hand-sketches, handling textured objects with no clear boundaries, and detecting complex actions in cluttered video data with no prior learning. We compare our measure to commonly used image-based and video-based similarity measures, and demonstrate its applicability to object detection, retrieval, and action detection."

For an N-class problem, the DDAG contains N(N - 1)/2 classifiers, one for each pair of classes. We present a VC analysis of the case when the node classifiers are hyperplanes; the resulting bound on the test error depends on N and on the margin achieved at the nodes, but not on the dimension of the space. This motivates an algorithm, DAGSVM, which operates in a kernel-induced feature space and uses two-class maximal margin hyperplanes at each decision-node of the DDAG. The DAGSVM is substantially faster to train and evaluate than either the standard algorithm or Max Wins, while maintaining comparable accuracy to both of these algorithms."

Additionally, we give an outlook on very recent, non-classical techniques for the prediction of structure data, for the estimation of statistical dependency, and for learning the kernel function itself. All methods are illustrated with examples of successful application from the recent computer vision research literature."

TRECVid completed its fifth annual cycle at the end of 2005 and in 2006 TRECVid will involve almost 70 research organizations, universities and other consortia. Throughout its existence, TRECVid has benchmarked both interactive and automatic/manual searching for shots from within a video corpus,automatic detection of a variety of semantic and low-level video features, shot boundary detection and the detection of story boundaries in broadcast TV news. This paper will give an introduction to information retrieval (IR) evaluation from both a user and a system perspective, high-lighting that system evaluation is by far the most prevalent type of evaluation carried out. We also include a summary of TRECVid as an example of a system evaluation bench-marking campaign and this allows us to discuss whether such campaigns are a good thing or a bad thing. There are arguments for and against these campaigns and we present some of them in the paper concluding that on balance they have had a very positive impact on research progress."

The model we study can be interpreted as a broad, abstract extension of the well-studied on-line prediction model to a general decision-theoretic setting. We show that the multiplicative weight-update Littlestone?Warmuth rule can be adapted to this model, yielding bounds that are slightly weaker in some cases, but applicable to a considerably more general class of learning problems. We show how the resulting learning algorithm can be applied to a variety of problems, including gambling, multiple-outcome prediction, repeated games, and prediction of points in Rn. In the second part of the paper we apply the multiplicative weight-update technique to derive a new boosting algorithm. This boosting algorithm does not require any prior knowledge about the performance of the weak learning algorithm. We also study generalizations of the new boosting algorithm to the problem of learning functions whose range, rather than being binary, is an arbitrary finite set or a bounded segment of the real line."

We present a system to automatically generate natural language descriptions from images that exploits both statistics gleaned from parsing large quantities of text data and recognition algorithms from computer vision. The system is very effective at producing relevant sentences for images. It also generates descriptions that are notably more true to the specific image content than previous work."

Tying our past experiences to our present interactions with the environment, they enable us to recognize and understand new objects and events. Concepts are also relevant to understanding domains such as social situations, personality types, and even artistic styles. Yet like other phenomenologically simple cognitive processes such as walking or understanding speech, concept formation and use are maddeningly complex. Research since the 1970s and the decline of the \"classical view\" of concepts have greatly illuminated the psychology of concepts. But persistent theoretical disputes have sometimes obscured this progress. The Big Book of Concepts goes beyond those disputes to reveal the advances that have been made, focusing on the major empirical discoveries. By reviewing and evaluating research on diverse topics such as category learning, word meaning, conceptual development in infants and children, and the basic level of categorization, the book develops a much broader range of criteria than is usual for evaluating theories of concepts."

The models are obtained by recursively partitioning the data space and fitting a simple prediction model within each partition. As a result, the partitioning can be represented graphically as a decision tree. Classification trees are designed for dependent variables that take a finite number of unordered values, with prediction error measured in terms of misclassification cost. Regression trees are for dependent variables that take continuous or ordered discrete values, with prediction error typically measured by the squared difference between the observed and predicted values.

As new experiments are made, we sometimes witness the survival of the fittest, sometimes the survival of the most familiar. A healthy conservatism keeps things from changing too rapidly; a healthy radicalism keeps things in tune with new theoretical emphases. Our mathematical language continues to improve, just as \"the d-ism of Leibniz overtook the dotage of Newton\" in past centuries [4, Chapter 4]. In 1970 I began teaching a class at Stanford University entitled Concrete Mathematics. The students and I studied how to manipulate formulas in continuous and discrete mathematics, and the problems we investigated were often inspired by new developments in computer science. As the years went by we began to see that a few changes in notational traditions would greatly facilitate our work. The notes from that class have recently been published in a book [15], and as I wrote the final drafts of that book I learned to my surprise that two of the notations we had been using were considerably more useful than I had previously realized. The ideas \"clicked\" so well, in fact, that I've decided to write this article, blatantly attempting to promote these notations among the mathematicians who have no use for [15]. I hope that within five years everybody will be able to use these notations in published papers without needing to explain what they mean. The notations I'm talking about are (1) Iverson's convention for characteristic functions; and (2) the \"right\" notation for Stirling numbers, at last."

An example is robins have sesamoid bones, therefore falcons have sesamoid bones. The model is based on the hypothesis that argument strength is related to the proportion of the conclusion category\u2032s features that are shared by the premise categories. The model assumes a two-stage process. First, premises are encoded by connecting the features of premise categories to the predicate. Second, conclusions are tested by examining the degree of activation of the predicate upon presentation of the features of the conclusion category. The model accounts for 13 qualitative phenomena and shows close quantitative fits to several sets of argument strength ratings."
