Training data consists of natural language sentences annotated with multiple potential meaning representations, only one of which is correct. Such ambiguous supervision models the type of supervision that can be more naturally available to language-learning systems. Given such weak supervision, our approach produces a semantic parser that maps sentences into meaning representations. An existing semantic parsing learning system that can only learn from unambiguous supervision is augmented to handle ambiguous supervision. Experimental results show that the resulting system is able to cope up with ambiguities and learn accurate semantic parsers."

The model is applied to the task of mapping sentences to hierarchical representations of their underlying meaning. We introduce dynamic programming techniques for efficient training and decoding. In experiments, we demonstrate that the model, when coupled with a discriminative reranking technique, achieves state-of-the-art performance when tested on two publicly available corpora. The generative model degrades robustly when presented with instances that are different from those seen in training. This allows a notable improvement in recall compared to previous models."

Central to this approach is the entity-grid representation of discourse, which captures patterns of entity distribution in a text. The algorithm introduced in the article automatically abstracts a text into a set of entity transition sequences and records distributional, syntactic, and referential information about discourse entities. We re-conceptualize coherence assessment as a learning task and show that our entity-based representation is well-suited for ranking-based generation and text classification tasks. Using the proposed representation, we achieve good performance on text ordering, summary coherence evaluation, and readability assessment."

There are two technical problems involved: (1) the correspondence problem in symbol grounding - how to associate words (symbols) with their perceptually grounded meanings from multiple cooccurrences between words and objects in the physical environment. (2) object learning - how to recognize and categorize visual objects. We argue that those two problems can be fundamentally simplified by considering them in a general system and incorporating the spatio-temporal and cross-modal constraints of multimodal data. The system collects egocentric data including image sequences as well as speech while users perform natural tasks. It is able to automatically infer the meanings of object names from vision, and categorize objects based on teaching signals potentially encoded in speech. The experimental results reported in this paper reveal the effectiveness of using multimodal data and integrating heterogeneous techniques in machine learning, natural language processing and computer vision."

The goal is to link individual database entries with sentences that verbalize the same information. By providing explicit semantics-to-text links, these alignments can aid the training of natural language generation and information extraction systems. Beyond these pragmatic benefits, the alignment problem is appealing from a modeling perspective: the mappings between database entries and text sentences exhibit rich structural dependencies, unique to this task. Thus, the key challenge is to make use of as many global dependencies as possible without sacrificing tractability. To this end, we cast text-database alignment as a structured multilabel classification task where each sentence is labeled with a subset of matching database entries. In contrast to existing multilabel classifiers, our approach operates over arbitrary global features of inputs and proposed labels. We compare our model with a baseline classifier that makes locally optimal decisions. Our results show that the proposed model yields a 15% relative reduction in error, and compares favorably with human performance."

It first uses an integrated statistical parser to produce a semantically augmented parse tree, in which each non-terminal node has both a syntactic and a semantic label. A compositional-semantics procedure is then used to map the augmented parse tree into a final meaning representation. We evaluate the system in two domains, a natural-language database interface and an interpreter for coaching instructions in robotic soccer. We present experimental results demonstrating that Scissor produces more accurate semantic representations than several previous approaches."

Unsupervised systems for this task are driven by lexical cohesion: the tendency of well-formed segments to induce a compact and consistent lexical distribution. We show that lexical cohesion can be placed in a Bayesian context by modeling the words in each topic segment as draws from a multinomial language model associated with the segment; maximizing the observation likelihood in such a model yields a lexically-cohesive segmentation. This contrasts with previous approaches, which relied on hand-crafted cohesion metrics. The Bayesian framework provides a principled way to incorporate additional features such as cue phrases, a powerful indicator of discourse structure that has not been previously used in unsupervised segmentation systems. Our model yields consistent improvements over an array of state-of-the-art systems on both text and speech datasets. We also show that both an entropy-based analysis and a well-known previous technique can be derived as special cases of the Bayesian framework."

According to the theory, concepts that ground linguistic meaning are neither internal nor external to language users, but instead span the objective-subjective boundary. To model the possible interactions between subject and object, the theory relies on the notion of perceived affordances: structured units of interaction that can be used for prediction at multiple levels of abstraction. Language understanding is treated as a process of filtering perceived affordances. The theory accounts for many aspects of the situated nature of human language use and provides a unified solution to a number of demands on any theory of language understanding including conceptual combination, prototypicality effects, and the generative nature of lexical items. To support the theory, we describe an implemented system that understands verbal commands situated in a virtual gaming environment. The implementation uses probabilistic hierarchical plan recognition to generate perceived affordances. The system has been evaluated on its ability to correctly interpret free-form spontaneous verbal commands recorded from unrehearsed game play between human players. The system is able to \"step into the shoes\" of human players and correctly respond to a broad range of verbal commands in which linguistic meaning depends on social and physical context. We quantitatively compare the system's predictions in response to direct player commands with the actions taken by human players and show generalization to unseen data across a range of situations and verbal constructions."

We demonstrate that for certain field structured extraction tasks, such as classified advertisements and bibliographic citations, small amounts of prior knowledge can be used to learn effective models in a primarily unsupervised fashion. Although hidden Markov models (HMMs) provide a suitable generative model for field structured text, general unsupervised HMM learning fails to learn useful structure in either of our domains. However, one can dramatically improve the quality of the learned structure by exploiting simple prior knowledge of the desired solutions. In both domains, we found that unsupervised methods can attain accuracies with 400 unlabeled examples comparable to those attained by supervised methods on 50 labeled examples, and that semi-supervised methods can make good use of small amounts of labeled data."

We define a concept of word-by-word alignment between such pairs of sentences. For any given pair of such sentences each of our models assigns a probability to each of the possible word-by-word alignments. We give an algorithm for seeking the most probable of these alignments. Although the algorithm is suboptimal, the alignment thus obtained accounts well for the word-by-word relationships in the pair of sentences. We have a great deal of data in French and English from the proceedings of the Canadian Parliament. Accordingly, we have restricted our work to these two languages; but we feel that because our algorithms have minimal linguistic content they would work well on other pairs of languages. We also feel, again because of the minimal linguistic content of our algorithms, that it is reasonable to argue that word-by-word alignments are inherent in any sufficiently large bilingual corpus."

The idea of the model is to make the alignment probabilities dependent on the differences in the alignment positions rather than on the absolute positions. To achieve this goal, the approach uses a first-order Hidden Markov model (HMM) for the word alignment problem as they are used successfully in speech recognition for the time alignment problem. The difference to the time alignment HMM is that there is no monotony constraint for the possible word orderings. We describe the details of the model and test the model on several bilingual corpora."
