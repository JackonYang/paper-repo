The example that is used demonstrates that the likelihood for the factor analysis model may have multiple modes that are not simply rotations of each other; such behavior should concern users of maximum likelihood factor analysis and certainly should cast doubt on the general utility of second derivatives of the log likelihood as measures of precision of estimation."

The models allow a priori information about the structure of the manifolds to be combined with empirical data. Accurate modeling of the manifolds allows digits to be discriminated using the relative probability densities under the alternative models. One of the methods is grounded in principal components analysis, the other in factor analysis. Both methods are based on locally linear low-dimensional approximations to the underlying data manifold. Links with other methods that model the manifold are discussed."

The technique models the distribution of human face patterns by means of a few view-based \"face\" and \"nonface\" model clusters. At each image location, a difference feature vector is computed between the local image pattern and the distribution-based model. A trained classifier determines, based on the difference feature vector measurements, whether or not a human face exists at the current image location. We show empirically that the distance metric we adopt for computing difference feature vectors, and the \"nonface\" clusters we include in our distribution-based model, are both critical for the success of our system."

However, we often have high-level knowledge about the learning problem. In optical character recognition (OCR), for instance, we know that the classification should be invariant under a set of transformations like rotation or translation. We propose a new modular classification system based on several autoassociative multilayer perceptrons which allows the efficient incorporation of such knowledge. Results are reported on the NIST database of upper case handwritten letters and compared to other approaches to the invariance problem."
