This paper describes automatic and semi-automatic procedures for extracting and organizing semantic feature information implicit in dictionary definitions. Two head-finding heuristics are described for locating the genus terms in noun and verb definitions. The assumption is that the genus term represents inherent features of the word it defines. The two heuristics have been used to process definitions of 40,000 nouns and 8,000 verbs, producing indexes in which each genus term is associated with the words it defined. The Sprout program interactively grows a taxonomic \"tree\" from any specified root feature by consulting the genus index. Its output is a tree in which all of the nodes have the root feature for at least one of their senses. The Filter program uses an inverted form of the genus index. Filtering begins with an initial filter file consisting of words that have a given feature (e.g. [+human]) in all of their senses. The program then locates, in the index, words whose genus terms all appear in the filter file. The output is a list of new words that have the given feature in all of their senses."

As a background we shall present in the following sections some fundamental clarifications and remarks on our specific view of lemmatization and disambiguation. Our starting point is the double assertion that we believe would be shared by many workers in applied computational linguistics and large text-processing projects, to wit: that on the one hand lemmatization is one of the most important and crucial steps in many non-trivial text-processing cycles, but on the other hand, no operational, reasonably general, fully automatic and high-quality context-sensitive text-lemmatization system nowadays is easily accessible for any natural language. Given these two premises, the problem is how to introduce a partial element (at least) of machineaided work in the process of text-lemmatization, so as to avoid the extremely laborious and frustrating task of a word-per-word manual lemmatization of large corpora as was done in the early days of automatic text-processing projects. (For a thorough report on mechanical lemmatization programs, see ref. 4.) In this paper we focus on the analysis and experimental testing of one idea that fits naturally into this framework, namely that of disambiguation by short contexts. (The somewhat unexpected shift from \"lemmatization\" to \"disambiguation\" will be justified in the sections to come.) Based on"

It depends on whether or not he is on a steam locomotive. I am trying to decide automatically which sense of a word is intended (in written English) by using machine readable dictionaries, and looking for words in the sense definitions that overlap words in the definition of nearby words. The problem of deciding which sense of a word was intended by the writer is an important problem in information retrieval systems. At present most retrieval systems rely on manual indexing; if this is to be replaced with automatic text processing, it would be very desirable to recognize the correct sense of each word as often as possible. Previous work has generally either suggested (a) detailed frames describing the particular word senses,t*\u2019 or (b) global statistics about the word occurrences.3 The first has not yet been made available in any real application, and the second may give the wrong answer in specific local instances. This procedure uses available dictionaries, so that it will process any text; and uses solely the immediate context. To consider the example in the title, look at the definition of pine in the Oxford Advanced Learner\u2019s Dictionary of Current English: there are, of course, two major senses. \u201ckind of evergreen tree with needle-shaped leaves.. .\u201d and \u201cwaste away through sorrow or illness...\u201d And cone has three separate definitions: \u201csolid body which narrows to a\u2019 point . . . . *\u2019 \u201csomething of this shape w-hether solid or hollow...,\u201d and \u201cfruit of certain evergreen trees...\u201d Note that both evergreen and tree are common to two of the sense definitions: thus a program could guess that if the two words pine cone appear together, the likely senses are those of the tree and its fruit"

An experimental system embodying this mechanism has been implemented for processing definitions from the Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English. A property of this dictionary, exploited by the system, is that it uses a restricted vocabulary in its word sense definitions. The structures generated by the experimental system are intended to be used for the classification of new word senses in terms of the senses of words in the restricted vocabulary. Examples illustrating the output generated are presented, and some qualitative performance results and problems that were encountered are discussed. The analysis process applies successively more specific phrasal analysis rules as determined by a hierarchy of patterns in which less specific patterns dominate more specific ones. This ensures that reasonable incomplete analyses of the definitions are produced when more complete analyses are not possible, resulting in a relatively robust analysis mechanism. Thus the work reported addresses two robustness problems faced by current experimental natural language processing systems: coping with an incomplete lexicon and with incomplete knowledge of phrasal constructions."

                "text": "The creation and development of a large Lexical Database (LDB) which, until now, mainly reuses the data found in standard Machine Readable Dictionaries, has been going on in Pisa for a number of years (see Calzolari 1984, 1988, Calzolari, Picchi 1988). We are well aware that, in order to build a more powel-ful I.DB (or even a Le.'dcal Knowledge Base) to be used in different ComputationM l.inguistics (CL) applications, types of information other than those usually found in machine readable dictionaries are urgently needed. Different sources of information must therefore be exploited if we wemt to overcome the 'qchcal bottleneck ~\" of Natural l..anguage Processing ( N I P ) . In a trend which is becoming increasingly relevant both m c1 proper and in Literao\" and Iinguistic Computing, we feel that very interesting data ibr our LI)Bs c:m be found b.v processing large textuM corpora, where the actual usage of the language can be truly investigated. Many research projects are nowadays collecting large amounts of textuM data, thus providing more and more material to be analyzed for descriptions based on measurable evidence of how language is actually used. We uhhnately aim at integrating lexical data extracted from the an',dysis of large textual corpora into the I,DB we are implementing. These data refer, typically, to: i) complementation relations introduced by prepositions (e.g. dividere subcategorizes for a PP headed by the preposition in ha one sense, and by the preposition fra in another sense); ii) lexically conditioned modification relations (tena macchina potente , un farmaco potente and not /brte , while un cajfe\" forte , una moneta forte and not potente ); iii) lefically significant collocations (premiere ut~a decisione and not fare z~na decisione , prestare attenzione and not dare ); iv) fixed phrases and idioms I (donna itz carriera, dottorato di ricerca, a propo~ito di); v) compounds ( tarola calda, ~ave scuo/a). All these types of data are a major issue of practical relevance, and particularly problematic, in many N I P applications in different areas. They should therefore be dvcn very lm'ge coverage in any useful LDB, and, moreover, should also be annotated, in a computerk,'ed lexicon, for the pe~inent t)equency information obtained fiom the processed corpus, and obviously updated fl\"om time to time. As a matter of fact, dictionaries now tend to encode all the theoreticcd possibilities on a same level, but \"if e ; 'e~ possibility in the diction:m, must be given equal weight, parsing is very diificult\" (Church 1988, p.3): they should provide infornaation on what is more likely to occur, e.g. relative likelihood of alternate pm-ts of speech for a word or of ahernate word-senses, both out of context and it\" possible taking into account contextu~d factors. Statistical anMyses of linguistic data were very popular in the \"50s and '60s, mainly, even though not only, for literary types of analyses and for studies on the lexicon (Guiraud 1959, Muller 1964, Moskovich 1977). Stochastic approaches to linguistic analyses have been strongly reevaluated in the past few years, either for syntactic analysis (Gm'side et al. 1987, Church 1988), or for NLP applications (Brown et al. 1988), or for semantic analysis (Zemik 1989, Smadja 1989). Quantitative (not statistical) evidence on e.g. word-sense occurrences in a large corpus have been taken into account for lexicographic descriptions (Cobuild 1%7)."
