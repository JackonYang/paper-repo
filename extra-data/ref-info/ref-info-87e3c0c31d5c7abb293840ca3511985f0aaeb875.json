Topographically ordered mappings, found widely in nervous systems, are those in which neighbouring elements in one sheet of cells project to neighbouring elements in a second sheet. Exploiting this neighbourhood property leads to a new theory for the establishment of topographical mappings, in which the distance between two cells is expressed in terms of their similarity with respect to certain physical properties assigned to them. This topographical code can be realized in a model employing either synchronization of nervous activity or exchange of specific molecules between neighbouring cells. By means of modifiable synapses the code is used to set up a topographical mapping between two sheets with the same internal structure. We have investigated the neural activity version. Without needing to make any elaborate assumptions about its structure or about the operations its elements are to carry out we have shown that the mappings are set up in a system-to-system rather than a cell-to-cell fashion. The pattern of connections develops in a step-by-step and orderly fashion, the orientation of the mappings being laid down in the earliest stages of development."

The termination of optic fibres at precisely defined tectal locations during normal embryonic development does not appear, in view of this and other evidence, to be due to any restrictions imposed by specializations distinguishing terminal sites themselves. However, there is clear evidence that, on the basis of possibly very simple specializations acquired as part of their embryological origin at particular locations in the retina, growing optic fibres actively and continuously select specific routes to be followed through intervening nervous tissue which eventually lead them to predictable and at least approximately appropriate terminal regions in the tectum. It is proposed that terminals move into and maintain fully retinotopic order as a result of direct interactions between fibres themselves based on features correlated with the retinal proximity of their cells of origin. This may involve further use of specializations due to related embryological origin: correlations in nerve impulse activity among neighbouring retinal ganglion cells may serve to stabilize most favourable terminal combinations. It is argued that fibres are subject to multiple influences which contribute to their orderly growth and that the demands made on the embryological differentiation of nervous tissue can thereby be considerably reduced."

                "text": "Although widely accepted, the theory, that neurones carry immutable cytochemical markers which specify their synaptic connections, is not consistent with plastic reorganizations. Half retinal fish were therefore tested for changed markers following expansion. Optic nerve crush at the time of the half retinal ablation resulted in regeneration of a normal, restricted projection; but nerve crush following expansion (many months later) resulted in reestablishment of the expanded projection, assessed both by electrophysiological mapping and by radioautography. Since this implied changed markers, the half retina and tectum were tested independently using the ipsilateral tectum and eye as controls. In normal fish, removal of one tectum and deflection of the corresponding optic tract toward the remaining tectum resulted in regeneration of a positionally normal but ipsilateral map. In experimental fish, after the half retina had expanded its projection to the contralateral tectum, its optic tract was deflected to the control tectum. After 40 days it had regenerated a normal, restricted map indicating that the retinal markers had not changed. Such restricted projections did not expand in the presence of the normal projection even after a year or more. Similarly, the optic tract from the normal eye was deflected to cause innervation of the tectum containing the expanded half retinal projection. After 40 days, the projection regenerated from the normal eye was similar to the expanded half retinal projection. Areas of the normal retina corresponding to the missing areas of the half retina were not represented. Tectal markers had been altered by the half retinal fibers. In a final group, tecta were denervated and tested at various intervals by innervation from ipsilateral half retinal eyes. After five months of denervation, the regenerating fibers were no longer restricted to the rostral tectum but formed an expanded projection initially. Apparently tectal markers are induced by the retinal fibers, changed during expansion, and disappear during long\u2010term denervation."

In this paper the role that competition may play in the development of such spatially patterned nervous connexions is discussed, and simple models incorporating competition and graded affinity between axons and postsynaptic sites have been tested by computer simulation. It is shown that the conditions for map making by this mechanism are that there is not only competition between axons for postsynaptic sites but also between postsynaptic sites for axons; and that this can be effected by imposing saturation conditions limiting the number of postsynaptic sites an axon may contact simultaneously and similarly the number of axon branches that can contact a postsynaptic cell. The possibility was investigated that competition models might lead to spreading or compression of the pattern of connexions in spatial mismatch experiments, such as have been done on the visual system of lower vertebrates. Two classes of these experiments exist: (a) those in which no size disparity is present between the set of presynaptic branches and the set of postsynaptic sites (for example, Xenopus the compound eye experiments); competition models predict an obligatory spreading of connexions without postulating regulation; (b) those in which a size disparity does exist (for example, a complete retina being made to regenerate into a half tectum, or vice versa); competition models predict spreading-compression only if the number of possible presynaptic branches available for contact formation is once more made equal to the number of available sites. The interpretation of other experimental designs is discussed. The importance of the establishment of transient or temporary contacts during development is emphasized."

A set of chemical markers that express the neighborhood relationships within the presynaptic sheet is induced by the fibers into the postsynaptic sheet. The markers are used to guide the fibers to their terminal sites. A case for which this idea may be relevant is the retinotectal projection; our model exhibits types of plasticity found experimentally. The fact that the postsynaptic markers remain after removal of the projecting fibers suggests an important difference between development and regeneration. This paper concentrates on explaining the basic idea, and in addition presents a set of preliminary computer simulations."

Recording was performed with the animals immersed in saline inside a transparent hemisphere. Visual responses could be recorded from the optic tectum from about stage 43 onwards. The visual map on the tectum of the tadpole was found to differ in several respects from that in the adult. The earliest responses recorded showed very large multi-unit receptive fields and no discernible retinotopic organization. From about stage 47 the map showed the adult type of order; nasal field projected rostrally, temporal field caudally, superior field medially and inferior field laterally. However, in tadpoles up to stage 63/64 the projection was markedly distorted in that nasal field was confined to the most rostral region of the tectum and theie was an expanded representation of the temporal pole of the field. In tadpoles the entire visual projection covers only the rostral one-half to two-thirds of the tectum. These results, in conjunction with the results of previous studies on the mode of growth of the retina and tectum, indicate a progressive shift of the retinotectal projection with development which may involve changing synaptic relations between retinal fibres and tectal cells."

The theory involves short-range autocatalytic activation and longer-range inhibition (lateral inhibition). When a certain criterion is satisfied, self-regulating patterns are generated.\n\nThe autocatalytic features of the theory are demonstrated by simulations of the determination of polarity in the Xenopus retina. General conditions for marginal and internal activation, and corresponding effects of symmetry are discussed. Special molecular mechanisms of pattern formation are proposed in which activator is chemically converted into inhibitor, or an activator precursor is depleted by conversion into activator.\n\nThe (slow) effects of primary patterns on differentiation can be included into the formalism in a straightforward manner. In conjunction with growth, this can lead to asymmetric steady states of cell types, cell differentiation and proliferation as found, for instance, in growing and budding hydra. In 2 dimensions, 2 different types of patterns can be obtained. Under some assumptions, a single pattern-forming system produces a \u2018bristle\u2019 type pattern of peaks of activity with rather regular spacings on a surface. Budding of hydra is treated on this basis. If, however, gradients develop under the influence of a weak external or marginal asymmetry, a monotonic gradient can be formed across the entire field, and 2 such gradient-forming systems can specify \u2018positional information\u2019 in 2 dimensions.\n\nIf inhibitor equilibrates slowly, a spatial pattern may oscillate, as observed with regard to the intracellular activation of cellular slime moulds.\n\nThe applications are intended to demonstrate the ability of the proposed theory to explain properties frequently encountered in developing systems."

The contralateral retinotectal projection from a double-ventral eye is neither normal nor does it show the type of abnormality predicted from previous work on double-nasal and double-temporal eyes. In the case of double-ventral eyes, the nasal part of the field projection tended to be reduplicated about the horizontal midline and those field positions corresponding to lateromedial rows of electrode positions on the tectum ran ventrodorsally in the field. As the electrode rows on the tectum progressed more caudally, so the corresponding rows of stimulus positions in the field tended to curl in a temporal direction. These observations have been interpreted as indicating that the nasotemporal and dorsoventral polarities of the eye are not irreversibly determined at stage 32 and that the mechanisms generating the nasotemporal and dorsoventral axes of the eye may interact with each other."

These two visuotectal projections at each optic tectum are superimposed and in register, an arrangement made possible by the functional organization of a topographically ordered system of intertectal neuronal connections. Following surgical rotation of a larval eye in Xenopus a rearrangement of intertectal connections may take place during metamorphosis. The nature of the intertectal reorganization is such that the two visuotectal projections at each optic tectum remain in register. This synaptic reorganization requires visual experience. The capacity of the intertectal system to respond to such changes in interocular geometry reduces with age but even in adult life a residual plasticity of intertectal connections exists. In the adult animal an acute rotation of one eye by 90 $^\\circ$ evokes no reorganization of intertectal connections. An equivalent cumulative change in interocular relationship in adult life which is achieved very gradually rather than acutely can, however, lead to an appropriate reorganization of intertectal connections. It is suggested that the normal role of this residual intertectal plasticity is to compensate for the normal changes in interocular geometry that occur with growth in the post-metamorphic animal."

University Laboratory of Physiology, Parks Road, Oxford OX1 3PT To explain the termination of regenerating optic fibres at particular retinotopically ordered positions in the optic tectum Sperry (1943) proposed that fibres, 'chemospecifically' differentiated according to retinal origin, selected terminal sites on the basis of matching distinctive tectal cues. However, this cannot explain, without further qualifications, the finding in goldfish (Gaze & Sharma, 1970) that the entire optic fibre array will re-establish terminals retinotopically within the rostral halftectum after ablation of the caudal half. During the course of regeneration in a series of goldfish (5.4-6.0 cm nose to tail-fin base, maintained at 280C) in which the right optic nerve had been cut together with removal of the caudal half of the left tectum, we mapped electrophysiologically (Jacobson & Gaze, 1964: tungsten electrodes) the arrangement of localized visual responses, believed to originate from optic fibre terminal arborizations, on the rostral halftectum which retains its original gross anatomical features. The earliest regenerated responses were due to fibres representing the naso-dorsal field located within the rostral half-tectum just as they are in a complete retinotectal projection, but these gradually moved forward on"

The remaining projection was initially restricted to the appropriate rostral half of the tectum, even if the nerve was crushed and allowed to regenerate. But later, after 137 days or more, it showed a progressive expansion onto the foreign caudal half of the tectum. The magnification factor, the number of micrometers of tectum per degree in the visual field, doubled in the rostro\u2010caudal but not in the medio\u2010lateral direction. Analysis of the sequence of the expansion showed that a few fibers originally projecting nearest the denervated area were the first to spread over it. Then, progressively more fibers moved caudally until a nearly uniform representation of the half retina was established on the tectum. Radioautography also demonstrated that retinal fiber terminals had invaded the caudal tectum. The retinae of these fish were also examined histologically. The density of ganglion cells had not increased, but they consistently showed the axonal reaction. This was not found to be associated with any initial surgical trauma, but rather with the movement of their fiber terminals within the tectum. Frozen sections, through half retinal and normal eyes, were cut and photographed for comparison of ocular geometry. Operated eyes were normal except for a slight but consistent loss of ocular volume. Analysis of the optical geometry showed that recording with fish in air produced two effects: Myopia (10\u00b0 blur circle, or less) and enlargement of the visual field by 15% to 20%."

In contrast, if the caudal half\u2010tectum is ablated but the optic nerve is left intact, no compression of the retinotectal projection results. Instead, the terminals displaced from the ablatcd tissue form apermanently disorganized projection to the rostral half\u2010tectum superimposed on the unaltered representation of those parts of the retinawhich normally project there. The receptive field locations of tectal ncurons in both groups of animals show that the altered retinotectal projections make functional synapses.

The first part of the adult tectum to form is the rostroventral pole; cells in this position undergo their final DNA synthesis between stages 35 and 45 or shortly thereafter. Next, the cells comprising the ventrolateral border of the tectum form. These cells undergo their final DNA synthesis at or shortly after stage 45. Finally the cells comprising the dorsal surface of the adult tectum form, mainly between stages 50\u201355. This part of the tectum originates from the serial addition of strips of cells medially, which displace the pre-existing tissue laterally and rostrally. The formation of the tectum is virtually complete by stage 58. The tectum in Xenopus thus forms in topographical order from rostroventral to caudo-medial. The distribution of labelled cells, several stages after the time of injection of isotope, indicates that, at any one time, a segment of tectum is forming which runs normal to the tectal surface and includes all layers from the ventricular layer out to the surface. In Xenopus, therefore, the times of origin of tectal cells appear to be related not to cell type or tectal layer but to the topographical position of the cells across the surface of the tectum."

We propose that cells within epimorphic fields behave according to two simple rules, the shortest intercalation rule and the complete circle rule, for both of which there is direct experimental evidence. It is possible to understand a large number of different behaviors of epimorphic fields as a straight-forward consequence of these two rules, and the model therefore provides a context in which to view many of the results of experimental embryology. Although we have confined our discussion to cockroach legs, the imaginal disks of Drosophila, and regenerating and developing amphibian limbs, the fact that the model can explain regulative behavior in such evolutionarily diverse animals suggests that it may have general applicability to epimorphic fields. The predictions which the model makes should make it possible to assess its applicability to other developing systems, and to investigate the cellular mechanisms involved."

                "text": "In early observations on the outgrowth and termination of nerve fibers, it appeared that different fiber types must be guided to their respective end organs and other connection sites by selective chemical or electrical forces. Explanatory terms like chemotaxis, chemotropism, galvanotaxis, and neurotropism were commonly employed by Cajal7 and others early in the century. These selectivity concepts later came under attack, especially during the 1930's and 40's when the application of more analytic experimental approaches to the mechanics of nerve growth seemed to rule out the presence of either chemical or electrical selectivity in favor of a predominantly mechanical interpretation.347 The numerous examples of apparent selectivity described earlier, as well as the developmental patterning of the central nerve tracts and fiber systems in general, we came to believe, were more properly and correctly explained on a mechanical basis, particularly in terms of the orienting effects of mechanical stresses on tissue ultrastructures and the resultant formation of submicroscopic systems of mechanical guide lines in the colloidal matrix of the growing medium. At the height of this antiselectivity movement I was led, from evidence indirect and partly behavioral, to postulate again in 1939 a form of chemical selectivity in nerve growth even more extreme in some respects than in the earlier proposals. The hypothesis, 18-24 in brief, suggested that the patterning of synaptic connections in the nerve centers, including those refined details of network organization heretofore ascribed mainly to functional molding in various forms, must be handled instead by the growth mechanism directly, independently of function, and with very strict selectivity governing synaptic formation from the beginning. The establishment and maintenance of synaptic associations were conceived to be regulated by highly specific cytochemical affinities that arise systematically among the different types of neurons involved via self-differentiation, induction through terminal contacts, and embryonic gradient effects. Coming at a time when \"instinctive\" was still a disreputable term in most scientific quarters, and when concepts of nerve growth were strongly dominated by the mechanical theory, this seemed a long shot at first and hardly less wild than some of the opposing interpretations of the day like the \"resonance principle\"2' 33 that it was proposed to replace. When tested experimentally, however, study after study through the 1940's18-24, 29 yielded results that fit nicely. In brief, whenever central fiber systems were disconnected and transplanted or just scrambled by rough surgical section, regrowth always led to orderly functional recovery and under conditions that precluded re-educative adjustments. The functional outcome was always as if the scrambled fibers somehow unsorted themselves in regeneration and managed to \"home in\" on their original and proper central nerve terminals. It seemed a necessary conclusion from these results that the cells and fibers of the brain and cord must carry some kind of individual identification tags, presumably"

The patterns of re\u2010established visual projections on to the rostral half\u2010tectum are studied following excision of the caudal tectum at various intervals after section of either the contralateral optic nerve or the ipsilateral optic tract in adult goldfish. 2. The pattern of a newly restored retinotectal projection depends on the duration of the post\u2010operative period given to the halved tectum before it is re\u2010innervated by regenrating optic fibres from the retina. 3. When the duration is such that regenerating optic fibres invade the denervated rostral half\u2010tectum at about 40 days or longer after excision of the caudal tectum, the remaining half\u2010tectum is able to accommodate incoming optic fibres not only from the appropriate temporal hemi\u2010retina but also from the foreign nasal hemiretina in an orderly compressed topographic pattern. 4. If the surgical operations are timed so that the halved tectum receive regenerating optic fibres earlier than 33 days after excision of the caudal tectum, the halved tectum initially accommodates only those optic fibres originating from the temporal half of the retina at this early stage. 5. This normal (uncompressed) pattern of the newly regenerated visual projection, however, eventually changes into an orderly compressed pattern at a later period. Post\u2010operative dark\u2010deprivation of the operated fish has no significant effect on the temporal transition. 6. The temporal transition from an initially normal pattern into an orderly compressed pattern may reflect the time course of progressive and systematic changes involved in topographic regulation of the halved tectum into a whole."

A majority (twenty\u2010one out of twenty\u2010three) of these operated fish, in which the reimplanted tectal tissue degenerated, showed no sign of a field compression: only the nasal half of the visual field (with a localized partial scotoma corresponding to the area of the degenerated reimplant) projected on to the remaining intact area of the rostral half\u2010tectum. 4. In seven fish, the re\u2010established visual projections on to the 180 or 90 degrees rotated reimplants showed a corresponding localized 180 or 90 degrees rotation with reference to the other projections on to the surrounding intact area of the same half\u2010tectum. Only one of these seven fish showed also a compression in the re\u2010established projections from the entire visual field on to the operated half\u2010tectum with the 90 degrees rotated reimplant. 5. When a field compression was induced first in the intact rostral half\u2010tectum following excision of the caudal half, and then a piece of the 90 degrees rotated tectal tissue was reimplanted later within the rostral half\u2010tectum, the previously induced field compression persisted, regardless of whether the reimplanted tissue degenerated or survived. In the latter case, the compression in the re\u2010established visual projections on to the surviving reimplant occurred according to the original topographic polarity of the 90 degrees rotated tectal tissue. 6. A field compression could also be induced within a rotated tectal reimplant, which retained its original polarity, as follows. A piece of the tectal tissue was dissected from the central area of the whole tectum, and then reimplanted after either 180 or 90 degrees rotation. When the reimplanted tectal tissue became reinnervated later, the caudal half of the operated tectum (including the posterior half of the reimplant) was excised. The re\u2010established visual projections on to the remaining part of the halved reimplant within the rostral half\u2010tectum showed later a field compression in accordance with the original topographic polarity of the 180 or 90 degrees rotated tectal tissue. 7. These results provide direct evidence for the compatibility between the retention of original topographic polarity by a reimplanted tectal tissue and the capability of the same tectal tissue to readjust to a disparity in size. 8. Histological examination of the operated half\u2010tectum with a reimplant, stained by a modified rapid Golai method, revealed that the reimplanted tectal tissues retained highly organized cytoarchitectonic structures..."

                "text": "The longest fibers of the main optic tract reach the upper layers of the superior colliculus (SC) of the midbrain. Destruction of this terminal area in newborn hamsters caused striking anomalies in the distribution of the optic tract, studied after the animals were fully grown. Evidence of termination was found in areas normally devoid of such termination: in the remaining tissue of the colliculus and in the thalamic nucleus lateralis posterior (LP). An abnormally high density of termination was found in part of the ventral nucleus of the lateral geniculate body. These thalamic regions normally receive connections from SC. Retinofugal axons could also be induced to terminate in the medial geniculate body of the thalamus if the brachium of the inferior colliculus, which normally carries auditory information to this cell group, was ablated at birth together with the lesion of SC.If the superficial layers of SC were destroyed unilaterally at birth, axons from the eye contralateral to the lesion not only reached the area of early damage, but also formed an abnormal decussation, crossing the tectal midline to terminate in the medial zone of the undamaged colliculus. Axons from the two eyes competed for terminal space in this intact colliculus, for they terminated in a nonoverlapping manner, and if the axons from the eye contralateral to the remaining SC were eliminated at birth, the anomalously recrossing axons increased in quantity and spread across the entire SC on the 'wrong' side of the midbrain. Hamsters with such an anomaly showed wrong-direction turning in response to visual stimuli in a large part of the visual field.The less the amount of termination found in SC, the greater was the amount in LP. Thus, optic tract axons showed a 'pruning effect' which may be attributed to a tendency for axons to conserve the quantity of their terminal arborizations. The pruning effect alone may account for the hypertrophy we found, after early SC lesions, of the dorsal terminal nucleus of the accessory optic tract. The tendency to invade vacated terminal space may be sufficient to account for an effect of early unilateral eye removal, namely, a pronounced increase in an ipsilateral retinal projection to the medial terminal nucleus of the accessory optic tract.The greatest alterations in axonal projections were seen when the two effects, competition and pruning, seemed to act jointly. Additional factors may have to be considered in fully explaining such neuroplasticity; some of these have been suggested."

                "text": "This article reports two series of investigations into the formation of synapses after injury in the adult rat. A comparison is made between synapse formation in a peripheral nervous site - the superior cervical sympathetic ganglion after destroying almost all the afferent fibres by cutting the preganglionic chain, and a central nervous site - the septal nuclei, after selectively destroying afferent fibres from the hippocampus running in the fimbria. The method consists of a quantitative electron microscopic assessment of numbers of synapses in the neuropil of the deafferented regions at progressively increasing survival times after the injury. The superior cervical ganglion has about 8.8 x 10 $^6$ synapses and about 8000 preganglionic axons. After a freeze lesion of the preganglionic chain over 90% of the synapses disappear, indicating that the preganglionic axons each form an average of about 1100 synaptic contacts. A proportion of the deafferented postsynaptic sites are recognizable by the presence of the vacated postsynaptic thickenings. As the preganglionic axons regenerate back across the lesion, the synapses gradually reappear, and the vacated thickenings disappear. If an insufficient number of axons regenerates, less than the normal complement of synapses is formed; the number of synapses bears a constant relation to the number of axons, and under these circumstances each axon forms about the same number of synapses as in the normal ganglion. This suggests that the number of synapses which an axon can form is limited, and that the preganglionic axons may be close to this limit in the normal ganglion. The ganglion can also be reinnervated by foreign nerves such as the vagus and hypoglossal. These nerves form less than normal numbers of synapses. In all cases of less than complete reinnervation, the numbers of vacated thickenings remaining are inversely proportional to the numbers of synapses which appear; this indicates that the synapses are formed at the originally denervated postsynaptic sites. The septum receives inputs of hippocampal origin both through the ipsilateral and the contralateral fimbria. After section of one fimbria, the terminals of the cut axons are recognizable by the reaction of electron dense degeneration. About half the synapses on dendritic spines belong to the ipsilateral fimbria and about half this number to the contralateral fimbria. The degenerating terminals are progressively removed from the postsynaptic sites by the phagocytic action of astrocytes. However, unlike the ganglion, the sites only rarely appear as vacated thickenings. Instead, there is a progressive increase in the number of non-degenerating terminals as the degenerating terminals are removed. This spontaneous reinnervation process results in restoration of the original complement of synapses. However, the originally cut fimbrial axons do not regenerate: this process of synapse formation is due to formation of additional contacts by the other axons remaining in the deafferented region. If the second fimbria is now cut, it results in an amount of degeneration equal to the sum of that found after cutting both the ipsilateral and the contralateral fimbria. This indicates that the sites left vacant by section of one fimbria are reinnervated exclusively by the other fimbria. However, this preference is not absolute. After section of the second fimbria, the degeneration is still removed, and a normal complement of synapses once again restored. Thus the septal neuropil has great powers of re-establishing normal synapse numbers even after major deafferentation. The ganglion and the septum are similar to the extent that denervated postsynaptic sites are capable of being reinnervated - spontaneously in the case of the central nervous site. The major difference is that in the peripheral nervous site the originally cut axons can regenerate back to their former targets. It is not clear why the cut fimbria - behaving in a manner typical for central nervous tracts - does not regenerate. The proximal parts of the cut fimbrial axons and their cells of origin survive the injury. The denervated sites in the septum also survive, and are capable of being reinnervated. Further, this reinnervation process is selective for fimbrial axons from the opposite hippocampus. This also shows that fimbrial fibres are capable of forming new synapses. Thus the defect which prevents true regeneration of the originally cut axons back to their former targets does not appear to be due to failure in the mechanism of synapse formation or matching. This suggests that the defect may be an inability of the cut axons to regenerate across the site of the lesion."

The contralateral retinotectal projection was normal in approximately two\u2010thirds of the animals, when mapped in later tadpole life. The remaining animals showed either some form of mirror reduplication in the visual map or else some degree of lack of order, as compared with a map taken from a normal tadpole of equivalent age. We conclude that the regulative powers of the larval Xenopus eye extend to much later stages (stage 38) than was previously thought; and a possible mechanism for the production of reduplicated maps from half\u2010eyes is considered."

Few environments are ideal; they may be unfavourable for numerous reasons and for different lengths of time. Indeed, variations on these themes are almost infinitely possible, but concrete examples will be selected and their effects on the lives of animals and of man demonstrated. Time comes into all this, but its importance and the difference between chronological and biological time have not been properly appreciated. The interactions of time and the environment on the growth of animals and of their organs are complex, but recent work on malnutrition and growth has given us some insight into the matter. Theories that have been formulated are discussed, but none of those yet put forward explain all the facts that can be demonstrated experimentally, and studies that might provide clues have been neglected."

C. The Tigreans and Amharas who have dominated Ethiopian political history from its foundations at Axum, also provide a sturdy peasantry, living typically in dispersed settlements and cultivating cereals (including the idigenous teff) with an ox-drawn plough. In the hotter, lower altitudes south of Addis Ababa where the hand hoe is used, ensete (the false banana) becomes the main crop. The hierarchical Semitic political structure, the conquest state, contrasts sharply with the fierce egalitarianism of the pastoral Cushites \u2013 where, as among the Galla, this is associated with an age and generation (gada), or as among the Somali with segmentary Galla and Afar lie between these two extremes. While the national core-culture has for centuries been christian, the distinction between Christian and Muslim, superimposed upon the earlier Judaic tradition, both reinforces and transcends these ethnic divisons, which were never more acutely felt or politically significant than they are today."
