An algorithm which will automatically locate the textual regions in the input image will facilitate this task; the optical character recognizer can then be applied to only those regions of the image which contain text. We present a method for automatically locating text in complex color images. The algorithm first finds the approximate locations of text lines using horizontal spatial variance, and then extracts text components in these boxes using color segmentation. The proposed method has been used to locate text in compact disc (CD) and book cover images, as well as in the images of traffic scenes captured by a video camera. Initial results are encouraging and suggest that these algorithms can be used in image retrieval applications."

Text location is the first step for recognizing the textual information. This paper proposes a neural network-based text location method for news video indexing. Text can be characterized by texture, location, alignment, and font size. The proposed method classifies text pixels and non-text pixels using a network that operates as a set of texture discrimination filters. We find and locate text regions using histogram analysis after removing errors in the classification results. Experimental results show that the proposed method is effective at locating texts."

In this work, we present algorithms for detecting and tracking text in digital video. Our system implements a scale-space feature extractor that feeds an artificial neural processor to detect text blocks. Our text tracking scheme consists of two modules: a sum of squared difference (SSD)-based module to find the initial position and a contour-based module to refine the position. Experiments conducted with a variety of video sources show that our scheme can detect and track text robustly."

The algorithms we propose make use of typical characteristics of text in videos in order to enhance segmentation and, consequently, recognition performance. As a result, we get segmented characters from video pictures. These can be parsed by any OCR software. The recognition results of multiple instances of the same character throughout subsequent frames are combined to enhance recognition result and to compute the final output. We have tested our segmentation algorithms in a series of experiments with video clips recorded from television and achieved good segmentation results."

It enables content- based browsing. We present our methods for automatic segmentation and recognition of text in digital videos. The algorithms we propose make use of typical characteristics of text in videos in order to enable and enhance segmentation and recognition performance. Especially the inter-frame dependencies of the characters provide new possibilities for their refinement. Then, a straightforward indexing and retrieval scheme is introduced. It is used in the experiments to demonstrate that the proposed text segmentation and text recognition algorithms are suitable for indexing and retrieval of relevant video scenes in and from a video data base. Our experimental results are very encouraging and suggest that these algorithms can be used in video retrieval applications as well as to recognize higher semantics in video."

In developing this system, we have addressed the twin issues of image representation and algorithms for learning. We have used the invariance properties of image representations based on Haar wavelets to robustly capture various facial features. Similarly, unlike previous approaches this system is entirely trained using examples and does not rely on a priori (hand-crafted) models of facial features based on an optical flow or facial musculature. The system works in several stages that begin with face detection, followed by localization of facial features and estimation of mouth parameters. Each of these stages is formulated as a problem in supervised learning from examples. We apply the new and robust technique of support vector machines (SVM) for classification in the stage of skin segmentation, face detection and eye detection. Estimation of mouth parameters is modeled as a regression from a sparse subset of coefficients (basis functions) of an overcomplete dictionary of Haar wavelets."

Properties of the mean shift are reviewed and its convergence on lattices is proven. The proposed filtering method associates with each pixel in the image the closest local mode in the density distribution of the joint domain. Segmentation into a piecewise constant structure requires only one more step, fusion of the regions associated with nearby modes. The proposed technique has two parameters controlling the resolution in the spatial and range domains. Since convergence is guaranteed, the technique does not require the intervention of the user to stop the filtering at the desired image quality. Several examples, for gray and color images, show the versatility of the method and compare favorably with results described in the literature for the same images."

A trained classifier determines, based on the difference feature vector measurements, whether or not a human face exists at the current image location.

Computer vision algorithms that are intended to form part of a perceptual user interface must be fast and efficient. They must be able to track in real time and yet not absorb a major share of computational resources. An efficient, new algorithm is described here based on the mean shift algorithm. The mean shift algorithm robustly finds the mode (peak) of probability distributions. We first describe histogram based methods of producing object probability distributions. In our case, we want to track the mode of an object's probability distribution within a video scene. Since the probability distribution of the object can change and move dynamically in time, the mean shift algorithm is modified to deal with dynamically changing probability distributions. The modified algorithm is called the Continuously Adaptive Mean Shift (CAMSHIFT) algorithm. CAMSHIFT is then used as an interface for games and graphics."

Vapnik and his team (AT&T Bell Labs., 1985) that can be seen as a new method for training polynomial, neural network, or Radial Basis Functions classifiers. The decision surfaces are found by solving a linearly constrained quadratic programming problem. This optimization problem is challenging because the quadratic form is completely dense and the memory requirements grow with the square of the number of data points. We present a decomposition algorithm that guarantees global optimality, and can be used to train SVM's over very large data sets. The main idea behind the decomposition is the iterative solution of sub-problems and the evaluation of optimality conditions which are used both to generate improved iterative values, and also establish the stopping criteria for the algorithm. We present experimental results of our implementation of SVM, and demonstrate the feasibility of our approach on a face detection problem that involves a data set of 50,000 data points."

With the size of the video collections growing to thousands of hours, technology is needed to effectively browse segments in a short time without losing the content of the video. We propose a method to extract the significant audio and video information and create a \"skim\" video which represents a very short synopsis of the original. The goal of this work is to show the utility of integrating language and image understanding techniques for video skimming by extraction of significant information, such as specific objects, audio keywords and relevant video structure. The resulting skim video is much shorter, where compaction is as high as 20:1, and yet retains the essential content of the original segment."

In the RBF case, the SV algorithm automatically determines centers, weights, and threshold that minimize an upper bound on the expected test error. The present study is devoted to an experimental comparison of these machines with a classical approach, where the centers are determined by X-means clustering, and the weights are computed using error backpropagation. We consider three machines, namely, a classical RBF machine, an SV machine with Gaussian kernel, and a hybrid system with the centers determined by the SV method and the weights trained by error backpropagation. Our results show that on the United States postal service database of handwritten digits, the SV machine achieves the highest recognition accuracy, followed by the hybrid system. The SV approach is thus not only theoretically well-founded but also superior in a practical application."

                "text": "Foreword The Support Vector Machine has recently been introduced as a new technique for solving various function estimation problems, including the pattern recognition problem. To develop such a technique, it was necessary to rst extract factors responsible for future generalization, to obtain bounds on generalization that depend on these factors, and lastly to develop a technique that constructively minimizes these bounds. The subject of this book are methods based on combining advanced branches of statistics and functional analysis, developing these theories into practical algorithms that perform better than existing heuristic approaches. The book provides a comprehensive analysis of what can be done using Support Vector Machines, achieving record results in real-life pattern recognition problems. In addition, it proposes a new form of nonlinear Principal Component Analysis using Support Vector kernel techniques, which I consider as the most natural and elegant way for generalization of classical Principal Component Analysis. In many ways the Support Vector machine became so popular thanks to works of Bernhard Schh olkopf. The work, submitted for the title of Doktor der Naturwis-senschaften, appears as excellent. It is a substantial contribution to Machine Learning technology."

Training a SVM is equivalent to solving a linearly constrained quadratic programming (QP) problem in a number of variables equal to the number of data points. This optimization problem is known to be challenging when the number of data points exceeds few thousands. In previous work done by us as well as by other researchers, the strategy used to solve the large scale QP problem takes advantage of the fact that the expected number of support vectors is small (<3,000). Therefore, the existing algorithms cannot deal with more than a few thousand support vectors. In this paper we present a decomposition algorithm that is guaranteed to solve the QP problem and that does not make assumptions on the expected number of support vectors. In order to present the feasibility of our approach we consider a foreign exchange rate time series database with 110,000 data points that generates 100,000 support vectors."

It is shown that a family of surfaces having d degrees of freedom has a natural separating capacity of 2d pattern vectors, thus extending and unifying results of Winder and others on the pattern-separating capacity of hyperplanes. Applying these ideas to the vertices of a binary n-cube yields bounds on the number of spherically, quadratically, and, in general, nonlinearly separable Boolean functions of n variables. It is shown that the set of all surfaces which separate a dichotomy of an infinite, random, separable set of pattern vectors can be characterized, on the average, by a subset of only 2d extreme pattern vectors. In addition, the problem of generalizing the classifications on a labeled set of pattern points to the classification of a new point is defined, and it is found that the probability of ambiguous generalization is large unless the number of training patterns exceeds the capacity of the set of separating surfaces."

SVM light is an implementation of an SVM learner which addresses the problem of large tasks.
