                "text": "Artificial neural net models have been studied for many years in the hope of achieving human-like performance in the fields of speech and image recognition. These models are composed of many nonlinear computational elements operating in parallel and arranged in patterns reminiscent of biological neural nets. Computational elements or nodes are connected via weights that are typically adapted during use to improve performance. There has been a recent resurgence in the field of artificial neural nets caused by new net topologies and algorithms, analog VLSI implementation techniques, and the belief that massive parallelism is essential for high performance speech and image recognition. This paper provides an introduction to the field of artificial neural nets by reviewing six important neural net models that can be used for pattern classification. These nets are highly parallel building blocks that illustrate neural net components and design principles and can be used to construct more complex systems. In addition to describing these nets, a major emphasis is placed on exploring how some existing classification and clustering algorithms can be performed using simple neuron-like components. Single-layer nets can implement algorithms required by Gaussian maximum-likelihood classifiers and optimum minimum-error classifiers for binary patterns corrupted by noise. More generally, the decision regions required by any classification algorithm can be generated in a straightforward manner by three-layer feed-forward nets."

This procedure takes a set of input/output pattern pairs and attempts to learn their functional relationship; it develops the necessary representational features during the course of learning. A series of computer simulation studies was carried out to assess the ability of these networks to accurately label sounds, to learn to recognize sounds without labels, and to learn feature representations of continuous speech. These studies demonstrated that the networks can learn to label presegmented test tokens with accuracies of up to 95%. Networks trained on segmented sounds using a strategy that requires no external labels were able to recognize and delineate sounds in continuous speech. These networks developed rich internal representations that included units which corresponded to such traditional distinctions as vowels and consonants, as well as units that were sensitive to novel and nonstandard features. Networks trained on a large corpus of unsegmented, continuous speech without labels also developed interesting feature representations, which may be useful in both segmentation and label learning. The results of these studies, while preliminary, demonstrate that backpropagation learning can be used with complex, natural data to identify a feature structure that can serve as the basis for both analysis and nontrivial pattern recognition."

In the previous paper of this series, I showed that such cells emerge spontaneously during the development of a simple multilayered network having local but initially random feedforward connections that mature, one layer at a time, according to a simple development rule (of Hebb type). In this paper, I show that, in the presence of lateral connections between developing orientation cells, these cells self-organize into banded patterns of cells of similar orientation. These patterns are similar to the \"orientation columns\" found in mammalian visual cortex. No orientation preference is specified to the system at any stage, none of the basic developmental rules is specific to visual processing, and the results emerge even in the absence of visual input to the system (as has been observed in macaque monkey)."

The origin of many of the salient features of this architecture, however, has remained unexplained. This paper is the first of three (the others will appear in subsequent issues of these Proceedings) that address the origin and organization of feature-analyzing (spatial-opponent and orientation-selective) cells in simple systems governed by biologically plausible development rules. I analyze the progressive maturation of a system composed of a few layers of cells, with connections that develop according to a simple set of rules (including Hebb-type modification). To understand the prenatal origin of orientation-selective cells in certain primates, I consider the case in which there is no external input, with the first layer exhibiting random spontaneous electrical activity. No orientation preference is specified to the system at any stage, and none of the basic developmental rules is specific to visual processing. Here I introduce the theory of \"modular self-adaptive networks,\" of which this system is an example, and explicitly demonstrate the emergence of a layer of spatial-opponent cells. This sets the stage for the emergence, in succeeding layers, of an orientation-selective cell population."

The treatment of Kronecker products and the vec operator is fairly exhaustive; the treatment of 0\u20131 matrices is selective. In particular we study the \u201ccommutation\u201d matrix K (defined implicitly by K vec A = vec A\u2032 for any matrix A of the appropriate order), the idempotent matrix N = \u00bd (I + K), which plays a central role in normal distribution theory, and the \u201cduplication\u201d matrix D, which arises in the context of symmetry. We present an easy and elegant way (via differentials) to evaluate Jacobian matrices (first derivatives), Hessian matrices (second derivatives), and Jacobian determinants, even if symmetric matrix arguments are involved. Finally we deal with the computation of information matrices in situations where positive definite matrices are arguments of the likelihood function."
