                "text": "Recently, Marr & Poggio (1979) presented a theory of human stereo vision. An implementation of that theory is presented, and consists of five steps. (i) The left and right images are each filtered with masks of four sizes that increase with eccentricity; the shape of these masks is given by delta 2G, the Laplacian of a Gaussian function. (ii) Zero crossings in the filtered images are found along horizontal scan lines. (iii) For each mask size, matching takes place between zero crossings of the same sign and roughly the same orientation in the two images, for a range of disparities up to about the width of the mask's central region. Within this disparity range, it can be shown that false targets pose only a simple problem. (iv) The output of the wide masks can control vergence movements, thus causing small masks to come into correspondence. In this way, the matching process gradually moves from dealing with large disparities at a low resolution to dealing with small disparities at a high resolution. (v) When a correspondence is achieved, it is stored in a dynamic buffer, called the 2 1/2-dimensional sketch. To support the adequacy of the Marr-Poggio model of human stereo vision, the implementation was tested on a wide range of stereograms from the human stereopsis literature. The performance of the implementation is illustrated and compared with human perception. Also statistical assumptions made by Marr & Poggio are supported by comparison with statistics found in practice. Finally, the process of implementing the theory has led to the clarification and refinement of a number of details within the theory; these are discussed in detail."

                "text": "IN man the two eyes receive slightly differing views of the world. The visual system utilises this disparity for stereoscopic depth perception. This involves a difficult correspondence problem for establishing binocular fusion: for each surface feature extracted from one eye's image, the brain has to decide which is the equivalent feature in the other eye's image. Ambiguities often exist, particularly for densely-textured visual surfaces, but one aspect of binocular visual processing which helps reduce the scale of the problem is that for any given vergence angle, the visual system considers only those potential left/right fusions with disparities under a certain limiting size (defined by Panum's fusional areas1,2). This disparity limit, however, requires that when disparities greater than Panum's area are presented, a suitable vergence change must be initiated to bring corresponding features within the allowable range for fusion. A question currently of considerable theoretical interest concerns the nature of the stimulus characteristics used to initiate these essential vergence movements. The interest stems mainly from Marr and Poggio's model of human stereo vision3,4 in which false correspondences are avoided by seeking left/right fusions within spatial frequency tuned disparity channels whose disparity range is closely tied to their spatial frequency sensitivity5. By setting the disparity range of any given channel to about \u00b1 w (where w = the width of the centre of the receptive fields of the channel in question) Marr and Poggio have demonstrated that false matches are improbable and any that do emerge are easily eliminated using quite simple rules. A further feature of the model is that the outputs of low spatial frequency tuned channels (that is units capable of dealing with large disparities because of their relatively large receptive fields) can initiate vergence movements bringing into correspondence higher spatial frequency channels mediating smaller disparities. The theory predicts that in the case of a two-planar densely-textured stereogram (for example Fig. 1a\u2013c] in which the disparity range exceeds the size appropriate for the lowest spatial frequency channels activated by the stereogram's texture, vergence movements should exhibit only a random-search structure. We report here an experimental test of this prediction which shows that vergence movements are not always random in the stimulus circumstances just specified. Rather, vergence can be guided by texture contours (Fig. 1b) depicted by differences of texture orientation between regions of relatively high spatial frequency content for the disparity range incorporated in the stereogram. Moreover, we find that such texture contours can facilitate stereopsis in a way consistent with the idea that they do so by initiating appropriate eye movements."

The most clearcut evidence for the presence of these two components is the finding that some individuals lack either one or the other. However, when the ability to process both convergent and divergent disparities is present in the same individual it is more difficult to demonstrate the presence of two separate mechanisms. In this paper, the mechanisms for stereopsis are shown to consist of at least two components in the same individual. This demonstration is based upon a new kind of perimetry whereby field maps for stereopsis are plotted for both convergent and divergent disparities. Extensive measurements on one observer show that the zone of the visual field over which convergent disparities are processed may differ quite distinctively from the zone of the visual field over which divergent disparities are processed."

                "text": "An introduction is given to a theory of early visual information processing. The theory has been implemented, and examples are given of images at various stages of analysis. It is argued that the first step of consequence is to compute a primitive but rich description of the grey-level changes present in an image. The description is expressed in a vocabulary of kinds of intensity change (EDGE, SHADING-EDGE, EXTENDED-EDGE, LINE, BLOB etc.). Modifying parameters are bound to the elements in the description, specifying their POSITION, ORIENTATION, TERMINATION points, CONTRAST, SIZE and FUZZINESS. This description is obtained from the intensity array by fixed techniques, and it is called the primal sketch. For most images, the primal sketch is large and unwieldy. The second important step in visual information processing is to group its contents in a way that is appropriate for later recognition. From our ability to interpret drawings with little semantic content, one may infer the presence in our perceptual equipment of symbolic processes that can define \"place-tokens\" in an image in various ways, and can group them according to certain rules. Homomorphic techniques fail to account for many of these grouping phenomena, whose explanations require mechanisms of construction rather than mechanisms of detection. The necessary grouping of elements in the primal sketch may be achieved by a mechanism that has available the processes inferred from above, together with the ability to select items by first order discriminations acting on the elements' parameters. Only occasionally do these mechanisms use downward-flowing information about the contents of the particular image being processed. It is argued that \"non-attentive\" vision is in practice implemented by these grouping operations and first order discriminations acting on the primal sketch. The class of computations so obtained differs slightly from the class of second order operations on the intensity array. The extraction of a form from the primal sketch using these techniques amounts to the separation of figure from ground. It is concluded that most of the separation can be carried out by using techniques that do not depend upon the particular image in question. Therefore, figure-ground separation can normally precede the description of the shape of the extracted form. Up to this point, higher-level knowledge and purpose are brought to bear on only a few of the decisions taken during the processing. This relegates the widespread use of downward-flowing information to a later stage than is found in current machine-vision programs, and implies that such knowledge should influence the control of, rather than interfering with, the actual data-processing that is taking place lower down."

This phenomenon is particularly impressive for random-dot stereoscopic images in foveal vision. If initially the left and right images are brought within Panum\u2019s fusional area (6-min arc alignment), fusion and stereopsis are perceived; the images can then be pulled apart symmetrically by about 2 deg in the horizontal direction without loss of stereopsis or fusion. The images are actually pulled apart on the retinae, since the binocular retinal stabilization compensates for the convergence-divergence motions of the eyes; hence a supra-retinal function must be responsible for this type of fusion. If the pulling proceeds too fast, or exceeds the 2-deg limit, or if the stimulus is occluded briefly, the fusional mechanism fails and the fused image abruptly breaks apart into two separate images which have to be brought within Panum\u2019s area again to re-establish fusion. For line stimuli, the maximum disparity without loss of fusion is much less than for random-dot patterns; it is always largest for disparity in the horizontal direction and is less in the vertical direction. These findings indicate that stereopsis and the classically conceived corresponding points greatly depend both on the class of stimulus used and on the recent history of the stimulation."

(1) Intensity changes, which occur in a natural image over a wide range of scales, are detected separately at different scales. An appropriate filter for this purpose at a given scale is found to be the second derivative of a Gaussian, and it is shown that, provided some simple conditions are satisfied, these primary filters need not be orientation-dependent. Thus, intensity changes at a given scale are best detected by finding the zero values of \u22072G(x, y)* I(x, y) for image I, where G(x, y) is a two-dimensional Gaussian distribution and \u22072 is the Laplacian. The intensity changes thus discovered in each of the channels are then represented by oriented primitives called zero-crossing segments, and evidence is given that this representation is complete. (2) Intensity changes in images arise from surface discontinuities or from reflectance or illumination boundaries, and these all have the property that they are spatially localized. Because of this, the zero-crossing segments from the different channels are not independent, and rules are deduced for combining them into a description of the image. This description is called the raw primal sketch. The theory explains several basic psychophysical findings, and the operation of forming oriented zero-crossing segments from the output of centre-surround \u22072G filters acting on the image forms the basis for a physiological model of simple cells (see Marr & Ullman 1979)."

Cells in V1 responded optimally to stimuli with very small or zero disparities, but cells in V2 frequently preferred disparities of several degrees crossed or uncrossed. Many cells in V2 were particularly selective to disparity, often giving no response to a monocular stimulus. 3. Cells preferring the same disparity occur in discrete columns, about 400 muM wide. Changes between columns result from a step displacement of the receptive field of one eye. The disparities encoded in successive columns seem to follow a regular sequence: crossed, zero, uncrossed, zero, etc. 4. In both V1 and V2, cells are clustered, perhaps in columns, according to their orientation preference and ocular dominance.

It was found that such features facilitated stereopsis in large-disparity but not in small-disparity stereograms, perception times for the latter being relatively short with or without monocular features. Facilitation in the large-disparity stimuli came about both from features which delineated the shape of the whole disparate area and from features which merely happened to lie in the same depth plane as the disparate area, but which did not give any shape cues. It is argued that these various results can be well accounted for by a \u2018vergence hypothesis\u2019, which supposes that the long perception times often found with random-dot stereograms are due in part to the absence of stimulus features which can guide the vergence movements necessary for fusing the display."

We have examined and compared the ability of binocularly activated striate neurons to make both position disparity and orientation disparity discrimination in the anesthetized (N2O/O2) and paralyzed cat preparation. 2. Accurate knowledge of eye position is essential for disparity studies. Using a retinal projection technique able to detect eye drifts of less than 3' arc per retinal landmark and less than 18' arc cyclorotation disparity, we determined eye drift during the course of 2- to 4-day experiments. After the initial eye rotation due to the anesthesia and the onset of paralysis (see below), rotational drift thereafter was mainly excyclorotatory and, from all causes, rarely totaled more than 4 degrees disparity. All our data have been corrected for this residual cyclorotatory drift. 3. Optimal stimulus orientation disparities were determined from quantitative monocular orientation tuning curves for 74 binocularly activated striate cells (37 simple, 3 hypercomplex I, 31 complex, 3 hypercomplex II) from nine cats. Without exception, the mean optimal stimulus orientation disparity in each of our animals showed a departure from zero disparity equivalent to an incyclorotation of the eyes (mean, 9.2 degrees; range, 2.7 degrees-15.9 degrees). 4. We attribute this mean optimal stimulus orientation disparity shift to ocular cyclorotation as a result of the initial anesthesia and paralysis. Assuming equal intortion, incyclorotation for each eye averages 4.6 degrees. On the assumption that the mean optimal stimulus orientation disparity is zero in normal life, we pooled results from the nine animals about their individual means. For the 74 cells the resulting distribution of the optimal stimulus orientation disparities had a range of about +/-15 degrees (simple cells: SD 4.9 degrees; complex cells: SD 7.4 degrees). 5. We examined the relationship of the sharpness of the orientation tuning curves to ocular dominance, to absolute orientation preference, and to other unit properties. The striking observation was the high correlation between the sharpness of orientation tuning curves for the two eyes of a binocular neuron. For simple cells the mean difference for the half-widths of half-height was only 2.54 degrees, with sharpness showing a high correlation between the two eyes (r=0.915) over half-width at half-heights ranging from 8.5 degrees to 41.8 degrees. Complex cells showed a similar, albeit weaker, correlation. 6. Having shown that, assessed monocularly binocular units show different orientation tunings in the two eyes, we undertook binocular experiments to ascertain if these differences were the optimal disparities of sharply tuned stimulus orientation disparity channels. Using a matrix stimulation paradigm to minimize the effects of spontaneous changes in responsiveness, we have simultaneously extracted bionocular stimulus orientation disparity and position disparity tuning curves from single striate neurons..."

                "text": "The perception of depth involves monocular and binocular depth cues. The latter seem simpler and more suitable for investigation. Particularly important is the problem of finding binocular parallax, which involves matching patterns of the left and right visual fields. Stereo pictures of familiar objects or line drawings preclude the separation of interacting cues, and thus this pattern-matching process is difficult to investigate. More insight into the process can be gained by using unfamiliar picture material devoid of all cues except binocular parallax. To this end, artificial stereo picture pairs were generated on a digital computer. When viewed monocularly, they appear completely random, but if viewed binocularly, certain correlated point domains are seen in depth. By introducing distortions in this material and testing for perception of depth, it is possible to show that pattern-matching of corresponding points of the left and right visual fields can be achieved by first combining the two fields and then searching for patterns in the fused field. By this technique, some interesting properties of this fused binocular field are revealed, and a simple analog model is derived. The interaction between the monocular and binocular fields is also describea. A number of stereo images that demonstrate these and other findings are presented."

Contrast\u2010matching between different spatial frequencies was performed correctly (especially at frequencies above 5 c/deg) despite the attenuation by optical and neural factors which cause large differences in contrast thresholds. 3. Contrast\u2010matching between single lines of different widths was also veridical, and was not limited by the spatial integration (Ricco's Law) present at threshold. Adaptation to gratings altered the appearance of lines, and this could be best understood in Fourier terms. 4. The generality of these results was shown by matching the contrast of pictures which had been filtered so that each contained a one octave band of spatial frequencies. 5. Within the limits imposed by threshold and resolution, contrast\u2010matching was largely independent of luminance and position on the retina. 6. Six out of eleven astigmatic observers showed considerable suprathreshold compensation for their orientation\u2010specific neural deficit in contrast sensitivity. 7. These results define a new property of vision: contrast constancy. It is argued that spatial frequency channels in the visual cortex are organized to compensate for earlier attenuation. This achieves a dramatic 'deblurring' of the image, and optimizes the clarity of vision."

Julesz (1971) has noted that giving a priori information to such observers about the nature of the \u2018hidden\u2019 cyclopean object appears to facilitate their stereopsis. An experiment is reported which investigated this possible facilitation. Naive subjects were shown a complex stereogram following various kinds of preliminary assistance, ranging from simply telling them about the amount of depth they could expect to see to showing them a full-scale model of the cyclopean object. Surprisingly, no benefit from such assistance could be demonstrated. All observers improved their stereopsis perception times with repeated presentations of the stereogram, showing that they could, in principle, benefit from assistance. A follow-up study three weeks later revealed that a substantial part of this improvement was maintained, indicating that the perceptual learning involved can last for a considerable period of time."

In this paper, we apply this approach to the problem of representing three-dimensional shapes for the purpose of recognition. 1. Three criteria, accessibility, scope and uniqueness, and stability and sensitivity, are presented for judging the usefulness of a representation for shape recognition. 2. Three aspects of a representation\u2019s design are considered, (i) the representation\u2019s coordinate system, (ii) its primitives, which are the primary units of shape information used in the representation, and (iii) the organization the representation imposes on the information in its descriptions. 3. In terms of these design issues and the criteria presented, a shape representation for recognition should: (i) use an object-centred coordinate system, (ii) include volumetric primitives of varied sizes, and (iii) have a modular organization. A representation based on a shape\u2019s natural axes (for example the axes identified by a stick figure) follows directly from these choices. 4. The basic process for deriving a shape description in this representation must involve: (i) a means for identifying the natural axes of a shape in its image and (ii) a mechanism for transforming viewer-centred axis specifications to specifications in an object-centred coordinate system. 5. Shape recognition involves: (i) a collection of stored shape descriptions, and (ii) various indexes into the collection that allow a newly derived description to be associated with an appropriate stored description. The most important of these indexes allows shape recognition to proceed conservatively from the general to the specific based on the specificity of the information available from the image. 6. New constraints supplied by a conservative recognition process can be used to extract more information from the image. A relaxation process for carrying out this constraint analysis is described."

An important aspect of vision is the choice of representations for the different kinds of information in a visual scene. In the early stages of the analysis of an image, the representations used depend more on what it is possible to compute from an image than on what is ultimately desirable, but later representations can be more sensitive to the specific needs of recognition. This essay surveys recent work in vision at M.I.T. from a perspective in which the representational problems assume a primary importance. An overall framework is suggested for visual information processing, in which the analysis proceeds through three representations; (1) the primal sketch, which makes explicit the intensity changes and local two-dimensional geometry of an image, (2) the 2 1/2-D sketch, which is a viewer-centered representation of the depth, orientation and discontinuities of the visible surfaces, and (3) the 3-D model representation, which allows an object-centered description of the three-dimensional structure and organization of a viewed shape. Recent results concerning processes for constructing and maintaining these representations are summarized and discussed. (Author)"

In the present study, random-dot stereograms were bandpass filtered in the two-dimensional Fourier domain, and masking noise of various spatial frequency bands was added to the filtered stereograms. Masking noise bands containing equally effective noise energy were selected such that their bands were either overlapping with the stereoscopic image spectrum or were two octaves distant. The first case resulted in binocular rivalry; however, in the second case stereoscopic fusion could be maintained in the presence of strong binocular rivalry owing to the masking noise. This finding indicates that spatial-frequency-tuned channels are not restricted to one-dimensional gratings but operate on two-dimensional patterns as well. Furthermore, these frequency channels are utilized in stereopsis and work independently from each other, since some of these channels can be in binocular rivalry while at the same time other channels yield fusion. The main binocular experiments are demonstrated."

                "text": "This classic work on cyclopean perception has influenced a generation of vision researchers, cognitive scientists, and neuroscientists and has inspired artists, designers, and computer graphics pioneers. In Foundations of Cyclopean Perception (first published in 1971 and unavailable for years), Bela Julesz traced the visual information flow in the brain, analyzing how the brain combines separate images received from the two eyes to produce depth perception. Julesz developed novel tools to do this: random-dot stereograms and cinematograms, generated by early digital computers at Bell Labs. These images, when viewed with the special glasses that came with the book, revealed complex, three-dimensional surfaces; this mode of visual stimulus became a paradigm for research in vision and perception. This reprint edition includes all 48 color random-dot designs from the original, as well as the special 3-D glasses required to view them.Foundations of Cyclopean Perception has had a profound impact on the vision studies community. It was chosen as one of the one hundred most influential works in cognitive science in a poll conducted by the University of Minnesota's Center for Cognitive Sciences. Many copies are \"permanently borrowed\" from college libraries; used copies are sought after online. Now, with this facsimile of the 1971 edition, the book is available again to cognitive scientists, neuroscientists, vision researchers, artists, and designers."

This is a method of direct photography, based upon collimated beams of light reflected from plane mirrors mounted on tightly fitting contact lenses. The records show that the eyes exhibit relatively rapid and accurate motions of vergence when fixating alternately a near and a far test object. There is no evidence for a systematic discrepancy between the extent of vergence and the geometrical location of the test object. It is concluded that when fusion is maintained, the images of a fixation object are brought to corresponding areas of the retina to an accuracy of about two minutes of arc. This finding is consistent with the reported sizes of Panum\u2019s area and the region of optimal visual resolution."

Impulse activity was recorded from neurons in fovea1 striate (A17) and prestriate (Al@ cortex of monkeys trained to fixate monocularly and binocularly by rewarding them for detecting an abrupt change in the intensity of a small luminous spot. During periods of fixation, single bright or dark narrow bars moving across a frontoparallel plane were presented at a series of different depths. 2. Nearly all cortical neurons studied received input from both eyes. Binocular neurons were classifiedLint two categories on the basis of their monocular responses: those that gave similar responses to stimulation of right and left eye (ocular balance) and those that gave different responses (ocular unbalance). Different kinds of binocular interactions were observed. 3. Most neurons (84%) were sensitive to location of the stimulus in depth. Four types of depth-sensitive cells were recognized: a) tuned excitatory neurons, the most common type, that gave excitatory responses over a narrow range of depth about the fixation distance often with inhibitory flanks nearer and farther, and that typically received a balanced binocular input; b) tuned inhibitory neurons whose responses were largely suppressed by stimuli at or close to the plane of fixation; c) near neurons, which responded well to stimuli in front of the fixation plane and were suppressed by those behind it; d) far neurons, the opposite of near neurons. The last three types of depth cells were usually ocularly unbalanced. Peaks and steps of depthsensitivity profiles occurred at or close to the fixation distance (within t 0.4O of disparity), whereas the total range of binocular interaction, even for a single cell, could extend to more than t lo of disparity. 4. The results suggest that there are cells in fovea1 striate and prestriate which may be part of"

The arrangement of the columns is highly ordered; in the great majority of oblique or tangential microelectrode penetrations the preferred orientations of cells changed systematically with electrode position, in a clockwise or counterclockwise direction. Graphs of orientation vs. electrode track distance were virtually straight lines over distances of up to several millimeters; such orderly sequences were often terminated by sudden changes in the direction of orientation shifts, from clockwise to counterclockwise or back. The orientations at which these reversals occurred were quite unpredictable. Total rotations of 180\u2013360\u00b0 were frequently seen between reversals. In tangential or almost tangential penetrations orientation shifts occurred almost every time the electrode was moved forward, indicating that the columns were either not discrete or had a thickness of less than 25\u201350 \u03bc, the smallest order of distance that our methods could resolve. In penetrations that were almost perpendicular to the surface, the graphs of orientation vs. track distance were relatively flatter, as expected if the surfaces of constant orientation are perpendicular to the cortical surface. Stepwise changes in orientation of about 10\u00b0 could sometimes be seen in perpendicular penetrations, each orientation persisting through several clear advances of the electrode, suggesting a set of discrete columnar subdivisions. The possibility of some kind of continuous variation in orientation with horizontal distance along the cortex was not, however, completely ruled out. Occasionally a highly ordered sequence was broken by an abrupt large shift in orientation of up to 90\u00b0. Shifts in ocular dominance occurred roughly every 0.25\u20130.5 mm and were independent of orientation shifts. In multiple parallel penetrations spaced closer than about 250 \u03bc the slopes of the orientation vs. track distance curves were almost the same; reconstruction of these penetrations indicated that the regions of constant orientation are parallel sheets. On crossing perpendicular to these sheets, a total orientation shift of 180\u00b0 took place over a distance of 0.5\u20131.0 mm. Column thickness, size of shifts in orientation, and the rate of change of orientation with distance along the cortex seemed to be independent of eccentricity, at least between 2\u00b0 and 15\u00b0 from the fovea. A few penetrations made in area 17 of the cat and in area 18 of the monkey showed similar orderly sequences of receptive\u2010field orientation shifts."

                "text": "Eye movements may be described in terms of two components: conjugate and disjunctive. A pure conjugate eye movement is one in which the two eyes move in a parallel fashion, while in a disjunctive movement changes occur in the orientation of one eye with respect to the other. A typical situation calling for a disjunctive movement is the change in binocular observation from a far to a near target, when the fixation lines of the two eyes have to converge. Recordings of eye movement responses to the presentation of targets requiring convergence show the movements to be slow compared with their reaction time (Westheimer &AMitchell, 1956). In this respect they differ from the most commonly occurring conjugate eye movements, the saccadic movements. It is clear now that saccadic eye movements are not guided, in that no adjustments in response to visual clues are made during the movement (Westheimer, 1954). The time characteristics of disjunctive movements, on the other hand, would theoretically allow correction of movements during their course on the basis of visual information. That the elements for such a control system exist is evidenced by the following two facts: (1) the sensory system on which such a control system would depend is capable of making very fine discriminations-retinal disparities of less than a minute of arc can be detected-and (2) the muscular system is quite fast and capable of making fine gradations in response. The experiments reported in this paper fall into two groups. Those describing the eye movement responses to simple types of convergence stimuli are given in Part I, and those in which responses are studied to special stimulus situations designed to elucidate the properties of the control mechanism for disjunctive eye movements are contained in Part II."

The moving of cells studied were not selective for bar width or for the spatial frequency of square-wave gratings. 3. Most cells responded selectively to the spatial frequency of the sine-wave gratings. 4. The spatial frequency of the sine-wave grating eliciting the optimal response could not be predicted from the organization of the receptive field of each cell as determined by stationary or moving stimuli. 5. The sharpness of spatial-frequency selectivity is only slightly more pronounced in S-type cells than in CX-type cells. 6. S-type and CX-type cells differ significantly in the temporal modulation of their discharges to gratings. S-type cells discharge in sharp bursts to each cycle which traverses the receptive field. CX-type cells discharge in a rather continuous fashion. This measure can be used reliably to classify cells as S or CS type."

                "text": "The probability density Pm of the spacing between the ith zero and the (i + m + 1)th zero of a stationary, random function f(t) (not necessarily Gaussian) is expressed as a series, of a type similar to that given by Rice (1945) but more rapidly convergent. The partial sums of the series provide upper and lower bounds successively for Pm. The series converges particularly rapidly for small spacings r. It is shown that for fixed values of r, the density Pm(r) diminishes more rapidly than any negative power of m. The results are applied to Gaussian processes; then the first two terms of the series for Pm(T) may be expressed in terms of known functions. Special attention is paid to two cases: (1) In the \u2018regular\u2019 case the covariance function i/r(t) is expressible as a power series in then Pm(r) is of order r 1/2(m+2)(m+3)-2 at the origin, and in particular P (r) is of order r (adjacent zeros have a strong mutual repulsion). The first two terms of the series give the value of P0(t) correct to r18. (2) In a singular case, the covariance function p(t) has a discontinuity in the third derivative. This happens whenever the frequency spectrum of f(t) is O (frequency)-4 at infinity. Then Pm(r) is shown to tend to a positive value Pm(0) as r -> 0 (neighbouring zeros are less strongly repelled). Upper and lower bounds for Pm(0) (m = 0, 1, 2, 3) are given, and it is shown th at P0(0) is in the neighbourhood of 1.155^ m ( - 6^ ') . The conjecture of Favreau, Low & Pfeffer (1956) according to which in one case P0(t) is a negative exponential, is disproved. In a final section, the accuracy of other approximations suggested by Rice (1945), McFadden (1958), Ehrenfeld et al. (1958) and the present author (1958) are compared and the results are illustrated by computations, the frequency spectrum of f(t) being assumed to have certain ideal forms: a low-pass spectrum, band-pass spectrum, Butterworth spectrum, etc."

Fluctuations of integrals involving I2(t) are discussed in section 3.9. The probability distribution of a sine wave plus a noise current is given in 3.10 and in 3.11 an alternative method of deriving the results of Part III is mentioned. Prof. Uhlenbeck has pointed out that much of the material in this Part is closely connected with the theory of Markoff processes. Also S.

                "text": "MANY authors-particularly in the physical and engineering sciences-have considered the problem of obtaining the distribution of the time between successive axiscrossings by a stochastic process. This interest dates back to the pioneering work of S. 0. Rice (1945), who developed a series expression and used a very simple approximation for the case of axis-crossings by a stationary normal process. More generally, one may consider the distribution of the time between an axiscrossing and the nth subsequent axis-crossing, or between, say, an upcrossing of the axis and the nth subsequent downcrossing. Problems of this type have been discussed by Longuet-Higgins (1962), with particular reference to the normal case. In particular he obtains series expressions which are variants and generalizations of that given by Rice (1945, equation 3.4-11). For example, Longuet-Higgins calculates (by somewhat heuristic methods) a series for the probability density for the time between an \"arbitrary\" upcrossing of zero to the (r+ l)st subsequent upcrossing. (A precise definition of what is meant by such a density is usually not given in the relevant literature. This difficulty, and one method of overcoming it, will be discussed in Section 2.) The series just referred to may be written in the form"

                "text": "INDUSTRIAL mercury discharges into natural waters have been effectively reduced during the past several years in the United States. In areas such as Mobile Bay, which previously received sufficient quantities of anthropogenic mercury effluents to require a ban on commercial fisheries, it is now critical to determine if the residual contaminated sediments are a reservoir of mercury compounds which could be detrimental to the fishery on a long term basis. It is well established that mercury accumulates in particulate material1,2 and may subsequently be transferred from sediment to fish3. Laboratory studies4 suggest that diagenetic processes in natural sediments can transform inorganic mercury to mono and dimethylmercury, increasing the pollution hazard. The methylated forms of mercury have been found to be more toxic to organisms than inorganic or phenyl mercury compounds5,6. Here we report the first published results on the concentration and distribution of methylmercury compounds in natural sediments from polluted and unpolluted coastal environments."
