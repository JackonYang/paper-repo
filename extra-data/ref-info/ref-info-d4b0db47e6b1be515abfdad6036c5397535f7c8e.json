Recent trends in social and collaborative software have greatly increased the popularity of this type of visualization. This paper proposes a family of novel algorithms for tag cloud layout and presents evaluation results obtained from an extensive user study and a technical evaluation. The algorithms address issues found in many common approaches, for example large whitespaces, overlapping tags and restriction to specific boundaries. The layouts computed by these algorithms are compact and clear, have small whitespaces and may feature arbitrary convex polygons as boundaries. The results of the user study and the technical evaluation enable designers to devise a combination of algorithm and parameters which produces satisfying tag cloud layouts for many application scenarios."

The second step uses linguistic-semantic analysis of the image caption text in the context of the document domain. The result on a PDF-document collection with about 3300 pages with 6500 images has a precision of 95.5% and a recall of 88.8% for the correct image captions."

Currently, no good solutions exist for viewing formatted documents, such as pdf documents, on these devices. Adapting content of web pages to small displays is usually achieved by complete redesign of a page or automatically reflowing text for small displays. Such techniques may not be applicable to documents whose format needs to be preserved. To address this problem, we propose a new document representation called Multimedia Thumbnail. Multimedia Thumbnail uses the visual and audio channels of small portable devices to communicate document information in form of a multimedia clip, which can be seen as a movie trailer for a document. Generation of such a clip includes a document analysis step, where salient document information is extracted, an optimization step, where the document information to be included in the thumbnail is determined based on display and time constraints, and a synthesis step, where visual and audible information are formed into a playable Multimedia Thumbnail. We also present user study results that evaluate an initial system design and point to further modification on analysis, optimization, and user interface components."

If a page overview is desired, typically a low resolution version of the image fitting a small array of pixels - a thumbnail - is provided. Whereas the readability of text in thumbnails is often lost, document layout information may or may not be preserved. Preserving document layout information in thumbnails is the goal of this paper. We derive models for controlling the preservation of document layout information in thumbnails by determining the size of a thumbnail depending on the layout content of the document. The downsampling factor for a document image will depend on its layout information, such that layout units will be visually separate after scaling. The link between scaling factors and document layout information is created through novel models, White Space Graphs and White Space Trees. These models enable control over enhancement and suppression of document layout structures during scaling. Minimal scaling factors can be derived that assure visual separability of a controlled set of layout units after scaling. Those scaling factors depends on the document content as well as user and display specifications."

While most work on KDD has been concerned with structured databases, there has been little work on handling the huge amount of information that is available only in unstructured textual form. Previous work in text mining focused at the word or the tag level. This paper presents an approach to performing text mining at the term level. The mining process starts by preprocessing the document collection and extracting terms from the documents. Each document is then represented by a set of terms and annotations characterizing the document. Terms and additional higher-level entities are then organized in a hierarchical taxonomy. In this paper we will describe the Term Extraction module of the Document Explorer system, and provide experimental evaluation performed on a set of 52,000 documents published by Reuters in the years 1995\u20131996."

However, moving more than a few pages can be slow because all scrolling techniques constrain visual search to only a small document region. To improve document navigation, we developed Space-Filling Thumbnails (SFT), an overview display that eliminates most scrolling. SFT provides two views: a standard page view for reading, and a thumbnail view that shows all pages. We tested SFT in three experiments that involved finding pages in documents. The first study (n=13) compared seven current scrolling techniques, and showed that SFT is significantly faster than the other methods. The second and third studies (n=32 and n=14) were detailed comparisons of SFT with thumbnail-enhanced scrollbars (TES), which performed well in the first experiment. SFT was faster than TES across all document types and lengths, particularly when tasks involved revisitation. In addition, SFT was strongly preferred by participants."

Recognizing the objects in an image is important in many retrieval tasks, but thumbnails generated by shrinking the original image often render objects illegible. We study the ability of computer vision systems to detect key components of images so that automated cropping, prior to shrinking, can render objects more recognizable. We evaluate automatic cropping techniques 1) based on a general method that detects salient portions of images, and 2) based on automatic face detection. Our user study shows that these methods result in small thumbnails that are substantially more recognizable and easier to find in the context of visual search."

                "text": "Background: Direct manipulation interfaces, such as the Macintosh desktop, often represent objects with icons [l, 41. For example, text files are represented by icons. Selection of the icon invokes an editor to view the file it represents, thus the icon not only represents the text file but also represents a text editor used to view the text file. Each type of object is viewed by using a specific program. Diagram objects, for example, require a graphical editor to view. In a typical iconic interface, icons represent a single view of an object.\nWhile the single-view single-icon model has proven very intuitive and easy to use, some objects have more than one logical view [2]. Program code can be viewed as text by using a text editor, or it can be viewed as program code by a compiler. The machine code that corresponds to the program code can be thought of as another view, thus the execution of a program can be thought of as another view of program code. This paper describes a mechanism for grouping a set of icons that depict several views of a single object into one multidimensional icon.\nMultidimensional icons group sets of icons, each describing a unique view of an object, into a single entity. The individual icons are projected onto the sides of a simulated cube. There are two distinct advantages to using a cube instead of displaying all the icons in a menu. The first advantage is that since cubes are very familiar objects, it is a natural mental model to think of the faces of a cube as views of the entire cube\u2014views of the actual object. The second advantage is that by allowing rotation of the cube, several icons representing views of an object are accessible using only a fraction of the screen space required to display all the icons."

The technique represents the data by using nested rectangles. It first packs icons or thumbnails of the lowest-level data and then generates rectangular borders that enclose the packed data. It repeats the process of generating rectangles that enclose the lower-level rectangles until the highest-level rectangles are packed. We present two rectangle-packing algorithms for placing items of hierarchical data onto display spaces. The algorithms refer to Delaunay triangular meshes connecting the centers of rectangles to find gaps where rectangles can be placed. The first algorithm places rectangles where they do not overlap each other and where the extension of the layout area is minimal. The second algorithm places rectangles by referring to templates describing the ideal positions for nodes of input data. It places rectangles where they do not overlap each other and where the combination of the layout area and the distances between the positions described in the template and the actual positions is minimal. It can smoothly represent time-varying data by referring to templates that describe previous layout results. It is also suitable for semantics-based or design-based data layout by generating templates according to the semantics or design."

Such images can summarize a larger collection of media in novel ways, giving an evocation of the whole, rather than a precise linguistic summary. Paradoxically, such visual summaries are often found to be more useful as indicators of the gestalt of a media than more traditional language summaries. We demonstrate a design pattern based method that creates visual compositions by selecting imagery from the source document(s) and instantiating several design patterns. Each pattern has a set of slots and roles that are filled with source imagery and then constrained to fit within the pattern visual specifications. Examples are given of the process and its end result. A pilot study has shown that these visual summaries lead to faster retrieval of relevant documents than textual summaries."

Frequent terms are extracted first, then a set of cooccurrence between each term and the frequent terms, i.e., occurrences in the same sentences, is generated. Co-occurrence distribution shows importance of a term in the documentas follows. If probability distribution of co-occurrence between term a and the frequent terms is biased to a particular subset of frequent terms, then term a is likely to be a keyword. The degree of biases of distribution is measured by the \u03c7 2 -measure. Our algorithm shows comparable performance to tfidf without using a corpus."

Numerous studies report that users misplace files and have trouble wayfinding in virtual worlds despite the fact that people have remarkable visual and spatial abilities. This issue is considered in the human-computer interface field and has been addressed with alternate display/navigation schemes. Our paper presents a fundamentally graphics based approach to this 'lost in hyperspace' problem. Specifically, we propose that spatial display of files is not sufficient to engage our visual skills; scenery (distinctive visual appearance) is needed as well. While scenery (in the form of custom icon assignments) is already possible in current operating systems, few if any users take the time to manually assign icons to all their files. As such, our proposal is to generate visually distinctive icons (\"VisualIDs\") automatically, while allowing the user to replace the icon if desired. The paper discusses psychological and conceptual issues relating to icons, visual memory, and the necessary relation of scenery to data. A particular icon generation algorithm is described; subjects using these icons in simulated file search and recall tasks show significantly improved performance with little effort. Although the incorporation of scenery in a graphical user interface will introduce many new (and interesting) design problems that cannot be addressed in this paper, we show that automatically created scenery is both beneficial and feasible."

In this paper, we present Summary Thumbnails-thumbnail views enhanced with readable text fragments. Summary Thumbnails help users identify viewed material and distinguish between visually similar areas. In our user study, participants located content in web pages about 41% faster and with 71% lower error rates when using the Summary Thumbnail interface than when using the Single-Column interface, and zoomed 59% less than when using the Thumbnail interface. Nine of the eleven participants preferred Summary Thumbnails over both the Thumbnail and Single-Column interfaces."

Because a successful term-recognition method has to be based on proper insights into the nature of terms, studies of automatic term recognition not only contribute to the applications of computational linguistics but also to the theoretical foundation of terminology. Many studies on automatic term recognition treat interesting aspects of terms, but most of them are not well founded and described.This paper tries to give an overview of the principles and methods of automatic term recognition. For that purpose, two major trends are examined, i.e., studies in automatic recognition of significant elements for indexing mainly carried out in information-retrieval circles and current research in automatic term recognition in the field of computational linguistics."

We investigated the added value of full text over abstracts in terms of information content and occurrences of gene symbol--gene name combinations that can resolve gene-symbol ambiguity.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWe analyzed a set of 3902 biomedical full-text articles. Different keyword measures indicate that information density is highest in abstracts, but that the information coverage in full texts is much greater than in abstracts. Analysis of five different standard sections of articles shows that the highest information coverage is located in the results section. Still, 30-40% of the information mentioned in each section is unique to that section. Only 30% of the gene symbols in the abstract are accompanied by their corresponding names, and a further 8% of the gene names are found in the full text. In the full text, only 18% of the gene symbols are accompanied by their gene names."

However, full text articles in electronic version, which offer larger sources of data, are currently available. Several questions arise as to whether the effort of scanning full text articles is worthy, or whether the information that can be extracted from the different sections of an article can be relevant.ResultsIn this work we addressed those questions showing that the keyword content of the different sections of a standard scientific article (abstract, introduction, methods, results, and discussion) is very heterogeneous.ConclusionsAlthough the abstract contains the best ratio of keywords per total of words, other sections of the article may be a better source of biologically relevant data."

However, this occurs at the cost of a significant increase in computational complexity. In fact, closed-form solutions for probabilistic retrieval are currently available only for simple probabilistic models such as the Gaussian or the histogram. We analyze the case of mixture densities and exploit the asymptotic equivalence between likelihood and Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to derive solutions for these models. In particular, 1) we show that the divergence can be computed exactly for vector quantizers (VQs) and 2) has an approximate solution for Gauss mixtures (GMs) that, in high-dimensional feature spaces, introduces no significant degradation of the resulting similarity judgments. In both cases, the new solutions have closed-form and computational complexity equivalent to that of standard retrieval approaches."

This paper shows that support vector machines (SVM's) can generalize well on difficult image classification problems where the only features are high dimensional histograms. Heavy-tailed RBF kernels of the form K(x, y) = e(-rho)Sigma(i)/xia-yia/b with a < or = 1 and b < or = 2 are evaluated on the classification of images extracted from the Corel stock photo collection and shown to far outperform traditional polynomial or Gaussian radial basis function (RBF) kernels. Moreover, we observed that a simple remapping of the input x(i)-->x(i)(a) improves the performance of linear SVM's to such an extend that it makes them, for this problem, a valid alternative to RBF kernels."

The Fisher Kernel and similar variants have been suggested as good ways to combine an underlying generative model in the feature space and discriminant classifiers such as SVM's. In this paper we suggest an alternative procedure to the Fisher kernel for systematically finding kernel functions that naturally handle variable length sequence data in multimedia domains. In particular for domains such as speech and images we explore the use of kernel functions that take full advantage of well known probabilistic models such as Gaussian Mixtures and single full covariance Gaussian models. We derive a kernel distance based on the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between generative models. In effect our approach combines the best of both generative and discriminative methods and replaces the standard SVM kernels. We perform experiments on speaker identification/verification and image classification tasks and show that these new kernels have the best performance in speaker verification and mostly outperform the Fisher kernel based SVM's and the generative classifiers in speaker identification and image classification."

Since the variety of the packing is infinite (two-dimensionally continuous) many, the key issue for successful optimization is in the introduction of a P-admissible solution space, which is a finite set of solutions at least one of which is optimal. This paper proposes such a solution space where each packing is represented by a pair of module name sequences. Searching this space by simulated annealing, hundreds of modules could be successfully packed as demonstrated. Combining a conventional wiring method, the biggest MCNC benchmark ami49 is challenged."

Many simple scheduling tasks can be modelled by this NP-complete problem. We use an anytime branch-and-bound algorithm to solve the problem optimally. Our main contributions are a lower-bound on the amount of wasted space in a partial solution, based on a relaxation of the problem to one-dimensional bin packing, and a dominance condition that allows us to ignore many partial solutions. For our experiments, we choose a class of increasingly difficult square-packing problems as a simple and easily-specified benchmark. The square-packing problem of size N is to find the smallest rectangle that contains the 1x1, 2x2, etc. up to NxN square. We find optimal solutions to these problems up to size N=22. For comparison, we also find the best slicing solutions, a popular approximation algorithm. Our approach is rather general, and many of our techniques can be applied to packing non-rectangular shapes in non-rectangular enclosing regions, and higher-dimensional packing problems as well."
