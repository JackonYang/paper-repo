                "text": "In many applications of image analysis, simply connected objects are to be located in noisy images. During the last 5-6 years active contour models have become popular for finding the contours of such objects. Connected to these models are iterative algorithms for finding the minimizing energy curves making the curves behave dynamically through the iterations. These approaches do however have several disadvantages. The numerical algorithms that are in use constrain the models that can be used. Furthermore, in many cases only local minima can be achieved. In this paper, the author discusses a method for curve detection based on a fully Bayesian approach. A model for image contours which allows the number of nodes on the contours to vary is introduced. Iterative algorithms based on stochastic sampling is constructed, which make it possible to simulate samples from the posterior distribution, making estimates and uncertainty measures of specific quantities available. Further, simulated annealing schemes making the curve move dynamically towards the global minimum energy configuration are presented. In theory, no restrictions on the models are made. In practice, however, computational aspects must be taken into consideration when choosing the models. Much more general models than the one used for active contours may however be applied. The approach is applied to ultrasound images of the left ventricle and to magnetic resonance images of the human brain, and show promising results. >"

In this paper, we extend this work by using a physically based framework to learn physically plausible, constrained dynamic models of deforming objects. Traditional physically based vibration modes have been shown to provide a useful mechanism for describing non-rigid motions of articulated and deformable objects. The standard approach relies on assumptions being made about the elastic properties of an object to generate a compact set of real, orthogonal shape parameters which can then be used for tracking and data approximation. We present a method for automatically generating an improved physically based model using a training set of examples of the object deforming, tuning the elastic properties of the object to reflect how the object actually deforms. The resulting model provides a low dimensional shape description that allows accurate temporal extrapolation at low computational cost based on the training motions. Results are shown in which the method is applied to an automatically acquired training set of the outline of a walking pedestrian."

Earlier results showing how surface curvature can be inferred from acceleration of image features are generalized for arbitrary viewer motion and perspective projection. It is shown that relative image acceleration, based on parallax measurements, is robust to uncertainties in robot motion. The theory has been implemented and extensively tested in a real-time (15 frames per second) tracking system based on deformable contours (snakes). It is shown that focusing attention by means of snakes allows rapid, robust computation of surface curvature, including discrimination of extremal and occluding contours.<<ETX>>"

The method operates by extracting two-dimensional models of an object from a sequence of images. The basic idea underlying the technique is to decompose the image of a solid object moving in space into two components: a two-dimensional motion and a two-dimensional shape change. The motion component is factored out and the shape change is represented explicitly by a sequence of two-dimensional models, one corresponding to each image frame. The major assumption underlying the method is that the two-dimensional shape of an object will change slowly from one frame to the next. There is no assumption, however, that the two-dimensional image motion between successive frames will be small.<<ETX>>"

RANSAC is capable of interpreting/smoothing data containing a significant percentage of gross errors, and is thus ideally suited for applications in automated image analysis where interpretation is based on the data provided by error-prone feature detectors. A major portion of this paper describes the application of RANSAC to the Location Determination Problem (LDP): Given an image depicting a set of landmarks with known locations, determine that point in space from which the image was obtained. In response to a RANSAC requirement, new results are derived on the minimum number of landmarks needed to obtain a solution, and algorithms are presented for computing these minimum-landmark solutions in closed form. These results provide the basis for an automatic system that can solve the LDP under difficult viewing"

Previous systems have been available to do this for specially illuminated objects or for naturally illuminated but polyhedral objects. Other systems have been able to track nonpolyhedral objects in motion, in some cases from live video, but following only centroids or key-points rather than tracking whole curves. The system described here can track accurately the curved silhouettes of moving non-polyhedral objects at frame-rate, for example hands, lips, legs, vehicles, fruit, and without any special hardware beyond a desktop workstation and a video-camera and framestore. The new algorithms are a synthesis of methods in deformable models, B-splines curve representation and control theory. This paper shows how such a facility can be used to turn parts of the body\u2014for instance, hands and lips\u2014into input devices. Rigid motion of a hand can be used as a 3D mouse with non-rigid gestures signalling a button press or the \u201clifting\u201d of the mouse. Both rigid and non-rigid motions of lips can be tracked independently and used as inputs, for example to animate a computer-generated face."

Pixel gray levels and the presence and orientation of edges are viewed as states of atoms or molecules in a lattice-like physical system. The assignment of an energy function in the physical system determines its Gibbs distribution. Because of the Gibbs distribution, Markov random field (MRF) equivalence, this assignment also determines an MRF image model. The energy function is a more convenient and natural mechanism for embodying picture attributes than are the local characteristics of the MRF. For a range of degradation mechanisms, including blurring, nonlinear deformations, and multiplicative or additive noise, the posterior distribution is an MRF with a structure akin to the image model. By the analogy, the posterior distribution defines another (imaginary) physical system. Gradual temperature reduction in the physical system isolates low energy states (``annealing''), or what is the same thing, the most probable states under the Gibbs distribution. The analogous operation under the posterior distribution yields the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the image given the degraded observations. The result is a highly parallel ``relaxation'' algorithm for MAP estimation. We establish convergence properties of the algorithm and we experiment with some simple pictures, for which good restorations are obtained at low signal-to-noise ratios."

Knowledge is represented in the computer as explicit three-dimensional geometrical models, dynamic filters, and descriptions of behaviour. Model-based vision, based on reasoning with analogue models, avoids many of the classical problems in visual perception: recognition is robust against changes in the image of shape, size, colour and illumination. The three-dimensional understanding of the scene which results also deals naturally with occlusion, and allows the behaviour of vehicles to be interpreted. The experiments with machine vision raise questions about the part played by perceptual context for object recognition in natural vision, and the neural mechanisms which might serve such a role."

Computational feasibility of the algorithms derived from this model is achieved by analytical means. The aim is to develop methods for image understanding based on structured restoration, for example automatic detection of abnormalities. The limits of applicability of the algorithms are also traced by making the optical degradations more and more severe until the algorithms no longer succeed in their task. This book is suitable for an advanced undergraduate or graduate seminar in pattern theory, or as an accompanying book for applied probability, computer vision or pattern recognition."

In almost all cases this has involved a description of the image at pixel level. In this paper we take the process further, and develop a spatial stochastic process of objects present in the image. The general theory is given and applied to images of spiral galaxies, with the aims of producing better schematic reconstructions and of automatically classifying galaxies."
