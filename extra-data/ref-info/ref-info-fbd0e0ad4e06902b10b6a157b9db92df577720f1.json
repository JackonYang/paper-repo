                "text": "The core of our question-answering mechanism is searching for predefined patterns of textual expressions that may be interpreted as answers to certain types of questions. The presence of such patterns in analyzed answer-string candidates may provide evidence of the right answer. The answer-string candidates are created by cutting up relatively-large source documents passages containing the query terms or their synonyms/substitutes. indicative patterns. The specificity of our approach is: placing the use of indicative patterns in the core of the QA approach; aiming at the comprehensive and systematic use of such indicators; defining various structural types of the indicative patterns, including nontrivial and sophisticated ones; developing accessory techniques that ensure effective performance of the approach. We believe that the use of indicative patterns for question answering can be considered as a special case of the more general approach to text information retrieval that contrasts with linguisticsoriented methodology. Introduction We decided to participate in the TREC-10 Question Answering track with a purpose to test certain specific features of the text processing technology we are developing in the framework of our CrossReader project. This technology is aimed at presenting to a user the needed information directly, i.e. instead of documents, or sources containing potentially relevant information. The query-relevant sentences or short passages are extracted from the processed documents and judiciously arranged; so, new full texts emerge that are focused precisely on the user's subject (Subbotin, 1993; Gilyarevskii, 1993; Perez, 2001). The latest version of this technology the TextRoller system uses not only key words, but also positive and negative patterns for choosing and arranging text items. For the TREC-10 Question Answering task we have developed a variant of our basic technology that searches for candidate answers using key words (from the question text) and chooses the most probable answer using patterns. The participation at TREC-10 was a test for some basic mechanisms of our technology. Now, after this test was successfully passed, these mechanisms will be implemented in the new TextRoller versions. Basic Features of the Applied Approach It seems that many systems participating at TREC QA track represent the question (or its reformulations) as a set of entities and relations between them in order to compare these entities and relations with those of candidate answers texts; the answer candidate that correlates at the highest degree with the question text gets the highest score. By contrast, our QA system checks the answer candidates for the presence of certain predefined indicators (patterns) to which scores were assigned beforehand, i.e. independently of the question text analysis. Candidate snippets containing the highest-scored indicators are chosen as final answers. It is obvious from the above that the applied approach does not require NLP or knowledge-based analysis of the question text. This text is considered as just a string consisting of various substrings. These are used, first of all, for composing queries helping to retrieve passages containing answer candidates. If present in candidate answers texts, they are considered as a condition of applicability of a given indicative pattern for a given question, but they do not influence the score of the pattern (as said above, it is predefined beforehand). The efficiency of this approach depends on the quantity and diversification of predefined indicative patterns as well as on the recall of passages containing candidate answers. We could not rely on the presence of predefined patterns in the texts of candidate answers for every question. If case of neither pattern was found, the system used the more common way to choose among candidate answers basing on lexical similarity between the question and an answer snippet. From 289 answer strings that were correct responses 193 did contain the patterns. Non-matching any patterns, but containing question (query) terms were 64. Other (containing minor indicators, such as capitalized words, or randomly selected) 32. To some extent, many QA-Track participants (at TRECs 8 and 9) had used what we call the indicative patterns. The specificity of our approach is: placing the use of indicative patterns in the core of the QA approach; aiming at the comprehensive and systematic use of such indicators; defining various structural types of the indicative patterns, including nontrivial and sophisticated ones; developing accessory techniques that ensure effective performance of the approach. In (Sanda Harabagiu et al., 2000) the term \"definition patterns\" was introduced as \"associated with questions that inquire about definitions\". This kind of patterns was widely used by our QA system, although in many cases they were effective in combination with some additional indicators (see section \"How patterns work\"). It is also noteworthy that we did not confine the use of these patterns to questions inquiring about definitions. We assume, in general, that there should not be one-to-one correspondence between a given pattern and a question type. The same pattern can be applicable in answering many types of questions (getting a different score for each question type). The Library of Indicative Patterns The indicative patterns used by our QA system are sequences or combinations of certain string elements, such as letters, punctuation marks, spaces, tokens (such as \"&\", \"%\", or \"$\"), digits, and words/phrases that are accumulated in special lists (see Fig. 1). Fig. 1. The general approach The way we defined indicative patterns is totally heuristic and inductive. At the initial stage the indicative patterns lists are accumulated basing on expressions that can be interpreted as answers to the questions of a definite type. For example: \"Milan, Italy\" present in any text passage can be considered (completely independently from the whole sense of the passage) as an answer to the question \"Where is Milan\". So, a pattern for the \"Where\" question type may be created: \"city name; comma; country name\". The string \"Mozart (1756-1791)\" contains answers to the questions about Mozart's birth and death dates, allowing construction of the pattern: \"a person's name; parenthesis; four digits; dash; four digits; parenthesis \". We studied texts systematically with the purpose of identifying expressions that may serve as models for answer patterns. Some patterns components can be used for searching more complex structure patterns. The validity of a pattern for a given question type (and its score) can be tested in large text corpora. The library of patterns can never be complete. Identifying patterns while studying text corpora is a research field by itself, accumulating special knowledge on cooccurencies of text elements (characters, strings, as well as definite classes of characters and strings). So, it can be found that the string \"Mr. \" at a certain frequency level precedes one or two capitalized words, and the string \"Jr.\" follows such words, etc. Thus, we can accumulate the knowledge on \"typical\" combinations and correlations of strings that correspond to personal names, to a persons age, to locations, dates, activities, etc. This requires the use of sophisticated tools and special methods. This knowledge area can become important not only for QA, but also for other text retrieval tasks. For example, we use such methodology for extracting and ordering of sentences resulting in a coherent description of the requested subject. The Structure of Indicative Patterns A pattern may include a constant part and a variable part. The latter can be represented by a query term or even an unknown term (the answer word/phrase proper that occupies a definite position in the sequence of pattern elements). We distinguish between two pattern categories: the first represents a complete structure while the second is a composite structure of specific pattern elements (see above). For TREC-10 we had prepared 51 lists of various patterns elements; for each question category 5 15 of such lists were applied for recognition of potential answers (see Fig. 2)."

We analyse the approximately 130 definitional questions in the TREC10 corpus with respect to our technique of Virtual Annotation (VA), which has previously been shown to be effective on the TREC9 definitional question set and other questions. We discover that VA is effective on a subset of the TREC10 definitional questions, but that some of these questions seem to need a user model to generate correct answers, or at least answers that agree with the NIST judges. Furthermore, there remains a large enough subset of definitional questions that cannot benefit at all from the WordNet isa-hierarchy, prompting the need to investigate alternative external resources."

In the QA track, our QA system (SiteQ) has general architecture with three processing steps: question processing, passage selection and answer processing. The key technique is LSP's (Lexico-Semantic Patterns) that are composed of linguistic entries and semantic types. LSP grammars constructed from various resources are used for answer type determination and answer matching. We also adapt AAD (Abbreviafion-Appositive-Definition) processing for the queries that answer type cannot be determined or expected, encyclopedia search for increasing the matching coverage between query terms and passages, and pivot detection for the distance calculation with answer candidates. We used two-level answer types consisted of 18 upper-level types and 47 lower-level types. Semantic category dictionary, WordNet, POS combined with lexicography and a stemmer were all applied to construct the LSP knowledge base. CSMT (Category Sense-code Mapping Table) fried to find answer types using the matching between semantic categories and sense-codes from WordNet. Evaluation shows that MRR for 492 questions is 0.320 (strict), which is considerably higher than the average MRR of other 67 runs.- In the Web track, we focused on the effectiveness of both noun phrase extraction and our new PRF (Pseudo Relevance Feedback). We confirmed that our query expansion using PRF with TSV function adapting TF factor contributed to better performance, but noun phrases did not contribute much. It needs more observations for us to make elaborate rules of tag patterns for the construction of better noun phrases."

AutoSlog-TS is based on the AutoSlog system, which generated extraction patterns using annotated text and a set of heuristic rules. By adapting AutoSlog and combining it with statistical techniques, we eliminated its dependency on tagged text. In experiments with the MUG-4 terrorism domain, AutoSlog-TS created a dictionary of extraction patterns that performed comparably to a dictionary created by AutoSlog, using only preclassified texts as input."

Weiner was the first to show that suffix trees can be built in linear time, and his method is presented both for its historical importance and for some different technical ideas that it contains. However, lJkkonen\u2019s method is equally fast and uses far less space (i.e., memory) in practice than Weiner\u2019s method Hence Ukkonen is the method of choice for most problems requiring the construction of a suffix tree. We also believe that Ukkonen\u2019s method is easier to understand. Therefore, it will be presented first A reader who wishes to study only one method is advised to concentrate on it. However, our development of Weiner\u2019s method does not depend on understanding Ukkonen\u2019s algorithm, and the two algorithms can be read independently (with one small shared section noted in the description of Weiner\u2019s method)."
