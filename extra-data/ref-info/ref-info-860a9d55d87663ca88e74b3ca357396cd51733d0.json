Visual recognition algorithms learn models from a set of training examples. Generative models learn their representations by considering data from a single class. Generative models are popular in computer vision for many reasons, including their ability to elegantly incorporate prior knowledge and to handle correspondences between object parts and detected features. However, generative models are often inferior to discriminative models during classification tasks. We study a discriminative approach to learning object categories which maintains the representational power of generative learning, but trains the generative models in a discriminative manner. The discriminatively trained models perform better during classification tasks as a result of selecting discriminative sets of features. We conclude by proposing a multi-class object recognition system which initially trains object classes in a generative manner, identifies subsets of similar classes with high confusion, and finally trains models for these subsets in a discriminative manner to realize gains in classification performance."

Typically, one fits a model by maximizing the likelihood of the part labels. Alternatively, one could fit a model such that, when the model is run on the training images, it finds the parts. We do this by maximizing the conditional likelihood of the training data. We formulate model-learning as parameter estimation in a conditional random field (CRF). Initializing parameters with their maximum likelihood estimates, we reach the global optimum by gradient ascent. We present a learning algorithm that searches exhaustively over all part locations in an image without relying on feature detectors. This provides millions of examples of training data, and seems to avoid over-fitting issues known with CRFs. Results for part localization are relatively scarce in the community. We present results on three established datasets; Caltech motorbikes [8], USC people [19], and Weizmann horses [3]. In the Caltech set we significantly outperform the state-of-the-art [6]. For the challenging people dataset, we present results that are comparable to [19], but are obtained using a significantly more generic model (devoid of a face or skin detector). Our model is general enough to find other articulated objects; we use it to recover poses of horses in the challenging Weizmann database."

This method learns both a model of local part appearance and a model of the spatial relations between those parts. In contrast, other work using such a weakly supervised learning paradigm has not considered the problem of simultaneously learning appearance and spatial models. Some of these methods use a \u201cbag\u201d model where only part appearance is considered whereas other methods learn spatial models but only given the output of a particular feature detector. Previous techniques for learning both part appearance and spatial relations have instead used a highly supervised learning process that provides substantial information about object part location. We show that our weakly supervised technique produces better results than these previous highly supervised methods. Moreover, we investigate the degree to which both richer spatial models and richer appearance models are helpful in improving recognition performance. Our results show that while both spatial and appearance information can be useful, the effect on performance depends substantially on the particular object class and on the difficulty of the test dataset."

Scanning-window template classifiers are the current state-of-the-art for many object classes such as faces, cars, and pedestrians. Such approaches, though quite successful, can be hindered by their lack of explicit encoding of object shape/structure - one might, for example, find faces in trees. We adopt the following strategy; we first use these systems as attention mechanisms, generating many possible object locations by tuning them for low missed-detections and high false-positives. At each hypothesized detection, we compute a local figure-ground segmentation using a window of slightly larger extent than that used by the classifier. This segmentation task is guided by top-down knowledge. We learn offline from training data those segmentations that are consistent with true positives. We then prune away those hypotheses with bad segmentations. We show this strategy leads to significant improvements (10-20%) over established approaches such as ViolaJones and DalalTriggs on a variety of benchmark datasets including the PASCAL challenge, LabelMe, and the INRIAPerson dataset."

The data consists of binary oriented edge features, robust to photometric variation and small local deformations. The template is defined in terms of probability arrays for each edge type. A primary contribution of this paper is the definition of the instantiation of an object in terms of shifts of a moderate number local submodels\u2014parts\u2014which are subsequently recombined using a patchwork operation, to define a coherent statistical model of the data. Object classes are modeled as mixtures of patchwork of parts POP models that are discovered sequentially as more class data is observed. We define the notion of the support associated to an instantiation, and use this to formulate statistical models for multi-object configurations including possible occlusions. All decisions on the labeling of the objects in the image are based on comparing likelihoods. The combination of a deformable model with an efficient estimation procedure yields competitive results in a variety of applications with very small training sets, without need to train decision boundaries\u2014only data from the class being trained is used. Experiments are presented on the MNIST database, reading zipcodes, and face detection."

We show how to find people by finding candidate body segments, and then constructing assemblies of segments that are consistent with the constraints on the appearance of a person that result from kinematic properties. Since a reasonable model of a person requires at least nine segments, it is not possible to inspect every group, due to the huge combinatorial complexity.We propose two approaches to this problem. In one, the search can be pruned by using projected versions of a classifier that accepts groups corresponding to people. We describe an efficient projection algorithm for one popular classifier, and demonstrate that our approach can be used to determine whether images of real scenes contain people.The second approach employs a probabilistic framework, so that we can draw samples of assemblies, with probabilities proportional to their likelihood, which allows to draw human-like assemblies more often than the non-person ones. The main performance problem is in segmentation of images, but the overall results of both approaches on real images of people are encouraging."

Objects are modeled as flexible constellations of parts. A probabilistic representation is used for all aspects of the object: shape, appearance, occlusion and relative scale. An entropy-based feature detector is used to select regions and their scale within the image. In learning the parameters of the scale-invariant object model are estimated. This is done using expectation-maximization in a maximum-likelihood setting. In recognition, this model is used in a Bayesian manner to classify images. The flexible nature of the model is demonstrated by excellent results over a range of datasets including geometrically constrained classes (e.g. faces, cars) and flexible objects (such as animals)."

This paper presents a large-scale evaluation of an approach that represents images as distributions (signatures or histograms) of features extracted from a sparse set of keypoint locations and learns a Support Vector Machine classifier with kernels based on two effective measures for comparing distributions, the Earth Mover\u2019s Distance and the \u03c72 distance. We first evaluate the performance of our approach with different keypoint detectors and descriptors, as well as different kernels and classifiers. We then conduct a comparative evaluation with several state-of-the-art recognition methods on four texture and five object databases. On most of these databases, our implementation exceeds the best reported results and achieves comparable performance on the rest. Finally, we investigate the influence of background correlations on recognition performance via extensive tests on the PASCAL database, for which ground-truth object localization information is available. Our experiments demonstrate that image representations based on distributions of local features are surprisingly effective for classification of texture and object images under challenging real-world conditions, including significant intra-class variations and substantial background clutter."

We introduce a simplified model of a deformable object class and derive the optimal detector for this model. However, the optimal detector is not realizable except under special circumstances (independent part positions). A cousin of the optimal detector is developed which uses \u201csoft\u201d part detectors with a probabilistic description of the spatial arrangement of the parts. Spatial arrangements are modeled probabilistically using shape statistics to achieve invariance to translation, rotation, and scaling. Improved recognition performance over methods based on \u201chard\u201d part detectors is demonstrated for the problem of face detection in cluttered scenes."

Our work is motivated by the pictorial structure models introduced by Fischler and Elschlager. The basic idea is to represent an object by a collection of parts arranged in a deformable configuration. The appearance of each part is modeled separately, and the deformable configuration is represented by spring-like connections between pairs of parts. These models allow for qualitative descriptions of visual appearance, and are suitable for generic recognition problems. We address the problem of using pictorial structure models to find instances of an object in an image as well as the problem of learning an object model from training examples, presenting efficient algorithms in both cases. We demonstrate the techniques by learning models that represent faces and human bodies and using the resulting models to locate the corresponding objects in novel images."

We propose a mathematical framework (a \"composition machine\") for constructing probabilistic hierarchical image models, designed to accommodate arbitrary contextual relationships, and we build a demonstration system for reading Massachusetts license plates in an image set collected at Logan Airport. The demonstration system detects and correctly reads more than 98% of the plates, with a negligible rate of false detection. Unlike a formal grammar, the architecture of a composition machine does not exclude the sharing of sub-parts among multiple entities, and does not limit interpretations to single trees (e.g. a scene can have multiple license plates, or no plates at all). In this sense, the architecture is more like a general Bayesian network than a formal grammar. On the other hand, unlike a Bayesian network, the distribution is non-Markovian, and therefore more like a probabilistic context-sensitive grammar. The conceptualization and construction of a composition machine is facilitated by its formulation as the result of a series of non-Markovian perturbations of a \"Markov backbone.\""

To cope with variation in object orientation, the detector uses multiple classifiers, each spanning a different range of orientation. Each of these classifiers determines whether the object is present at a specified size within a fixed-size image window. To find the object at any location and size, these classifiers scan the image exhaustively.Each classifier is based on the statistics of localized parts. Each part is a transform from a subset of wavelet coefficients to a discrete set of values. Such parts are designed to capture various combinations of locality in space, frequency, and orientation. In building each classifier, we gathered the class-conditional statistics of these part values from representative samples of object and non-object images. We trained each classifier to minimize classification error on the training set by using Adaboost with Confidence-Weighted Predictions (Shapire and Singer, 1999). In detection, each classifier computes the part values within the image window and looks up their associated class-conditional probabilities. The classifier then makes a decision by applying a likelihood ratio test. For efficiency, the classifier evaluates this likelihood ratio in stages. At each stage, the classifier compares the partial likelihood ratio to a threshold and makes a decision about whether to cease evaluation\u2014labeling the input as non-object\u2014or to continue further evaluation. The detector orders these stages of evaluation from a low-resolution to a high-resolution search of the image. Our trainable object detector achieves reliable and efficient detection of human faces and passenger cars with out-of-plane rotation."

These models provide a way of relating different spatial priors that have been used for recognizing generic classes of objects, including joint Gaussian models and tree-structured models. By providing explicit control over the degree of spatial structure, our models make it possible to study the extent to which additional spatial constraints among parts are actually helpful in detection and localization, and to consider the tradeoff in representational power and computational cost. We consider these questions for object classes that have substantial geometric structure, such as airplanes, faces and motorbikes, using datasets employed by other researchers to facilitate evaluation. We find that for these classes of objects, a relatively small amount of spatial structure in the model can provide statistically indistinguishable recognition performance from more powerful models, and at a substantially lower computational cost."

Despite the fact that this type of problem is well understood, there are many issues to be considered in designing an SVM learner. In particular, for large learning tasks with many training examples on the shelf optimization techniques for general quadratic programs quickly become intractable in their memory and time requirements. SVM light is an implementation of an SVM learner which addresses the problem of large tasks.

After reviewing existing edge and gradient based descriptors, we show experimentally that grids of histograms of oriented gradient (HOG) descriptors significantly outperform existing feature sets for human detection. We study the influence of each stage of the computation on performance, concluding that fine-scale gradients, fine orientation binning, relatively coarse spatial binning, and high-quality local contrast normalization in overlapping descriptor blocks are all important for good results. The new approach gives near-perfect separation on the original MIT pedestrian database, so we introduce a more challenging dataset containing over 1800 annotated human images with a large range of pose variations and backgrounds."

We also describe a new algorithm that searches for lightest derivations using a hierarchy of abstractions. Our generalization of A* gives a new algorithm for searching AND/OR graphs in a bottom-up fashion. \n \nWe discuss how the algorithms described here provide a general architecture for addressing the pipeline problem -- the problem of passing information back and forth between various stages of processing in a perceptual system. We consider examples in computer vision and natural language processing. We apply the hierarchical search algorithm to the problem of estimating the boundaries of convex objects in grayscale images and compare it to other search methods.

Its advantages include improved classification performance, accurate detection and localization of object parts and sub-parts, and explicitly identifying the different appearances of each object part. The semantic hierarchy algorithm starts by constructing a minimal feature hierarchy and proceeds by adding semantically equivalent representatives to each node, using the entire hierarchy as a context for determining the identity and locations of added features. Part detection is obtained by a bottom-up top-down cycle. Unlike previous approaches, the semantic hierarchy learns to represent the set of possible appearances of object parts at all levels, and their statistical dependencies. The algorithm is fully automatic and is shown experimentally to substantially improve the recognition of objects and their parts."

Inference consists in clamping the value of observed variables and finding config urations of the remaining variables that minimize the energy. Learning consists in finding an energy function in which observed configurations of the variables a re given lower energies than unobserved ones. The EBM approach provides a common theoretical framework for many learning models, including traditional discr iminative and generative approaches, as well as graph-transformer networks, co nditional random fields, maximum margin Markov networks, and several manifold learning methods. Probabilistic models must be properly normalized, which sometimes requires evaluating intractable integrals over the space of all poss ible variable configurations. Since EBMs have no requirement for proper normalization, this problem is naturally circumvented. EBMs can be viewed as a form of non-probabilistic factor graphs, and they provide considerably more flexibility in th e design of architectures and training criteria than probabilistic approaches ."

                "text": "Machine learning develops intelligent computer systems that are able to generalize from previously seen examples. A new domain of machine learning, in which the prediction must satisfy the additional constraints found in structured data, poses one of machine learning's greatest challenges: learning functional dependencies between arbitrary input and output domains. This volume presents and analyzes the state of the art in machine learning algorithms and theory in this novel field. The contributors discuss applications as diverse as machine translation, document markup, computational biology, and information extraction, among others, providing a timely overview of an exciting field.

The approach is based on the topological partitioning of the complex structure into several subdomains joined together by interfaces. In analogy with network theory, individual subdomains are characterized via subdomain relations, obtained either analytically or numerically, and described in a unified format by using a generalized network formulation; the various subdomains are linked together via connection relations provided by the complex structure topology. Together these two relations yield the Tableau equations which combine all of the necessary information. The suggested framework accommodates the use of different analytic/numerical methods (hybridization), the choice of problem\u2010matched alternative Green's function representations, as well as different types of field representations. In the present paper, we focus on the general architecture, various options and their implications, in Part II [1] we furnish formal expressions for the subdomain relationships via alternative Green's functions representations; and in part III [2], we discuss the connection network properties.
