This class of neural networks implements a function tau(G, n) isin R m that maps a graph G and one of its nodes n onto an m-dimensional Euclidean space. We characterize the functions that can be approximated by GNNs, in probability, up to any prescribed degree of precision. This set contains the maps that satisfy a property called preservation of the unfolding equivalence, and includes most of the practically useful functions on graphs; the only known exception is when the input graph contains particular patterns of symmetries when unfolding equivalence may not be preserved. The result can be considered an extension of the universal approximation property established for the classic feedforward neural networks (FNNs). Some experimental examples are used to show the computational capabilities of the proposed model."

GNNs can be applied on datasets that contain very general types of graphs and, under mild hypotheses, they have been proven to be universal approximators on graphical domains. Whereas most of the common approaches to graphs processing are based on a preliminary phase that maps each graph onto a simpler data type, like a vector or a sequence of reals, GNNs have the ability to directly process input graphs, thus embedding their connectivity into the processing scheme. In this paper, the main theoretical properties of GNNs are briefly reviewed and they are proposed as a tool for object localization. An experimentation has been carried out on the task of locating the face of a popular Walt Disney character in comic covers. In the dataset the character is shown in a number of different poses, often in cluttered backgrounds, and in high variety of colors. The proposed learning framework provides a way to deal with complex data arising from image segmentation process, without exploiting any prior knowledge on the dataset. The results are very encouraging, prove the viability of the method and the effectiveness of the structural representation of images."

Traditional approaches cope with graphical data structures using a preprocessing phase which transforms the graphs into a set of flat vectors. However, in this way, important topological information may be lost and the achieved results may heavily depend on the preprocessing stage. This paper presents a new neural model, called graph neural network (GNN), capable of directly processing graphs. GNNs extends recursive neural networks and can be applied on most of the practically useful kinds of graphs, including directed, undirected, labelled and cyclic graphs. A learning algorithm for GNNs is proposed and some experiments are discussed which assess the properties of the model."

RNNs and GNNs exploit a similar processing framework, but they can be applied to different input domains. RNNs require the input graphs to be directed and acyclic, whereas GNNs can process any kind of graphs. The aim of this paper consists in understanding whether such a difference affects the behaviour of the models on a real application. An experimental comparison on an image classification problem is presented, showing that GNNs outperforms RNNs. Moreover the main differences between the models are also discussed w.r.t. their input domains, their approximation capabilities and their learning algorithms."

On the other hand, most connectionist models assume that data are organized according to relatively poor structures, like arrays or sequences. The framework described in this paper is an attempt to unify adaptive models like artificial neural nets and belief nets for the problem of processing structured information. In particular, relations between data variables are expressed by directed acyclic graphs, where both numerical and categorical values coexist. The general framework proposed in this paper can be regarded as an extension of both recurrent neural networks and hidden Markov models to the case of acyclic graphs. In particular we study the supervised learning problem as the problem of learning transductions from an input structured space to an output structured space, where transductions are assumed to admit a recursive hidden statespace representation. We introduce a graphical formalism for representing this class of adaptive transductions by means of recursive networks, i.e., cyclic graphs where nodes are labeled by variables and edges are labeled by generalized delay elements. This representation makes it possible to incorporate the symbolic and subsymbolic nature of data. Structures are processed by unfolding the recursive network into an acyclic graph called encoding network. In so doing, inference and learning algorithms can be easily inherited from the corresponding algorithms for artificial neural networks or probabilistic graphical model."

Here we use these principles to derive several specific classes of DAG-RNN architectures based on lattices, trees, and other structured graphs. These architectures can process a wide range of data structures with variable sizes and dimensions. While the overall resulting models remain probabilistic, the internal deterministic dynamics allows efficient propagation of information, as well as training by gradient descent, in order to tackle large-scale problems. These methods are used here to derive state-of-the-art predictors for protein structural features such as secondary structure (1D) and both fine- and coarse-grained contact maps (2D). Extensions, relationships to graphical models, and implications for the design of neural architectures are briefly discussed. The protein prediction servers are available over the Web at: www.igb.uci.edu/tools.htm ."

In fact, feature-based approaches usually fail to give satisfactory solutions because of the sensitivity of the approach to the a priori selection of the features, and the incapacity to represent any specific information on the relationships among the components of the structures. However, we show that neural networks can, in fact, represent and classify structured patterns. The key idea underpinning our approach is the use of the so called \"generalized recursive neuron\", which is essentially a generalization to structures of a recurrent neuron. By using generalized recursive neurons, all the supervised networks developed for the classification of sequences, such as backpropagation through time networks, real-time recurrent networks, simple recurrent networks, recurrent cascade correlation networks, and neural trees can, on the whole, be generalized to structures. The results obtained by some of the above networks (with generalized recursive neurons) on the classification of logic terms are presented."

We first introduce a general paradigm for connectionist learning from graphs that covers both approaches, and situate the approaches in this general paradigm. This gives a first view on how they relate to each other. As RelNNs have been developed with learning aggregate functions in mind, we compare them to GNNs for this specific task. Next, we compare both with other relational learners on a number of benchmark problems (mutagenesis, biodegradability). The results are promising and suggest that RelNNs and GNNs can be a viable approach for learning on relational data. They also point out a number of differences in behavior between both approaches that deserve further study."

We present a connectionist architecture together with a novel supervised learning scheme which is capable of solving inductive inference tasks on complex symbolic structures of arbitrary size. Labeled directed acyclic graphs are the most general structures that can be handled. The processing in this architecture is driven by the inherent recursive nature of the given structures. Our approach can be viewed as a generalization of the well-known discrete-time, continuous-space recurrent neural networks and their corresponding training procedures. We give first results from experiments with inductive learning tasks consisting in the classification of logical terms. These range from the detection of a certain subterm to the satisfaction of complex matching constraints and also capture certain concepts of syntactical variables."

(1998), recursive neural networks can deal only with directed ordered acyclic graphs (DOAGs), in which the children of any given node are ordered. While this assumption is reasonable in some applications, it introduces unnecessary constraints in others. In this paper, it is shown that the constraint on the ordering can be relaxed by using an appropriate weight sharing, that guarantees the independence of the network output with respect to the permutations of the arcs leaving from each node. The method can be used with graphs having low connectivity and, in particular, few outcoming arcs. Some theoretical properties of the proposed architecture are given. They guarantee that the approximation capabilities are maintained, despite the weight sharing."

Here, we propose the first fully unsupervised model, namely an extension of traditional self-organizing maps (SOMs), for the processing of labeled directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). The extension is obtained by using the unfolding procedure adopted in recurrent and recursive neural networks, with the replicated neurons in the unfolded network comprising of a full SOM. This approach enables the discovery of similarities among objects including vectors consisting of numerical data. The capabilities of the model are analyzed in detail by utilizing a relatively large data set taken from an artificial benchmark problem involving visual patterns encoded as labeled DAGs. The experimental results demonstrate clearly that the proposed model is capable of exploiting both information conveyed in the labels attached to each node of the input DAGs and information encoded in the DAG topology."

Recursive CC is a neural network model recently proposed for the processing of structured data. It allows the direct handling of chemical compounds as labeled ordered directed graphs, and constitutes a novel approach to QSAR. The adopted representation of molecular structure captures, in a quite general and flexible way, significant topological aspects and chemical functionalities for each specific class of molecules showing a particular chemical reactivity or biological activity. A class of 1,4-benzodiazepin-2-ones is analyzed by the proposed approach. It compares favorably versus the traditional QSAR treatment based on equations. To show the ability of the model in capturing most of the structural features that account for the biological activity, the internal representations developed by the networks are analyzed by principal component analysis. This analysis shows that the networks are able to discover relevant structural features just on the basis of the association between the molecular morphology and the target property (affinity)."

As a result several kernel functions over these complex structures have been proposed in the literature so far. Most of them exploit the Cross Product Kernel between two sets resulting from the decompositions of corresponding graphs into subgraphs of a specific type. The similarities between the substructures are often computed using the 0 \u2212 1 Kronecker Delta Kernel. This approach has two main limitations: (i) in general most of the subgraphs will be poorly correlated with the actual target variable, adversely affecting the generalization of a classifier and (ii) as no graded similarities on subparts are computed, the expressivity of the resulting kernels is reduced. To tackle the above problems we propose here a class of graph kernels based on set distance measures whose computation is based on specific pairs of points from the corresponding graph decompositions. The actual matching of elements from the two sets depends on a graded similarity (standard Euclidean metric in our case) between the elements of the two sets. To make our similarity measure positive semidefinite we exploit the notion of the proximity space induced by a given set distance measure. To practically demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach we report promising experimental results for the task of activity prediction of drug molecules."

However, these algorithms do not model network connections or relations between entities. Meanwhile, Pagerank and variants find the stationary distribution of a reasonable but arbitrary Markov walk over a network, but do not learn from relevance feedback. We present a framework for ranking networked entities based on Markov walks with parameterized conductance values associated with the network edges. We propose two flavors of conductance learning problems in our framework. In the first setting, relevance feedback comparing node-pairs hints that the user has one or more hidden preferred communities with large edge conductance, and the algorithm must discover these communities. We present a constrained maximum entropy network flow formulation whose dual can be solved efficiently using a cutting-plane approach and a quasi-Newton optimizer. In the second setting, edges have types, and relevance feedback hints that each edge type has a potentially different conductance, but this is fixed across the whole network. Our algorithm learns the conductances using an approximate Newton method."

Like neural networks, they are large-scale nonlinear circuits which process signals in real time. Like cellular automata, they are made of a massive aggregate of regularly spaced circuit clones, called cells, which communicate with each other directly only through their nearest neighbors. Some applications in such areas as image processing are demonstrated, albeit with only a crude circuit. In particular, examples of cellular neural networks which can be designed to recognize the key features of Chinese characters are presented. Some theorems concerning the dynamic range and the steady states of cellular neural networks are proved. In view of the near-neighbor interactive property of cellular neural networks, they are much more amenable to VLSI implementation than general neural networks.<<ETX>>"

The FA is a recurrent neural network architecture which is especially suited for adaptive structure processing, i.e. learning approximations of mappings from symbolic term structures to IR n. The main objective of this paper is to demonstrate that the FA can be successfully applied to approximate quantitative structure activity relationships (QSARs), which play an important role during a drug design process. Several approaches for the conversion of a QSAR problem to suitable learning tasks for the FA are presented. Finally the FA is applied to a well-known QSAR benchmark, viz. the inhibition of E. coli dihydrofolate reductase by triazines. The achieved results are compared with results of other machine learning approaches on the same QSAR benchmark, and prove that the FA is signiicantly better. activity relationships, inhibition of E. coli dihydrofolate reductase by triazines."

They enable the application of kernel methods, such as support vector machines, to the analysis and classification of graphs, for example, chemical compounds. These graph kernels are obtained by marginalizing a kernel between paths with respect to a random walk model on the graph vertices along the edges. We propose two extensions of these graph kernels, with the double goal to reduce their computation time and increase their relevance as measure of similarity between graphs. First, we propose to modify the label of each vertex by automatically adding information about its environment with the use of the Morgan algorithm. Second, we suggest a modification of the random walk model to prevent the walk from coming back to a vertex that was just visited. These extensions are then tested on benchmark experiments of chemical compounds classification, with promising results."

A dynamic route approach for analyzing the local dynamics of this class of neural circuits is used to steer the system trajectories into various stable equilibrium configurations which map onto binary patterns to be recognized. Some applications of cellular neural networks to such areas as image processing and pattern recognition are demonstrated, albeit with only a crude circuit. In particular, examples of cellular neural networks which can be designed to recognize the key features of Chinese characters are presented. >"

However, as observed in most neural network implementations, tuning all the parameters of the networks may cause learning complicated and inefficient, and it may be difficult to train networks with nondifferential activation functions such as threshold networks. Unlike conventional neural network theories, this paper proves in an incremental constructive method that in order to let SLFNs work as universal approximators, one may simply randomly choose hidden nodes and then only need to adjust the output weights linking the hidden layer and the output layer. In such SLFNs implementations, the activation functions for additive nodes can be any bounded nonconstant piecewise continuous functions g : R --> R and the activation functions for RBF nodes can be any integrable piecewise continuous functions g : R --> R and integral of R g(x)dx not equal to 0. The proposed incremental method is efficient not only for SFLNs with continuous (including nondifferentiable) activation functions but also for SLFNs with piecewise continuous (such as threshold) activation functions. Compared to other popular methods such a new network is fully automatic and users need not intervene the learning process by manually tuning control parameters."

Several distinct, and complementary modelling techniques are being explored. Firstly, work is being conducted on applying Support-Vector ILP (SVILP) as an accurate means of screening high-toxicity molecules. Secondly, Bayes' networks have been machine-learned to provide causal maps of the effects of toxins on the network of metabolic reactions within cells. The data were derived from a study on the effects of hydrazine toxicity in rats. Although the resultant network can be partly explained in terms of existing KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) pathway descriptions, several of the strong dependencies in the Bayes' network involve metabolite pairs with high separation in KEGG. Thirdly, in a complementary study KEGG pathways are being used as background knowledge for explaining the same data using a model constructed using Abductive ILP, a logic-based machine learning technique. With a binary prediction model (up/down regulation) cross validation results show that even with a restricted number of observed metabolites high predictive accuracy (80-90%) is achieved on unseen metabolite concentrations. Further increases in accuracy are achieved by allowing discovery of general rules from additional literature data on hydrazine inhibition. Ongoing work is aimed at formulating probabilistic logic models which combine the learned Bayes' network and ILP models."

Instead of just adjusting the weights in a network of fixed topology. Cascade-Correlation begins with a minimal network, then automatically trains and adds new hidden units one by one, creating a multi-layer structure. Once a new hidden unit has been added to the network, its input-side weights are frozen. This unit then becomes a permanent feature-detector in the network, available for producing outputs or for creating other, more complex feature detectors. The Cascade-Correlation architecture has several advantages over existing algorithms: it learns very quickly, the network determines its own size and topology, it retains the structures it has built even if the training set changes, and it requires no back-propagation of error signals through the connections of the network."

Interest in SSL has increased in recent years, particularly because of application domains in which unlabeled data are plentiful, such as images, text, and bioinformatics. This first comprehensive overview of SSL presents state-of-the-art algorithms, a taxonomy of the field, selected applications, benchmark experiments, and perspectives on ongoing and future research. Semi-Supervised Learning first presents the key assumptions and ideas underlying the field: smoothness, cluster or low-density separation, manifold structure, and transduction. The core of the book is the presentation of SSL methods, organized according to algorithmic strategies. After an examination of generative models, the book describes algorithms that implement the low-density separation assumption, graph-based methods, and algorithms that perform two-step learning. The book then discusses SSL applications and offers guidelines for SSL practitioners by analyzing the results of extensive benchmark experiments. Finally, the book looks at interesting directions for SSL research. The book closes with a discussion of the relationship between semi-supervised learning and transduction.

At first, logo images are converted into a structured representation based on contour trees. Recursive neural networks are then learnt using the contourtrees as inputs to the neural nets. On the other hand, the contour-tree is constructed by associating a node with each exterior or interior contour extracted from the logo instance. Nodes in the tree are labeled by a feature vector, which describes the contour by means of its perimeter, surrounded area, and a synthetic representation of its curvature plot. The contour-tree representation contains the topological structured information of logo and continuous values pertaining to each contour node. Hence symbolic and sub-symbolic information coexist in the contour-tree representation of logo image. Experimental results are reported on 40 real logos distorted with artificial noise and performance of recursive neural network is compared with another two types of neural approaches."

In this tutorial paper, we give an overview about extensions of pattern recognition towards non-standard data which are not contained in a finite dimensional space, such as strings, sequences, trees, graphs, or functions. Two major directions can be distinguished in the neural networks literature: models can be based on a similarity measure adapted to non-standard data, including kernel methods for structures as a very prominent approach, but also alternative metric based algorithms and functional networks; alternatively, non-standard data can be processed recursively within supervised and unsupervised recurrent and recursive networks and fully recurrent systems."

Then, we show how the first order derivatives of squared error function with respect to the weights can be derived using a variational approach, resulting in what is commonly known as real time recurrent learning algorithms. We have also indicated how the backprop through time algorithm can be derived. We have shown how second order training algorithms, those based on Newton methods, and those based on recursive method can be obtained."

It is the union of inductive logic programming, (statistical) relational learning and multi-relational data mining and constitutes a general class of techniques and methodology for learning from structured data (such as graphs, networks, relational databases) and background knowledge. During the course of its existence, logical and relational learning has changed dramatically. Whereas early work was mainly concerned with logical issues (and even program synthesis from examples), in the 90s its focus was on the discovery of new and interpretable knowledge from structured data, often in the form of rules or patterns. Since then the range of tasks to which logical and relational learning has been applied has significantly broadened and now covers almost all machine learning problems and settings. Today, there exist logical and relational learning methods for reinforcement learning, statistical learning, distance- and kernel-based learning in addition to traditional symbolic machine learning approaches. At the same time, logical and relational learning problems are appearing everywhere. Advances in intelligent systems are enabling the generation of high-level symbolic and structured data in a wide variety of domains, including the semantic web, robotics, vision, social networks, and the life sciences, which in turn raises new challenges and opportunities for logical and relational learning. These developments have led to a new view on logical and relational learning and its role in machine learning and artificial intelligence. In this talk, I shall reflect on this view by identifying some of the lessons learned in logical and relational learning and formulating some challenges for future developments."

In the field of Natural Language Processing, feature extraction consists of the following two steps: (1) syntactically and semantically analyzing raw data, i.e., character strings, then representing the results as discrete structures, such as parse trees and dependency graphs with part-of-speech tags; (2) creating (possibly high-dimensional) numerical feature vectors from the discrete structures. The new kernels, called Hierarchical Directed Acyclic Graph (HDAG) kernels, directly accept DAGs whose nodes can contain DAGs. HDAG data structures are needed to fully reflect the syntactic and semantic structures that natural language data inherently have. In this paper, we define the kernel function and show how it permits efficient calculation. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed kernels are superior to existing kernel functions, e.g., sequence kernels, tree kernels, and bag-of-words kernels."

Like neural networks, they are large-scale nonlinear analog circuits that process signals in real time. Like cellular automata, they consist of a massive aggregate of regularly spaced circuit clones, called cells, which communicate with each other directly only through their nearest neighbors. Each cell is made of a linear capacitor, a nonlinear voltage-controlled current source, and a few resistive linear circuit elements. Cellular neural networks share the best features of both worlds: their continuous-time feature allows real-time signal processing, and their local interconnection feature makes them particularly adapted for VLSI implementation. Cellular neural networks are uniquely suited for high-speed parallel signal processing. >"

This paper introduces a novel technique, combining Discourse Representation Theory (DRT) with Recursive Neural Networks (RNN) in order to yield a neural model capable to discover properties and relationships among constituents of a knowledge-base expressed by natural language sentences. DRT transforms sequences of sentences into directed ordered acyclic graphs, while RNNs are trained to deal with such structured data. The acquired information allows the network to reply on questions, the answers of which are not directly expressed into the knowledge-base. A simple experimental demonstration, drawn from the context of a fairy tales is presented. Finally, on-going research direction are pointed-out."

We propose to formalize a scene (consisting of a set of objects with various properties and relations) as a labeled directed graph and describe content selection (which properties to include in a referring expression) as a subgraph construction problem. Cost functions are used to guide the search process and to give preference to some solutions over others. The current approach has four main advantages: (1) Graph structures have been studied extensively, and by moving to a graph perspective we get direct access to the many theories and algorithms for dealing with graphs; (2) many existing generation algorithms can be reformulated in terms of graphs, and this enhances comparison and integration of the various approaches; (3) the graph perspective allows us to solve a number of problems that have plagued earlier algorithms for the generation of referring expressions; and (4) the combined use of graphs and cost functions paves the way for an integration of rule-based generation techniques with more recent stochastic approaches."

The physical meaning of content-addressable memory is described by an appropriate phase space flow of the state of a system. A model of such a system is given, based on aspects of neurobiology but readily adapted to integrated circuits. The collective properties of this model produce a content-addressable memory which correctly yields an entire memory from any subpart of sufficient size. The algorithm for the time evolution of the state of the system is based on asynchronous parallel processing. Additional emergent collective properties include some capacity for generalization, familiarity recognition, categorization, error correction, and time sequence retention. The collective properties are only weakly sensitive to details of the modeling or the failure of individual devices."

Several problems concerning the presence of faces in images, including face recognition, pose estimation, and expression recognition have focused the research efforts in the last few years. Moreover, those problems are usually solved having assumed that the face was previously localized, often via heuristics based on prototypes of the whole face or significant details. Therefore, each fully automated system, which is able to analyze the information contained in images of faces, requires an efficient face localization method. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to the solution of the face localization problem using recursive neural networks. In particular, the proposed approach assumes a graph\u2013based representation of images that combines structural and sub\u2013symbolic visual features. Each image is represented by a forest of trees. Such trees are then processed by recursive neural networks, in order to establish the eventual presence and the position of faces inside the image. Some preliminary experiments on snapshots from video sequences are reported, showing very promising results."

We propose a general method for constructing a kernel following the syntactic structure of the data, as defined by its type signature in a higher-order logic. Our main theoretical result is the positive definiteness of any kernel thus defined. We report encouraging experimental results on a range of real-world data sets. By converting our kernel to a distance pseudo-metric for 1-nearest neighbour, we were able to improve the best accuracy from the literature on the Diterpene data set by more than 10%."

This paper discusses this issue of convolution kernels, and then proposes a new approach based on statistical feature selection that avoids this issue. To enable the proposed method to be executed efficiently, it is embedded into an original kernel calculation process by using sub-structure mining algorithms. Experiments are undertaken on real NLP tasks to confirm the problem with a conventional method and to compare its performance with that of the proposed method."

In particular, it details the application of the ILP system Progol to discovering structural features that can result in mutagenicity in small molecules. To discover these concepts, Progol only had access to the atomic and bond structure of the molecules. With such a primitive description and no further assistance from chemists, Progol corroborated some existing knowledge and proposed a new structural alert for mutagenicity in compounds. In the process, the experiments act as a case study in which, even with extremely limited background knowledge, an Inductive Logic Programming tool rstly, complements a complex statistical model developed by skilled chemists, and secondly, continues to provide understandable theories when the statistical model fails. The experiments also constitute the rst demonstrations of a prototype of the Progol system. Progol allows the construction of hypotheses with bounded non-determinacy by performing a best-rst search within the subsumption lattice. The results here provide evidence that such searches are both viable and desirable."

For more refined searches, this global notion of importance can be specialized to create personalized views of importance--for example, importance scores can be biased according to a user-specified set of initially-interesting pages. Computing and storing all possible personalized views in advance is impractical, as is computing personalized views at query time, since the computation of each view requires an iterative computation over the web graph. We present new graph-theoretical results, and a new technique based on these results, that encode personalized views as partial vectors. Partial vectors are shared across multiple personalized views, and their computation and storage costs scale well with the number of views. Our approach enables incremental computation, so that the construction of personalized views from partial vectors is practical at query time. We present efficient dynamic programming algorithms for computing partial vectors, an algorithm for constructing personalized views from partial vectors, and experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness and scalability of our techniques."

Conditional random fields offer several advantages over hidden Markov models and stochastic grammars for such tasks, including the ability to relax strong independence assumptions made in those models. Conditional random fields also avoid a fundamental limitation of maximum entropy Markov models (MEMMs) and other discriminative Markov models based on directed graphical models, which can be biased towards states with few successor states. We present iterative parameter estimation algorithms for conditional random fields and compare the performance of the resulting models to HMMs and MEMMs on synthetic and natural-language data."

The page rank of a collection of Web pages can be represented in a parameterized model, and the user requirements can be represented by a set of constraints. For a particular parameterization, namely, a linear combination of the page ranks produced by different forcing functions, and user requirements represented by a set of linear constraints, the problem can be solved using a quadratic programming method. The solution to this problem produces a set of parameters which can be used for ranking all pages in the Web. We show that the method is suitable for building customized versions of PageRank which can be readily adapted to the needs of a vertical search engine or that of a single user."

In this paper, we compare up-to-date methods for propositionalization from two main groups: logic-oriented and database-oriented techniques. Experiments using several learning tasks \u2013 both ILP benchmarks and tasks from recent international data mining competitions \u2013 show that both groups have their specific advantages. While logic-oriented methods can handle complex background knowledge and provide expressive first-order models, database-oriented methods can be more efficient especially on larger data sets. Obtained accuracies vary such that a combination of the features produced by both groups seems a further valuable venture."

To yield more accurate search results, we propose computing a set of PageRank vectors, biased using a set of representative topics, to capture more accurately the notion of importance with respect to a particular topic. By using these (precomputed) biased PageRank vectors to generate query-specific importance scores for pages at query time, we show that we can generate more accurate rankings than with a single, generic PageRank vector. For ordinary keyword search queries, we compute the topic-sensitive PageRank scores for pages satisfying the query using the topic of the query keywords. For searches done in context (e.g., when the search query is performed by highlighting words in a Web page), we compute the topic-sensitive PageRank scores using the topic of the context in which the query appeared."

To yield more accurate search results, we propose computing a set of PageRank vectors, biased using a set of representative topics, to capture more accurately the notion of importance with respect to a particular topic. For ordinary keyword search queries, we compute the topic-sensitive PageRank scores for pages satisfying the query using the topic of the query keywords. For searches done in context (e.g., when the search query is performed by highlighting words in a Web page), we compute the topic-sensitive PageRank scores using the topic of the context in which the query appeared. By using linear combinations of these (precomputed) biased PageRank vectors to generate context-specific importance scores for pages at query time, we show that we can generate more accurate rankings than with a single, generic PageRank vector. We describe techniques for efficiently implementing a large-scale search system based on the topic-sensitive PageRank scheme."

GEVOL extracts information about a Java program stored within a CVS version control system and displays it using a temporal graph visualizer. This information can be used by programmers to understand the evolution of a legacy program: Why is the program structured the way it is? Which programmers were responsible for which parts of the program during which time periods? Which parts of the program appear unstable over long periods of time and may need to be rewritten? This type of information will complement that produced by more static tools such as source code browsers, slicers, and static analyzers."

From the data, a quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) has been derived for 188 congeners. The main determinants of mutagenicity are the hydrophobicity (modeled by octanol/water partition coefficients) and the energies of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals calculated using the AM1 method. It is also shown that chemicals possessing three or more fused rings possess much greater mutagenic potency than compounds with one or two fused rings. Since the QSAR is based on a very wide range in structural variation, aromatic rings from benzene to coronene are included as well as many different types of heterocycles, it is a significant step toward a predictive toxicology of value in the design of less mutagenic bioactive compounds."

Ranking schemes for horizontal search like the PageRank algorithm used by Google operate on the topology of the graph, regardless of the page content. On the other hand, the recent development of vertical portals (vortals) makes it useful to adopt scoring systems focussed on the topic and taking the page content into account.In this paper, we propose a general framework for Web Page Scoring Systems (WPSS) which incorporates and extends many of the relevant models proposed in the literature. Finally, experimental results are given to assess the features of the proposed scoring systems with special emphasis on vertical search."
