While there have been many successful attempts to address these problems in application-specific settings, we believe that underlying a large set of problems in vision is a representational deficiency of intensity-derived local measurements that are the basis of most efficient models. We argue that interesting structure in images is better captured when the image is defined as a matrix whose entries are discrete indices to a separate palette of possible intensities, colors or other features, much like the image representation often used to save on storage. In order to model the variability in images, we define an image class not by a single index map, but by a probability distribution over the index maps, which can be automatically estimated from the data, and which we call probabilistic index maps. The existing algorithms can be adapted to work with this representation, as we illustrate in this paper on the example of transformation-invariant clustering and background subtraction. Furthermore, the probabilistic index map representation leads to algorithms with computational costs proportional to either the size of the palette or the log of the size of the palette, making the cost of significantly increased invariance to non-structural changes quite bearable."

Compact and yet discriminative appearance-based object class models are automatically learned from a set of training images. The method is simple and extremely fast, making it suitable for many applications such as semantic image retrieval, Web search, and interactive image editing. It classifies a region according to the proportions of different visual words (clusters in feature space). The specific visual words and the typical proportions in each object are learned from a segmented training set. The main contribution of this paper is twofold: i) an optimally compact visual dictionary is learned by pair-wise merging of visual words from an initially large dictionary. The final visual words are described by GMMs. ii) A novel statistical measure of discrimination is proposed which is optimized by each merge operation. High classification accuracy is demonstrated for nine object classes on photographs of real objects viewed under general lighting conditions, poses and viewpoints. The set of test images used for validation comprise: i) photographs acquired by us, ii) images from the Web and iii) images from the recently released Pascal dataset. The proposed algorithm performs well on both texture-rich objects (e.g. grass, sky, trees) and structure-rich ones (e.g. cars, bikes, planes)"

We introduce LOCUS (learning object classes with unsupervised segmentation) which uses a generative probabilistic model to combine bottom-up cues of color and edge with top-down cues of shape and pose. A key aspect of this model is that the object appearance is allowed to vary from image to image, allowing for significant within-class variation. By iteratively updating the belief in the object's position, size, segmentation and pose, LOCUS avoids making hard decisions about any of these quantities and so allows for each to be refined at any stage. We show that LOCUS successfully learns an object class model from unlabeled images, whilst also giving segmentation accuracies that rival existing supervised methods. Finally, we demonstrate simultaneous recognition and segmentation in novel images using the learned models for a number of object classes, as well as unsupervised object discovery and tracking in video."

Objects are modeled as flexible constellations of parts. A probabilistic representation is used for all aspects of the object: shape, appearance, occlusion and relative scale. An entropy-based feature detector is used to select regions and their scale within the image. In learning the parameters of the scale-invariant object model are estimated. This is done using expectation-maximization in a maximum-likelihood setting. In recognition, this model is used in a Bayesian manner to classify images. The flexible nature of the model is demonstrated by excellent results over a range of datasets including geometrically constrained classes (e.g. faces, cars) and flexible objects (such as animals)."

At the feature extraction stage, a sparse set of affine Harris and Laplacian regions is found in the image. Each of these regions can be thought of as a texture element having a characteristic elliptic shape and a distinctive appearance pattern. This pattern is captured in an affine-invariant fashion via a process of shape normalization followed by the computation of two novel descriptors, the spin image and the RIFT descriptor. When affine invariance is not required, the original elliptical shape serves as an additional discriminative feature for texture recognition. The proposed approach is evaluated in retrieval and classification tasks using the entire Brodatz database and a publicly available collection of 1,000 photographs of textured surfaces taken from different viewpoints."

In general, research on color naming applies the following paradigm: a collection of color chips is labelled with color names within a well-defined experimental setup by multiple test subjects. The collected data set is subsequently used to label RGB values in real-world images with a color name. Apart from the fact that this collection process is time consuming, it is unclear to what extent color naming within a controlled setup is representative for color naming in real-world images. Therefore we propose to learn color names from real-world images. Furthermore, we avoid test subjects by using Google Image to collect a data set. Due to limitations of Google Image this data set contains a substantial quantity of wrongly labelled data. The color names are learned using a PLSA model adapted to this task. Experimental results show that color names learned from real-world images significantly outperform color names learned from labelled color chips on retrieval and classification."

We study the influence of each stage of the computation on performance, concluding that fine-scale gradients, fine orientation binning, relatively coarse spatial binning, and high-quality local contrast normalization in overlapping descriptor blocks are all important for good results. The new approach gives near-perfect separation on the original MIT pedestrian database, so we introduce a more challenging dataset containing over 1800 annotated human images with a large range of pose variations and backgrounds."

It is demonstrated that textures can be classified using the joint distribution of intensity values over extremely compact neighborhoods (starting from as small as 3 /spl times/ 3 pixels square), and that this outperforms classification using filter banks with large support. We develop a novel texton based representation, which is suited to modeling this joint neighborhood distribution for MRFs. The representation is learnt from training images, and then used to classify novel images (with unknown viewpoint and lighting) into texture classes. The power of the method is demonstrated by classifying over 2800 images of all 61 textures present in the Columbia-Utrecht database. The classification performance surpasses that of recent state-of-the-art filter bank based classifiers such as Leung & Malik, Cula & Dana, and Varma & Zisserman."
