In general these confusion classes are a substantial source of error in the overall performance of the classifier. A productive way to deal with the problem is to separate these characters and reprocess them further in an independent secondary stage in the framework of a multiple expert configuration. The philosophy is to use multiple classifiers to re-evaluate these relatively difficult characters by treating them as special and specific problem cases. In extending special treatment to these characters, advantage can be taken of distinctive structural features to design tailor-made algorithms suited to a particular problem. Since such classifiers are required to deal only with a limited number of classes, very versatile classifiers can be implemented. The main difficulty of this philosophy is to devise a way to group characters together to make sure that these specialised classifiers receive a stream of input characters which indeed belong to the particular group of characters associated with that particular classifier. The authors present a general philosophy for multi-expert classification and deal with the specific problem of formation of distinctive character streams with a high degree of confidence. It then elaborates on other techniques and variations that can be adopted to make this type of multiple expert configuration more effective."

Four approaches based on different methodologies are proposed for solving this problem. One is suitable for combining individual classifiers such as Bayesian, k-nearest-neighbor, and various distance classifiers. The other three could be used for combining any kind of individual classifiers. On applying these methods to combine several classifiers for recognizing totally unconstrained handwritten numerals, the experimental results show that the performance of individual classifiers can be improved significantly. For example, on the US zipcode database, 98.9% recognition with 0.90% substitution and 0.2% rejection can be obtained, as well as high reliability with 95% recognition, 0% substitution, and 5% rejection. >"

The combination technique uses these rankings to determine a small subset of the set of classes that contains the correct class. A group consensus function is then applied to re-rank the elements in the subset. This methodology is especially suited for recognition systems with large numbers of classes where it is valuable to reduce the decision problem to a manageable size before making a final determination about the identity of the image. Experimentation is discussed in which the proposed method is used with a word recognition problem where 40 classifiers are applied to degraded machine-printed word images and where a typical lexicon contains 235 words. A 96.6% correct rate is achieved within the 10 best decisions for 817 test images."

For the recognizer, they used three representative recognizers: a structural, a statistical, and a neural network approach. They also used three combining methods (a vote, a Bayesian, and BKS) to combine the results obtained from three recognizers. This system is applied to credit card slip recognition. For recognizing printed numerals, the authors use template matching, and for handwritten numerals, a multiple combined system is used. Reliability about 99% was achieved in handwritten numeral recognition and 81% reliability in credit card slip recognition. L. Lam and C. Y. Suen's (1988) standard handwritten numeral data showing high reliability of above 95%.<<ETX>>"

An experimental comparison of various classifier combination schemes demonstrates that the combination rule developed under the most restrictive assumptions-the sum rule-and its derivatives consistently outperform other classifier combinations schemes. A sensitivity analysis of the various schemes to estimation errors is carried out to show that this finding can be justified theoretically."

A tunable, high level k-nearest neighbors decision rule is defined that comprehends most previous generalizations of the common majority rule. A learning procedure is developed that applies to this rule and exploits those statistical features that can be induced from the training set. The overall approach is tested on a problem of handwritten character recognition. Experiments show that adaptivity in the decision rule may improve the recognition and rejection capability of standard k-NN classifiers."

                "text": "ENCORE (ENhanced COnsensus in REcognition) is a new classifier structure based on decision fusion of multiple experts (classifiers). When more than one classifier (expert) is available and it is required to combine their decisions, a fundamental aim may be to incorporate a sense of decision consensus. Alternatively, it may be considered important to ensure that appropriate weights are given to more competent classifiers. These two requirements may be mutually contradictory, as the first aims to ensure giving higher emphasis to the best decision delivered by the majority, while the second aims to ensure finding the most appropriate classifier and then giving higher weight to its decision. A new multiple expert classifier (ENCORE) is introduced which implements a decision consensus approach, but the quality of the consensus is evaluated in terms of the past track record of the consenting experts before it is accepted. The ENCORE system has been found to offer greater flexibility of performance in a character recognition task. Detailed analysis using two different databases illustrates the capabilities of this system, although the structure proposed is generic in nature, and may be readily applied to other task domains."
