The accuracy of an approach has usually been demonstrated experimentally by comparing its results with those obtained by previous schemes. In this contribution we analyze localization properties of existing direct corner detectors by using an analytical model of gray-value corners. For the different approaches we derive implicit equations constraining the corner points and numerically evaluate their locations. Since a gray-value corner is generally defined as the curvature extremum along the edge line, we also compute this position and take it as the reference location for a comparison of the investigated approaches."

We will restrict our search to specific points identified by corners, which are stable given a sequence. Our approach makes us of a model-based corner detector. It matches a part of the image containing a corner against a predefined corner model. Once the fitting is accomplished, the position of the corner in the image can be deduced by the knowledge of the corner position in the image. The validity of our approach has been proven with 4 independent tests. It is shown that the accuracy which can be achieved is 1/10th of a pixel."

Each benchmark consists of a large number of images of a carefully designed scene for which we enforce a constraint on the edges, for example, that they are co-linear. We sample the space of edge appearances as densely as possible by capturing the images under widely varying imaging conditions. Not only do we change the viewing geometry and the illumination direction, but we also vary the camera parameters and the physical properties of the objects in the scene. We show that the degrees to which the constraints hold in the output edge-maps can be used as highly discriminating measures of edge detector performance. The code, images, and results which form our benchmarks are all available from the website http://www.cs.columbia.edu/CAVE/. The code and images enable a user to compare any new detector against several previous ones with minimal effort."

Simpler filters are directly defined in the discrete domain. We define criteria to compare filter performances in the discrete domain. Canny has defined (1983, 1986) three criteria to derive the equation of an optimal filter for step edge detection: good detection, good localization, and low-responses multiplicity. These criteria seem to be good candidates for filter comparison. Unfortunately, they have been developed in the continuous domain, and their analytical expressions cannot be used in the discrete domain. We establish three criteria with the same meaning as Canny's. Some comparisons with experimental results confirm the validity of our approach. This study highlights the existence of two classes of derivative operators that are distinguished by whether or not the impulse response of the filter in continuous space domain is continuous on its center. These classes exhibit very different properties for the second and third criteria. We extend the use of the first and third criteria to the smoothing filters. We also define an optimal continuous filter according to the continuous third criterion and an optimal discrete filter according to the discrete third criterion. We compare the performances of the sampled version of the continuous filter to those of the optimal discrete filter."

Since the locations of centers in an image depend both on the intrinsic parameters of the camera and the relative position and orientation of the object with respect to the camera, the exact positions of corners in an image are generally not known. To circumvent the need for this knowledge, we use sets of points (instead of individual points) extracted from images of polyhedral objects and projective invariants to calculate a manifold of constraints on the coordinates of the corners. We then estimate the variance of the detected corners from the distance of the coordinate vector to this manifold. This is independent of the camera parameters and the relative position and orientation between the camera and the object. Five different kinds of corner extraction schemes are investigated. The purpose of the paper is to show that invariance methods can effectively be used to make this comparison rather than to make a thorough comparison of different corner extraction schemes."

The first step is to extract edges from the original image using a Canny detector (1986). The corner points of an image are defined as points where image edges have their maxima of absolute curvature. The corner points are detected at a high scale of the CSS and tracked through multiple lower scales to improve localization. This method is very robust to noise, and we believe that it performs better than the existing corner detectors An improvement to Canny edge detector's response to 45/spl deg/ and 135/spl deg/ edges is also proposed. Furthermore, the CSS detector can provide additional point features (curvature zero-crossings of image edge contours) in addition to the traditional corners."

The key is to propose some efficient models associated to each of these features directly from the image by searching the parameters of the model that best approximate the observed grey level image intensities. Due to the large amount of time required by a first approach that assumes the blur of the imaging acquisition system to be describable by a 2-D Gaussian filter, different solutions that drastically reduce this computational time are considered and developed. The problem of the initialization phase in the minimization process is considered, and an original and efficient solution is proposed. A large number of experiments involving real images are conducted in order to test and compare the reliability, the robustness, and the efficiency of the proposed approaches.<<ETX>>"

We propose an algorithm to automatically construct detectors for arbitrary parametric features. To maximize robustness we use realistic multi-parameter feature models and incorporate optical and sensing effects. Each feature is represented as a densely sampled parametric manifold in a low dimensional subspace of a Hilbert space. During detection, the vector of intensity values in a window about each pixel in the image is projected into the subspace. If the projection lies sufficiently close to the feature manifold, the feature is detected and the location of the closest manifold point yields the feature parameters. The concepts of parameter reduction by normalization, dimension reduction, pattern rejection, and heuristic search are all employed to achieve the required efficiency. Detectors have been constructed for five features, namely, step edge (five parameters), roof edge (five parameters), line (six parameters), corner (five parameters), and circular disc (six parameters). The results of detailed experiments are presented which demonstrate the robustness of feature detection and the accuracy of parameter estimation."

We present a unified approach to detecting, classifying, and reconstructing junctions in images. Our main contribution is a modeling of the junction which is complex enough to handle all these issues and yet simple enough to admit an effective dynamic programming solution. We use a template deformation framework along with a gradient criterium to detect radial partitions of the template. We use the minimum description length principle to obtain the optimal number of partitions that best describes the junction. The Kona detector presented by Parida et al. (1997) is an implementation of this model. We demonstrate the stability and robustness of the detector by analyzing its behavior in the presence of noise, using synthetic/controlled apparatus. We also present a qualitative study of its behavior on real images."

The success of the approach depends on the definition of a comprehensive set of goals for the computation of edge points. These goals must be precise enough to delimit the desired behavior of the detector while making minimal assumptions about the form of the solution. We define detection and localization criteria for a class of edges, and present mathematical forms for these criteria as functionals on the operator impulse response. A third criterion is then added to ensure that the detector has only one response to a single edge. We use the criteria in numerical optimization to derive detectors for several common image features, including step edges. On specializing the analysis to step edges, we find that there is a natural uncertainty principle between detection and localization performance, which are the two main goals. With this principle we derive a single operator shape which is optimal at any scale. The optimal detector has a simple approximate implementation in which edges are marked at maxima in gradient magnitude of a Gaussian-smoothed image. We extend this simple detector using operators of several widths to cope with different signal-to-noise ratios in the image. We present a general method, called feature synthesis, for the fine-to-coarse integration of information from operators at different scales. Finally we show that step edge detector performance improves considerably as the operator point spread function is extended along the edge."

This allows us to clarify the behavior of some well-knowncornerness measure based approaches used to detect these points of interest. Most of these classical approaches appear to detect points that do not correspond to the exact position of the corner. A new scale-space based approach that combines useful properties from the Laplacian and Beaudet's measure (Beaudet 1978) is then proposed in order to correct and detect exactly the corner position. An extension of this approach is then developed to solve the problem of trihedral vertex characterization and detection. In particular, it is shown that a trihedral vertex has two elliptic maxima on extremal contrast surfaces if the contrast is sufficient, and this allows us to classify trihedral vertexes in 2 classes: \u201cvertex,\u201d and \u201cvertex as corner.\u201d The corner-detection approach developed is applied to accurately detect trihedral vertexes using an additional test in order to make a distinction between trihedral vertexes and corners. Many experiments have been carried out using noisy synthetic data and real images containing corners and vertexes. Most of the promising results obtained are used to illustrate the experimental section of this paper."

The basic measure of performance is a visual rating score which indicates the perceived quality of the edges for identifying an object. The process of evaluating edge detection algorithms with this performance measure requires the collection of a set of gray-scale images, optimizing the input parameters for each algorithm, conducting visual evaluation experiments and applying statistical analysis methods. The novel aspect of this work is the use of a visual task and real images of complex scenes in evaluating edge detectors. The method is appealing because, by definition, the results agree with visual evaluations of the edge images."

Using Canny's design [1], we show that a solution to his precise formulation of detection and localization for an infinite extent filter leads to an optimal operator in one dimension, which can be efficiently implemented by two recursive filters moving in opposite directions. In addition to the noise truncature immunity which results, the recursive nature of the filtering operations leads, with sequential machines, to a substantial saving in computational effort (five multiplications and five additions for one pixel, independent of the size of the neighborhood). The extension to the two-dimensional case is considered and the resulting filtering structures are implemented as two-dimensional recursive filters. Hence, the filter size can be varied by simply changing the value of one parameter without affecting the time execution of the algorithm. Performance measures of this new edge detector are given and compared to Canny's filters. Various experimental results are shown."

In addition to corners, we detect points of significant curvature between them.

Estimates of the searched model parameters characterizing completely single grey-value structures are determined by a least-squares fit of the model to the observed image intensities applying the minimization method of Levenberg-Marquardt. In particular, we develop an analytical approximation of our model in such a way that function values can be calculated without numerical integration. Assuming the blur of the imaging system to be describable by Gaussian convolution our approach permits subpixel localization of the corner position of the unblurred grey-value structures, that is, to reverse the blur of the imaging system. By fitting our model to the original as well as to the smoothed original-image cues can be obtained for finding out whether the underlying model is an adequate description or not.

We propose that machine visual attention should consist of both high-level, context-dependent components, and low-level, context free components. As a basis for the context-free component, we present an attention operator based on the intuitive notion of symmetry, which generalized many of the existing methods of detecting regions of interest. It is a low-level operator that can be applied successfully without a priori knowledge of the world. The resultingsymmetry edge map can be applied in various low, intermediate-and high- level tasks, such as extraction of interest points, grouping, and object recognition. In particular, we have implemented an algorithm that locates interest points in real time, and can be incorporated in active and purposive vision systems. The results agree with some psychophysical findings concerning symmetry as well as evidence concerning selection of fixation points. We demonstrate the performance of the transform on natural, cluttered images."

A number of necessary criteria are imposed on any candidate solution method. Path-based Gaussian smoothing techniques are applied to the curve to find zeros of curvature at varying levels of detail. The result is the ``generalized scale space'' image of a planar curve which is invariant under rotation, uniform scaling and translation of the curve. These properties make the scale space image suitable for matching. The matching algorithm is a modification of the uniform cost algorithm and finds the lowest cost match of contours in the scale space images. It is argued that this is preferable to matching in a so-called stable scale of the curve because no such scale may exist for a given curve. This technique is applied to register a Landsat satellite image of the Strait of Georgia, B.C. (manually corrected for skew) to a map containing the shorelines of an overlapping area."

The resulting smoothed polygonal representation preserves the signs of the curvature function of the curve. The algorithm is based on a simple decomposition of noisy digital curves into a minimal number of convex and concave sections. The location of each separation point is optimized, yielding the minimal possible distance between the smoothed approximation and the original curve. Curve points within a convex (concave) section are discarded if their angle signs do not agree with the section sign, and if the resulted deviations from the curve are less than a threshold /spl epsi/, which is derived automatically. Inflection points are curve points between pairs of convex-concave sections, and cusps are curve points between pairs of convex-convex or concave-concave sections. Corners and points of local minimal curvature are detected by applying the algorithm to respective total curvature graphs. The detection of the feature points is based on properties of pairs of sections that are determined in an adaptive manner, rather than on properties of single points that are based on a fixed-size neighborhood. The detection is therefore reliable and robust. Complexity analysis and experimental results are presented. >"

Arbitrary concatenations of such RF profiles yield again similar ones of higher order and for a greater degree of blurring.By replacing the illuminance with its third order jet extension we obtain position dependent geometries. It is shown how such a representation can function as the substrate for \u201cpoint processors\u201d computing geometrical features such as edge curvature. We obtain a clear dichotomy between local and multilocal visual routines. The terms of the truncated Taylor series representing the jets are partial derivatives whose corresponding RF profiles closely mimic the well known units in the primary visual cortex. Hence this description provides a novel means to understand and classify these units.Taking the receptive field outputs as the basic input data one may devise visual routines that compute geometric features on the basis of standard differential geometry exploiting the equivalence with the local jets (partial derivatives with respect to the space coordinates)."

We call the representation the Curvature Primal Sketch because of the close analogy to the primal sketch representation advocated by Marr for describing significant intensity changes. We define a set of primitive parameterized curvature discontinuities, and derive expressions for their convolutions with the first and second derivatives of a Gaussian. We describe an implemented algorithm that computes the Curvature Primal Sketch by matching the multiscale convolutions of a shape, and illustrate its performance on a set of tool shapes. Several applications of the representation are sketched."

Two main motivations for research in computer vision are to develop algorithms to solve vision problems and to understand and model the human visual system. It turns out that finding satisfactory answers to either motivation is significantly harder than common wisdom initially assumed. Research in computer vision has actively continued to the current time. Most of the research in the computer vision and pattern recognition community is focused on developing solutions to vision problems. With three decades of research behind current efforts and with the availability of powerful, inexpensive computers, there is a common belief that computer vision is poised to deliver reliable solutions. The area of empirical evaluation of computer vision algorithms is developing the methods and tools for measuring the ability of algorithms to meet requirements to be fielded, for determining the state-of-the-art, and for pointing out future research directions. The goal of this special theme section of IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (PAMI) is to highlight progress in empirical evaluation and identify it as a maturing area of computer vision. Out of 18 submissions, three were accepted for this special section. In addition, one submission was accepted to appear in a regular issue, and two others are being revised for consideration as regular papers. \u201cFiltering for Supervised Texture Segmentation: A Comparative Study\u201d by T. Randen and J.H. Husoy presents a comparative study of methods for texture classification. The emphasis of the study is filtering methods from signal processing. Most major filtering approaches are evaluated. For reference, a statistical algorithm and a model-based algorithm are also evaluated. The paper presents performance results on a number of mosaic texture images. In a first for PAMI, the raw image files for these images are being made available as part of the electronic version of the paper. (The electronic version of the paper is part of the Computer Society\u2019s digital library, accessible online at www.computer.org.) It is hoped that future papers on texture segmentation will take advantage of this in order to present directly comparable experimental results. \u201cPerformance Evaluation and Analysis of Monocular Building Extraction From Aerial Imagery\u201d by J.A. Shufelt evaluates end-to-end performance of four systems on their ability to extract buildings from 83 aerial images of 18 sites. The methodology allows for an examination of traditional assumptions made in designing algorithms that extract buildings from monocular imagery. \u201cEvaluation of Methods for Ridge and Valley Detection\u201d by A.M. Lopez, F. Lumbreras, and J. Serrat evaluates ridge and valley detectors. The authors discuss what are desirable properties of ridge and valley detectors and the methods for measuring desirable properties. Then they present an evaluation using these methods. We hope the papers in this special section are interesting and present challenges for future researchers."

Results of the previous section show that a stable implementation of the derivatives improves the results of the standard Harris detector. The improved version of Harris (ImpHarris) gives significantly better results than the other detectors in the presence of image rotation. This is due to the rotation invariance of its image measures. The detector of Heitger combines computations in several directions and is not invariant to rotations. This is confirmed by Perona (1995) who has noticed that the computation in several directions is less stable to an image rotation."

Positions obtained by this method are very precise. However, the quality of the approximation depends on the initial position estimation. Rohr uses an interest point detector which maximizes det (A) (cf. Eq. (1)) as well as the intersection of line segments to determine the initial values for the model parameters.
