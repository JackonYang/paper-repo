In this paper, we present a new approach that learns to recognize tables in free text, including the boundary, rows and columns of tables. When tested on Wall Street Journal news documents, our learning approach outperforms a deterministic table recognition algorithm that identifies table recognition algorithm that identifies tables based on a fixed set of conditions. Our learning approach is also more flexible and easily adaptable to texts in different domains with different table characteristics."

Here we describe the nature of the IE task, review the history of the area from its origins in AI work in the 1960s and 70s till the present, discuss the techniques being used to carry out the task, describe application areas where IE systems are or are about to be at work, and conclude with a discussion of the challenges facing the area. What emerges is a picture of an exciting new text processing technology with a host of new applications, both on its own and in conjunction with other technologies, such as information retrieval, machine translation and data mining."

However, proper names are major unknown words in natural language texts, and unknown word identification is still a challenge problem in natural language processing. This paper deals with identification of person names, organization names and location names from Chinese texts. Different types of information from different levels of text are employed, including character conditions, statistic information, titles, punctuation marks, organization and location keywords, speech\u2013act and locative verbs, cache and n\u2013gram model. We also clarify which strategies can be used in which cases, i.e., queries and/or documents. In our experiments, the recall rates and the precision rates for the extraction of person names, organization names, and location names under MET data are (87.33%, 82.33%), (76.67%, 79.33%) and (77.00%, 82.00%), respectively."

The identification of outliers can lead to the discovery of truly unexpected knowledge in areas such as electronic commerce, credit card fraud, and even the analysis of performance statistics of professional athletes. Existing methods that we have seen for finding outliers in large datasets can only deal efficiently with two dimensions/attributes of a dataset. Here, we study the notion of DB- (DistanceBased) outliers. While we provide formal and empirical evidence showing the usefulness of DB-outliers, we focus on the development of algorithms for computing such outliers. First, we present two simple algorithms, both having a complexity of O(k N\u2019), k being the dimensionality and N being the number of objects in the dataset. These algorithms readily support datasets with many more than two attributes. Second, we present an optimized cell-based algorithm that has a complexity that is linear wrt N, but exponential wrt k. Third, for datasets that are mainly disk-resident, we present another version of the cell-based algorithm that guarantees at most 3 passes over a dataset. We provide"

For doing this the workbench employs methods from computational linguistics, information retrieval and knowledge engineering.
