We explicitly train it to distinguish objects with a well-defined boundary in space, such as cows and telephones, from amorphous background elements, such as grass and road. The measure combines in a Bayesian framework several image cues measuring characteristics of objects, such as appearing different from their surroundings and having a closed boundary. These include an innovative cue to measure the closed boundary characteristic. In experiments on the challenging PASCAL VOC 07 dataset, we show this new cue to outperform a state-of-the-art saliency measure, and the combined objectness measure to perform better than any cue alone. We also compare to interest point operators, a HOG detector, and three recent works aiming at automatic object segmentation. Finally, we present two applications of objectness. In the first, we sample a small numberof windows according to their objectness probability and give an algorithm to employ them as location priors for modern class-specific object detectors. As we show experimentally, this greatly reduces the number of windows evaluated by the expensive class-specific model. In the second application, we use objectness as a complementary score in addition to the class-specific model, which leads to fewer false positives. As shown in several recent papers, objectness can act as a valuable focus of attention mechanism in many other applications operating on image windows, including weakly supervised learning of object categories, unsupervised pixelwise segmentation, and object tracking in video. Computing objectness is very efficient and takes only about 4 sec. per image."

These models have been introduced for fully supervised training of object detectors, but we demonstrate that they are also capable of more open-ended learning of latent structure for such tasks as scene recognition and weakly supervised object localization. For scene recognition, DPM's can capture recurring visual elements and salient objects; in combination with standard global image features, they obtain state-of-the-art results on the MIT 67-category indoor scene dataset. For weakly supervised object localization, optimization over latent DPM parameters can discover the spatial extent of objects in cluttered training images without ground-truth bounding boxes. The resulting method outperforms a recent state-of-the-art weakly supervised object localization approach on the PASCAL-07 dataset."

                "text": "In this paper we propose a simple but efficient image representation for solving the scene classification problem. Our new representation combines the benefits of spatial pyramid representation using nonlinear feature coding and latent Support Vector Machine (LSVM) to train a set of Latent Pyramidal Regions (LPR). Each of our LPRs captures a discriminative characteristic of the scenes and is trained by searching over all possible sub-windows of the images in a latent SVM training procedure. Each LPR is represented in a spatial pyramid and uses non-linear locality constraint coding for learning both shape and texture patterns of the scene. The final response of the LPRs form a single feature vector which we call the LPR representation and can be used for the classification task. We tested our proposed scene representation model in three datasets which contain a variety of scene categories (15-Scenes, UIUC-Sports and MIT-indoor). Our LPR representation obtains state-of-the-art results on all these datasets which shows that it can simultaneously model the global and local scene characteristics in a single framework and is general enough to be used for both indoor and outdoor scene classification."

However, to enable the use of more expensive features and classifiers and thereby progress beyond the state-of-the-art, a selective search strategy is needed. Therefore, we adapt segmentation as a selective search by reconsidering segmentation: We propose to generate many approximate locations over few and precise object delineations because (1) an object whose location is never generated can not be recognised and (2) appearance and immediate nearby context are most effective for object recognition. Our method is class-independent and is shown to cover 96.7% of all objects in the Pascal VOC 2007 test set using only 1,536 locations per image. Our selective search enables the use of the more expensive bag-of-words method which we use to substantially improve the state-of-the-art by up to 8.5% for 8 out of 20 classes on the Pascal VOC 2010 detection challenge."

The training images contain a preponderance of clutter and learning is unsupervised. Our models represent objects as probabilistic constellations of rigid parts (features). The variability within a class is represented by a join probability density function on the shape of the constellation and the appearance of the parts. Our method automatically identifies distinctive features in the training set. The set of model parameters is then learned using expectation maximization. When trained on different, unlabeled and unsegmented views of a class of objects, each component of the mixture model can adapt to represent a subset of the views. Similarly, different component models can also \"specialize\" on sub-classes of an object class. Experiments on images of human heads, leaves from different species of trees, and motor-cars demonstrate that the method works well over a wide variety of objects."

                "text": "The task of visual classification is thce recognition of an object in the image as belonging to a general class of similar objects, such as a face, a car, a dog, and the like. This is a fundamental and natural task for biological visual systems, but it has proven difficult to perform visual classification by artificial computer vision systems. The main reason for this difficulty is the variability of shape within a class: different objects vary widely in appearance, and it is difficult to capture the essential shape features that characterize the members of one category and distinguish them from another, such as dogs from cats. \n \nIn this paper we describe an approach to classification using a fragment-based representation. In this approach, objects within a class are represented in terms of common image fragments that are used as building blocks for representing a large variety of different objects that belong to a common class. The fragments are selected from a training set of images based on a criterion of maximizing the mutual information of the fragments and the class they represent. For the purpose of classification the fragments are also organized into types, where each type is a collection of alternative fragments, such as different hairline or eye regions for face classification. During classification, the algorithm detects fragments of the different types, and then combines the evidence for the detected fragments to reach a final decision. Experiments indicate that it is possible to trade off the complexity of fragments with the complexity of the combination and decision stage, and this tradeoff is discussed. \n \nThe method is different from previous part-based methods in using class-specific object fragments of varying complexity, the method of selecting fragments, and the organization into fragment types. Experimental results of detecting face and car views show that the fragment-based approach can generalize well to a variety of novel image views within a class while maintaining low mis-classification error rates. We briefly discuss relationships between the proposed method and properties of parts of the primate visual system involved in object perception"

[11] achieve state-of-the-art performance for a variety of object categories, but are still outperformed by simpler bag-of-words models for highly flexible objects such as cats and dogs. In these cases we propose to use the template-based model to detect a distinctive part for the class, followed by detecting the rest of the object via segmentation on image specific information learnt from that part. This approach is motivated by two ob- servations: (i) many object classes contain distinctive parts that can be detected very reliably by template-based detec- tors, whilst the entire object cannot; (ii) many classes (e.g. animals) have fairly homogeneous coloring and texture that can be used to segment the object once a sample is provided in an image. We show quantitatively that our method substantially outperforms whole-body template-based detectors for these highly deformable object categories, and indeed achieves accuracy comparable to the state-of-the-art on the PASCAL VOC competition, which includes other models such as bag-of-words."

The method is based on training a separate linear SVM classifier for every exemplar in the training set. Each of these Exemplar-SVMs is thus defined by a single positive instance and millions of negatives. While each detector is quite specific to its exemplar, we empirically observe that an ensemble of such Exemplar-SVMs offers surprisingly good generalization. Our performance on the PASCAL VOC detection task is on par with the much more complex latent part-based model of Felzenszwalb et al., at only a modest computational cost increase. But the central benefit of our approach is that it creates an explicit association between each detection and a single training exemplar. Because most detections show good alignment to their associated exemplar, it is possible to transfer any available exemplar meta-data (segmentation, geometric structure, 3D model, etc.) directly onto the detections, which can then be used as part of overall scene understanding."

Our approach represents a scene as a collection of region models (\u201cparts\u201d) arranged in a reconfigurable pattern. We partition an image into a predefined set of regions and use a latent variable to specify which region model is assigned to each image region. In our current implementation we use a bag of words representation to capture the appearance of an image region. The resulting method generalizes a spatial bag of words approach that relies on a fixed model for the bag of words in each image region. Our models can be trained using both generative and discriminative methods. In the generative setting we use the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to estimate model parameters from a collection of images with category labels. In the discriminative setting we use a latent structural SVM (LSSVM). We note that LSSVMs can be very sensitive to initialization and demonstrate that generative training with EM provides a good initialization for discriminative training with LSSVM."

Our system is able to represent highly variable object classes and achieves state-of-the-art results in the PASCAL object detection challenges. While deformable part models have become quite popular, their value had not been demonstrated on difficult benchmarks such as the PASCAL data sets. Our system relies on new methods for discriminative training with partially labeled data. We combine a margin-sensitive approach for data-mining hard negative examples with a formalism we call latent SVM. A latent SVM is a reformulation of MI--SVM in terms of latent variables. A latent SVM is semiconvex, and the training problem becomes convex once latent information is specified for the positive examples. This leads to an iterative training algorithm that alternates between fixing latent values for positive examples and optimizing the latent SVM objective function."

The desired patches need to satisfy two requirements: 1) to be representative, they need to occur frequently enough in the visual world; 2) to be discriminative, they need to be different enough from the rest of the visual world. The patches could correspond to parts, objects, \"visual phrases\", etc. but are not restricted to be any one of them. We pose this as an unsupervised discriminative clustering problem on a huge dataset of image patches. We use an iterative procedure which alternates between clustering and training discriminative classifiers, while applying careful cross-validation at each step to prevent overfitting. The paper experimentally demonstrates the effectiveness of discriminative patches as an unsupervised mid-level visual representation, suggesting that it could be used in place of visual words for many tasks. Furthermore, discriminative patches can also be used in a supervised regime, such as scene classification, where they demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on the MIT Indoor-67 dataset."

We show that place and scene recognition, especially for indoor environments, require its visual descriptor to possess properties that are different from other vision domains (e.g., object recognition). CENTRIST satisfies these properties and suits the place and scene recognition task. It is a holistic representation and has strong generalizability for category recognition. CENTRIST mainly encodes the structural properties within an image and suppresses detailed textural information. Our experiments demonstrate that CENTRIST outperforms the current state of the art in several place and scene recognition data sets, compared with other descriptors such as SIFT and Gist. Besides, it is easy to implement and evaluates extremely fast."

A key component of these approaches is that local regions of images are characterized using high-dimensional descriptors which are then mapped to ldquovisual wordsrdquo selected from a discrete vocabulary.This paper explores techniques to map each visual region to a weighted set of words, allowing the inclusion of features which were lost in the quantization stage of previous systems. The set of visual words is obtained by selecting words based on proximity in descriptor space. We describe how this representation may be incorporated into a standard tf-idf architecture, and how spatial verification is modified in the case of this soft-assignment. We evaluate our method on the standard Oxford Buildings dataset, and introduce a new dataset for evaluation. Our results exceed the current state of the art retrieval performance on these datasets, particularly on queries with poor initial recall where techniques like query expansion suffer. Overall we show that soft-assignment is always beneficial for retrieval with large vocabularies, at a cost of increased storage requirements for the index."

Organised annually from 2005 to present, the challenge and its associated dataset has become accepted as the benchmark for object detection.This paper describes the dataset and evaluation procedure. We review the state-of-the-art in evaluated methods for both classification and detection, analyse whether the methods are statistically different, what they are learning from the images (e.g. the object or its context), and what the methods find easy or confuse. The paper concludes with lessons learnt in the three year history of the challenge, and proposes directions for future improvement and extension."

For high level visual tasks, such low-level image representations are potentially not enough. In this paper, we propose a high-level image representation, called the Object Bank, where an image is represented as a scale-invariant response map of a large number of pre-trained generic object detectors, blind to the testing dataset or visual task. Leveraging on the Object Bank representation, superior performances on high level visual recognition tasks can be achieved with simple off-the-shelf classifiers such as logistic regression and linear SVM. Sparsity algorithms make our representation more efficient and scalable for large scene datasets, and reveal semantically meaningful feature patterns."

We postulate two criteria (1) It should be easy to find a poselet given an input image (2) it should be easy to localize the 3D configuration of the person conditioned on the detection of a poselet. To permit this we have built a new dataset, H3D, of annotations of humans in 2D photographs with 3D joint information, inferred using anthropometric constraints. This enables us to implement a data-driven search procedure for finding poselets that are tightly clustered in both 3D joint configuration space as well as 2D image appearance. The algorithm discovers poselets that correspond to frontal and profile faces, pedestrians, head and shoulder views, among others. Each poselet provides examples for training a linear SVM classifier which can then be run over the image in a multiscale scanning mode. The outputs of these poselet detectors can be thought of as an intermediate layer of nodes, on top of which one can run a second layer of classification or regression. We show how this permits detection and localization of torsos or keypoints such as left shoulder, nose, etc. Experimental results show that we obtain state of the art performance on people detection in the PASCAL VOC 2007 challenge, among other datasets. We are making publicly available both the H3D dataset as well as the poselet parameters for use by other researchers."

It builds on a re-interpretation of the recent exemplar-based SVM approach, where a linear SVM is trained at a query point and distance is computed as the dot product with the normal to the separating hyperplane. Although exemplar-based SVM is slow because it requires a new training for each exemplar, the latter approach has shown robustness for image retrieval and object classification, yielding state-ofthe-art performance on the PASCAL VOC 2007 detection task despite its simplicity. We re-interpret it by viewing the SVM between a single point and the set of negative examples as the computation of the tangent to the manifold of images at the query. We show that, in a high-dimensional space such as that of image features, all points tend to lie at the periphery and that they are usually separable from the rest of the set. We then use a simple Gaussian approximation to the set of all images in feature space, and fit it by computing the covariance matrix on a large training set. Given the covariance matrix, the computation of the tangent or normal at a point is straightforward and is a simple multiplication by the inverse covariance. This allows us to dramatically speed up image retrieval tasks, going from more than ten minutes to a single second. We further show that our approach is equivalent to feature-space whitening and has links to image saliency."

Training linear SVMs however is quite expensive, and can become intractable as the number of categories increase. In this work we revisit a much older technique, viz. Linear Discriminant Analysis, and show that LDA models can be trained almost trivially, and with little or no loss in performance. The covariance matrices we estimate capture properties of natural images. Whitening HOG features with these covariances thus removes naturally occuring correlations between the HOG features. We show that these whitened features (which we call WHO) are considerably better than the original HOG features for computing similarities, and prove their usefulness in clustering. Finally, we use our findings to produce an object detection system that is competitive on PASCAL VOC 2007 while being considerably easier to train and test."

This technique works by partitioning the image into increasingly fine sub-regions and computing histograms of local features found inside each sub-region. The resulting \"spatial pyramid\" is a simple and computationally efficient extension of an orderless bag-of-features image representation, and it shows significantly improved performance on challenging scene categorization tasks. Specifically, our proposed method exceeds the state of the art on the Caltech-101 database and achieves high accuracy on a large database of fifteen natural scene categories. The spatial pyramid framework also offers insights into the success of several recently proposed image descriptions, including Torralba\u2019s \"gist\" and Lowe\u2019s SIFT descriptors."

The assembly of these clusters into an action class is governed by a graphical model that incorporates appearance and motion constraints for the individual parts and pairwise constraints for the spatio-temporal dependencies among them. During training, we estimate the model parameters discriminatively. During classification, we efficiently match the model to a video using discrete optimization. We validate the model's classification ability in standard benchmark datasets and illustrate its potential to support a fine-grained analysis that not only gives a label to a video, but also identifies and localizes its constituent parts."

The main building blocks are dense statistical models for individual objects. The models assume conditional independence of binary oriented edge variables conditional on a hidden instantiation parameter, which also determines an object support. These models are then be composed to form models for object configurations with various interactions including occlusion. Choosing the optimal configuration is entirely likelihood based and no decision boundaries need to be pre-learned. Training involves estimation of model parameters for each class separately. Both training and classification involve estimation of hidden pose variables which can be computationally intensive. We describe two levels of approximation which facilitate these computations: the Patchwork of Parts (POP) model and the coarse part based models (CPM). A concrete implementation of the approach is illustrated on the problem of reading zip-codes."

Examples include locality-constrained linear encoding [23], improved Fisher encoding [17], super vector encoding [27], and kernel codebook encoding [20]. While several authors have reported very good results on the challenging PASCAL VOC classification data by means of these new techniques, differences in the feature computation and learning algorithms, missing details in the description of the methods, and different tuning of the various components, make it impossible to compare directly these methods and hard to reproduce the results reported. This paper addresses these shortcomings by carrying out a rigorous evaluation of these new techniques by: (1) fixing the other elements of the pipeline (features, learning, tuning); (2) disclosing all the implementation details, and (3) identifying both those aspects of each method which are particularly important to achieve good performance, and those aspects which are less critical. This allows a consistent comparative analysis of these encoding methods. Several conclusions drawn from our analysis cannot be inferred from the original publications."

We make the following three contributions: (i) a new method to compare SIFT descriptors (RootSIFT) which yields superior performance without increasing processing or storage requirements; (ii) a novel method for query expansion where a richer model for the query is learnt discriminatively in a form suited to immediate retrieval through efficient use of the inverted index; (iii) an improvement of the image augmentation method proposed by Turcot and Lowe [29], where only the augmenting features which are spatially consistent with the augmented image are kept. We evaluate these three methods over a number of standard benchmark datasets (Oxford Buildings 5k and 105k, and Paris 6k) and demonstrate substantial improvements in retrieval performance whilst maintaining immediate retrieval speeds. Combining these complementary methods achieves a new state-of-the-art performance on these datasets."

                "text": "We explore a new approach to shape recognition based on a virtually infinite family of binary features (queries) of the image data, designed to accommodate prior information about shape invariance and regularity. Each query corresponds to a spatial arrangement of several local topographic codes (or tags), which are in themselves too primitive and common to be informative about shape. All the discriminating power derives from relative angles and distances among the tags. The important attributes of the queries are a natural partial ordering corresponding to increasing structure and complexity; semi-invariance, meaning that most shapes of a given class will answer the same way to two queries that are successive in the ordering; and stability, since the queries are not based on distinguished points and substructures. No classifier based on the full feature set can be evaluated, and it is impossible to determine a priori which arrangements are informative. Our approach is to select informative features and build tree classifiers at the same time by inductive learning. In effect, each tree provides an approximation to the full posterior where the features chosen depend on the branch that is traversed. Due to the number and nature of the queries, standard decision tree construction based on a fixed-length feature vector is not feasible. Instead we entertain only a small random sample of queries at each node, constrain their complexity to increase with tree depth, and grow multiple trees. The terminal nodes are labeled by estimates of the corresponding posterior distribution over shape classes. An image is classified by sending it down every tree and aggregating the resulting distributions. The method is applied to classifying handwritten digits and synthetic linear and nonlinear deformations of three hundred symbols. State-of-the-art error rates are achieved on the National Institute of Standards and Technology database of digits. The principal goal of the experiments on symbols is to analyze invariance, generalization error and related issues, and a comparison with artificial neural networks methods is presented in this context.

This paper presents a simple but effective coding scheme called Locality-constrained Linear Coding (LLC) in place of the VQ coding in traditional SPM. LLC utilizes the locality constraints to project each descriptor into its local-coordinate system, and the projected coordinates are integrated by max pooling to generate the final representation. With linear classifier, the proposed approach performs remarkably better than the traditional nonlinear SPM, achieving state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks. Compared with the sparse coding strategy [22], the objective function used by LLC has an analytical solution. In addition, the paper proposes a fast approximated LLC method by first performing a K-nearest-neighbor search and then solving a constrained least square fitting problem, bearing computational complexity of O(M + K2). Hence even with very large codebooks, our system can still process multiple frames per second. This efficiency significantly adds to the practical values of LLC for real applications."

After reviewing existing edge and gradient based descriptors, we show experimentally that grids of histograms of oriented gradient (HOG) descriptors significantly outperform existing feature sets for human detection. We study the influence of each stage of the computation on performance, concluding that fine-scale gradients, fine orientation binning, relatively coarse spatial binning, and high-quality local contrast normalization in overlapping descriptor blocks are all important for good results. The new approach gives near-perfect separation on the original MIT pedestrian database, so we introduce a more challenging dataset containing over 1800 annotated human images with a large range of pose variations and backgrounds."

The features are invariant to image scaling, translation, and rotation, and partially invariant to illumination changes and affine or 3D projection. These features share similar properties with neurons in inferior temporal cortex that are used for object recognition in primate vision. Features are efficiently detected through a staged filtering approach that identifies stable points in scale space. Image keys are created that allow for local geometric deformations by representing blurred image gradients in multiple orientation planes and at multiple scales. The keys are used as input to a nearest neighbor indexing method that identifies candidate object matches. Final verification of each match is achieved by finding a low residual least squares solution for the unknown model parameters. Experimental results show that robust object recognition can be achieved in cluttered partially occluded images with a computation time of under 2 seconds."

In this article, we propose to use as an alternative the Fisher kernel framework. We first show why the Fisher representation is well-suited to the retrieval problem: it describes an image by what makes it different from other images. One drawback of the Fisher vector is that it is high-dimensional and, as opposed to the BOV, it is dense. The resulting memory and computational costs do not make Fisher vectors directly amenable to large-scale retrieval. Therefore, we compress Fisher vectors to reduce their memory footprint and speed-up the retrieval. We compare three binarization approaches: a simple approach devised for this representation and two standard compression techniques. We show on two publicly available datasets that compressed Fisher vectors perform very well using as little as a few hundreds of bits per image, and significantly better than a very recent compressed BOV approach."

However, existing maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) schemes can make the prediction model learning independent of latent topic discovery and result in an unbalanced prediction rule for scene classification. This paper presents a joint max-margin and max-likelihood learning method for upstream scene understanding models, in which latent topic discovery and prediction model estimation are closely coupled and well-balanced. The optimization problem is efficiently solved with a variational EM procedure, which iteratively solves an online loss-augmented SVM. We demonstrate the advantages of the large-margin approach on both an 8-category sports dataset and the 67-class MIT indoor scene dataset for scene categorization."

The codebook approach describes an image as a bag of discrete visual codewords, where the frequency distributions of these words are used for image categorization. There are two drawbacks to the traditional codebook model: codeword uncertainty and codeword plausibility. Both of these drawbacks stem from the hard assignment of visual features to a single codeword. We show that allowing a degree of ambiguity in assigning codewords improves categorization performance for three state-of-the-art datasets."

We define a predicate for measuring the evidence for a boundary between two regions using a graph-based representation of the image. We then develop an efficient segmentation algorithm based on this predicate, and show that although this algorithm makes greedy decisions it produces segmentations that satisfy global properties. We apply the algorithm to image segmentation using two different kinds of local neighborhoods in constructing the graph, and illustrate the results with both real and synthetic images. The algorithm runs in time nearly linear in the number of graph edges and is also fast in practice. An important characteristic of the method is its ability to preserve detail in low-variability image regions while ignoring detail in high-variability regions."

We prove that the number of iterations required to obtain a solution of accuracy $${\\epsilon}$$ is $${\\tilde{O}(1 / \\epsilon)}$$, where each iteration operates on a single training example. In contrast, previous analyses of stochastic gradient descent methods for SVMs require $${\\Omega(1 / \\epsilon^2)}$$ iterations. As in previously devised SVM solvers, the number of iterations also scales linearly with 1/\u03bb, where \u03bb is the regularization parameter of SVM. For a linear kernel, the total run-time of our method is $${\\tilde{O}(d/(\\lambda \\epsilon))}$$, where d is a bound on the number of non-zero features in each example. Since the run-time does not depend directly on the size of the training set, the resulting algorithm is especially suited for learning from large datasets. Our approach also extends to non-linear kernels while working solely on the primal objective function, though in this case the runtime does depend linearly on the training set size. Our algorithm is particularly well suited for large text classification problems, where we demonstrate an order-of-magnitude speedup over previous SVM learning methods."

Most scene recognition models that work well for outdoor scenes perform poorly in the indoor domain. The main difficulty is that while some indoor scenes (e.g. corridors) can be well characterized by global spatial properties, others (e.g, bookstores) are better characterized by the objects they contain. More generally, to address the indoor scenes recognition problem we need a model that can exploit local and global discriminative information. In this paper we propose a prototype based model that can successfully combine both sources of information. To test our approach we created a dataset of 67 indoor scenes categories (the largest available) covering a wide range of domains. The results show that our approach can significantly outperform a state of the art classifier for the task."

The linear SVMs are in general much faster to learn and evaluate (test) than the original nonlinear SVMs. This work introduces explicit feature maps for the additive class of kernels, such as the intersection, Hellinger's, and \u03c72 kernels, commonly used in computer vision, and enables their use in large scale problems. In particular, we: 1) provide explicit feature maps for all additive homogeneous kernels along with closed form expression for all common kernels; 2) derive corresponding approximate finite-dimensional feature maps based on a spectral analysis; and 3) quantify the error of the approximation, showing that the error is independent of the data dimension and decays exponentially fast with the approximation order for selected kernels such as \u03c72. We demonstrate that the approximations have indistinguishable performance from the full kernels yet greatly reduce the train/test times of SVMs. We also compare with two other approximation methods: Nystrom's approximation of Perronnin et al., which is data dependent, and the explicit map of Maji and Berg for the intersection kernel, which, as in the case of our approximations, is data independent. The approximations are evaluated on a number of standard data sets, including Caltech-101, Daimler-Chrysler pedestrians, and INRIA pedestrians."
