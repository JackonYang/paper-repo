The CPSC algorithm evaluates a large set of curved cuts through the image of the input string using dynamic programming and selects a small \"optimal\" subset of cuts for segmentation. It usually generates pixel accurate segmentations, indistinguishable from characters written in isolation. At four times oversegmentation, segmentation points are missed with an undetectable frequency on real-world databases. The CPSC algorithm has been used as part of a high-performance handwriting recognition system."

Segmentation is achieved through the extraction of a wide range of information adjacent to or surrounding suspicious segmentation points. Initially, a heuristic technique is employed to search for structural features and to over-segment each word. For each segmentation point that is located, the left character (preceding the segmentation point) and centre character (centred on the segmentation point) are extracted along with other features from the segmentation area. The aforementioned features are presented to trained character and segmentation point validation neural networks to evaluate a number of confidence values. Finally, the confidence values are fused to obtain the final segmentation decision. Based on a detailed analysis, it was observed that the left and centre character networks increased the accuracy of the segmentation algorithm."

We classify the field into three categories: segmentation-free methods, which compare a sequence of observations derived from a word image with similar references of words in the lexicon; segmentation-based methods, that look for the best match between consecutive sequences of primitive segments and letters of a possible word; and the perception-oriented approach, that relates to methods that perform a human-like reading technique, in which anchor features found all over the word are used to boot-strap a few candidates for a final evaluation phase."

A document recognition problem is viewed as consisting of three elements-an image generator, a noisy channel, and an image decoder. A document image generator is a Markov source which combines a message source with an imager. The message source produces a string of symbols which contains the information to be transmitted. The imager is modeled as a finite-state transducer, which converts the message into an ideal bitmap. The channel transforms the ideal image into a noisy observed image. The decoder estimates the message from the observed image by finding the a posteriori most probable path through the combined source and channel models using a Viterbi-like algorithm. Application of the proposed method to decoding telephone yellow pages is described.<<ETX>>"
