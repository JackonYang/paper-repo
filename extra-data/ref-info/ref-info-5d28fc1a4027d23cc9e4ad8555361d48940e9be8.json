A variant of the expectation maximization algorithm known as the Viterbi algorithm is used to obtain the statistical model from the unaligned sequences. In a detailed series of experiments, they have taken 400 unaligned globin sequences, and produced a statistical model entirely automatically from the primary sequences. The authors used no prior knowledge of globin structure. Using this model, a multiple alignment of the 400 sequences and 225 other globin sequences was obtained that agrees almost perfectly with a structural alignment by D. Bashford et al. (1987). This model can also discriminate all these 625 globins from nonglobin protein sequences with greater than 99% accuracy, and can thus be used for database searches.<<ETX>>"

This HMM includes states that model the codons and their frequencies in E. coli genes, as well as the patterns found in the intergenic region, including repetitive extragenic palindromic sequences and the Shine-Delgarno motif. To account for potential sequencing errors and or frameshifts in raw genomic DNA sequence, it allows for the (very unlikely) possibility of insertions and deletions of individual nucleotides within a codon. The parameters of the HMM are estimated using approximately one million nucleotides of annotated DNA in EcoSeq6 and the model tested on a disjoint set of contigs containing about 325,000 nucleotides. The HMM finds the exact locations of about 80% of the known E. coli genes, and approximate locations for about 10%. It also finds several potentially new genes, and locates several places were insertion or deletion errors/and or frameshifts may be present in the contigs."

Left-right HMMs with insertion and deletion states are then trained to represent several protein families including immunoglobulins and kinases. In all cases, the models derived capture all the important statistical properties of the families and can be used efficiently in a number of important tasks such as multiple alignment, motif detection, and classification."

It is shown that this Bayesian method can improve the quality of HMMs produced from small training sets. Specific experiments on the EF-hand motif are reported, for which these priors are shown to produce HMMs with higher likelihood on unseen data, and fewer false positives and false negatives in a database search task."

By adopting a protein structure grammar, the HMM makes it possible to treat global interactions, the interaction between two secondary structures which are apart in the sequence. In this framework, prediction of local and global structures are totally treated through global and local interactions which are expressed by the protein sequence grammar. The relations between some of the previous methods for secondary structure prediction and HMMs are discussed. Some experimental results on secondary structure prediction are included. The learning algorithms for the HMMs are presented.<<ETX>>"

SCFGs capture the sequences' common primary and secondary structure and generalize the hidden Markov models (HMMs) used in related work on protein and DNA. The novel aspect of this work is that SCFG parameters are learned automatically from unaligned, unfolded training sequences. A generalization of the HMM forward-backward algorithm is introduced The new algorithm, based on tree grammars and faster than the previously proposed SCFG inside-outside algorithm, is tested on the transfer RNA (tRNA) family. Results show the model can discern tRNA from similar-length RNA sequences, can find secondary structure of new tRNA sequences, and can give multiple alignments of large sets of tRNA sequences. The model is extended to handle introns in tRNA.<<ETX>>"

The environments are described by: (i) the area of the residue buried in the protein and inaccessible to solvent; (ii) the fraction of side-chain area that is covered by polar atoms (O and N); and (iii) the local secondary structure. Examples of this 3D profile method are presented for four families of proteins: the globins, cyclic AMP (adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate) receptor-like proteins, the periplasmic binding proteins, and the actins. This method is able to detect the structural similarity of the actins and 70- kilodalton heat shock proteins, even though these protein families share no detectable sequence similarity."

                "text": "A new method has been developed to compute the probability that each amino acid in a protein sequence is in a particular secondary structural element. Each of these probabilities is computed using the entire sequence and a set of predefined structural class models. This set of structural classes is patterned after Jane Richardson's taxonomy for the domains of globular proteins. For each structural class considered, a mathematical model is constructed to represent constraints on the pattern of secondary structural elements characteristic of that class. These are stochastic models having discrete state spaces (referred to as hidden Markov models by researchers in signal processing and automatic speech recognition). Each model is a mathematical generator of amino acid sequences; the sequence under consideration is modeled as having been generated by one model in the set of candidates. The probability that each model generated the given sequence is computed using a filtering algorithm. The protein is then classified as belonging to the structural class having the most probable model. The secondary structure of the sequence is then analyzed using a \u201csmoothing\u201d algorithm that is optimal for that structural class model. For each residue position in the sequence, the smoother computes the probability that the residue is contained within each of the defined secondary structural elements of the model. This method has two important advantages: (1) the probability of each residue being in each of the modeled secondary structural elements is computed using the totality of the amino acid sequence, and (2) these probabilities are consistent with prior knowledge of realizable domain folds as encoded in each model. As an example of the method's utility, we present its application to flavodoxin, a prototypical \u03b1/\u03b2 protein having a central \u03b2\u2010sheet, and to thioredoxin, which belongs to a similar structural class but shares no significant sequence similarity."

(1) The database of known sequences, currently at more than 12,000 proteins, is two orders of magnitude larger than the database of known structures. (2) The currently most powerful method of predicting protein structures is model building by homology. (3) Structural homology can be inferred from the level of sequence similarity. (4) The threshold of sequence similarity sufficient for structural homology depends strongly on the length of the alignment. Here, we first quantify the relation between sequence similarity, structure similarity, and alignment length by an exhaustive survey of alignments between proteins of known structure and report a homology threshold curve as a function of alignment length. We then produce a database of homology\u2010derived secondary structure of proteins (HSSP) by aligning to each protein of known structure all sequences deemed homologous on the basis of the threshold curve. For each known protein structure, the derived database contains the aligned sequences, secondary structure, sequence variability, and sequence profile. Tertiary structures of the aligned sequences are implied, but not modeled explicity. The database effectively increases the number of known protein structures by a factor of five to more than 1800. The results may be useful in assessing the structural significance of matches in sequence database searches, in deriving preferences and patterns for structure prediction, in elucidating the structural role of conserved residues, and in modeling three\u2010dimensional detail by homology."

We believe we our technique is a more sensitive method for detecting structural and functional relationships in sets of aligned sequences because we use a flexible representation (for sequences), as well as a general statistical method that can detect a wide range of relationships between positions in a sequence. Our method utilizes functional classifications of the sequence building-blocks (nucleotide bases and amino acids) based on physical or chemical properties. This flexibility in sequence representation improves the significance of finding sequence relationships mediated by the defining property. For example, using a purine/pyrimidine classification, we can detect base-stacking interactions in sets of nucleotide sequences that form base-paired helices. We use several statistical measures, including chi 2-tests, Monte Carlo simulations and an information measure to detect significant correlations in sequences. In this paper we illustrate our method by analyzing a set of tRNA sequences and showing that the correlations our program discovers, in each case, correspond to the known base-pairing and higher order interactions observed in tRNA crystal structures. Furthermore, we show that novel and interesting features of tRNAs are detected when sequence correlations with the charged amino acid (and anticodon) are evaluated. This technique is a powerful method for predicting the structure of RNAs and for analyzing specific functional characteristics."

The sequence of a known structure is aligned to sequences of other members of a given folding class. From the known structure, the secondary structure (\u03b1\u2010helix, \u03b2\u2010strand or \u201cother\u201d) is assigned to each position of the aligned sequences. As in the standard profile method,1 a position\u2010dependent scoring table, termed a profile, is calculated from the aligned sequences. However, rather than using the standard Dayhoff mutation table in calculating the profile, we use distinct amino acid mutation tables for residues in \u03b1\u2010helices, \u03b2\u2010strands or other secondary structures to calculate the profile. In addition, we also distinguish between internal and external residues. With this new secondary structure\u2010based profile method, we created a profile for eight\u2010stranded, antiparallel \u03b2 barrels of the insecticyanin folding class. It is based on the sequences of retinol\u2010binding protein, insecticyanin and \u03b2\u2010lactoglobulin. Scanning the sequence database with this profile, it was possible to detect the sequence of avidin. The structure of streptavidin is known, and it appears to be distantly related to the antiparallel \u03b2 barrels. Also detected is the sequence of complement component C8, which we therefore predict to be a member of this folding class."

Each sequence must contain at least one common site. No alignment of the sites is required. Instead, the uncertainty in the location of the sites is handled by employing the missing information principle to develop an \u201cexpectation maximization\u201d (EM) algorithm. This approach allows for the simultaneous identification of the sites and characterization of the binding motifs. The reliability of the algorithm increases with the number of fragments, but the computations increase only linearly. The method is illustrated with an example, using known cyclic adenosine monophophate receptor protein (CRP) binding sites. The final motif is utilized in a search for undiscovered CRP binding sites."

The use of protein sequence patterns (or motifs) to determine the function of proteins is becoming very rapidly one of the essential tools of sequence analysis. This reality has been recognized by many authors. While there have been a number of recent reports that review published patterns, no attempt had been made until very recently [5,6] to systematically collect biologically significant patterns or to discover new ones. It is for these reasons that we have developed, since 1988, a dictionary of sites and patterns which we call PROSITE.

The magnesium adenosine triphosphate (MgATP) binding site was located by difference Fourier synthesis. The enzyme structure is bilobal with a deep cleft between the lobes. The cleft is filled by MgATP and a portion of the inhibitor peptide. The smaller lobe, consisting mostly of amino-terminal sequence, is associated with nucleotide binding, and its largely antiparallel beta sheet architecture constitutes an unusual nucleotide binding motif. The larger lobe is dominated by helical structure with a single beta sheet at the domain interface. This lobe is primarily involved in peptide binding and catalysis. Residues 40 through 280 constitute a conserved catalytic core that is shared by more than 100 protein kinases. Most of the invariant amino acids in this conserved catalytic core are clustered at the sites of nucleotide binding and catalysis."

The open reading frame encodes 1852 amino acids (Mr 210,060). A 155-amino acid COOH-terminal sequence (after the fourth internal repeat) is evolutionarily preserved (90% homology) and may represent an important functional domain of L-type calcium channels. The photolabeled, membrane-bound, and purified carp alpha 1 subunits have masses of 211 and 190 kDa. The purified channel could not be phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase. Two glycoproteins (alpha 2 subunits) are associated with the alpha 1 subunit and change their apparent masses from 235 and 220 kDa to 159 kDa upon reduction of disulfide bonds. Nucleic acid hybridization with alpha 2 cDNA revealed an 8.0-kilobase transcript in carp skeletal muscle. Evidence for a copurification of subunits similar in size to mammalian beta or gamma subunits was not obtained."

Traditional methods for such multilocus linkage analysis are computationally prohibitive in general, even with supercomputers. The problem has acquired practical importance because of the current international collaboration aimed at constructing a complete human linkage map of DNA markers through the study of three-generation pedigrees. We describe here several alternative algorithms for constructing human linkage maps given a specified gene order. One method allows maximum-likelihood multilocus linkage maps for dozens of DNA markers in such three-generation pedigrees to be constructed in minutes."

The maximum likelihood fit of a model of this type suggests a \"softer\" form of competition, in which all competitors adapt in proportion to the relative probability that the input came from each competitor. I investigate one application of the soft competitive model, placement of radial basis function centers for function interpolation, and show that the soft model can give better performance with little additional computational cost."

We illustrate the main points with some recognition experiments involving artificial data as well as handwritten numerals. In way of conclusion, we suggest that current-generation feedforward neural networks are largely inadequate for difficult problems in machine perception and machine learning, regardless of parallel-versus-serial hardware or other implementation issues. Furthermore, we suggest that the fundamental challenges in neural modeling are about representation rather than learning per se. This last point is supported by additional experiments with handwritten numerals."

typical or essential for all L type calcium channels regardless of whether they couple to ryanodine receptors conduct ions or both\nIntroduction\nThe rate of generation of sequence data in recent years provides abundant opportunities for the development of new approaches to problems in computational biology In this paper we apply hidden Markov models HMMs to the problems of statistical modeling database searching and multiple alignment of protein families and protein domains To demonstrate the method we examine three protein families Each family consists of a set of proteins that have the same overall three dimensional structure but widely divergent sequences Features of the sequences that are determinants of folding structure and function should be present as conserved elements in the family of sequences We consider the globins whole proteins ranging in length from to residues with few exceptions and two domains the protein kinase catalytic domain residues and the EF hand calcium binding motif residues The same approach can be used to model families of nucleic acid sequences as well Krogh et al\nA hidden Markov Model Rabiner describes a series of observations by a hidden stochastic process a Markov process In speech recognition where HMMs have been used extensively the observations are sounds forming a word and a model is one that by its hidden random process generates these sounds with high probability Every possible sound sequence can be generated by the model with some probability Thus the model de nes a probability distribution over possible sound sequences A good word model would assign high probability to all sound sequences that are likely utterances of the word it models and low probability to any other sequence In this paper we propose an HMM similar to the ones used in speech recognition to model protein families such as globins and kinases In speech recognition the alphabet from which words are constructed could be the set of phonemes valid for a particular language in protein modeling the alphabet we use is the amino acids from which protein molecules are constructed Where the observations in speech recognition are words or strings of phonemes in protein modeling the observations are strings of amino acids forming the primary sequence of a protein A model for a set of proteins is one that assigns high probability to the sequences in that particular set\nThe HMM we build identi es a set of positions that describe the more or less conserved rst order structure in the sequences from a given family of proteins In biological terms this corresponds to identifying the core elements of homologous molecules The model provides additional information such as the probability of initiating an insertion at any position in the model and the probability of extending it The structure of the model is similar to that of a pro le Waterman Perlwitz Barton Sternberg Gribskov et al Bowie et al L uthy et al but slightly more general Once we have built the model from unaligned sequences we can generate a multiple alignment of the sequences using a dynamic programming method By employing it for database searching the model can be used to discriminate sequences that belong to a given family from non members Finally we can study the model we have found directly and see what it reveals about the common structure underlying the various sequences in the family\nOur method of multiple alignment di ers quite markedly from conventional techniques which are usually based on pairwise alignments generated by dynamic programming schemes Waterman Feng Doolittle Barton Subbiah Harrison The\nalignments produced by these methods often depend strongly on the particular values of the parameters required by the method in particular the gap penalties Vingron Argos Furthermore a given set of sequences is likely to possess both fairly conserved re gions and highly variable regions yet conventional global methods assign identical penalties for all regions of the sequences Substitutions insertions or deletions in a region of high conservation should ideally be penalized more than in a variable region and some kinds of substitutions should be penalized di erently in one position compared to another That is one of the motivations for the present work The statistical model we propose corresponds to multiple alignment with variable position dependent gap penalties Furthermore these penalties are in large part learned from the data itself Essentially we build a statistical model during the process of multiple alignment rather than leaving this as a separate task to be done after the alignment is completed We believe the model should guide the alignment as much as the alignment determines the model\nWe are not the rst group to employ hidden Markov models in computational biology Lander and Green used hidden Markov models in the construction of genetic linkage maps Other work employed HMMs to distinguish coding from non coding regions in DNA Churchill Later simple HMMs were used in conjunction with the EM algorithm to model certain protein binding sites in DNA Lawrence Reilly Cardon Stormo and more recently to model the N caps and C caps of alpha helices in proteins D Morris unpublished These applications of HMMs and the EM Expectation Maximization algorithm including our own presage a more widespread use of this technique in computa tional biology During the time that we have been developing this approach several related e orts have come to our attention One is that of White Stultz and Smith who use HMMs to model protein superfamilies This work is more ambitious than our own since superfamilies are harder to characterize than families It is not yet clear how successful their work has been since no results are reported for sequences not in the training set If there are weaknesses in their method it is possible that these are due to the use of hand crafted models and reliance on prealigned data for parameter estimation In contrast our models have a simple regular structure and we are able to estimate all the parameters of these models including the size of the model directly from unaligned training sequences Interestingly enough they independently propose an alternate HMM state structure similar to ours in section of their paper where they discuss the relationship of their work to but they do not pursue this further It is possible that the type of models we use may work better for characterizing superfamilies than those investigated by White et al However it is more likely that they are too simple and that richer and more varied state structure along the lines they propose is required for this problem We recently found that Asai Hayamizu and Onizuka have applied HMMs to the problem of predicting the secondary structure of proteins obtaining prediction rates that are competitive with previous methods in some cases Asai K and Hayamizu S and Onizuka K In addition Tanaka Ishikawa Asai and Konagaya also discuss the relationship between the HMM method for obtaining multiple alignments and previous methods Tanaka et al Finally in work\nInstead of using delete states they have direct transitions between each pair of match states mi and mj with i j\nmost closely related to our own since the timewe presented a preliminary report on this work Haussler Krogh see also Haussler et al Baldi et al have further demon strated the usefulness of this technique by producing multiple alignments for immunoglobins and protease as well as globins and kinases Baldi et al\nMethods\nHMM Architecture\nConsider a family of protein sequences that all have a common three dimensional structure for example the globins The common structure in these sequences can be de ned as a sequence of positions in space where amino acids occur In the case of globins whose structure contains principally helices the or so helical positions have been named A A A B etc where the letter denotes the helix and the number indicates the location within that helix see for example Bashford et al For each of these positions there is a distinct probability distribution over the amino acids that measures the likelihood of each amino acid occurring in that position in a typical globin as well as the probability that there is no amino acid in that position i e that a sequence belonging to this family may have a gap at that position in a multiple alignment These have been called pro les Waterman Perlwitz Barton Sternberg Gribskov et al Bowie et al L uthy et al A pro le of globins can be thought of as a statistical model for the family of globins in that for any sequence of amino acids it de nes a probability for that sequence in such a way that globin sequences tend to have much higher probabilities than non globin sequences\nThe type of hidden Markov model we use as a statistical model for a protein family can be viewed as a generalized pro le However instead of describing the HMM directly in terms of the probability it assigns to each protein sequence we nd that it is easier to rst think of an HMM as a structure that generates protein sequences by a random process This structure and corresponding random process is illustrated in Figure and can be described as follows\nThe main line of the HMM contains a sequence of M states which we call match states corresponding to positions in a protein or columns in a multiple alignment M equals in gure Each of these states can generate a letter x from the letter amino acid alphabet according to a distribution P xjmk k M The notation P xjmk means that each of the match states mk k M have distinct distributions For each match state mk there is a delete state dk that does not produce any amino acid but is a dummy state used to skip mk Finally there are a total of M insert states to either side of the match states which generate amino acids in exactly the same way as the match states but use probability distributions P xjik In Figure match delete and insert states are shown as boxes circles and diamonds respectively For convenience we have added a dummy BEGIN state and a dummy END state denoted m and mM respectively which do not produce any amino\nThey have developed a variant of the method described here that employs a gradient descent training algorithm in place of the EM algorithm\nx Amino acid s Sequence of amino acids s x x L Length of sequence q r State in HMM path A sequence of states q qN N Number of states in a path M Length of model m i d Match insert and delete states m mM Begin and end states P xjq Probability distribution of amino acids in state q T rjq Probability of a transition from state q to r\nTable Notation\nacid From each state there are three possible transitions to other states also shown in Figure Transitions into match or delete states always move forward in the model whereas transitions into insert states do not Note that multiple insertions between match states can occur since the self loop on the insert state allows a transition from the insert state to itself The transition probability from state q to state r is called T rjq Our notation is summarized in Table\nA sequence can be generated by a random walk through the model as follows Com mencing at state m BEGIN choose a transition to m d or i randomly according to the probabilities T m jm T d jm and T i jm If m is chosen generate the rst amino acid x from the probability distribution P xjm and choose a transition to the next state according to probabilities T jm where indicates any possible next state If this next state is the insert state i then generate amino acid x from P xji and select the next state from T ji If delete d is chosen next generate no amino acid and choose the next state from T jd Continue in this manner all the way to the END state generating a sequence of amino acids x x xL by following a path of states q q qN qN through the model where q m the BEGIN state and qN mM the END state Because the delete states do not produce any amino acid N is larger than or equal to L If qi is a match or insert state we de ne l i to be the index in the sequence x xL of the amino acid produced in state qi The probability of the event that the path q qN is taken and the sequence x xL is generated is\nProb x xL q qN jmodel T mN jqN NY\ni\nT qijqi P xl i jqi\nwhere we set P xl i jqi if qi is a delete state The probability of any sequence x xL of amino acids is a sum over all possible paths that could produce that sequence which we write as follows\nProb x xLjmodel X\npaths q qN\nProb x xL q qN jmodel\nIn this way a probability distribution on the space of sequences is de ned The goal is to nd a model i e a proper model length and probability parameters that accurately describes a family of proteins by assigning large probabilities to sequences in that family\nThis particular structure for the HMM was chosen because it is the simplest model that captures the structural intuition of a protein a a sequence of positions each with its own distribution over the amino acids b the possibility for either skipping a position or inserting extra amino acids between consecutive positions and c allowing for the possibility that continuing an insertion or deletion is more likely than starting one This choice appears to have worked well for modeling the protein families that we have examined but other types of HMMs may be better at other tasks e g the more elaborate models for protein superfamilies used in White et al Stultz et al The important feature of the HMM method is its generality One can choose any structure for the states and transitions that is appropriate for the problem at hand Examples of more general HMM architectures are given in Sections and below\nEstimating the parameters of an HMM from training se\nquences\nAll the parameters in the HMM i e the transition probabilities and the amino acid distribu tions could in principle be chosen by hand from an existing alignment of protein sequences as in Gribskov et al White et al Stultz et al or from information about the three dimensional structure of proteins as in Bowie et al White et al Stultz et al The novel approach we take is to learn the parameters entirely automatically from a set of unaligned primary sequences using an EM algorithm This approach can in principle nd the model that best describes a given set of sequences\nGiven a set of training sequences s s n one can see how well a model ts them by calculating the probability that it generates them This probability is simply a product of terms of the form given by i e\nProb sequencesjmodel nY\nj\nProb s j jmodel\nwhere each term Prob s j jmodel is calculated by substituting x xL s j in eq This is called the likelihood of the model One would like this value to be high The maximum likelihood ML method of model estimation is to nd the model that maximizes the likelihood\nAn alternate approach to ML estimation is the maximum a posteriori MAP approach Here we assume a prior probability distribution over all possible parameters of the model embodying prior beliefs on what a model should be like This can then be used to penalize models that are known to be bad or uninteresting We discuss this further in Section In MAP estimation we try to maximize the posterior probability of the model given the sequences Using Bayes rule the posterior probability can be calculated as\nProb modeljsequences Prob sequencesjmodel Prob model\nProb sequences\nHere Prob model is the prior probability distribution and Prob sequences can be viewed as a normalizing constant Since this normalizing constant is independent of the model MAP estimation is equivalent to maximizing\nProb sequencesjmodel Prob model\nover all possible models The MAP approach is closely related to minimumdescription length Jurka Milosavljevic and minimum message length Allison et al methods\nThere is no known e cient way to directly calculate the best HMM model either in the ML or MAP sense However there are algorithms that given an arbitrary starting point nd a local maximum by iteratively re estimating the model in such a way that the likelihood or the posterior probability increases in each iteration The most common one is the Baum Welch or forward backward algorithm Rabiner Lawrence Reilly which is a version of the general EM method often used in statistics Dempster et al The process of the EM algorithm can be viewed as an iterative adaptation of the model to t the training sequences The steps in this process can be summarized as follows\nAn initial model is created by assigning values to the transition probability T rjq and the amino acid generation probability P xjq for each x q and r where x is one of the amino acids and q and r are states in the HMM connected by a transition arc If one already knows some features present in the sequences or constraints on the sequences these may sometimes be encoded in the initial model The current model is set to this initial model\nUsing the current model all possible paths for each training sequence are considered in order to get a new estimate T rjq of the transition probability T rjq and a new estimate P xjq of the amino acid generation probability P xjq for each x q and r The transition probability estimate T rjq is obtained by counting the number of times a transition is made from state q to r for all paths of all training sequences weighted by the probability of the path The estimate P xjq is made in a similar manner by counting the number of times the amino acid x is aligned to the state q\nIn the next step of maximum likelihood estimation a new current model is created by simply replacing T rjq by T rjq and P xjq by P xjq for each x q and r In MAP EM estimation the parameters T rjq and P xjq are further modi ed by considering the prior probability of the model before they are used to replace the old parameters\nStep and are repeated until the parameters of the current model change only insigni cantly\nSince the quality of the current model as measured by or increases in each iteration and no model is arbitrarily good the process eventually terminates and produces a model that is at least locally the best model for the training sequences to within some speci ed precision of the parameters Dempster et al Typically this occurs very rapidly e g in less than ten iterations even for large models and large sets of training sequences\nThe main computational bottleneck in the algorithm is step since individually exam ining each possible path for every training sequence would generally take time exponential in the length of the longest training sequence However it is possible to use a dynamic programming technique known as the forward backward procedure to speed up this step Using this method the new parameter estimates can be calculated in time proportional to the number of states in the model multiplied by the total length of all the training sequences Details are given in the excellent tutorial article on HMMs by Rabiner\nThe forward part of the forward backward procedure can also be used to e ciently com pute log Prob sequencejmodel the negative logarithm of the probability of a sequence given the model as de ned in without summing over all possible paths for the se quence Rabiner We call this the negative log likelihood NLL score of the sequence The average NLL score of a training sequence is inversely related to the likelihood of the model given by and hence serves as a numerical measure of progress for each iteration of the EM procedure The NLL score can also be used to evaluate how well the model ts a novel test sequence not present in the training set as described in Section below\nThe Viterbi algorithm and multiple alignment from an HMM\nThe forward backward procedure is related to the dynamic programming technique used to align one sequence to another or more generally to align a sequence to a pro le A variant of the forward backward procedure known as the Viterbi algorithm is similar to the stan dard pro le alignment algorithm Waterman Perlwitz Barton Sternberg Gribskov et al Instead of calculating the NLL score for a sequence which implic itly involves all possible paths for that sequence through the model the Viterbi algorithm computes the negative logarithm of the probability of the single most likely path for the sequence We can write this as\nlogmax paths Prob s pathjmodel\nwhere Prob s pathjmodel is given in with s x xL and path q qN Instead of rst maximizing the probability of the path and then taking the negative logarithm it is convenient and equivalent to simply minimize the negative logarithm of the probability over all paths This minimum we will call the distance from the sequence to the model\ndist s model min paths f log Prob s pathjmodel g\nmin paths\nN X\ni\nlog T qijqi logP xl i jqi\nThis distance from a sequence to a model is analogous to the standard edit distance from one sequence to another with gap penalties see e g Waterman but is perhaps more related to the distance from a sequence to a pro le The term logP xl i jqi represents a penalty for aligning the amino acid xl i to the position represented by state qi in the model The term log T qijqi corresponds to a penalty for using the transition from qi to qi in the model If this is a transition from a match state to a delete state then this represents a\ngap initiation penalty if it is from a delete state to a delete state it represents a gap extension penalty if it is from a match state to an insert state it represents an insertion initiation penalty and if it is a transition from an insertion state to itself a self loop then it represents an insertion extension penalty One of the main features of this distance measure is that all these penalties depend on the position in the model whereas they would be xed in most standard pairwise alignment methods Often the most likely path has a signi cantly higher probability than all other paths and in that case the distance de ned here will be approximately equal to the NLL score de ned earlier\nThe computation time for the Viterbi algorithm is proportional to the number of states in the model multiplied by the length of the sequence being aligned i e the same as the time for the forward backward algorithm In addition with a simple extension to the algorithm the most probable path itself can be found using the usual backtracking technique Rabiner This is the method we use to obtain our multiple alignments each sequence is aligned to the model by the Viterbi algorithm after which the mutual alignment of the sequences among themselves is then determined\nUsing the HMM to cluster sequences and discover subfami\nlies\nWhen a relatively large number of sequences are available it is sometimes possible to obtain improved results by dividing these sequences into clusters of similar sequences and training a di erent HMM for each cluster subfamily The results of this are illustrated in more detail in Section Given a large set of unlabeled and unaligned sequences a simple extension of the hidden Markov model enables us to use the EM training algorithm to automatically partition the sequences into clusters of similar sequences By iteratively splitting clusters this method might be useful for building phylogenetic trees in a top down manner However when the clusters become too small there will be an insu cient number of sequences in each cluster to construct an accurate model so some bottom up processing may still be necessary\nIn order to discover w clusters in the data we make w copies of the HMM one for each cluster We call these components of the composite HMM Presently the number w of clusters and the initial lengths of the models for these clusters are determined empirically We then add a new begin state with w outgoing transitions one to each of the begin states of the component HMMs see Figure\nThis new begin state is analogous to the other begin states in that it generates no amino acid We then train this composite model with the EM algorithm as described in Section The EM reestimation of a component model is the same as the reestimation of a single model except that the weight that a sequence has in the reestimation of a component is proportional to the probability of the sequence given that component model Thus sequences that have better NLL scores for a particular HMM component have greater in uence in reestimating the parameters of that component and this causes the parameters of that component to change in such a way that the component further specializes in modeling those sequences The surgery procedure described below in Section is used to adapt the length of that\nWe make no attempt to align portions of the sequence that use the insert states of the model\ncomponent to further specialize it In this manner the individual components evolve during training to represent clusters in the training sequences This way of using EM is called mixture modeling in the statistics literature Duda Hart Everitt Hand and is known as ! soft competitive learning\" in the neural network literature Nowlan\nWhen the model is trained the probability of a sequence given any of the submod els can be calculated i e the probability that the sequence belongs to the corresponding cluster subclass The negative logarithm of this probability corresponds to the NLL score calculated for a simple HMM As with the standard HMM we use this yields a quantitative measure of how well the model ts the data The clusters found can also be compared to known subfamilies of the sequences Experiments with the clustering of globin sequences are described in Section\nModeling protein domains with an HMM\nThere are many cases when one does not want to build a statistical model of a family of whole proteins like globins but instead to build a model of a structural motif or domain that occurs as a subsequence in many di erent kinds of proteins such as the EF hand motif Nakayama et al or the kinase catalytic domain Hanks Quinn Here we expect our model to only match a relatively small subsequence of any given protein with many other unmatched amino acids appearing before and after this subsequence One approach to this problem is to alter the dynamic programming method used to align a sequence to a model so that it tries all possible ways of aligning each subsequence of the sequence to a model Waterman We use a simpler but almost equivalent method in which only the HMM model is altered so that the same standard procedures forward backward and Viterbi which we use for models of whole proteins can be used without modi cation for models of domains\nConsider a training set of many unaligned sequences consisting not of complete proteins but of a speci c domain Our rst step is to train an HMM for these sequences exactly as described earlier As shown in Figure this HMM will have initial and nal dummy match states m and mN where N in Figure that do not match any amino acid To alter the HMM to represent a protein domain we create two new insert states iB and iE adding iB to the model before the state m and iE at the end of the model after mN see Figure\nWe then add a new dummy BEGIN state before iB and a new dummy END state after iE Eight new transitions are also added to the model The rst four are from BEGIN to iB from mN to iE and the self loops from iB to itself and from iE to itself These all have the same probability p for some p between and The second four transitions are from iB to m from BEGIN to m from iE to END and from mN to END These all have probability p The new states added before and after the model along with these transitions form two new modules one for matching the extra amino acids that occur in the sequence before the domain and the other for matching the amino acids after the domain\nThe choice of the parameter p does a ect the way that the overall model aligns with a given sequence To see how it is convenient to think of the negative logarithm of the probability of a transition as a penalty for using that transition as described in Section\nIn the modi ed model all sequences must su er a penalty of log p to enter and again to exit the domain part of the model no matter which path they take Hence this penalty is a xed cost which can be ignored when comparing the distances or NLL scores of two sequences with respect to the model In addition to this penalty all sequences will su er a penalty of K log p log where K is the number of amino acids that are not matched to the original domain model but are instead matched in the states iB and iE The log term arises because we set the probabilities of each amino acid to in the insertion states iB and iE see Section Thus p will determine the !pressure\" on the sequence to align something to the domain model i e if p is low it advantageous to squeeze many amino acids into the domain model using the insert states in this part of the model If it is high it is possible that most sequences would prefer to pass through the delete states in the domain model aligning everything instead to the new modules before and after it It is straightforward to estimate p the same way as all the other parameters the only additional problem is that the same value must be used in all the transitions that use this value !tying\" these parameters to each other Otherwise the model might become biased towards aligning the domain either near the beginning of the sequence or near the end of the sequence We have not attempted to estimate p Rather we have used a xed p with good results This should be thought of as a limit of p approaching otherwise log p is in nite\nUsing this construction it may also be possible to discover interesting domains by training on whole protein sequences and letting EM determine which part of the proteins to model Furthermore if more than one occurrence of the same domain is expected in some sequences then this model can be further modi ed to nd all occurrences This is accomplished by simply adding a transition from the END state back to the BEGIN state\nSearching a database with an HMM\nOnce an HMM is built for a family of proteins it can be used to search a database such as PIR or SWISS PROT for other proteins in this family Similarly if an HMM is built for a protein domain or motif then it can be used to search for occurrences of this domain or motif in the database much like a PROSITE expression Bairoch a commonly used method for searching for patterns found in protein sequences Like a pro le Waterman Perlwitz Barton Sternberg Gribskov et al Bowie et al L uthy et al an HMM has an advantage over a PROSITE expression for database searches because it takes into account a large amount of statistical information in matching a sequence and weighs this information appropriately rather than relying on relatively rigid matching rules\nAs described in Section the forward part of the forward backward dynamic program ming method calculates a NLL score for any test sequence that measures how well it ts the model This NLL score is the negative logarithm of the probability of the sequence given the model It turns out that this raw NLL score is too dependent on the length of the test sequence to be used directly to decide if the sequence is in the family modeled by the HMM or not However we can overcome this problem by normalizing this NLL score appropriately\nWhenever we build an HMM for a family of proteins or for a protein domain we run all the proteins in a standard database for instance SWISS PROT through this HMM and compute the NLL score for each sequence A scatter plot of sequence length versus\nNLL score for our kinase catalytic domain model is given in Figure Most proteins tend to lie on a fairly straight line towards the top of the plot indicating that the NLL score for these proteins is proportional to their lengths These proteins are the ones that do not contain the kinase catalytic domain and thus look like random proteins to the kinase catalytic domain model In contrast the proteins that do contain the kinase catalytic domain tend to have NLL scores that are much lower than expected for proteins of their length and hence appear below the linear band of non kinase proteins\nWe can quantify the di erence between NLL scores for proteins containing the kinase catalytic domain and NLL scores for proteins not containing the domain by a simple sta tistical method as follows Using a local windowing technique we rst calculate a smooth average curve for the roughly linear band of the NLL score versus length plot The standard deviation around this average curve is also calculated Using this we calculate the di erence between the NLL score of a sequence and the average NLL score of typical sequences of that same length measured in standard deviations This number is called the Z score for the sequence We then choose a Z score cut o either a priori or by looking at the histogram of Z scores for sequences in the database see Figure and use it to decide if a given sequence ts the model or not We have found that a Z score of approximately appears a good choice in most cases we have examined but we suggest carefully checking the his togram by eye before deciding on a cuto For example for our HMM of the kinase catalytic domain sequences with Z scores below are classi ed as not containing the kinase catalytic domain and sequences with Z scores above are classi ed as containing the catalytic do main If the Z score of a sequence indicates that it contains the catalytic domain we can align the sequence to the catalytic domain HMM to nd out where this domain occurs in the sequence The time it takes to do a database search is proportional to the numbers of residues in the database times the length of the model For our globin model length we can search the SWISS PROT database about residues in approximately CPU hours on a Sun Sparcstation Using the shorter EF hand model length it takes only CPU seconds user minutes on a Sun Sparcstation A parallel implemetation of the search procedure not yet implemented will speed up these searches substantially as it has the EM training procedure\nWhile the statistical techniques we have used to determine Z scores are still quite crude we have found that the HMMs are su ciently good models that these techniques work well enough in practice However it may be that more sophisticated techniques are needed in certain cases\nThe average curve is calculated as follows For each length i starting at i the length li is computed such that there are at least proteins of lengths i to li and less than proteins of lengths i to li The length interval i to li is called a window The average curve is piecewise linear through the points corresponding to the average length and average NLL score for each window The rst and last parts of the curve are calculated by linear regression in the rst and last window respectively The standard deviation of the points from the smooth curve is also calculated for each window The estimate of the average curve can be improved by eliminating outliers i e NLL scores that lie many standard deviations from the average We iterate the process of removing outliers and reestimating the average curve until no more outliers remain\nInitial model local minima and choice of model length\nAs mentioned in Section when estimating the model from the training sequences the EM algorithm does not guarantee convergence to the best model It is basically a steepest descent type algorithm that climbs the nearest peak local maximum of the likelihood func tion or the posterior probability in MAP estimation Since nding the globally optimal model seems to be a di cult optimization problem in general Abe Warmuth we have experimented with various heuristic methods to improve the performance of the method\nProbably the best method is to give the model a hint if something is already known about the sequences which is often the case A good starting point makes it much more likely that the nearest peak is at least close to optimal This is done by setting the probabilities in the initial model to values re ecting that knowledge If for instance an alignment of some of the sequences is available it is straightforward to translate that into a model by simply calculating the relative frequency of the amino acids and the transition frequencies in each position as in the pro le method Gribskov et al\nIt is of course even more interesting if the model can be found from a tabula rasa i e using no knowledge about the sequences For that we have used an initial model where all equivalent probabilities are the same i e T mkjmk is independent of the position k in the model and similarly for all other transition probabilities and P xjmk is also independent of k To avoid the smaller local maxima noise is added to the model during the iteration before each reestimation Initially quite a lot of noise is added but over ten iterations the noise is decreased linearly to zero Since noise is added directly to the model it is not like the usual implementation of simulated annealing but the principle is the same The annealing schedule is presently rather arbitrary but it does seem to give reasonable results if it is applied several times and the best of the models found is used as the nal model\nIt is important that the best model be selected since suboptimal models do produce inferior alignments in general However when studying alignments from suboptimal globin models we noted that they tend to align some regions well occasionally getting better alignments in those regions than the best overall model found while in other regions they are completely incorrect This leaves open the intriguing possibility of combining the best solutions found for di erent regions into a new overall best model We have not yet explored this possibility\nThe length of the model is also a crucial parameter that needs to be chosen a priori However we have developed a simple heuristic that selects a good model length and even helps in the problem of local maxima The heuristic is this After learning if more than a fraction del of the paths of the sequences choose dk the delete state at position k that position is removed from the model Similarly if more than a fraction ins make insertions at position k in state ik a number of new positions equal to the average number of insertions made at that position are inserted into the model after position k After these changes in"
