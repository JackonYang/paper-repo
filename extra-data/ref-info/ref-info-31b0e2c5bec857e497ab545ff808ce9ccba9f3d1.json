We show here that non-linear 'infomax', when applied to an ensemble of natural scenes, produces sets of visual filters that are localised and oriented. Some of these filters are Gabor-like and resemble those produced by the sparseness-maximisation network of Olshausen & Field (1996). In addition, the outputs of these filters are as independent as possible, since the infomax network is able to perform Independent Components Analysis (ICA). We compare the resulting ICA filters and their associated basis functions, with other decorrelating filters produced by Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and zero-phase whitening filters (ZCA). The ICA filters have more sparsely distributed (kurtotic) outputs on natural scenes. They also resemble the receptive fields of simple cells in visual cortex, which suggests that these neurons form an information-theoretic co-ordinate system for images."

In a scheme due to Gabor, an image is represented in terms of localized symmetrical and antisymmetrical elementary signals. Both measured receptive fields and measured spatial frequency tuning curves conform closely to the functional form of Gabor elementary signals. It is argued that the visual cortex representation corresponds closely to the Gabor scheme owing to its advantages in treating the subsequent problem of pattern recognition."

One approach to understanding such response properties of visual neurons has been to consider their relationship to the statistical structure of natural images in terms of efficient coding7\u201312. Along these lines, a number of studies have attempted to train unsupervised learning algorithms on natural images in the hope of developing receptive fields with similar properties13\u201318, but none has succeeded in producing a full set that spans the image space and contains all three of the above properties. Here we investigate the proposal8,12 that a coding strategy that maximizes sparseness is sufficient to account for these properties. We show that a learning algorithm that attempts to find sparse linear codes for natural scenes will develop a complete family of localized, oriented, bandpass receptive fields, similar to those found in the primary visual cortex. The resulting sparse image code provides a more efficient representation for later stages of processing because it possesses a higher degree of statistical independence among its outputs."

Here we will concentrate on the spatial properties of simple cells. Several hypotheses as to the function of these cells have been proposed. As the cells preferentially respond to oriented edges or lines, they can be viewed as edge or line detectors. Their joint localisation in both the spatial domain and the spatial frequency domain has led to the suggestion that they mimic Gabor filters, minimising uncertainty in both domains (Daugman 1980, Marcelja 1980). More recently, the match between the operations performed by simple cells and the wavelet transform has attracted attention (e.g., Field 1993). The approaches based on Gabor filters and wavelets basically consider processing by the visual cortex as a general image processing strategy, relatively independent of detailed assumptions about image statistics. On the other hand, the edge and line detector hypothesis is based on the intuitive notion that edges and lines are both abundant and important in images. This theme of relating simple cell properties with the statistics of natural images was explored extensively by Field (1987, 1994). He proposed that the cells are optimized specifically for coding natural images. He argued that one possibility for such a code, sparse coding, simplifies further processing in the visual system, because it produces a representation of the stimulus that helps detection of coincidences (Barlow 1972, 1994). Indeed, Olshausen & Field (1996) showed that imposing sparseness on the output of receptive fields being trained on natural images produced receptive fields similar to those of simple cells (see also Harpur 1997)."

To understand the representation of images by the mammalian visual system, it might therefore be useful to consider the statistics of images from the natural environment (i.e., images with trees, rocks, bushes, etc). In this study, various coding schemes are compared in relation to how they represent the information in such natural images. The coefficients of such codes are represented by arrays of mechanisms that respond to local regions of space, spatial frequency, and orientation (Gabor-like transforms). For many classes of image, such codes will not be an efficient means of representing information. However, the results obtained with six natural images suggest that the orientation and the spatial-frequency tuning of mammalian simple cells are well suited for coding the information in such images if the goal of the code is to convert higher-order redundancy (e.g., correlation between the intensities of neighboring pixels) into first-order redundancy (i.e., the response distribution of the coefficients). Such coding produces a relatively high signal-to-noise ratio and permits information to be transmitted with only a subset of the total number of cells. These results support Barlow's theory that the goal of natural vision is to represent the information in the natural environment with minimal redundancy."

We find that including a simple \"gain control\" nonlinearity in the filtering process makes the filter output quite Gaussian, meaning information is maximized at fixed channel variance. Finally, we use the measured power spectrum to place an upper bound on the information conveyed about natural scenes by an array of receptors."

Responses to small spots of light presented at different positions over the receptive field and responses to elongated bars of different orientations centred on the receptive field were recorded. 2. To test whether a linear model can account for orientation selectivity of cortical neurones, responses to elongated bars were compared with responses predicted by a linear model from the receptive field map obtained from flashing spots. 3. The linear model faithfully predicted the preferred orientation, but not the degree of orientation selectivity or the sharpness of orientation tuning. The ratio of optimal to non\u2010optimal responses was always underestimated by the model. 4. Thus non\u2010linear mechanisms, which can include suppression of non\u2010optimal responses and/or amplification of optimal responses, are involved in the generation of orientation selectivity in the primary visual cortex."

Comparing these measurements with the ICA results, we see that the distributions roughly match, despite the variabilit y in ICA results. This variabilit y should probably not be considered as just a random estimation error, but rather as an inherent property associated with systematic changes in the statistics of different ensembles of natural images. Therefore, we consider the standard deviation of the ICA histograms (rather than the standard error of the mean) as a rough but reasonable measure for the reliabilit y of the estimate. Below we will use this, together with the mean of the ICA histograms, for comparing the ICA results with various properties measured in simple cells. Figure 4(a) shows this for the same data as in Fig. 3. The error for each bin of the histogram of simple cells was estimated by taking the square root of the number of cells in each bin. Figure 4(a) shows that the calculated and measured distributions are roughly similar; a chi-square test yields p>0.26, which means that the hypothesis that the calculated and measured histograms are identical can not be rejected. The mean and the standard deviation of the spatial frequency bandwidths shown here are similar to those reported by Olshausen & Field (1996), although a direct comparison is not full y appropriate because they analyse basis functions rather than filters."

Here I compare measured neural images with theoretical calculations based on maximizing information, taking into account the statistical structure of natural images. Neural images were obtained by scanning an image while recording from a second-order neuron in the fly visual system. Over a 5.5-log-units-wide range of mean intensities, experiment and theory correspond well. At high mean intensities, redundancy in the image is reduced by spatial and temporal antagonism. At low mean intensities, spatial and temporal low-pass filtering combat noise and increase signal reliability."

A number of investigators have suggested that the line-weighting functions, as measured orthogonal to the preferred orientation, may be best described as the product of a Gaussian envelope and a sinusoid (i.e. a Gabor function). Following Gabor\u2019s theory of \u2018basis\u2019 functions, it has also been suggested that simple cells can be categorized into even-and odd-symmetric categories. Based on the receptive field profiles of 46 simple cells recorded from cat visual cortex, our analysis provides a quantitative description of both the receptive-field envelope and the receptive-field \u2018symmetry\u2019 of each of the 46 cells. The results support the notion that, to a first approximation, Gabor functions with three free parameters (envelope width, carrier frequency and carrier phase) provide a good description of the receptive-field profiles. However, our analysis does not support the notion that simple cells generally fit into even- and odd-symmetric categories."

Focusing on the linear cortical cells, we classify all transforms having these properties. They are given by representations of the scaling and translation group and turn out to be labeled by rational numbers (p q)/p (p, q integers). Any given (p, q) predicts a set of receptive fields that comes at different spatial locations and scales (sizes) with a bandwidth of log2 [(p q)/p] octaves and, most interestingly, with a diversity of q cell varieties. The bandwidth affects the trade-off between preservation of planar and depth relations and, we think, should be selected to match structures in natural scenes. For bandwidths between 1 and 2 octaves, which are the ones we feel provide the best matching, we find for each scale a minimum of two distinct cell types that reside next to each other and in phase quadrature, that is, differ by 90 in the phases of their receptive fields, as are found in the cortex, they resemble the even-symmetric and odd-symmetric simple cells in special cases. An interesting consequence of the representations presented here is that the pattern of activation in the cells in response to a translation or scaling of an object remains the same but merely shifts its locus from one group of cells to another. This work also provides a new understanding of color coding changes from the retina to the cortex."

Contextual modulation was studied using texture displays in which texture covering the receptive field (RF) was the same in all trials, but the perceptual context of this texture could vary depending on the configuration of extra-RF texture elements. We found robust contextual modulation when disparity, color, luminance, and orientation cues variously defined a textured figure centered on the RF of V1 neurons. We found contextual modulation to have a spatial extent of \u223c8 to 10\u00b0 diameter parafoveally. Contextual modulation correlated with perceptual experience of both binocularly rivalrous texture displays and of displays with a simple example of surface occlusion. We found contextual modulation in V1 to have a characteristic latency of 80\u2013100 msec after stimulus onset, potentially allowing feedback from extrastriate areas to underlie to this effect."

                "text": "A recent computational theory suggests that visual processing in the retina and the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) serves to recode information into an efficient form (Atick and Redlich, 1990). Information theoretic analysis showed that the representation of visual information at the level of the photoreceptors is inefficient, primarily attributable to a high degree of spatial and temporal correlation in natural scenes. It was predicted, therefore, that the retina and the LGN should recode this signal into a decorrelated form or, equivalently, into a signal with a \u201cwhite\u201d spatial and temporal power spectrum. In the present study, we tested directly the prediction that visual processing at the level of the LGN temporally whitens the natural visual input. We recorded the responses of individual neurons in the LGN of the cat to natural, time-varying images (movies) and, as a control, to white-noise stimuli. Although there is substantial temporal correlation in natural inputs (Dong and Atick, 1995b), we found that the power spectra of LGN responses were essentially white. Between 3 and 15 Hz, the power of the responses had an average variation of only \u00b110.3%. Thus, the signals that the LGN relays to visual cortex are temporarily decorrelated. Furthermore, the responses of X-cells to natural inputs can be well predicted from their responses to white-noise inputs. We therefore conclude that whitening of natural inputs can be explained largely by the linear filtering properties (Enroth-Cugell and Robson, 1966). Our results suggest that the early visual pathway is well adapted for efficient coding of information in the natural visual environment, in agreement with the prediction of the computational theory."

We propose that this organization enables the visual system to encode spatial detail in a manner that minimizes the deleterious effects of intrinsic noise, by exploiting the spatial correlation that exists within natural scenes. The antagonistic surround takes a weighted mean of the signals in neighbouring receptors to generate a statistical prediction of the signal at the centre. The predicted value is subtracted from the actual centre signal, thus minimizing the range of outputs transmitted by the centre. In this way the entire dynamic range of the interneuron can be devoted to encoding a small range of intensities, thus rendering fine detail detectable against intrinsic noise injected at later stages in processing. This predictive encoding scheme also reduces spatial redundancy, thereby enabling the array of interneurons to transmit a larger number of distinguishable images, taking into account the expected structure of the visual world. The profile of the required inhibitory field is derived from statistical estimation theory. This profile depends strongly upon the signal: noise ratio and weakly upon the extent of lateral spatial correlation. The receptive fields that are quantitatively predicted by the theory resemble those of X-type retinal ganglion cells and show that the inhibitory surround should become weaker and more diffuse at low intensities. The latter property is unequivocally demonstrated in the first-order interneurons of the fly\u2019s compound eye. The theory is extended to the time domain to account for the phasic responses of fly interneurons. These comparisons suggest that, in the early stages of processing, the visual system is concerned primarily with coding the visual image to protect against subsequent intrinsic noise, rather than with reconstructing the scene or extracting specific features from it. The treatment emphasizes that a neuron\u2019s dynamic range should be matched to both its receptive field and the statistical properties of the visual pattern expected within this field. Finally, the analysis is synthetic because it is an extension of the background suppression hypothesis (Barlow & Levick 1976), satisfies the redundancy reduction hypothesis (Barlow 1961 a, b) and is equivalent to deblurring under certain conditions (Ratliff 1965)."

Focusing on the {\\it linear} cortical cells, we classify all transforms having these properties. They are given by representations of the scaling and translation group, and turn out to be labeled by rational numbers `$(p+q)/p$' ($p, q$ integers). Any given $(p,q)$ predicts a set of receptive fields which come at different spatial locations and scales (sizes) with a bandwidth of $\\log_2[(p+q)/p]$ octaves, and, most interestingly, with a diversity of `$q$' cell varieties. The bandwidth affects the trade-off between preservation of planar and depth relations, and, we think, should be selected to match structures in natural scenes. For bandwidths between $1$ and $2$ octaves, which are the ones we feel provide the best matching, we find for each scale a minimum of two distinct cell types that reside next to each other and in phase quadrature, i.e., differ by $90^o$ in the phases of their receptive fields, as are found in the cortex, they resemble the ``even-symmetric'' and ``odd-symmetric'' simple cells in special cases. An interesting consequence of the representations presented here is that the pattern of activation in the cells in response to a translation or scaling of an object remains the same but merely shifts its locus from one group of cells to another. This work also provides a new understanding of color coding changes from the retina to the cortex."

                "text": "1. Most studies of cortical neurons have focused on the spatial structure of receptive fields. For a more complete functional description of these neurons, it is necessary to consider receptive-field structure in the joint domain of space and time. We have studied the spatiotemporal receptive-field structure of 233 simple cells recorded from the striate cortex of adult cats and kittens at 4 and 8 wk postnatal. The dual goal of this study is to provide a detailed quantitative description of spatiotemporal receptive-field structure and to compare the developmental time courses of spatial and temporal response properties. 2. Spatiotemporal receptive-field profiles have been measured with the use of a reverse correlation method, in which we compute the cross-correlation between a neuron's response and a random sequence of small, briefly presented bright and dark stimuli. The receptive-field profiles of some simple cells are space-time separable, meaning that spatial and temporal response characteristics can be dissociated. Other cells have receptive-field profiles that are space-time inseparable. In these cases, a particular spatial location cannot be designated, unambiguously, as belonging to either an on or off subregion. However, separate on and off subregions may be clearly distinguished in the joint space-time domain. These subregions are generally tilted along an oblique axis. 3. Our observations show that spatial and temporal aspects of receptive-field structure mature with clearly different time courses. By 4 wk postnatal, the spatial symmetry and periodicity of simple-cell receptive fields have reached maturity. The spatial extent (or size) of these receptive fields is adult-like by 8 wk postnatal. In contrast, the response latency and time duration of spatiotemporal receptive fields do not mature until well beyond 8 wk postnatal. 4. By applying Fourier analysis to spatiotemporal receptive-field profiles, we have examined the postnatal development of spatial and temporal selectivity in the frequency domain. By 8 wk postnatal, spatial frequency tuning has clearly reached maturity. On the contrary, temporal frequency selectivity remains markedly immature at 8 wk. We have also examined the joint distribution of optimal spatial and temporal frequencies. From 4 wk postnatal until 8 wk postnatal, the range of optimal spatial frequencies increases substantially, whereas the range of optimal temporal frequencies remains largely unchanged. From 8 wk postnatal until adulthood, there is a large increase in optimal temporal frequencies for cells tuned to low spatial frequencies. For cells tuned to high spatial frequencies, the distribution of optimal temporal frequencies does not change much beyond 8 wk postnatal.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

                "text": "A number of recent attempts have been made to describe early sensory coding in terms of a general information processing strategy. In this paper, two strategies are contrasted. Both strategies take advantage of the redundancy in the environment to produce more effective representations. The first is described as a compact coding scheme. A compact code performs a transform that allows the input to be represented with a reduced number of vectors (cells) with minimal RMS error. This approach has recently become popular in the neural network literature and is related to a process called Principal Components Analysis (PCA). A number of recent papers have suggested that the optimal compact code for representing natural scenes will have units with receptive field profiles much like those found in the retina and primary visual cortex. However, in this paper, it is proposed that compact coding schemes are insufficient to account for the receptive field properties of cells in the mammalian visual pathway. In contrast, it is proposed that the visual system is near to optimal in representing natural scenes only if optimality is defined in terms of sparse distributed coding. In a sparse distributed code, all cells in the code have an equal response probability across the class of images but have a low response probability for any single image. In such a code, the dimensionality is not reduced. Rather, the redundancy of the input is transformed into the redundancy of the firing pattern of cells. It is proposed that the signature for a sparse code is found in the fourth moment of the response distribution (i.e., the kurtosis). In measurements with 55 calibrated natural scenes, the kurtosis was found to peak when the bandwidths of the visual code matched those of cells in the mammalian visual cortex. Codes resembling wavelet transforms are proposed to be effective because the response histograms of such codes are sparse (i.e., show high kurtosis) when presented with natural scenes. It is proposed that the structure of the image that allows sparse coding is found in the phase spectrum of the image. It is suggested that natural scenes, to a first approximation, can be considered as a sum of self-similar local functions (the inverse of a wavelet). Possible reasons for why sensory systems would evolve toward sparse coding are presented."

The principle states that the input-output mapping implemented by a processing stage should be chosen so as to maximize the average mutual information between input and output patterns, subject to constraints and in the presence of processing noise. In the present work I show how infomax, when applied to a class of nonlinear input-output mappings, can under certain conditions generate optimal filters that have additional useful properties: (1) Output activity (for each input pattern) tends to be concentrated among a relatively small number of nodes. (2) The filters are sensitive to higher-order statistical structure (beyond pairwise correlations). If the input features are localized, the filters' receptive fields tend to be localized as well. (3) Multiresolution sets of filters with subsampling at low spatial frequencies - related to pyramid coding and wavelet representations - emerge as favored solutions for certain types of input ensembles."

This redundancy reduction between components relates independent component analysis to many other theoretical and practical areas of science that are concerned with information, such as information theory, compression, sensory coding and pattern recognition. One of the rst cases where the principle of redundancy reduction was presented was the analysis of the human visual system. Ever since the rst time this idea was brought up, there has existed a need to study the reduction of statistical dependencies in images. A set of new algorithms for independent component analysis has been developed during the 1990's. Some of these have been applied to image data, but no larger investigation has been performed to determine the properties and limitations of the method to solve this problem. In this master's thesis the applicability of independent component analysis to analyze statistical dependencies in images has been explored. This has been done by applying some of the new algorithms to image data. The relevant properties of the resulting components have been studied, as well as their connections with closely connected areas of information science."

We investigate the empirical evidence for this further and argue that filters can produce 'interesting' output distributions simply because natural images have variable local intensity variance. If the proposed filters have zero DC, then the probability distribution of filter outputs (and hence the output Kurtosis) is well predicted simply from these effects of variable local variance. This suggests that finding filters with high output Kurtosis does not necessarily signal interesting image structure. It is then argued that finding filters that maximize output Kurtosis generates filters that are incompatible with observed physiology. In particular the optimal difference-of-Gaussian (DOG) filter should have the smallest possible scale, an on-centre off-surround cell should have a negative DC, and that the ratio of centre width to surround width should approach unity. This is incompatible with the physiology. Further, it is also predicted that oriented filters should always be oriented in the vertical direction, and of all the filters tested, the filter with the highest output Kurtosis has the lowest signal-to-noise ratio (the filter is simply the difference of two neighbouring pixels). Whilst these observations are not incompatible with the brain using a sparse representation, it does argue that little significance should be placed on finding filters with highly Kurtotic output distributions. It is therefore argued that other constraints are required in order to understand the development of visual receptive fields."

Estimation of ICA is usually performed by optimizing a 'contrast' function based on higher-order cumulants. In this paper, it is shown how almost any error function can be used to construct a contrast function to perform the ICA estimation. In particular, this means that one can use contrast functions that are robust against outliers. As a practical method for nding the relevant extrema of such contrast functions, a xed-point iteration scheme is then introduced. The resulting algorithms are quite simple and converge fast and reliably. These algorithms also enable estimation of the independent components one-by-one, using a simple de ation scheme."

Analysis of the resulting trial-to-trial fluctuations in postsynaptic response can provide estimates both of the number of quanta released and of the size of their postsynaptic effect. This in turn permits the quantification of the relative contributions of pre- and postsynaptic factors to the strength of a given synapse. Quantal analysis of excitatory synapses in the hippocampus has proved difficult2\u20136 and has led to contradictory conclusions when applied to long-term potentiation7\u201314. Here we report the use of a combination of quantal analysis procedures to provide evidence that both pre- and postsynaptic changes can contribute substantially to the maintenance of long-term potentiation in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. The initial setting of the presynaptic release mechanism seems to determine their relative importance."
