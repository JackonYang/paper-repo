They use the kd-tree data structure to reduce the large number of nearest-neighbor queries issued by the traditional algorithm. Sufficient statistics are stored in the nodes of the kd-tree. Then an analysis of the geometry of the current cluster centers results in great reduction of the work needed to update the centers. Our algorithms behave exactly as the traditional k-means algorithm. Proofs of correctness are included. The kd-tree can also be used to initialize the k-means starting centers efficiently. Our algorithms can be easily extended to provide fast ways of computing the error of a given cluster assignment regardless of the method in which those clusters were obtained. We also show how to use them in a setting which allows approximate clustering results, with the benefit of running faster. We have implemented and tested our algorithms on both real and simulated data. Results show a speedup factor of up to 170 on real astrophysical data, and superiority over the naive algorithm on simulated data in up to 5 dimensions. Our algorithms scale well with respect to the number of points and number of centers allowing for clustering with tens of thousands of centers."

                "text": "This paper describes two simple modification of K-means and related algorithms for clustering, that improve the running time without changing the output. The two resulting algorithms are called Compare-means and Sort-means. The time for an iteration of K-means is reduced from O(ndk), where n is the number of data points, k the number of clusters and d the dimension, to O(nd? + k2d + k2 log k) for Sort-means. Here ? ? k is the average over all points p of the number of means that are no more than twice as far as p is from the mean p was assigned to in the previous iteration. Compare-means performs a similar number of distance calculations as Sort-means, and is faster when the number of means is very large. Both modifications are extremely simple, and could easily be added to existing clustering implementations.We investigate the empirical performance of the algorithms on three datasets drawn from practical applications. As a primary test case, we use the Isodata variant of K-means on a sample of 2.3 million 6-dimensional points drawn from a Landsat-7 satellite image. For this dataset, ? quickly drops to less than log2 k, and the running time decreases accordingly. For example, a run with k = 100 drops from an hour and a half to sixteen minutes for Compare-means and six and a half minutes for Sortmeans. Further experiments show similar improvements on datasets derived from a forestry application and from the analysis of BGP updates in an IP network."

It organizes all the patterns in a k-d tree structure such that one can find all the patterns which are closest to a given prototype efficiently. The main intuition behind our approach is as follows. All the prototypes are potential candidates for the closest prototype at the root level. However, for the children of the root node, we may be able to prune the candidate set by using simple geometrical constraints. This approach can be applied recursively until the size of the candidate set is one for each node. Our experimental results demonstrate that our scheme can improve the computational speed of the direct k-means algorithm by an order to two orders of magnitude in the total number of distance calculations and the overall time of computation."

Experiments show that the new method is several times faster than standard k-means, and that it produces clusterings of equal or almost equal quality. The new method is a simpli cation of an algorithm due to Bradley, Fayyad and Reina that uses several data compression techniques in an attempt to improve speed and clustering quality. Unfortunately, the overhead of these techniques makes the original algorithm several times slower than standard k-means on materialized datasets, even though standard k-means scans a dataset multiple times. Also, lesion studies show that the compression techniques do not improve clustering quality. All results hold for 400 megabyte synthetic datasets and for a dataset created from the real-world data used in the 1998 KDD data mining contest. All algorithm implementations and experiments are designed so that results generalize to datasets of many gigabytes and larger."

Given a set of n data points in R(exp d) and an integer k, the problem is to determine a set of k points R(exp d), called centers, so as to minimize the mean squared distance from each data point to its nearest center. A popular heuristic for k-means clustering is Lloyd's algorithm. In this paper, we present a simple and efficient implementation of Lloyd's k-means clustering algorithm, which we call the filtering algorithm. This algorithm is very easy to implement. It differs from most other approaches in that it precomputes a kd-tree data structure for the data points rather than the center points. We establish the practical efficiency of the filtering algorithm in two ways. First, we present a data-sensitive analysis of the algorithm's running time. Second, we have implemented the algorithm and performed a number of empirical studies, both on synthetically generated data and on real data from applications in color quantization, compression, and segmentation."

In high dimensional space the data becomes sparse, and traditional indexing and algorithmic techniques fail from a efficiency and/or effectiveness perspective. Recent research results show that in high dimensional space, the concept of proximity, distance or nearest neighbor may not even be qualitatively meaningful. In this paper, we view the dimensionality curse from the point of view of the distance metrics which are used to measure the similarity between objects. We specifically examine the behavior of the commonly used L k norm and show that the problem of meaningfulness in high dimensionality is sensitive to the value of k. For example, this means that the Manhattan distance metric (L 1 norm) is consistently more preferable than the Euclidean distance metric (L 2 norm) for high dimensional data mining applications. Using the intuition derived from our analysis, we introduce and examine a natural extension of the L k norm to fractional distance metrics. We show that the fractional distance metric provides more meaningful results both from the theoretical and empirical perspective. The results show that fractional distance metrics can significantly improve the effectiveness of standard clustering algorithms such as the k-means algorithm."

Prior work does not adequately address the problem of large datasets and minimization of I/O costs.This paper presents a data clustering method named BIRCH (Balanced Iterative Reducing and Clustering using Hierarchies), and demonstrates that it is especially suitable for very large databases. BIRCH incrementally and dynamically clusters incoming multi-dimensional metric data points to try to produce the best quality clustering with the available resources (i.e., available memory and time constraints). BIRCH can typically find a good clustering with a single scan of the data, and improve the quality further with a few additional scans. BIRCH is also the first clustering algorithm proposed in the database area to handle \"noise\" (data points that are not part of the underlying pattern) effectively.We evaluate BIRCH's time/space efficiency, data input order sensitivity, and clustering quality through several experiments. We also present a performance comparisons of BIRCH versus CLARANS, a clustering method proposed recently for large datasets, and show that BIRCH is consistently superior."

We show how this, in its own right, gives a fast and effective clustering of data. But more importantly we show how it can produce a well-balanced structure similar to a Ball-Tree (Omohundro, 1991) or a kind of metric tree (Uhlmann, 1991; Ciaccia, Patella, & Zezula, 1997) in a way that is neither \"topdown\" nor \"bottom-up\" but instead \"middleout\". We then show how this structure, decorated with cached sufficient statistics, allows a wide variety of statistical learning algorithms to be accelerated even in thousands of dimensions."

One of the best known examples of such a structure is the quadtree . It is used here as a basis for more complex data structures. We also provide multidimensional versions of the stratified tree by van Emde Boas [vEB]. We show that under the assumption that the input points have limited precision (i.e., are drawn from the integer grid of size u ) these data structures yield efficient solutions to many important problems. In particular, they allow us to achieve O(log\u00a0log\u00a0 u) time per operation for dynamic approximate nearest neighbor (under insertions and deletions) and exact on-line closest pair (under insertions only) in any constant number of dimensions. They allow O(log\u00a0log\u00a0 u) point location in a given planar shape or in its expansion (dilation by a ball of a given radius). Finally, we provide a linear time (optimal) algorithm for computing the expansion of a shape represented by a region quadtree. This result shows that the spatial order imposed by this regular data structure is sufficient to optimize the operation of dilation by a ball."

Like PDS, this new method can be used to improve many fast encoding algorithms.

The principle is to bypass those codewords which satisfy the proposed kick-out condition without the actual (and time-consuming) computation of the distortions from the bypassed codewords to the query vector. Due to the efficiency and simplicity of the proposed condition, a considerable saving of the central processing unit time needed to encode a data set (using a given codebook) can be achieved. Moreover, the memory requirement is low. Comparisons with some previous works are included to show these two benefits."

Specifically, the task is to determine whether or not two syntactic values are alternative designations of the same semantic entity. For example the addresses Dept. of Comput. Sci. and Eng., University of California, San Diego, 9500 Gilman Dr. Dept. 0114, La Jolla. CA 92093 and UCSD, Computer Science and Engineering Department, CA 92093-0114 do designate the same department. This paper describes three field matching algorithms, and evaluates their performance on real-world datasets. One proposed method is the well-known Smith-Waterman algorithm for comparing DNA and protein sequences. Several applications of field matching in knowledge discovery are described briefly, including WEBFIND, which is a new software tool that discovers scientific papers published on the worldwide web. WEBFIND uses external information sources to guide its search for authors and papers. Like many other worldwide web tools, WEBFIND needs to solve the field matching problem in order to navigate between information sources."

They usually have no training phase and only at prediction time do they perform computation Then they take a query search the database for similar datapoints and build an on-line local model (such as a local average or local regression) with which to predict an output value. In this paper we review the advantages of instance based methods for autonomous systems but we also note the ensuing cost hopelessly slow computation as the database grows large. We present and evaluate a new way of structuring a database and a new algorithm for accessing it that maintains the advantages ot instance-based learning. Earlier attempts to combat the cost of instancebased learning have sacrificed the explicit retention of all data or been applicable only to instancebased predictions based on a small number of near neighbors, or have had to reintroduce an explicit training phase in the form of an interpolative data structure. Our approach builds a multiresolution data structure to summarize the database of experiences at all resolutions of interest simultaneously. This permits us to query the database with the same flexibility as a conventional linear search but at greatly reduced computational cost."

It has been shown by Panter and Dite that, in the limit as the number of quanta becomes infinite, the asymptotic fractional density of quanta per unit voltage should vary as the one-third power of the probability density per unit voltage of signal amplitudes. In this paper the corresponding result for any finite number of quanta is derived; that is, necessary conditions are found that the quanta and associated quantization intervals of an optimum finite quantization scheme must satisfy. The optimization criterion used is that the average quantization noise power be a minimum. It is shown that the result obtained here goes over into the Panter and Dite result as the number of quanta become large. The optimum quautization schemes for 2^{b} quanta, b=1,2, \\cdots, 7 , are given numerically for Gaussian and for Laplacian distribution of signal amplitudes."

Our aim is to find which aspects of these algorithms contribute to finding good clusterings, as opposed to converging to a low-quality local optimum. We describe each algorithm in a unified framework that introduces separate cluster membership and data weight functions. We then show that the algorithms do behave very differently from each other on simple low-dimensional synthetic datasets and image segmentation tasks, and that the k-harmonic means method is superior. Having a soft membership function is essential for finding high-quality clusterings, but having a non-constant data weight function is useful also."
