                "text": "In a previous paper (Hartline, 1940) it was shown that a ganglion cell in the peripheral retina of the vertebrate eye is excited by activity in many convergent pathways, from sensory elements distributed over a receptive field covering approximately a square millimeter of retinal area. Illumination of any portion of the receptive field of a retinal ganglion cell will accordingly produce a discharge of impulses in its axon, the strength of the response to illumination of a fixed retinal area usually being greater the higher the intensity of the stimulating light. The present paper will show that the discharge of impulses in a single optic nerve fiber also depends upon the size of the illuminated area. The excitation of a ganglion cell is therefore controlled by the number of active pathways which converge upon it, as well as by the degree of activity in the individual pathways. Spatial summation in the vertebrate retina has previously been demonstrated by Adrian and Matthews (1927-1928). They showed that the latency of the discharge of impulses in the whole optic nerve of the eel was shorter the larger the area of the retina illuminated, and the latency of the response to four spots of light was shorter than the shortest latency obtained with any of the spots singly. This summation was enhanced by the application of strychnine, indicating that it depended upon the nervous interconnections within the retina. The study of the activity in single optic nerve fibers has now furnished more direct evidence for the convergence of excitatory effects within the retina; the present paper is concerned with the extension of this study to an analysis of spatial summation, in terms of the activity of the individual units of the retina. METHOD. The method for studying the activity of single optic nerve fibers in the retinas of cold-blooded vertebrates, and for determining the location and extent of their receptive fields has been described in previous papers (Hartline, 1938, 1940).

It has been possible in many types of visual sense organ to record nerve impulse discharges set up by the stimulus of light ; in work on a simple eye (Limulus), Hartline showed that visual sense cells, like other sensory nerve endings that have been investigated, set up impulses of frequency related to the strength of the stimulus, and Hartline later confirmed this for single opticnerve fibres from the frog's retina.

                "text": "THE electrical activity of the optic ganglion of the Water Beetle (Dytiscus marginalis) was studied some years ago and the main results were summarized in a note [Adrian, 1932]. One feature of particular interest was the occurrence of rhythmic potential oscillations in the ganglion and of rhythmic bursts of impulses in the nerve, due apparently to synchronous activity in the nerve cells. The tendency to synchronization is now recognized to play a considerable part in the reactions of the cerebral cortex, and it has become important to know more about the conditions which promote it. The optic ganglion of Dytiscus is in some ways an ideal preparation for a study of this kind. It has a relatively complex structureindeed according to Zawarzin [1914] it is equivalent to the retina and optic lobes of a vertebrate-but its electrical reactions are simple and there is the great advantage that its activity can be readily controlled. It has therefore been re-examined in the hope that the results would show what might be expected of nerve cells in general. Although they illustrate a principle which has been invoked before, many of the results can be simply explained and they suggest an explanation for some of the reactions of the cerebral cortex."

How is it possible to get such good insulation in a packed structure like the retina using a 25-\u00b5 electrode? Why are large isolated spikes only found in some spots and not elsewhere? Is it because some typical structure happens to be exceptionally favourably placed for recording, or is the structure a comparatively rare one?

In the present paper we are concerned more particularly with the initial stages of the process, i.e. with the excitation of the retinal elements, and we shall have little to say about the subsequent nervous changes. The latter have shown themselves to be of great interest from the neurological point of view, but before we dealt with them at length it seemed worth while to try and gain a little more information about the action of light as a stimulus to the retina. We have attempted to do this by studying the effect of flashes of light of short duration. In Part I we were mainly concerned with relatively long exposures and it was possible that some of the phenomena we found might be considerably modified with flashes. In any case a study of the response to flashes ought to give us data bearing on retinal excitation and it ought, in particular, to show how far we can liken the mechanism of the vertebrate eye to that of the much simpler organs investigated with the same method by Hecht(2)."

Extension to mesopia and scotopia is possible.Associated optically and mechanically are devices for locating, holding, and directing the eye and head of anaesthetized cats (or monkeys).

At first the assumption of a subthreshold response seems to be in conflict with the allor-nothing law, but there is in reality no contradiction, since the all-ornothing principle refers to the propagated disturbance, and does not exclude the possibility of graded reactions in the stimulated region. Indeed, the existence of some kind of subliminal action potential is to be expected from the local circuit theory of nervous transmission; for the current generated by the activity of a very short length of nerve would be too weak to excite surrounding regions, so that a shock which activated less than a certain length would fail to produce a self-propagating impulse and would leave behind only a small and localized response (cf. Rosenberg 1937, Rushton 1937)."

Hill 1936 a ) that, when a critical state is reached at a point of the nerve, \u201cexcitation\u201d occurs and then automatically propagates over the whole length of the nerve fibre. Since, however, the self-conduction of an impulse involves stimulation of each element by the simultaneous activity of a finite adjacent region of nerve, it is more natural to suppose that initially also a certain minimal length of nerve must be excited by an applied shock, in order to give rise to a propagated disturbance. A subthreshold stimulus, therefore, by exciting too small a region, might produce a localized response, the spread and size of which are not enough to excite resting points further on. If such a non-conducted response can actually occur, it might be expected (i) to facilitate excitation by a second shock, if applied to the same region shortly after the first, and (ii) to be accompanied by a small local action potential. Both possibilities can be investigated experimentally, though both might be expected to be complicated by the direct effects (electrotonus,\u201clocal potential\u201d) of the first shock."
