Our texture model is based on the statistical distribution of clustered filter responses. However, unlike previous 3D texton representations, we use rotationally invariant filters and cluster in an extremely low dimensional space. Having built a texton dictionary, we present a novel method of classifying a single image without requiring any a priori knowledge about the viewing or illumination conditions under which it was photographed. We argue that using rotationally invariant filters while clustering in such a low dimensional space improves classification performance and demonstrate this claim with results on all 61 textures in the Columbia-Utrecht database. We then proceed to show how texture models can be further extended by compensating for viewpoint changes using weak isotropy.The new clustering and classification methods are compared to those of Leung and Malik (ICCV 1999), Schmid (CVPR 2001) and Cula and Dana (CVPR 2001), which are the current state-of-the-art approaches."

It is demonstrated that the classifier developed here achieves performance superior to that of Cula and Dana (2004) and Leung and Malik (2001), while requiring only a single image as input and with no information (implicit or explicit) about the illumination and viewing conditions. The CUReT database contains 61 textures, and each texture has 205 images obtained under different viewing and illumination conditions. The variety of textures in this database is shown in Fig. 3. Results are reported for all 61 textures. A preliminary version of these results appeared in Varma and Zisserman (2002)."

Leung and Malik\u2019s method is not rotationally invariant and requires as input a set of registered images acquired under a (implicitly) known set of imaging conditions. Schmid\u2019s approach is rotationally invariant but the invariance is achieved in a different manner to ours, and texton clustering is in a higher dimensional space. More importantly, only a single model is used to characterise each texture class rather than having multiple models to account for the variations in imaging conditions. Cula and Dana classify from single images, but the method is not rotationally invariant and their algorithm for model selection differs from the one developed in this paper. These points are discussed in more detail subsequently. The paper is organised as follows: in Section 2, the basic classification algorithm is developed within a rotationally invariant framework. The clustering, learning and classification steps of the algorithm are described, and the performance of four filter sets is compared. The sets include those used by Schmid (2001) and Leung and Malik (2001), and two rotationally invariant sets based on maximal filter responses."

Often textured surfaces present not only variations of color or reflectance, but also local height variations. This type of surface is referred to as a 3D texture. As the lighting and viewing conditions are varied, effects such as shadowing, foreshortening and occlusions, give rise to significant changes in texture appearance. Accounting for the variation of texture appearance due to changes in imaging parameters is a key issue in developing accurate 3D texture models. The bidirectional texture function (BTF) is observed image texture as a function of viewing and illumination directions. In this work, we construct a BTF-based surface model which captures the variation of the underlying statistical distribution of local structural image features, as the viewing and illumination conditions are changed. This 3D texture representation is called the bidirectional feature histogram (BFH). Based on the BFH, we design a 3D texture recognition method which employs the BFH as the surface model, and classifies surfaces based on a single novel texture image of unknown imaging parameters. Also, we develop a computational method for quantitatively evaluating the relative significance of texture images within the BTF. The performance of our methods is evaluated by employing over 6200 texture images corresponding to 40 real-world surface samples from the CUReT (Columbia-Utrecht reflectance and texture) database. Our experiments produce excellent classification results, which validate the strong descriptive properties of the BFH as a 3D texture representation."

The first is the Sowerby dataset, which contains one hundred colour photographs of country roads in England that have been interactively segmented and classified into six classes-edge, vegetation, air, road, building, and other. The second domain is a set of thirty five-images, taken in San Francisco, which have been interactively segmented into similar classes. In each domain we learn the joint probability distributions of filter responses, based on colour and texture, for each class. These distributions are then used for classification. We restrict ourselves to a limited number of filters in order to ensure that the learnt filter responses do not overfit the training data (our region classes are chosen so as to ensure that there is enough data to avoid over fitting). We do performance analysis on the two datasets by evaluating the false positive and false negative error rates for the classification. This shows that the learnt models achieve high accuracy in classifying individual pixels into those classes for which the filter responses are approximately spatially homogeneous (i.e. road, vegetation, and air but not edge and building). A more sensitive performance measure, the Chernoff information, is calculated in order to quantify how well the cues for edge and building are doing. This demonstrates that statistical knowledge of the domain is a powerful tool for segmentation."

Such natural textures arise from spatial variation of two surface attributes: (1) reflectance and (2) surface normal. In this paper, we provide a unified model to address both these aspects of natural texture. The main idea is to construct a vocabulary of prototype tiny surface patches with associated local geometric and photometric properties. We call these 3D textons. Examples might be ridges, grooves, spots or stripes or combinations thereof. Associated with each texton is an appearance vector, which characterizes the local irradiance distribution, represented as a set of linear Gaussian derivative filter outputs, under different lighting and viewing conditions.Given a large collection of images of different materials, a clustering approach is used to acquire a small (on the order of 100) 3D texton vocabulary. Given a few (1 to 4) images of any material, it can be characterized using these textons. We demonstrate the application of this representation for recognition of the material viewed under novel lighting and viewing conditions. We also illustrate how the 3D texton model can be used to predict the appearance of materials under novel conditions."

Our model representation is based on two layers. The first one consists of \"generic\" descriptors which represent sets of similar rotational invariant feature vectors. Rotation invariance allows to group similar, but rotated patterns and makes the method robust to model deformations. The second layer is the joint probability on the frequencies of the \"generic\" descriptors over neighborhoods. This probability is multi-modal and is represented by a set of \"spatial-frequency\" clusters. It adds a statistical spatial constraint which is rotationally invariant. Our two-layer representation is novel; it allows to efficiently capture \"texture-like\" visual structure. The selection of distinctive structure determines characteristic model features (common to the positive and rare in the negative examples) and increases the performance of the model. Models are retrieved and localized using a probabilistic score. Experimental results for \"textured\" animals and faces show a very good performance for retrieval as well as localization."

We propose a classifier that is robust to lighting direction\u2014even when the direction is unknown. An existing model of the dependency of texture features on lighting direction is used to develop a probabilistic model. Given a feature set, the algorithm estimates the most likely illumination direction for each texture class. The likelihoods of each candidate (with their estimated lighting) are compared to classify the sample. The ability of the classifier to identify illuminant direction, and to assign the correct class, was tested on 25 real texture samples. The classifier was able to accurately estimate both the azimuth and the zenith of the light source for most textures and gave a 98% classification rate."

Since the appearance of 3D texture depends on the illumination and viewing direction in a complicated manner, such image texture can be called a bidirectional texture function. A fundamental representation of image texture is the histogram of pixel intensities. Since the histogram of 3D texture also depends on the illumination and viewing directions in a complex fashion, we refer to it as a bidirectional histogram. In this work, we present a concise analytical model for the bidirectional histogram of Lambertian, isotropic, randomly rough surfaces, which are common in real-world scenes. We demonstrate the accuracy of the histogram model by fitting to several samples from the Columbia-Utrecht texture database. The parameters obtained from the model fits are roughness measures which can be used in texture recognition schemes. In addition, the model has potential application in estimating illumination direction in scenes where surfaces of known tilt and roughness are visible. We demonstrate the usefulness of our model by employing it in a novel 3D texture synthesis procedure."

These changes can affect the output of texture features to such an extent that they cause complete misclassification. We present new theory and experimental results that show that changes in illumination tilt angle cause texture clusters to describe Lissajous's ellipses in feature space. We focus on texture features that may be modelled as a linear filter followed by an energy estimation process e.g. Laws filters, Gabor filters, ring and wedge filters. This general texture filter model is combined with a linear approximation of Lambert's cosine law to predict that the outputs of these filters are sinusoidal functions of illuminant tilt. Experimentation with 30 real textures verifies this proposal. Furthermore we use these results to show that the clusters of distinct textures describe different elliptical paths in feature space as illuminant tilt varies. These results have significant implications for illuminant tilt invariant texture classification."

It is applicable to texture patches which are locally planar and have stationary statistics. The novelty of the descriptor is that it is based on statistics aggregated over the region, resulting in richer and more stable descriptors than those computed at a point. Two texture matching applications of this descriptor are demonstrated: (1) it is used to automatically identify, regions of the same type of texture, but with varying surface pose, within a single image; (2) it is used to support wide baseline stereo, i.e. to enable the automatic computation of the epipolar geometry between two images acquired from quite separated viewpoints. Results are presented on several sets of real images."

Instead of relying on an external feature extractor, the SVM receives the gray-level values of the raw pixels, as SVMs can generalize well even in high-dimensional spaces. Furthermore, it is shown that SVMs can incorporate conventional texture feature extraction methods within their own architecture, while also providing solutions to problems inherent in these methods. One-against-others decomposition is adopted to apply binary SVMs to multitexture classification, plus a neural network is used as an arbitrator to make final classifications from several one-against-others SVM outputs. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of SVMs in texture classification."

In the literature, the word texture is often used to describe a color or albedo variation on a smooth surface. We refer to such texture as 2D texture. In real world scenes, texture is often due to surface height variations and can be termed 3D texture. Because of local foreshortening and masking, oblique views of 3D texture are not simple transformations of the frontal view. Consequently, texture representations such as the correlation function or power spectrum are also affected by local foreshortening and masking. This work presents a correlation model for a particular class of 3D textures. The model characterizes the spatial relationship among neighboring pixels in an image of 3D texture and the change of this spatial relationship with viewing direction."

We fit the BRDF measurements to two recent models to obtain a BRDF parameter database. These BRDF parameters can be directly used for both image analysis and image synthesis. Finally, we present a BTF (bidirectional texture function) database with image textures from over 60 different samples, each observed with over 200 different combinations of viewing and source directions. Each of these unique databases has important implications for a variety of vision algorithms and each is made publicly available."

Natural images contain both textured and untextured regions, so the cues of contour and texture differences are exploited simultaneously. Contours are treated in the intervening contour framework, while texture is analyzed using textons. Each of these cues has a domain of applicability, so to facilitate cue combination we introduce a gating operator based on the texturedness of the neighborhood at a pixel. Having obtained a local measure of how likely two nearby pixels are to belong to the same region, we use the spectral graph theoretic framework of normalized cuts to find partitions of the image into regions of coherent texture and brightness. Experimental results on a wide range of images are shown."

This article describes a way of reducing this effect for a general class of methods for deriving 3-D shape cues from 2-D image data, which are based on the estimation of locally linearized distortion of brightness patterns. By extending the linear scale-space concept into an affine scale-space representation and performing affine shape adaption of the smoothing kernels, the accuracy of surface orientation estimates derived from texture and disparity cues can be improved by typically one order of magnitude. The reason for this is that the image descriptors, on which the methods are based, will be relative invariant under affine transformations, and the error will thus be confined to the higher-order terms in the locally linearized perspective mapping."

The book also introduces Bayesian analysis of learning and relates SVMs to Gaussian Processes and other kernel based learning methods. SVMs deliver state-of-the-art performance in real-world applications such as text categorisation, hand-written character recognition, image classification, biosequences analysis, etc. Their first introduction in the early 1990s lead to a recent explosion of applications and deepening theoretical analysis, that has now established Support Vector Machines along with neural networks as one of the standard tools for machine learning and data mining. Students will find the book both stimulating and accessible, while practitioners will be guided smoothly through the material required for a good grasp of the theory and application of these techniques. The concepts are introduced gradually in accessible and self-contained stages, though in each stage the presentation is rigorous and thorough. Pointers to relevant literature and web sites containing software ensure that it forms an ideal starting point for further study. Equally the book will equip the practitioner to apply the techniques and an associated web site will provide pointers to updated literature, new applications, and on-line software."
