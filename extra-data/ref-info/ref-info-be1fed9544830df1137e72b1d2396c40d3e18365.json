Some major computer-based English word frequency lists are those published by Kuiera and Francis (1967), Carroll et al. (1971), Engels et al. (1981), and Hofland and Johansson (1982). In several respects Thorndike and Lorge's work is more sophisticated than the more recent publications. It is based on a larger material, it gives the frequencies of lexemes rather than of word forms, and it reports the results of large-scale counts based on different types of material. The aim of the book is to provide information on how common a word is \"in standard English reading matter\" (p.x), primarily for the use of language teachers. The four separate counts reported were based on (1) texts used at school (\"readers, textbooks, the Bible and the English classics,\" p.x), (2) popular magazines, (3) juvenile books (\"books recommended for boys and girls in grades 3 to 8,\" p.x), and (4) \"a miscellany of juvenile and adult readings-of old and recent, and of matter-of-fact and imaginative-but ... [omitting] school readers and textbooks\" (p.x). As a guide to word frequency and text type in present-day English, the work of Thorndike and Lorge is, however, of limited value. For one thing, the lists are based on texts which are at least forty years old; in addition, three of the counts used a mixture of old and contemporary texts. Two of the counts only are based on well-defined categories of"

One of the major reasons why speech models, based on Markov chains, have not been developed until recently was the lack of a method for optimizing the parameters of the Markov model to match observed signal patterns. Such a method was proposed in the late 1960's and was immediately applied to speech processing in several research institutions. Continued refinements in the theory and implementation of Markov modelling techniques have greatly enhanced the method, leading to a wide range of applications of these models. It is the purpose of this tutorial paper to give an introduction to the theory of Markov models, and to illustrate how they have been applied to problems in speech recognition."
