Unlike techniques that rely on OCR output, our method is region-based: the segmentation output, described as a set of regions together with their types, output order etc., is matched against the pre-stored set of ground-truth regions. Misclassifications, splitting, and merging of regions are among the errors that are detected by the system. Each error is weighted individually for a particular application and a global estimate of segmentation quality is derived. The system can be customized to benchmark specific aspects of segmentation (e.g., headline detection) and according to the type of error correction that might follow (e.g., re-typing). Segmentation ground-truth files are quickly and easily generated and edited using GroundsKeeper, an X-Window based tool that allows one to view a document, manually draw regions (arbitrary polygons) on it, and specify information about each region (e.g., type, parent)."

In the existing performance evaluation methods, two crucial components are usually missing: 1) automatic training of algorithms with free parameters and 2) statistical and error analysis of experimental results. We use the following five-step methodology to quantitatively compare the performance of page segmentation algorithms: 1) first, we create mutually exclusive training and test data sets with groundtruth, 2) we then select a meaningful and computable performance metric, 3) an optimization procedure is then used to search automatically for the optimal parameter values of the segmentation algorithms on the training data set, 4) the segmentation algorithms are then evaluated on the test data set, and, finally, 5) a statistical and error analysis is performed to give the statistical significance of the experimental results. In particular, instead of the ad hoc and manual approach typically used in the literature for training algorithms, we pose the automatic training of algorithms as an optimization problem and use the simplex algorithm to search for the optimal parameter value. A paired-model statistical analysis and an error analysis are then conducted to provide confidence intervals for the experimental results of the algorithms. This methodology is applied to the evaluation of live page segmentation algorithms of which, three are representative research algorithms and the other two are well-known commercial products, on 978 images from the University of Washington III data set. It is found that the performance indices of the Voronoi, Docstrum, and Caere segmentation algorithms are not significantly different from each other, but they are significantly better than that of ScanSoft's segmentation algorithm, which, in turn, is significantly better than that of X-Y cut."

In order to choose between these algorithms for a specific domain it is important to empirically evaluate their performance. To accomplish this task the document image analysis community needs: i) standardized document image datasets with groundtruth; ii) evaluation metrics that are agreed upon by researchers; and iii) freely available software for evaluating new algorithms and replicating other researchers' results. In an earlier paper (IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence 2001) we published evaluation results for various popular page segmentation algorithms using the University of Washington dataset. In this paper we describe the software architecture of the PSET evaluation package, which was used to evaluate the segmentation algorithms. The description of the architecture will allow researchers to understand the software better, replicate our results, evaluate new algorithms, experiment with new metrics and datasets, etc. The software is written using the C language on the SUN/UNIX platform and is being made available to researchers at no cost."

The evaluation is performed using a subset of the UW-III collection commonly used for evaluation, with a separate training set for parameter optimization. We compare the results using both default parameters and optimized parameters. In the course of the evaluation, the strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm are analyzed, and it is shown that no single algorithm outperforms all other algorithms. However, we observe that the three best-performing algorithms are those based on constrained text-line finding, Docstrum, and the Voronoi-diagram."

Each approach has been devised for and/or evaluated using (usually small) application-specific datasets. While the need for objective performance evaluation of layout analysis algorithms is evident, there does not exist a suitable dataset with ground truth that reflects the realities of everyday documents (widely varying layouts, complex entities, colour, noise etc.). The most significant impediment is the creation of accurate and flexible (in representation) ground truth, a task that is costly and must be carefully designed. This paper discusses the issues related to the design, representation and creation of ground truth in the context of a realistic dataset developed by the authors. The effectiveness of the ground truth discussed in this paper has been successfully shown in its use for two international page segmentation competitions (ICDAR2003 and ICDAR2005)."

The method permits a detailed analysis of the behavior of page segmentation algorithms in terms of over- and undersegmentation at different layout levels, as well as determination of the geometric accuracy of the segmentation. The representation of document layouts relies on labeling each pixel according to its function in the overall segmentation, permitting pixel-accurate representation of layout information of arbitrary layouts and allowing background pixels to be classified as \"don't care\". Our representations can be encoded easily in standard color image formats like PNG, permitting easy interchange of segmentation results and ground truth"

One major problem centres on the performance analysis of the evolving segmentation algorithms. The use of a standard document database maintained at the Universities/Research Laboratories helps to solve the problem of getting authentic data sources and other information, but some methodologies have to be used for performance analysis of the segmentation. We describe a new document model in terms of a bounding box representation of its constituent parts and suggest an empirical measure of performance of a segmentation algorithm based on this new graph-like model of the document. Besides the global error measures, the proposed method also produces segment-wise details of common segmentation problems such as horizontal and vertical split and merge as well as invalid and mismatched regions."

We use a geometric matching algorithm to find the optimal page frame, which has the advantages of not assuming the existence of whitespace between noisy borders and actual page contents, and of giving a practical solution to the page frame detection problem without the need for parameter tuning. We define suitable performance measures and evaluate the algorithm on the UW-III database. The results show that the error rates are below 4% for each of the performance measures used. In addition, we demonstrate that the use of page frame detection reduces the optical character recognition (OCR) error rate by removing textual noise. Experiments using a commercial OCR system show that the error rate due to elements outside the page frame is reduced from 4.3% to 1.7% on the UW-III dataset."

This paper proposes a representation of segmentations and presegmentations in terms of color images. Such representations allow convenient interchange of ground truth and hypothesized segmentations in the form of standard image formats. The paper formally defines the notions of oversegmentation and undersegmentation in terms of the maximal bipartite match between corresponding pixels. It also defines a number of metrics that quantify the frequency and extent of events in handwriting like kerning, splitting, and merging of characters. It is hoped that these metrics and representations will find wider use in the community and serve as a basis for creating standard training and test databases of segmentation data."

Correct document layout analysis is a key step in document capture conversions into electronic formats, optical character recognition (OCR), information retrieval from scanned documents, appearance-based document retrieval, and reformatting of documents for on-screen display. We have developed a number of novel geometric algorithms and statistical methods. Layout analysis systems built from these algorithms are applicable to a wide variety of languages and layouts, and have proven to be robust to the presence of noise and spurious features in a page image. The system itself consists of reusable and independent software modules that can be reconfigured to be adapted to different languages and applications. Currently, we are using them for electronic book and document capture applications. If there is commercial or government demand, we are interested in adapting these tools to information retrieval and intelligence applications."

By doing so, we obtain a variety of performance measures which have not been used before in image processing. In particular, some of these measures have the highly desired property of being a metric. Experimental results are reported on both synthetic and real data to validate the measures and compare them with others."

The approach is based on computational-geometry algorithms for off-line enumeration of maximal white rectangles and on-line rectangle unification. These support a fast, simple, and general heuristic for geometric layout segmentation, in which white space is covered greedily by rectangles until all text blocks are isolated. Design of the heuristic can be substantially automated by an analysis of the empirical statistical distribution of properties of covering rectangles: for example, the stopping rule can be chosen by Rosenblatt\u2019s perceptron training algorithm. Experimental trials show good behavior on the large and useful class of textual Manhattan layouts. On complex layouts from English-language technical journals of many publishers, the method finds good segmentations in a uniform and nearly parameter-free manner. On a variety of non-Latin texts, some with vertical text lines, the method finds good segmentations without prior knowledge of page and text-line orientation."

The process by which the X-Y tree data structure converts a 2-D page-segmentation problem into a series of 1-D string-parsing problems that can be tackled using conventional compiler tools is also described. Syntactic analysis is used in Gobbledoc to divide each page into labeled rectangular blocks. Blocks labeled text are converted by OCR to obtain a secondary (ASCII) document representation. Since such symbolic files are better suited for computerized search than for human access to the document content and because too many visual layout clues are lost in the OCR process (including some special characters), Gobbledoc preserves the original block images for human browsing. Storage, networking, and display issues specific to document images are also discussed.<<ETX>>"

Searching for documents by their type is a natural way to enhance the effectiveness of document retrieval in the workplace [2], and a such system is proposed in [4]. The goal of our work is to build classifiers that can determine the type or genre of a document image. We use primarily layout features since the layout of a document contains a significant amount of information that can be used to identify a document\u2019s type. Layout analysis is necessary since our input image has no structural definition that is immediately perceivable by a computer. Classification is thus based on \u201cvisual similarity\u201d of the structure without reference to models of particular kinds of pages. There has been some classification work reported but most require either domain specific models [3, 5, 6, 8] or are based on text obtained by optical character recognition (OCR) [3, 6, 8]."

Several critical functions have been investigated and the technical approaches are discussed. The first is the segmentation and classification of digitized printed documents into regions of text and images. A nonlinear, run-length smoothing algorithm has been used for this purpose. By using the regular features of text lines, a linear adaptive classification scheme discriminates text regions from others. The second technique studied is an adaptive approach to the recognition of the hundreds of font styles and sizes that can occur on printed documents. A preclassifier is constructed during the input process and used to speed up a well-known pattern-matching method for clustering characters from an arbitrary print source into a small sample of prototypes. Experimental results are included."

This paper describes the document spectrum (or docstrum), which is a method for structural page layout analysis based on bottom-up, nearest-neighbor clustering of page components. The method yields an accurate measure of skew, within-line, and between-line spacings and locates text lines and text blocks. It is advantageous over many other methods in three main ways: independence from skew angle, independence from different text spacings, and the ability to process local regions of different text orientations within the same image. Results of the method shown for several different page formats and for randomly oriented subpages on the same image illustrate the versatility of the method. We also discuss the differences, advantages, and disadvantages of the docstrum with respect to other lay-out methods. >"

The layout of a document contains a significant amount of information that can be used to classify a document's type in the absence of domain specific models. A document type or genre can be defined by the user based primarily on layout structure. Our classification approach is based on 'visual similarity' of the layout structure by building a supervised classifier, given examples of the class. We use image features, such as the percentages of tex and non-text (graphics, image, table, and ruling) content regions, column structures, variations in the point size of fonts, the density of content area, and various statistics on features of connected components which can be derived from class samples without class knowledge. In order to obtain class labels for training samples, we conducted a user relevance test where subjects ranked UW-I document images with respect to the 12 representative images. We implemented our classification scheme using the OC1, a decision tree classifier, and report our findings."

The main purpose of the present report is to describe the current status of DIU with particular attention to two subprocesses: document skew angle estimation and page decomposition. Several algorithms proposed in the literature are synthetically described. They are included in a novel classification scheme. Some methods proposed for the evaluation of page decomposition algorithms are described. Critical discussions are reported about the current status of the field and about the open problems. Some considerations about the logical layout analysis are also reported."

(2) The candidates are utilized to estimate the intercharacter and interline gaps without the use of domain-specific parameters to select the boundaries. From the experimental results for 128 images with non-Manhattan layout and the skew of 0\u00b0~45\u00b0 as well as 98 images with Manhattan layout, we have confirmed that the method is effective for extraction of body text regions, and it is as efficient as other methods based on connected component analysis."

In this paper we report a very simple but extremely powerful approach to detect tables present in document pages. The algorithm relies on the observation that the tables have distinct columns which implies that gaps between the fields are substantially larger than the gaps between the words in text lines. This deceptively simple observation has led to the design of a simple but powerful table detection system with low computation cost. Moreover, mathematical foundation of the approach is also established including formation of a regular expression for ease of implementation."

This methodology involves (1) a common set of 40 laser range finder images and 40 structured light scanner images that have manually specified ground truth and (2) a set of defined performance metrics for instances of correctly segmented, missed, and noise regions, over- and under-segmentation, and accuracy of the recovered geometry. A tool is used to objectively compare a machine generated segmentation against the specified ground truth. Four research groups have contributed to evaluate their own algorithm for segmenting a range image into planar patches."

The algorithms are considerably easier to implement than prior methods, they return globally optimal solutions, and they require no heuristics. The paper also introduces an evaluation function that reliably identifies maximal empty rectangles corresponding to column boundaries. Combining this evaluation function with the two geometric algorithms results in an easy-to-implement layout analysis system. Reliability of the system is demonstrated on documents from the UW3 database."

However, there has been no comparative evaluation of different dewarping techniques so far. In an attempt to fill this gap, we have organized a page dewarping contest along with CBDAR 2007. We have created a dataset of 102 documents captured with a hand-held camera and have made it freely available online. We have prepared text-line, text-zone, and ASCII text ground-truth for the documents in this dataset. Three groups participated in the contest with their methods. In this paper we present an overview of the approaches that the participants used, the evaluation measure, and the dataset used in the contest. We report the performance of all participating methods. The evaluation shows that none of the participating methods was statistically significantly better than any other participating method."

The order and containment relations among the physical or logical components of a document page can be described by an ordered tree structure and can be modeled by a tree grammar which describes the page at the component level in terms of regions or blocks. This paper provides a detailed survey of past work on document structure analysis algorithms and summarize the limitations of past approaches. In particular, we survey past work on document physical layout representations and algorithms, document logical structure representations and algorithms, and performance evaluation of document structure analysis algorithms. In the last section, we summarize this work and point out its limitations."
