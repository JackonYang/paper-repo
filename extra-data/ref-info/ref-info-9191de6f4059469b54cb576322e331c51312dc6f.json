The objects are modeled as polyhedra (or polygons) having up to six degrees of freedom relative to the sensors. The approach operates by examining all hypotheses about pairings between sensed data and object surfaces and efficiently discarding inconsistent ones by using local constraints on: distances between faces, angles between face normals, and angles (relative to the surface normals) of vectors between sensed points. The method described here is an extension of a method for recognition and localization of non-overlapping parts previously described in [Grimson & Lozano--P\u00e9rez 84] and [Gaston & Lozano-P\u00e9rez 84]."

The method is based upon matching pairs of boundary segments of the template of an object with pairs of boundary segments in the image. Using a Bayesian based signal detection approach, pairs of segments are selected from the template of the object such that the probability of correctly identifying the object given that the pair is matched in the image is close to one. Assuming that models of all objects which might appear in the scene (a reasonable assumption for industrial applications) are known a priori, suitable pairs of segments can be determined a priori. Preliminary investigation suggests that the technique is robust and that subsecond recognition time can be achieved."

Shape matching is viewed as a ``segment matching'' problem. Unlike the previous work, the technique is based on a stochastic labeling procedure which explicitly maximizes a criterion function based on the ambiguity and inconsistency of classification. To reduce the computation time, the technique is hierarchical and uses results obtained at low levels to speed up and improve the accuracy of results at higher levels. This basic technique has been extended to the situation where various objects partially occlude each other to form an apparent object and our interest is to find all the objects participating in the occlusion. In such a case several hierarchical processes are executed in parallel for every object participating in the occlusion and are coordinated in such a way that the same segment of the apparent object is not matched to the segments of different actual objects. These techniques have been applied to two-dimensional simple closed curves represented by polygons and the power of the techniques is demonstrated by the examples taken from synthetic, aerial, industrial and biological images where the matching is done after using the actual segmentation methods."

Shih 2009-03-23 In the development of digital multimedia, the importance and impact of image processing and mathematical morphology are well documented in areas ranging from automated vision detection and inspection to object recognition, image analysis and pattern recognition. Those working in these ever-evolving fields require a solid grasp of basic fundamentals, theory, and related applications\u2014and few books can provide the unique tools for learning contained in this text. Image Processing and Mathematical Morphology: Fundamentals and Applications is a comprehensive, wide-ranging overview of morphological mechanisms and techniques and their relation to image processing. More than merely a tutorial on vital technical information, the book places this knowledge into a theoretical framework. This helps readers analyze key principles and architectures and then use the author\u2019s novel ideas on implementation of advanced algorithms to formulate a practical and detailed plan to develop and foster their own ideas. The book: Presents the history and state-of-the-art techniques related to image morphological processing, with numerous practical examples Gives readers a clear tutorial on complex technology and other tools that rely on their intuition for a clear understanding of the subject Includes an updated bibliography and useful graphs and illustrations Examines several new algorithms in great detail so that readers can adapt them to derive their own solution approaches This invaluable reference helps readers assess and simplify problems and their essential requirements and complexities, giving them all the necessary data and methodology to master current theoretical developments and applications, as well as create new ones."

Classic applications are illustrated such as Shaw's picture description language (1969) applied to bubble chamber photographs, and Ledley's chromosome grammar ( 1965). The student with no particular interest in pattern recognition, who nevertheless desires to grasp a quick overview of what formal language theory is all about, could read this chapter. A minimum of preliminary definitions and notation must be waded through before learning about-types of grammars (regular, context-free, context-sensitive), equivalency of grammars, syntaxdirected translations, and deterministic, nondeterministic, and stochastic systems. Higher dimensional grammars are treated in Chapter Three, i.e., those allowing more complex primitive description and interconnection capabilities. Tree, web, plex, and shape grammars are each described with accompanying examples which make the material very easy to absorb. Chapter Four, on recognition and translation of syntactic structures, presents that integral part of formal language theory known as automata theory. The one-to-one correspondences between types of string grammars and automata are presented here, namely finite automation/regular grammar, push-down automaton/context-free grammar, linear-bounded automaton/ context-sensitive grammar, and Turing machine/unrestricted grammar. Quite properly, the authors restrict their attention to the finite and push-down automata used to accept or reject input strings and to automata for tree recognition, since these are the models thus far proved to be most useful for syntactic pattern recognition tasks. Chapter Five introduces stocastic grammars, languages, and recognizers. The material is well covered and brings the reader up to date (1978). As the authors mention, the impact of this theory on syntactic pattern processing has not been thoroughly realized, and references are cited for one interested in pursuing the topic further. The final chapter deals with grammatical inference and exemplifies the principalideas underlying the problem of obtaining a pattern grammar from a set of samples. Again, the material in this chapter is presented in a logical and easy to understand format. By this time the reader is beginning to understand the limitations of the linguistic aspect of syntactic pattern recognition (Reviewer's opinion), and will draw his or her attention to some of the material which came out of this work in the late sixties, which can be described as structural pattern recognition, and which is the topic of the book review which follows."
