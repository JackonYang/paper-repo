It has been found that most terrestrial substances, including standard diffusing surfaces, when observed with an instrument of small aperture, show a prominent rise in reflectivity if the direction of observation is within \u00b15\u00b0 of the direction of the incident light. Experiments show that the height of the intensity peak entails complex interrelations of the particle size, shape, and optical properties of the reflector. The abrupt increase in the brightness of the lunar surface at zero phase may not be an unusual property of the moon but is one common to most substances. An airplane passenger can easily verify that this phenomenon is a common one by noting the bright zone on the ground around the shadow of the airplane."

The shading function is determined by a linear interpolation of the curvature of the surface. It takes into consideration the physical properties of the materials of which the surfaces are made. By applying the fundamental laws of optics, highlights due to the specular reflection of the light are simulated, and other existing shading problems are overcome. This results in computer-generated images of increased realism. A large number of sample pictures are provided to give a pictorial comparison of the new shading process with past methods. Finally, pictures of simple real solids, such as cylinders, spheres and cones, are compared with those generated by the computer."

                "text": "A general and rigorous treatment is given of the photometric method for deriving surface elevation information from a single picture of the surface. In the course of the derivation a brief indication is given of possible photometric function symmetries yielding exact solutions to the problem. It is shown that the photometric properties of the lunar maria are sufficient to produce an exact solution but with an inherent practical difficulty. The resulting equations are then specialized to the case of lunar photography and applied to the Ranger pictures as part of a digital processing procedure. Examples of the resulting elevation maps are given. INTRODUCTION QUANTITATIVE ELEVATION INFORMATION about a surface can be derived from pictures both by stereoscopic and by photometric methods. The second method, which is of interest here, was first suggested by van Diggelen (Ref. 1) in 1951. Extending his original formulation of the problem, it is desired to reconstruct quantitatively the shape of a surface being photographed using the imaging geometry, the facsi mile system transfer characteristics, and the surface photometric properties. A rigorous solution to this problem is presented and the results are applied to the lunar pictures taken by the three Ranger impacting spacecraft. CALCULATION OF ELEVATIONS IN TEl{]vIS OF A LENS-CENTERED COORDINATE SYSTEM The pertinent photometry of extended surfaces can be summarized as follows. For simplicity, it will be assumed that the surface possesses homogenous photometric properties at least over the local area under consideration. The photometric geometry can be com pletely defined in terms of three angles; the incidence angle i (angle between the direction of incident light and the surface normal), the emission angle e (angle between the direction of emitted light and the surface normal), and the phase angle g (angle between the directions of incident and emitted light). This geometry is shown in Figure 1. For uniform collimated illumination of the surface, such as with sunlight, the luminence b can be written b(i, e, g) = poEo\u00a2(i, e, g) (1) where Po is the normal albedo of the surface, Eo is the uniform illumination intensity, and \u00a2 (i, e, g) is the surface photometric function. The normalization of \u00a2 is such that \u00a2(O, 0, 0) = 1. * This paper presents the results of one phase of research conducted at J.P.L., California Institute of Technology, under Contract No. NAS 7-100, sponsored by NASA.

This is typically done by modelling the surface as a perfect diffuser, sometimes with a specular component added for the simulation of hilights. This paper presents a more accurate function for the generation of hilights which is based on some experimental measurements of how light reflects from real surfaces. It differs from previous models in that the intensity of the hilight changes with the direction of the light source. Also the position and shape of the hilights is somewhat different from that generated by simpler models. Finally, the hilight function generates different results when simulating metallic vs. nonmetallic surfaces. Many of the effects so generated are somewhat subtle and are apparent only during movie sequences. Some representative still frames from such movies are included."

The idea of photometric stereo is to vary the direction of the incident illumination between successive views while holding the viewing direction constant. This provides enough information to determine surface orientation at each picture element. Traditional stereo techniques determine range by relating two images of an object viewed from different directions. If the correspondence between picture elements is known, then distance to the object can be calculated by triangulation. Unfortunately, it is difficult to determine this correspondence. In photometric stereo, the imaging geometry does not change. Therefore, the correspondence between picture elements is known a priori. This stereo technique is photometric because it uses the intensity values recorded at a single picture element, in successive views, rather than the relative positions of features."

The analytical model assumes that the surface consists of small, randomly disposed, mirror-like facets. Specular reflection from these facets plus a diffuse component due to multiple reflections and/or internal scattering are postulated as the basic mechanisms of the reflection process. The effects of shadowing and masking of facets by adjacent facets are included in the analysis. The angular distributions of reflected flux predicted by the analysis are in very good agreement with experiment for both metallic and nonmetallic surfaces. Moreover, the analysis successfully predicts the off-specular maxima in the reflection distribution which are observed experimentally and which emerge as the incidence angle increases. The model thus affords a rational explanation for the off-specular peak phenomenon in terms of mutual masking and shadowing of mirror-like, specularly reflecting surface facets."

Unlike previous derivations that modeled the rough interface as consisting of microareas randomly oriented but flat (facets), this derivation models it as consisting of microareas not only randomly oriented but also randomly curved. Physically, the models are the same, but this new derivation leads to some new results. (1) For any given rough surface, there exists a single, optically smooth, curved surface of revolution of very restricted shape that will reflect radiation in the same distribution as that reflected by the rough interface. (2) Modeling that surface as an ellipsoid of revolution gives a surface-structure function that appears more accurate and useful than existing ones. (3) Unlike the facet derivations, this derivation lends itself to a normalization that gives the absolute, instead of just a comparative, reflectance-distribution function."

Two types of reflection, diffuse and specular, usually take place simultaneously at all incidence and viewing angles. Only one of the eight definitions that we study, the equation of Spencer and Gray, agrees entirely with experiment. Half of the definitions apply only for purely diffuse reflection (i.e., reflection devoid of any specular component). Apparently, many illuminating engineers treat all reflecting surfaces as though they were purely diffuse. We also show that some of the definitions that do not agree with experiment are nevertheless valid for the extreme cases of purely diffuse and purely specular reflection. Definitions that apply to these special cases do not necessarily apply in general."

Measurements were made of the plane-polarized components of the reflected light as well as of the mixed radiation (containing all components of polarization). The test materials included a magnesium oxide ceramic and aluminum coated ground glass, thereby permitting a study of reflection in the presence and in the absence of subsurface scattering. The angle of incidence was varied from 10\u00b0 to 87\u00b0, while the angle of reflection extended from 0\u00b0 to 89\u00b0. The roughness of the test surfaces ranged from optically smooth to 5.8 \u03bc, while the measurements were performed monochromatically at a wavelength of 0.5 \u03bc. The measured directional distributions affirm that the diffuse limit (Lambert\u2019s cosine law) does not hold when roughened surfaces are illuminated at moderate to large angles of incidence. Rather, it is found that a maximum in the distribution of the reflected radiance occurs at reflection angles larger than the specular-ray direction. The contributions of the s and p components of polarization to this off-specular peak are made clear. The degree of polarization imparted by reflection at surfaces of varying roughness is also investigated. It is shown that the absence or presence of subsurface scattering is an important factor. The various findings of the experiments are subjected to interpretation by a model of the reflection process which pictures the surface as being composed of elementary mirror-like facets."

Surfaces of solid rocks, volcanic slags, or coarsely ground rock powders do not have the intricate structure necessary for backscattering light strongly, but finely pulverized dielectric particles can build extremely complex surfaces that can reproduce the lunar scattering law. It is concluded that the surface of the moon is covered with a layer of fine rock dust composed of particles of the order of 10-micron average diameter and that 90 per cent of the volume of the surface layer is voids."

                "text": "In 1963, Melamed developed a theory of diffuse reflec\u00ad tance spectroscopy based on a model in which a powdered sample is treated as a collection of uniformly sized roughsurfaced spherical particles. Subsequently, the same model has been applied to develop other reflectance equa\u00ad tions. The main points favoring the model are that it is undoubtedly the most realistic model on which a theory of reflectance can be based and that use of it results in equa\u00ad tions that relate the diffuse reflectance to the fundamental optical parameters. It has been suggested that the most severe limitation of the model is the assumption of uniform particle size. Although uniform particle size can be ap\u00ad proached experimentally, it cannot be achieved; and, in any case, it may often be convenient to study reflectance prop\u00ad erties of samples with nonuniformly sized particles. It is therefore the purpose of this Letter to illustrate that, for the simplest particle model theory, the equations are valid without the use of the assumption of uniform particle size and to determine the type of average particle size value that must be used in the reflectance equations. Although the simplest particle model theory is undoubtedly not as accurate as the more elaborate ones, it has been shown to agree reasonably well with the more elaborate theories for relative index of refraction values between 1.5-2.5, which are the most commonly encountered values. The advantage of the simplified particle model theory is that the equations resulting from it are easily applied. Consider a powdered layer of infinite thickness with par\u00ad ticles that vary in size and onto which monochromatic light of constant intensity is directed. A collection of the parti\u00ad cles that may be considered to represent the particle size distribution may be selected as lying between X and X + \u03b4X below the sample surface in such a way that \u03b4X is suffi\u00ad ciently small that the radiation flux Id impinging on the particles moving in the downward direction (away from the sample surface) and Iu impinging on the particles moving in the upward direction are essentially constant throughout the layer of particles. Then the following equation may be written:"

A layer of fine, loosely compacted dust is in the category of surfaces described by this model, but volcanic foam is not. The shape of the photometric curve depends on the fractional void volume.

Several target areas were chosen at selected locations around the spacecraft, and photometric measurements were taken with the television camera throughout the lunar day. Surveyor I data agree within \u00b120% with the terrestrially observed photometric properties. Initial examination of the data indicates no anomalies of the photometric properties of homogeneous areas on scales greater than 6 cm in diameter. Luminance factors were estimated from the observed data and ranged from 7.0% to 7.5% for more than 91% of the area; however, values of 5% to 25% were recorded in some locations. The chromaticity coordinates of the disturbed area near one of the footpads were found to be very close to natural sunlight on a gray paint. A preliminary estimate of the spectral radiance factor of this area is given, using an eigenvector-analysis technique. The spacecraft characteristics, viewing geometry, and ground-recording techniques are included, along with a brief description of errors."

Parameters are then obtained for a model for randomly shaped particles, and used to relate the diffuse reflectance to the optical absorption coefficient, the index of refraction, and the particle diameter. The relationship is compared with measurements on materials of different refractive indices.Part II deals with applications to luminescent powders, the calculation of the characteristics of emission in the presence of optical absorption, and the calculation of cascade transfer yields."

Isopleths are drawn from these on graphs which simulate glitter-pattern photographs through projections of sea-surface grid points on an inclined plane assumed to be in front of the observer. The intensity computed for each grid point is based on a calculation of the wave-surface orientation required for direct reflection from source to observer at that point; the probability of occurrence of this orientation, determined from the Cox-Munk distribution, is the principal factor in the computed intensity. The curvature of the earth is taken into account, and calculations are made for various cases of source elevation angle, observer altitude, and wind speed (the controlling parameter for the distribution of wave inclinations). Percent polarization is computed for the glitter patterns, and projected isopleths of this quantity are plotted. The effects of variations in wind speed, source elevation angle, and observer height on the morphology of the glitter pattern are shown, and such phenomena as the shifting of a reflected image toward the horizon are clearly demonstrated. It is suggested that the technique developed here could be useful in evaluating models of ocean wave structure and in making remote determinations of the sea state in the region of the glitter pattern."

The spectral reflectance of green vegetation against a soil background decreases in regions of absorption and increases in regions of minimal or no absorption as the vegetational density increases until a stable or unchanging spectral reflectance, called the asymptotic spectral reflectance, is reached. Results indicated spectral reflectance asymptotes occurred at significantly lower levels of total wet biomass, total dry biomass, dry green biomass, chlorophyll content, and leaf water content in regions of strong pigment absorption (low detectability threshold) than in the photographic ir region where absorption was at a minimum (high detectability threshold). These findings suggested that photographic ir sensors were more suited to remote sensing of moderate to high biomass levels or vegetational density in a grass canopy than were sensors operating in regions of the spectrum where strong absorption occurred."

The smooth shading technique described here has been used to produce a large variety of pictures of which several airplanes, a car, a human face and some mathematical surfaces are included to illustrate the effect of the method.

The model accurately predicts the absorbed, reflected, and transmitted radiation of normal incidence as a function of wavelength resulting from the leaf-irradiance interaction over the spectral interval of 0.40-2.50 microm. The leaf optical system has been represented as Markov process with a unique transition matrix at each 0.01-microm increment between 0.40 microm and 2.50 microm. Probabilities are calculated at every wavelength interval from leaf thickness, structure, pigment composition, and water content. Simulation results indicate that this approach gives accurate estimations of actual measured values for dicot leaf absorption, reflection, and transmission as a function of wavelength."
