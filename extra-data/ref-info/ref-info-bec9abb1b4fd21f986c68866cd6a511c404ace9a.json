Text paragraphs and areas of graphic type may be of any shape, individually rotated and in any arrangement. Previous document analysis techniques are not well suited to such complex layouts. This paper introduces a new method for the segmentation of images of document pages having both traditional and complex layouts. The underlining idea is to efficiently produce a flexible description (by means of tiles) of the background space which surrounds the printed regions in the page image under all the above conditions. Using this description of space, the contours of printed regions are identified with significant accuracy. The new approach is fast as there is no need for skew detection and correction, and only few simple operations are performed on the description of the background (not on the pixel-based data)."

Complex layouts are supported as well as the flexible configuration of goal-oriented performance analysis scenarios. The comparison of segmentation results against the ground truth is performed in a very efficient way based on a decomposition of any region shape into an interval-based description. The framework has been validated using the dataset and method results of the ICDAR2005 Page Segmentation Competition."

The aim of this contest was to evaluate all existing algorithms for document image segmentation that can be applied to Newspaper page segmentation. We evaluated the performance of three different newspaper segmentation algorithms on tracing all basic entities that appear in newspaper pages from the beginning of the previous century up to the present. The selected entities are text regions, lines and images/drawings. Both training and test sets come from Greek and English newspapers. The performance evaluation method is based on counting the number of matches between the entities detected by the algorithms and the entities of the ground truth. In order to rank the global performance of each participant, we employed a metric that combines the average values of detection rate and recognition accuracy."

Lines and tables are among the most frequent graphic, non-textual entities in documents and their detection is directly related to the OCR performance as well as to the document layout description. We propose a workflow for table detection that comprises three distinct steps: (i) image pre-processing; (ii) horizontal and vertical line detection and (iii) table detection. The efficiency of the proposed method is demonstrated by using a performance evaluation scheme which considers a great variety of documents such as forms, newspapers/magazines, scientific journals, tickets/bank cheques, certificates and handwritten documents."

In particular, there is currently no ground-truth for the evaluation of the performance of page segmentation methods dealing with complex-shaped regions and documents with non-uniformly oriented regions.This paper describes a new, flexible, ground-truthing tool. It is fast and easy to use as it performs page segmentation to obtain a first description of regions. The ground-truthing system allows for the editing (merging, splitting and shape alteration) of each of the region outlines obtained from page segmentation. The resulting ground-truth regions are described in terms of isothetic polygons to ensure flexibility and wide applicability. The system also provides for the labelling of each of the ground truth regions according to the type of their content and their logical function. The former can be used to evaluate page classification, while the latter can be used in assessing logical layout structure extraction."

An efficient representation scheme for document images is necessary to solve this problem. Document representation involves techniques of thresholding, skew detection, geometric layout analysis, and logical layout analysis. The derived representation can then be used in document storage and retrieval. Page segmentation is an important stage in representing document images obtained by scanning journal pages. The performance of a document understanding system greatly depends on the correctness of page segmentation and labeling of different regions such as text, tables, images, drawings, and rulers. We use the traditional bottom-up approach based on the connected component extraction to efficiently implement page segmentation and region identification. A new document model which preserves top-down generation information is proposed based on which a document is logically represented for interactive editing, storage, retrieval, transfer, and logical analysis. Our algorithm has a high accuracy and takes approximately 1.4 seconds on a SGI Indy workstation for model creation, including orientation estimation, segmentation, and labeling (text, table, image, drawing, and ruler) for a 2550/spl times/3300 image of a typical journal page scanned at 300 dpi. This method is applicable to documents from various technical journals and can accommodate moderate amounts of skew and noise."

We have adopted a policy of classifying each pixel (rather than regions) by content type: we discuss the motivation and engineering implications of this choice. We describe experiments on a wide variety of document-image and content types, and discuss performance in detail in terms of classification speed, per-pixel classification accuracy, per-page inventory accuracy, and subjective quality of page segmentation. These show that even modest per-pixel classification accuracies (of, e.g., 60-70%) support usefully high recall and precision rates (of, e.g., 80-90%) for retrieval queries of document collections seeking pages that contain a given minimum fraction of a certain type of content."

However, this policy also allows content classes to vary frequently within small regions, often yielding areas where several content classes are mixed together. This does not reflect the way that real content is organized: typically almost all small local regions are of uniform class. This observation suggested a post-classification methodology which enforces local uniformity without imposing a restricted class of region shapes. We choose features extracted from small local regions (e.g. 4-5 pixels radius) with which we train classifiers that operate on the output of previous classifiers, guided by ground truth. This provides a sequence of post-classifiers, each trained separately on the results of the previous classifier. Experiments on a highly diverse test set of 83 document images show that this method reduces per-pixel classification errors by 23%, and it dramatically increases the occurrence of large contiguous regions of uniform class, thus providing highly usable near-solid 'masks' with which to segment the images into distinct classes. It continues to allow a wide range of complex, non-rectilinear region shapes."

While half-tone can be characterised by its inherent intensity variation, text and graphics share common characteristics except difference in spatial distribution. The success of document image analysis systems depends on the proper segmentation. The success of document image analysis systems depends on the proper segmentation of text and graphics as text is further subdivided into other classes such as heading, table and math-zones. Segmentation of graphics is essential for better OCR performance and vectorization in computer vision applications. Graphics segmentation from text is particularly difficult in the context of graphics made of small components (dashed or dotted lines etc.) which have many features similar to texts. Here we propose a robust technique for segmenting all sorts of graphics and texts in any orientation from document pages."

We also propose a rule-based growing algorithm used for layout understanding. The implementation of layout representation is discussed at the same time. Using these algorithms with a Chinese OCR engine, we developed a complete system that can be used for automatic electronic publishing. The algorithms were proved to be efficient and practical by experimental results and by a practically running system."

Defined as an array of black pixel run-lengths, DSCC works very well as an image structure element or vector in our vectorization algorithm. By merging multiple DSCCs under some constraints, we are able to extract the form frame lines automatically yet fast. The speed of our algorithm is comparable with some well-known projection methods. Experiments show that our algorithm is fast, resistant to moderate serious line breaks and can detect diagonal lines with any angle."
