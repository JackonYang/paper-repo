The statistical translation uses two sources of information: a translation model and a language model. The language model used is a standard bigram model. For the translation model, the alignment probabilities are made dependent on the differences in the alignment positions rather than on the absolute positions. Thus, the approach amounts to a first-order Hidden Markov model (HMM) as they are used successfully in speech recognition for the time alignment problem. Under the assumption that the alignment is monotone with respect to the word order in both languages, an efficient search strategy for translation can be formulated. The details of the search algorithm are described. Experiments on the EuTrans corpus produced a word error rate of 5.1%."

The idea of the model is to make the alignment probabilities dependent on the differences in the alignment positions rather than on the absolute positions. To achieve this goal, the approach uses a first-order Hidden Markov model (HMM) for the word alignment problem as they are used successfully in speech recognition for the time alignment problem. The difference to the time alignment HMM is that there is no monotony constraint for the possible word orderings. We describe the details of the model and test the model on several bilingual corpora."

We define a concept of word-by-word alignment between such pairs of sentences. For any given pair of such sentences each of our models assigns a probability to each of the possible word-by-word alignments. We give an algorithm for seeking the most probable of these alignments. Although the algorithm is suboptimal, the alignment thus obtained accounts well for the word-by-word relationships in the pair of sentences. We have a great deal of data in French and English from the proceedings of the Canadian Parliament. Accordingly, we have restricted our work to these two languages; but we feel that because our algorithms have minimal linguistic content they would work well on other pairs of languages. We also feel, again because of the minimal linguistic content of our algorithms, that it is reasonable to argue that word-by-word alignments are inherent in any sufficiently large bilingual corpus."
