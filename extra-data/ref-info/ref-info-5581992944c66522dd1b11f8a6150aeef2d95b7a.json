Combining the constraints across many adjectives, a clustering algorithm separates the adjectives into groups of different orientations, and finally, adjectives are labeled positive or negative. Evaluations on real data and simulation experiments indicate high levels of performance: classification precision is more than 90% for adjectives that occur in a modest number of conjunctions in the corpus."

Over the past few years, the availability of several large-scale symbol taxonomies and axiomatizations (often called Ontologies) has generated considerable interest, mostly for how they can be used to assist with such integration. This paper outlines recent attempt at USC/ISI to create a single large Ontology for general free use over the Web, as performed under the aegis of the ANSI Ad Hoc Committee on Ontology Standardization. Eventually, this socalled Reference Ontology may combine the existing largescale ontologies WordNet, MIKROKOSMOS, EDR, CYC, and SENSUS into a single framework. The paper provides semiautomated cross-ontology concept alignment heuristics and describes their use, operation, and results."

It is treated as neither a \\natural\" entity waiting to be discovered nor a purely theoretical construct. This paper describes how a semantico-pragmatic analyzer, Mikrokosmos, uses knowledge from a situated ontology as well as from language-speciic knowledge sources (lexicons and microtheory rules). Also presented are some guidelines for acquiring ontological concepts and an overview of the technology developed in the Mikrokosmos project for large-scale acquisition and maintenance of ontological databases. Tools for acquiring, maintaining, and browsing ontologies can be shared more readily than ontologies themselves. Ontological knowledge bases can be shared as computational resources if such tools provide translators between diierent representation formats. 1 A Situated Ontology World models (ontologies) in computational applications are artiicially constructed entities. They are created, not discovered. This is why so many diierent world models were suggested. Many ontologies are developed for purely theoretical purposes or without the context of a practical situation (e. Many practical knowledge-based systems, on the other hand, employ world or domain models without recognizing them as a separate knowledge source (e.g., Farwell, et al. 1993). In the eld of natural language processing (NLP) there is now a consensus that all NLP systems that seek to represent and manipulate meanings of texts need an ontology (e. In our continued eeorts to build a multilingual knowledge-based machine translation (KBMT) system using an interlingual meaning representation (e.g., Onyshkevych and Nirenburg, 1994), we have developed an ontology to facilitate natural language interpretation and generation. The central goal of the Mikrokosmos project is to develop a system that produces a comprehensive Text Meaning Representation (TMR) for an input text in any of a set of source languages. 1 Knowledge that supports this process is stored both in language-speciic knowledge sources and in an independently motivated, language-neutral ontology (e. An ontology for NLP purposes is a body of knowledge about the world (or a domain) that a) is a repository of primitive symbols used in meaning representation; b) organizes these symbols in a tangled subsumption hierarchy; and c) further interconnects these symbols using a rich system of semantic and discourse-pragmatic relations deened among the concepts. In order for such an ontology to become a computational resource for solving problems such as ambiguity and reference resolution, it must be actually constructed, not merely deened formally, as is the \u2026"

Such passages take a character's psychological point of view. A language understander must determine the current psychological point of view in order to distinguish the beliefs of the characters from the facts of the story, to correctly attribute beliefs and other attitudes to their sources, and to understand the discourse relations among sentences. Tracking the psychological point of view is not a trivial problem, because many sentences are not explicitly marked for point of view, and whether the point of view of a sentence is objective or that of a character (and if the latter, which character it is) often depends on the context in which the sentence appears. Tracking the psychological point of view is the problem addressed in this work. The approach is to seek, by extensive examinations of naturally occurring narrative, regularities in the ways that authors manipulate point of view, and to develop an algorithm that tracks point of view on the basis of the regularities found. This paper presents this algorithm, gives demonstrations of an implemented system, and describes the results of some preliminary empirical studies, which lend support to the algorithm."

A version of the method, actor-role analysis, is encoded in a computer program, SpinDoetor, which can automatically detect the point(s) of view represented in some news stories. SpinDoctor is a computer program designed to detect ideological point of viewlin news stories. To detect point of view, SpinDoctor implements a critical reading strategy called actor-role analysis (Sack, 1994a; Sack, 1994b). Actor-role analysis was developed around the following observation: one means of detecting point of view is to examine how certain people, who appear again and again in the news (i.e., news actors), are described or portrayed (i.e., are assigned roles). Thus, for example, if one is given a news story which mentions Oliver North -- (in)famous for his role in the Iran-Contra affair and recent senatorial campaign -- and the story assigns North the role of patriot (via the use of certain adjectives and verbs), one can quite certain that the point of view expressed in the story is significantly to the right (in the spectrum of US politics) than that expressed by another news story which assigns North the role of villain or criminal. Two aspects of actor-role analysis, as it is implemented in the SpinDoctor system, might be of especial interest to researchers concerned with textual analysis: (1) A representation for ideological point of view: Although practically all, contemporary, AI systems for NLP are capable of finding actors and roles in texts to fill in scripts, frames, or templates (e.g., Jacobs and Ran, 1993), none of these systems assign any political significance to the pairing of certain actors with certain roles (e.g., North as patriot versus North as criminal). contrast, I maintain that sets of actor-role pairs are an interesting and implementable representation for differing ideological points of view. The proposed actor-role representation of ideological point of view accords with some recent work by Lakoff (1991) and generalizes and improves upon previous AI work on representation of ideology (e.g., Abelson and Carroll, 1966; Carbonell, 1978). (2) An algorithm for anaphoric resolution: Actor-role analysis incorporates a new anaphoric resolution algorithm. It is shown how careful attention to actor-role pairings assists in the resolution of anaphoric reference. By noting, for example, that an instance of the pronoun \"he\" is cast in the role of victim and that, earlier in the same story, \"Lieut. Rodriguez\" is also cast in the role of"

These models can serve as possible explanations of the observed relationships among a set of m manifest polytomous variables. The class of models considered here includes both models in which the parameters are identifiable and also models in which the parameters are not. For each of the models considered here, a relatively simple method is presented for calculating the maximum likeli- hood estimate of the frequencies in the m-way contingency table expected under the model, and for determining whether the parameters in the estimated model are identifiable. In addition, methods are presented for testing whether the model fits the observed data, and for replacing unidentifiable models that fit by identifiable models that fit. Some illus- trative applications to data are also included. This paper deals with the relationships among m polytomous variables, i.e. with the analysis of an m-way contingency table. These m variables are manifest variables in that, for each observed individual in a sample, his class with respect to each of the m variables is observed. We also consider here polytomous variables that are latent in that an individ- ual's class with respect to these variables is not observed. The classes of a latent variable will be called latent classes. Consider first a 4-way contingency table which cross-classifies a sample of n individuals with respect to four manifest polytomous variables A, B, C and D. If there is, say, some latent dichotomous variable X, so that each of the n individuals is in one of the two latent classes with respect to this variable, and within the tth latent class the manifest variables (A, B, C, D) are mutually independent, then this two-class latent structure would serve as a simple explanation of the observed relationships among the variables in the 4-way con- tingency table for the n individuals. There is a direct generalization when the latent variable has T classes. We shall present some relatively simple methods for determining whether the observed relationships among the variables in the m-way contingency table can be explained by a T-class structure, or by various modifications and extensions of this latent structure. To illustrate the methods we analyze Table 1, a 24 contingency table presented earlier by Stouffer & Toby (1951, 1962, 1963), which cross-classifies 216 respondents with respect to whether they tend towards universalistic values ( + ) or particularistic values (-) when confronted by each of four different situations of role conflict.
