This article focuses on the problem of obtaining maximum likelihood estimates (MLE) for the parameters of log-linear models under this type of incomplete data. The appropriate systems of equations are presented and the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm (Dempster, Laird, and Rubin 1977) is suggested as one of the possible methods for solving them. The algorithm has certain advantages but other alternatives may be computationally more effective. Tests of fit for log-linear models in the presence of incomplete data are considered. The data from the Protective Services Project for Older Persons (Blenkner, Bloom, and Nielsen 1971; Blenkner, Bloom, and Weber 1974) are used to illustrate the procedures discussed in the article."

The general location model of Olkin & Tate (1961) and extensions introduced by Krzanowski (1980, 1982) form the basis for our methods. Maximum likelihood estimation with incomplete data is achieved by an application of the EM algorithm (Dempster, Laird & Rubin, 1977). Special cases of the algorithm include Orchard & Woodbury's (1972) algorithm for incomplete normal samples, Fuchs's (1982) algorithms for log linear modelling of partially classified contingency tables, and Day's (1969) algorithm for multivariate normal mixtures. Applications include: (a) imputation of missing values, (b) logistic regression and discriminant analysis with missing predictors and unclassified observations, (c) linear regression with missing continuous and categorical predictors, and (d) parametric cluster analysis with incomplete data. Methods are illustrated using data from the St Louis Risk Research Project.

(1977) discussed the method and derived basic properties, demonstrating that a variety of procedures previously developed rather informally could be unified. The common strand to problems where the approach is applicable is a notion of 'incomplete data'; this includes the conventional sense of 'missing data' but is much broader than that. The EM algorithm demon- strates its strength in situations where some hypothetical experiment yields data from which estimation is particularly convenient and economical: the 'incomplete' data actually at hand are regarded as observable functions of these 'complete' data. The resulting algorithms, while usually slow to converge, are often extremely simple and remain practical in large problems where no other approaches may be feasible. Dempster et al. (1977) briefly refer to the use of the same approach to the problem of finding the posterior mode (maximum a posteriori estimate) in a Bayesian estima-"

Illustrative examples especially studied in this paper concern grouped and censored normal samples and normal mixtures. A simple iterative method of solution is proposed and studied. It is shown that the sequence of iterates converges to a relative maximum of the likelihood function, and that the convergence is geometric with a factor of convergence which for large samples equals the maxi-mal relative loss of Fisher information due to the incompleteness of data. This large sample factor of convergence is illustrated diagrammaticaily for the examples mentioned above. Experiences of practical application are mentioned."

The first of these is a subclass of hierarchical log linear models. Each of its models can be represented by an undirected graph. In the second class each model corresponds to a particular kind of a directed graph instead and can be characterized by a nontrivial factorization of the joint distribution in terms of response variables. We derive decomposable or multiplicative models as the intersecting class. This result has useful consequences for exploratory types of analysis as well as for the model interpretation: we can give an aid for detecting well-fitting decomposable models in a transformation of the observed contingency table and each decomposable model may be interpreted with the help of an undirected or directed graph."

These models are hierarchical models that can be represented by a simple, undirected graph on as many vertices as the dimension of the corresponding table. Further all these models can be given an interpretation in terms of conditional independence and the interpretation can be read directly off the graph in the form of a Markov property. The class of graphical models contains that of decomposable models and we give a simple criterion for decomposability of a given graphical model. To some extent we discuss estimation problems and give suggestions for further work."

The models assume that the conditional distribution of the quantitative variables, given the qualitative, is multivariate Gaussian. The computational architecture is set up by forming a tree of belief universes, and the calculations are then performed by local message passing between universes. The asymmetry between the quantitative and qualitative variables sets some additional limitations for the specification and propagation structure. Approximate methods when these are not appropriately fulfilled are sketched. It has earlier been shown how to exploit the local structure in the specification of a discrete probability model for fast and efficient computation, thereby paving the way for exploiting probability-based models as parts of realistic systems for planning and decision support. The purpose of this article is to extend this computational s..."

(ii) does the sequence of parameter estimates generated by EM converge? Several convergence results are obtained under conditions that are applicable to many practical situations. Two useful special cases are: (a) if the unobserved complete-data specification can be described by a curved exponential family with compact parameter space, all the limit points of any EM sequence are stationary points of the likelihood function; (b) if the likelihood function is unimodal and a certain differentiability condition is satisfied, then any EM sequence converges to the unique maximum likelihood estimate.

Using a real, moderately complex, medical example we illustrate how qualitative and quantitative knowledge can be represented within a directed graphical model, generally known as a belief network in this context. Exact probabilistic inference on individual cases is possible using a general propagation procedure. When data on a series of cases are available, Bayesian statistical techniques can be used for updating the original subjective quantitative inputs, and we present a sets of diagnostics for identifying conflicts between the data and the prior specification. A model comparison procedure is explored, and a number of links made with mainstream statistical methods. Details are given on the use of Dirichlet prior distributions for learning about parameters and the process of transforming the original graphical model to a junction tree as the basis for efficient computation."

When compared to traditional scemingly unrelated regression (SUR) methods the LME approach saves both computer time and space, and it provides parameter estimates that are less likely to suffer from round-off error. However, the LME method is difficult to implement without the use of specially written computer programs and, unlike traditional SUR methods, it does not automatically provide an estimate of the covariance of the parameters. This paper solves these two problems, the first by providing a simplified solution to the Liapunov matrix equation which can be written in a few lines of code in computer languages such as SAS PROC MATRIX/IMLTM or GAUSSTM; the second, by bootstrapping the parameter covariance matrix."

                "text": "The literature on categorized data has been primarily concerned with the analysis of contingency tables. In the usual situation, it is assumed that we have sampled a multinomial population in which the classes are described according to two or more categories and the data are summarized in a contingency table with corresponding dimension. Specifically, in a two-way table with r rows and c columns, it is assumed that the data in the rc cells follow a multinomial distribution with cell probabilities 7iij . The usual analysis consists of estimating the rii and testing certain hypotheses on these parameters. In this paper, we consider situations in which the data have been taken from such a multinomial population, but, because of partial categorization of some of the observations, the summary is in the form of two or more related tables. For example, we may have data ni;, i = 1, 2; j = 1, 2, 3, in a 2 X 3 table from a population with six classes described by two categories with two and three classes, respectively. Let us assume that in addition, we have data mij , i = 1, 2; j = 1, 2, in a 2 X 2 table whose description is derived from the original table in the sense that the first two column classifications have been combined. For the purpose of gaining additional precision in the analysis, it is desired to combine the information in the two sets of data. If the data nii are assumed to follow a multinomial distribution with parameters irij, = 1, 2; j = 1, 2, 3, then the data mij are also multinomial with parameters (7ril + 7r12), 713 , (X21 + r22), r23 . Assuming that the two sets of data are independent, we may obtain maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters from the combined data using the procedure described by Hocking and Oxspring [1971] (hereafter abbreviated (HO)). The purpose of this paper is to illustrate the application of (HO) to the estimation of parameters from contingency data when, in addition to the basic table, we have tables which arise because row and/or column classifications have been combined. In some cases, the partially categorized data arises because of the nature of the data and the manner in which it was collected. Alternatively, the experiment may have been intentionally designed"

This paper outlines an implementation the HUGIN shell - for handling a domain model expressed by a causal probabilistic network. The only topological restriction imposed on the network is that, it must not contain any directed loops. The approach is illustrated step by step by solving a genetic breeding problem. A graph representation of the domain model is interactively created by using instances of the basic network components-- nodes and arcs--as building blocks. This structure, together with the quantitative relations between nodes and their immediate causes expressed as conditional probabilities, are automatically transformed into a tree structure, a junction tree. Here a computationally efficient and conceptually simple algebra of Bayesian belief universes supports incorporation of new evidence, propagation of information, and calculation of revised beliefs in the states of the nodes in the network. Finally, as an exam ple of a real world application, MUNIN an expert system for electromyography is discussed."

High-quality decompositions are essential for performing efficient inference in probabilistic networks. Optimum decomposition of probabilistic networks is known to be NP-hard (Wen, 1990). The paper proves that cost-function changes can be computed locally, which is essential to the efficiency of the annealing algorithm. Pragmatic control schedules which reduce the running time of the annealing algorithm are presented and evaluated. Apart from the conventional temperature parameter, these schedules involve the radius of the search space as a new control parameter.
