Existing approaches for table detection mainly focus on detecting tables in single columns of text and do not work reliably on documents with varying layouts. This paper presents a practical algorithm for table detection that works with a high accuracy on documents with varying layouts (company reports, newspaper articles, magazine pages, ...). An open source implementation of the algorithm is provided as part of the Tesseract OCR engine. Evaluation of the algorithm on document images from publicly available UNLV dataset shows competitive performance in comparison to the table detection module of a commercial OCR system."

The approach is designed as a structured labeling problem, which learns the layout of the document and labels its various entities as table header, table trailer, table cell and non-table region. We develop features which encode the foreground block characteristics and the contextual information. These features are provided to a fixed point model which learns the inter-relationship between the blocks. The fixed point model attains a contraction mapping and provides a unique label to each block. We compare the results with Condition Random Fields(CRFs). Unlike CRFs, the fixed point model captures the context information in terms of the neighbourhood layout more efficiently. Experiments on the images picked from UW-III (University of Washington) dataset, UNLV dataset and our dataset consisting of document images with multicolumn page layout, show the applicability of our algorithm in layout analysis and table detection."

T-Recs works on the output of commercial OCR systems that provide the word bounding box geometry together with the text itself (e.g. Xerox ScanWorX). While T-Recs performs well on a number of document categories, business letters still remained a challenging domain because the T-Recs location heuristics are mislead by their header or footer resulting in a low recognition precision. Business letters such as invoices are a very interesting domain for industrial applications due to the large amount of documents to be analyzed and the importance of the data carried within their tables. Hence, we developed a more restrictive approach which is implemented in the T-Recs++ prototype. This paper describes the ideas of the T-Recs++ location and also proposes a quality evaluation measure that reflects the bottom-up strategy of either T-Recs or T-Recs++. Finally, some results comparing both systems on a collection of business letters are given."

The physical presentation on one hand by means of a nested layout structure representing a \u201cpart-of\u201d-relationship, e.g. of text blocks, text line segments, words, and characters. The composition of meaningful entities, such as title, author, address, or abstract, on the other, in terms of a logical structure. Both views to the contents of a document are complementary. They relate to each other as being explicitely given by publication guidelines where the position and dimensions of logical objects are precisely described. Moreover such \u201cpublication guidelines\u201d more or less hold for various types of documents. Although they are intuitively understandable for human beings, they are hard to formalize explicitly because of the freedom originators and authors of documents have in order to incorporate their own creativity. However, humans use these intrinsic layout features to get first hints towards the logical meaning of document information. This is even obvious when considering the very difficult document examples in Figure 1 where no text is given but it is nevertheless possible to generate hypothesis for logical meaning."

Today, quite a large number of different approaches facing these tasks have been described in literature or are available as part of commercial OCR systems that claim to deal with tables on the scanned documents and to treat them accordingly.\n However, the problem of detecting tables is not yet solved at all. Different approaches have different strengths and weak points. Some fail in certain situations or layouts where others perform better. How shall one know, which approach or system is the best for his specific job? The answer to this question raises the demand for an objective comparison of different approaches which address the same task of spotting tables and recognizing their structure.\n This paper describes our approach towards establishing a complete and publicly available, hence open environment for the benchmarking of table spotting and structural analysis. We provide free access to the ground truthing tool and evaluation mechanism described in this paper, describe the ideas behind and we also provide ground truth for the 547 documents of the UNLV and UW-3 datasets that contain tables.\n In addition, we applied the quality measures to the results that were generated by the T-Recs system which we developed some years ago and which we started to further advance since a few months."

For a total of 1,125 document pages having 518 table entities and a total of 10,941 cell entities, our table detection algorithm takes line, word segmentation results as input and obtains around 90% cell correct detection rates."
