The first experiment compared tables and bar charts for their effects on readability, interpretation accuracy, and decision making. No differences in interpretation accuracy or decision quality were observed for the two groups, although tabular reports were rated as \"easier to read and understand\" than graphical reports. The second experiment compared line plots to tables for their effects on interpretation accuracy and decision quality. Subjects with graphical reports outperformed those with tables. There were no meaningful differences in interpretation accuracy across treatment groups. The third experiment compared graphical and tabular reports for their ability to convey a \"message\" to the reader. Only in situations in which a vast amount of information was presented and relatively simple impressions were to be made, did subjects given graphs outperform those using tables.\nThis program of cumulative experiments indicates that generalized claims of superiority of graphic presentation are unsupported, at least for decision-related activities. In fact, the experiments suggest that the effectiveness of the data display format is largely a function of the characteristics of the task at hand, and that impressions gleaned from \"one shot\" studies of the effectiveness of the use of graphs may be nothing more than situationally dependent artifacts."

The purpose of the reported research is to take a step toward developing such principles for graphical information presentation formats. Specifically, this paper presents an investigation of the effects of graphical formats and task demands upon decision processes and decision outcomes. In a laboratory setting, research participants made choices under differing task and graphical format conditions, and their information acquisition and evaluation behaviors were recorded. The results suggest that information presentation format influences the decision time and the selection of acquisition and evaluation strategies by influencing the cognitive costs and benefits of the task environment. Other factors influencing the decision time and the choice of strategies include the characteristics of the task and the interactions between the presentation format and the other task demands. The interactions between the task demands and the graphical format appear to be complex and may impact different stages of decision process differently (e.g., acquisition versus evaluation). The findings of the current study extend the results of previous studies on information format into the domain of graphical displays. The findings also suggest that the cognitive cost/benefit framework can provide a robust theoretical foundation for design decisions regarding graphical presentation formats in decision support systems."

Furthermore, there is evidence that those features that make a graph visually attractive\u2014such as color, design complexity, and realism\u2014may actually detract from accurate comprehension.

It is suggested that the type of data and type of subject used in the work by Dickson et al. favored tabular presentation and compromise any generalization of their conclusions. The current study finds that user training/expertise is a critical variable in determining the effectiveness of graphs versus tables. The conclusion drawn is that a user-friendly system should make both modes available so that the users have the option of selecting their preferred mode. >"

The evaluation measured speed and accuracy of the subjects' interpretation of the displays of test results. Accuracy did not significantly vary with format but speed did. Response times for both graphic formats were consistently shorter than those for the narrative format. With additional practice, however, response times for the structured format were just as short.
