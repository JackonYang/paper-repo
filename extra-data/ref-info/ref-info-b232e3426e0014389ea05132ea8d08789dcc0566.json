The N-camera stereo algorithm determines the \"best\" set of correspondences between a given pair of cameras, referred to as the principal cameras. Knowledge of the relative positions of the cameras allows the 3D point hypothesized by an assumed correspondence of two features in the principal pair to be projected onto the image plane of the remaining N-2 cameras. These N-2 points are then used to verify proposed matches. Not only does the algorithm explicitly model occlusion between features of the principal pair, but the possibility of occlusions in the N-2 additional views is also modelled. The benefits and importance of this are experimentally verified. Like other multi-frame stereo algorithms, the computational and memory costs of this approach increase linearly with each additional view. Experimental results are shown for two outdoor scenes. It is clearly demonstrated that the number of correspondence errors is significantly reduced as the number of views/cameras is increased.<<ETX>>"

It is shown how the imposition of such a limit can provide a suitable balance between the twin requirements of disambiguating power and the ability to deal with a wide range of surfaces. Next, the design of a very simple stereo algorithm called PMF is described. In conjunction with certain other constraints used in many other stereo algorithms, PMF employs a limit on allowable disparity gradients of 1, a value that coincides with that reported for human stereoscopic vision. The excellent performance of PMF is illustrated on a series of natural and artificial stereograms. Finally, the differences between the theoretical justification for the use of disparity gradients for solving the stereo correspondence problems presented in the paper and others that exist in the stereo algorithm literature are discussed."

It integrates area-based and feature-based primitives. The area-based processing provides a dense disparity map, and the feature-based processing provides an accurate location of discontinuities. An area-based cross correlation, an ordering constraint, and a weak surface smoothness assumption are used to produce an initial disparity map. This disparity map is only a blurred version of the true one because of the smoothing introduced by the cross correlation. The problem can be reduced by introducing edge information. The disparity map is smoothed and the unsupported points removed. This method gives an active role to edgels parallel to the epipolar lines, whereas they are discarded in most feature-based systems. Very good results have been obtained on complex scenes in different domains. >"

These occur typically as parts of the background immediately to the left and right sides of nearby occluding objects, and are present in most natural scenes. Previous approaches to stereo either ignored these unmatchable points or attempted to weed them out in a second pass. An algorithm that incorporates them from the start as a strong clue to depth discontinuities is presented. The authors first derive a measure for goodness of fit and a prior based on a simplified model of objects in space, which leads to an energy functional depending both on the depth as measured from a central cyclopean eye and on the regions of points occluded from the left and right eye perspectives. They minimize this using dynamic programming along epipolar lines followed by annealing in both dimensions. Experiments indicate that this method is very effective even in difficult scenes.<<ETX>>"

The stereo matching problem, that is, obtaining a correspondence between right and left images, can be cast as a search problem. When a pair of stereo images is rectified, pairs of corresponding points can be searched for within the same scanlines. We call this search intra-scanline search. This intra-scanline search can be treated as the problem of finding a matching path on a two-dimensional (2D) search plane whose axes are the right and left scanlines. Vertically connected edges in the images provide consistency constraints across the 2D search planes. Inter-scanline search in a three-dimensional (3D) search space, which is a stack of the 2D search planes, is needed to utilize this constraint. Our stereo matching algorithm uses edge-delimited intervals as elements to be matched, and employs the above mentioned two searches: one is inter-scanline search for possible correspondences of connected edges in right and left images and the other is intra-scanline search for correspondences of edge-delimited intervals on each scanline pair. Dynamic programming is used for both searches which proceed simultaneously: the former supplies the consistency constraint to the latter while the latter supplies the matching score to the former. An interval-based similarity metric is used to compute the score. The algorithm has been tested with different types of images including urban aerial images, synthesized images, and block scenes, and its computational requirement has been discussed."

With the increasing demand for 3-D spatial information for tasks of passive navigation [7,12], automatic surveillance [9], aerial cartography [10,13], and inspection in industrial automation, the importance of effective stereo analysis has been made quite clear. A particular challenge is to provide reliable and accurate depth data for input to object or terrain modelling systems (such as [5]. This paper describes an algorithm for such stereo sensing It uses an edge-based line-by-line stereo correlation scheme, and appears to be fast, robust, and parallel implementable. The processing consists of extracting edge descriptions for a stereo pair of images, linking these edges to their nearest neighbors to obtain the edge connectivity structure, correlating the edge descriptions on the basis of local edge properties, then cooperatively removmg those edge correspondences determined to be in error - those which violate the connectivity structure of the two images. A further correlation process, using a technique similar to that used for the edges, is applied to the image intensity values over intervals defined by the previous correlation The result of the processing is a full image array disparity map of the scene viewed."

For a given cost function, the algorithm finds the optimal correspondence along epipolar lines. In our case, this function is the difference of intensities between corresponding points, adjusted with a factor accounting for occlusions.

                "text": "The constant image brightness (CIB) assumption assumes that the intensities of corresponding points in two images are equal. This assumption is central to much of computer vision. However, surprisingly little work has been performed to support this assumption, despite the fact the many of algorithms are very sensitive to deviations from CIB. An examination of the images contained in the SRI JISCT stereo database revealed that the constant image brightness assumption is indeed often false. Moreover, the simple additive/multiplicative models of the form I/sub L/=/spl beta/I/sub R/+/spl alpha/ do not adequately represent the observed deviations. A comprehensive physical model of the observed deviations is difficult to develop. However, many potential sources of deviations can be represented by a nonlinear monotonically increasing relationship between intensities. Under these conditions, we believe that an expansion/contraction matching of the intensity histograms represents the best method to both measure the degree of validity of the CIB assumption and correct for it. Dynamic histogram warping (DHW) is closely related to histogram specification. It is shown that histogram specification introduces artifacts that do not occur with dynamic histogram warping. Experimental results show that image histograms are closely matched after DHW, especially when both histograms are modified simultaneously. DHW is also capable of removing simple constant additive and multiplicative biases without derivative operations, thereby avoiding amplification of high frequency noise. DHW can improve the estimates from stereo and optical flow estimators."

The viewing positions and orientations for these perspective views are known a priori, as is usually the case for such applications as robotics and industrial vision as well as close range photogrammetry. Like the conventional two-frame correlation method, the JMM and WVM require finding the extrema of 1-D curves, which are proved to theoretically approach a delta function exponentially as the number of frames increases for the JMM and are much sharper than the two-frame correlation function for both the JMM and the WVM, even when the image point to be matched cannot be easily distinguished from some of the other points. The theoretical findings have been supported by simulations. It is also proved that JMM and WVM are not sensitive to certain radiometric effects. If the same window size is used, the computational complexity for the proposed methods is about n - 1 times that for the two-frame method where n is the number of frames. Simulation results show that the JMM and WVM require smaller windows than the two-frame correlation method with better accuracy, and therefore may even be more computationally feasible than the latter since the computational complexity increases quadratically as a function of the window size."

This reconstruction is not done as a postprocessing step, but rather all of the quantities are estimated simultaneously as part of the matching algorithm. An energy functional is considered in which each of the quantities in the scene geometry is explicitly represented. For this energy functional, a smoothness prior that, in addition to its ability to detect surface discontinuities and the accompanying half-occluded regions, is able to reconstruct steeply sloping surfaces with sharp creases is used. Experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness of the algorithm are presented.<<ETX>>"

This formulation enables us to integrate the depth information from different types of matching primitives, or from different vision modules. We treat the correspondence problem and surface interpolation as different aspects of the same problem and solve them simultaneously, unlike most previous theories. We use techniques from statistical physics to compute properties of our theory and show how it relates to previous work. These techniques also suggest novel algorithms for stereo which are argued to be preferable to standard algorithms on theoretical and experimental grounds. It can be shown (Yuille, Geiger and Bulthoff 1989) that the theory is consistent with some psychophysical experiments which investigate the relative importance of different matching primitives."

These maps are local (i.e., attached to specific frames of reference). Since noise is present, they incorporate information about the ge ometry of the environment and about the uncertainty of the parameters defining the geometry. This geometric uncertainty is directly related to its source (i.e., sensor uncertainty). We show how visual maps corresponding to different positions of the robot can be registered to compute a better estimate of its displacement between the various viewpoint positions, as suming an otherwise static environment. We use these esti mates to fuse the different visual maps and reduce locally the uncertainty of the geometric primitives which have found correspondents in other maps. We propose to perform these three tasks (building, registrating, and fusing visual maps) within the general framework of extended Kalman filtering, which allows efficient combination of measurements in the presence of noise."

In this formulation depth can be represented by one or more surfaces. Prior probabilities, corresponding to natural constraints, can be defined on these surfaces to avoid the ill-posedness of vision. We advocate strong coupling between different depth cues, so that the different modules can interact during computation. This framework is rich enough to accommodate straightforwardly both consonant and contradictory cue integration, by the use of binary decision units. These units can be interpreted in terms of robust statistics. A number of existing psychophysical experiments can be understood within this framework."
