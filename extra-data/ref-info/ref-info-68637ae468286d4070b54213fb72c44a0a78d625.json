                "text": "In the last few years observations made from single cells in the striate cortex have revealed neural mechanisms which doubtless underlie many of the phenomena of binocular vision. These new observations will be reviewed and a neurophysiological theory of binocular single vision and depth discrimination, already outlined elsewhere (Barlow, Blakemoke, and Pettigrew, 1967; Nikara, Bishop, and Pettigrew, 1968; Pettigrew, Nikara, and Bishop, 1968 a and b; Joshua and Bishop, 1969) will be further elaborated below. Before proceeding with this task, it will be instructive to make brief reference to some of the evolutionary aspects of binocular vision and, prompted by our neurophysiological observations, to suggest new interpretations of some features of the evolution of single vision and depth discrimination. In addition it will be necessary to consider the psychophysics of binocular vision since it is the goal of the sensory physiologist to interpret psychophysics in neurological terms. In sharp contrast to form perception and pattern recognition, there is available in relation to binocular vision a well- structured, relatively coherent and widely-accepted body of psychophysical observation and theory, suggesting at once that the problems concerned are more tractable and perhaps less complex than those for form perception. A further matter to be considered is the role of eye movements and their co-ordination in the binocular process since vision is pre-eminently a sensorimotor activity."

It would be astonishing if such a structure did not profoundly modify the response patterns of fibres coming into it. In the cat's visual cortex, the receptive field arrangements of single cells suggest that there is indeed a degree of complexity far exceeding anything yet seen at lower levels in the visual system. In a previous paper we described receptive fields of single cortical cells, observing responses to spots of light shone on one or both retinas (Hubel & Wiesel, 1959). In the present work this method is used to examine receptive fields of a more complex type (Part I) and to make additional observations on binocular interaction (Part II). This approach is necessary in order to understand the behaviour of individual cells, but it fails to deal with the problem of the relationship of one cell to its neighbours. In the past, the technique of recording evoked slow waves has been used with great success in studies of functional anatomy. It was employed by Talbot & Marshall (1941) and by Thompson, Woolsey & Talbot (1950) for mapping out the visual cortex in the rabbit, cat, and monkey. Daniel & Whitteiidge (1959) have recently extended this work in the primate. Most of our present knowledge of retinotopic projections, binocular overlap, and the second visual area is based on these investigations. Yet the method of evoked potentials is valuable mainly for detecting behaviour common to large populations of neighbouring cells; it cannot differentiate functionally between areas of cortex smaller than about 1 mm2. To overcome this difficulty a method has in recent years been developed for studying cells separately or in small groups during long micro-electrode penetrations through nervous tissue. Responses are correlated with cell location by reconstructing the electrode tracks from histological material. These techniques have been applied to"

                "text": "Experiments were made on the posterior parietal association cortical areas 5 and in 17 hemispheres of 11 monkeys, 6 M. mulatta and 5 M. arctoides. The electrical signs of the activity of single cortical cells were recorded with microelectrodes in waking animals as they carried out certain behavioral acts in response to a series of sensory cues. The behavioral paradigms were one for detection alone, and a second for detection plus projection of the arm to contact a stationary or moving target placed at arm's length. Of the 125 microelectrode penetrations made, 1,451 neurons were identified in terms of the correlation of their activity with the behavioral acts and their sensitivity or lack of it to sensory stimuli delivered passively; 180 were studied quantitatively. The locations of cortical neurons were identified in serial sections; 94 penetrations and 1,058 neurons were located with certainty. About two-thirds of the neurons of area 5 were activated by passive rotation of the limbs at their joints; of these, 82% were related to single, contralateral joints, 10% to two or more contralateral joints, 6% to ipsilateral, and 2% to joints on both sides of the body. A few of the latter were active during complex bodily postures. A large proportion of area 5 neurons were relatively insensitive to passive joint rotations, as compared with similar neurons of the postcentral gyrus, but were driven to high rates of discharge when the same joint was rotated during an active movement of the animal..."

Thirty-four correct responses out of 50 stimulus presentations constitute the 1% significance level beyond which guessing may be ruled out. Almost all observers were able to respond considerably better than this at disparities up to about 7\u00b0, while one highly trained observer showed 90% correct responses or better up to 10\u00b0 disparity.

Although both animals learned a number of discriminations, control tests showed that both were perceiving non-depth cues such as monocular identification of minute pattern differences or brightness differences caused by reflections of polarized light. In a final experiment red/green anaglyph forms of the stereograms were viewed through red/green filters. Both monkeys, together with a third experimentally naive animal, showed incontrovertible evidence of prompt discrimination based on stereopsis. This paper makes a number of recommendations about the use of random dot stereograms to demonstrate global stereopsis in animals."

                "text": "Eye movements may be described in terms of two components: conjugate and disjunctive. A pure conjugate eye movement is one in which the two eyes move in a parallel fashion, while in a disjunctive movement changes occur in the orientation of one eye with respect to the other. A typical situation calling for a disjunctive movement is the change in binocular observation from a far to a near target, when the fixation lines of the two eyes have to converge. Recordings of eye movement responses to the presentation of targets requiring convergence show the movements to be slow compared with their reaction time (Westheimer &AMitchell, 1956). In this respect they differ from the most commonly occurring conjugate eye movements, the saccadic movements. It is clear now that saccadic eye movements are not guided, in that no adjustments in response to visual clues are made during the movement (Westheimer, 1954). The time characteristics of disjunctive movements, on the other hand, would theoretically allow correction of movements during their course on the basis of visual information. That the elements for such a control system exist is evidenced by the following two facts: (1) the sensory system on which such a control system would depend is capable of making very fine discriminations-retinal disparities of less than a minute of arc can be detected-and (2) the muscular system is quite fast and capable of making fine gradations in response. The experiments reported in this paper fall into two groups. Those describing the eye movement responses to simple types of convergence stimuli are given in Part I, and those in which responses are studied to special stimulus situations designed to elucidate the properties of the control mechanism for disjunctive eye movements are contained in Part II."

The most clearcut evidence for the presence of these two components is the finding that some individuals lack either one or the other. However, when the ability to process both convergent and divergent disparities is present in the same individual it is more difficult to demonstrate the presence of two separate mechanisms. In this paper, the mechanisms for stereopsis are shown to consist of at least two components in the same individual. This demonstration is based upon a new kind of perimetry whereby field maps for stereopsis are plotted for both convergent and divergent disparities. Extensive measurements on one observer show that the zone of the visual field over which convergent disparities are processed may differ quite distinctively from the zone of the visual field over which divergent disparities are processed."
