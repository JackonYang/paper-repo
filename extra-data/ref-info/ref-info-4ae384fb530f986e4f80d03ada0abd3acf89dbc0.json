                "text": "Path finding is a key process in many areas of computation. Optimization problems and heuristic search problems are two notable examples. The first part of this dissertation presents a class of algorithms, denoted VGA, for solving the two point shortest path problem in directed graphs with non-negative edge weights. This class is a bi-directional extension of the most efficient known uni-directional shortest path algorithms. While it has long been realized that hi-directional algorithms often provide computational savings, a theory of this has not been forthcoming until now. This theory shows how a hi-directional method using the proposed cardinal@ comparison strategy is a priori the best shortest path algorithm within the class of algorithms VGA. These theoretical results are verified by extensive tests of VGA. A computer program was written where several standard uni-directional and bi-directional strategies were compared with cardinality comparison. The program randomly generated a number of large directed graphs and each strategy in turn was tried on numerous path problems within these graphs. In heuristic search for artificial intelligence problems, algorithms similar to the two point shortest path problem are used. The spaces searched are enormous , often infinite, and in consequence the constraint on finding the shortest path is abandoned. The concern is for finding any solution path with minimum effort. The second part of the dissertation presents a theory of these problems and some experiments with the fifteen puzzle in using the methods suggested by this theory of heuristic search. The evaluation function directing the search is the sum of the distance from the starting node and an estimate of the distance to the goal. This second component is the heuristic term, and if accurate, allows efficient path finding in-iii-large spaces. Some results on the effect of error in the heuristic term are presented. Especially interesting is theorem '7.9, showing that the distance from the start should be incorporated in the evaluation function. This particular result runs counter to the reliance strictly on the heuristic term, a practice which is widespread. Bi-directional heuristic search is also proposed. VGHA, a bi-directional class of algorithms, is an extension of the Hart, Nilsson, and Raphael uni-directional heuristic search algorithms. Their results are extended to this more general class. These methods are used in solving fifteen puzzle problems and comparing the number of nodes explored. It is a continuance of the empirical work started by Doran and Michie with the \u2026"

It seems extraordinary, therefore, that so little progress has been made (and, indeed, that so little effort has been expended) toward the systematizing and quantifying of such factors. Our most precise knowledge of perception is in those areas which have yielded to psychophysical analysis (e.g., the perception of size, color, and pitch), but there is virtually no psychophysics of shape or pattern. Several difficulties may be pointed out at once: (a) Shape is a multidimensional variable, though it is often carelessly referred to as a \"dimension,\" along with brightness, hue, area, and the like, (b) The number of dimensions necessary to describe a shape is not fixed or constant, but increases with the complexity of the shape, (c) Even if we know how many dimensions are necessary in a given case, the choice of particular descriptive terms (i.e., of referenceaxes in the multidimensional space with which we are dealing) remains a problem; presumably some such terms have more psychological meaningfulness than others."

This rule is independent of the underlying joint distribution on the sample points and their classifications, and hence the probability of error R of such a rule must be at least as great as the Bayes probability of error R^{\\ast} --the minimum probability of error over all decision rules taking underlying probability structure into account. However, in a large sample analysis, we will show in the M -category case that R^{\\ast} \\leq R \\leq R^{\\ast}(2 --MR^{\\ast}/(M-1)) , where these bounds are the tightest possible, for all suitably smooth underlying distributions. Thus for any number of categories, the probability of error of the nearest neighbor rule is bounded above by twice the Bayes probability of error.

In spite of many serious mechanical perception of microscopic fields with a reliability that would inspire routine application still eludes us. Many facets of the problem appear to be well within the grasp of presentday technology. Thus, available histochemical techniques make it possible to prepare biological materials so that morphological integrity is preserved, key constituents are stained stoichiometrically, and the specimens are favorably dispersed for effective imaging one by one. Scanning microscopes now have the requisite sensitivity, resolution, and stability to sample such objects and make photometric measurements over a wide range of magnifications and wavelengths within the visible and near-visible spectrum. Furthermore, modern large capacity, high speed data facilities at last provide the ability to manipulate the hitherto unmanageable quantities of optical information contained within all but the simplest images. With the basic materials for achieving automation via mensuration finally a t hand, attention has been turned toward generating and evaluating methods for extracting meaning from quantitative optical information. Definitive concepts for image structuring and image characterization have yet to be realized, to be given satisfactory operational definitions, and to be assembled within a machine-oriented perceptual framework.6 Criteria for effective and efficient discrimination and interpretation of images must be evolved. It would be a serious mistake to presuppose that mechanical perception must mimic the human\u2019s perceptual apparatus in organizing images as complexes of picture eIements. Likewise i t would be serious to ignore traditional descriptive morphology and established taxonomies. In steering a middle course, the exploration of many complementary approaches and the introduction of numeric methods which fully utilize measurements of light intensity of optical density seemed to us to hold the most promise for augmenting and explicating the existing, largely verbal tradition of microscopic morphology. To realize these objectives, we have designed a system with three basic components: 1) a sensor which rigorously and effectively scans microscopic fields and converts the optical information into digital form; 2) human analysts who contribute heuristics, devise image processing methods and en-"

It was also used to present the ideas of big data to both the broad computer community and a bigger technical community. The response to the special issue, noted Michael, \u201chas really gone far beyond our wildest expectations.\u201d Of course, one of the reasons that this article has been so widely circulated has been the fact that it was part of a well-researched and well-written special issue. \u201cWe had a very long list of people who we wanted to approach,\u201d Michael explained. \u201cPeople from academia of course, but also people working with industry, people from big corporations, and even government.\u201d The five other articles are a good representation of these institutions, and they, too, have become highly visible in their own right. All of them are in the list of top articles downloaded from IEEE Xplore. Yet, perhaps the most convincing reason that \u201cBig Data: New Opportunities and New Challenges\u201d has become an important article is the language of the text itself. At a distance of seven years, it describes the opportunities of this technology as well as its challenges in sentences that are direct and clear and reflect the nature of big data as we now understand it. \u201cWhile big data can yield extremely useful information,\u201d the article explains, \u201cit also presents new challenges with respect to how much data to store, how much this will cost, whether the data will be secure, and how long it must be maintained.\u201d If you are seeking to write an influential article for Computer, you will need this third step as well as the other two. After you have identified a newly important topic for a special issue and found good authors to complete your special issue, you will do well to express your ideas in a clear, open form that will be quoted by current researchers as well as those who are attempting to understand the new technologies."

A similar rule of connectivity with hue replacing brightness was obtained by using varicolored dots of equal subjective brightness.
