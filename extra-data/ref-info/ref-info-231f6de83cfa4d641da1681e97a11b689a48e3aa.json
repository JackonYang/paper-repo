In the past decade, there has been increasing interest in applying them to practical problems, and this thesis shows that they can be used effectively in the field of automatic speech recognition. \nA principle characteristic of dynamic Bayesian networks is that they can model an arbitrary set of variables as they evolve over time. Moreover, an arbitrary set of conditional independence assumptions can be specified, and this allows the joint distribution to be represented in a highly factored way. Factorization allows for models with relatively few parameters, and computational efficiency. Standardized inference and learning routines allow a variety of model structures to be tested without deriving new formulae, or writing new code. \nThe contribution of this thesis is to show how DBNs can be used in automatic speech recognition. This involves solving problems related to both representation and inference. Representationally, the thesis shows how to encode stochastic finite-state word models as DBNs, and how to construct DBNs that explicitly model the speech-articulators, accent, gender, speaking-rate, and other important phenomena. Technically, the thesis presents inference routines that are especially tailored to the requirements of speech recognition: efficient inference with deterministic constraints, variable-length utterances, and online inference. Finally, the thesis presents experimental results that indicate that real systems can be built, and that modeling important phenomena with DBNs results in higher recognition accuracy."

Language acquisition involves both types of mechanisms, but most theorists emphasize the relative importance of experience-independent mechanisms. The present study shows that a fundamental task of language acquisition, segmentation of words from fluent speech, can be accomplished by 8-month-old infants based solely on the statistical relationships between neighboring speech sounds. Moreover, this word segmentation was based on statistical learning from only 2 minutes of exposure, suggesting that infants have access to a powerful mechanism for the computation of statistical properties of the language input."
