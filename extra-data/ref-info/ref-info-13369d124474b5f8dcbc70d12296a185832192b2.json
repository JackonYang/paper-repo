However, practical difficulties have been reported in training recurrent neural networks to perform tasks in which the temporal contingencies present in the input/output sequences span long intervals. We show why gradient based learning algorithms face an increasingly difficult problem as the duration of the dependencies to be captured increases. These results expose a trade-off between efficient learning by gradient descent and latching on information for long periods. Based on an understanding of this problem, alternatives to standard gradient descent are considered."

It permits uphill moves under the control of a probabilistic criterion, thus tending to avoid the first local minima encountered.\nThe algorithm has been tested against the Nelder and Mead simplex method and against a version of Adaptive Random Search. The test functions were Rosenbrock valleys and multiminima functions in 2,4, and 10 dimensions.\nThe new method proved to be more reliable than the others, being always able to find the optimum, or at least a point very close to it. It is quite costly in term of function evaluations, but its cost can be predicted in advance, depending only slightly on the starting point."
