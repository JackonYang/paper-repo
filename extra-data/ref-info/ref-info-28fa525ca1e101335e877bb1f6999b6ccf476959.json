Pooling is used to achieve invariance to image transformations, more compact representations, and better robustness to noise and clutter. Several papers have shown that the details of the pooling operation can greatly influence the performance, but studies have so far been purely empirical. In this paper, we show that the reasons underlying the performance of various pooling methods are obscured by several confounding factors, such as the link between the sample cardinality in a spatial pool and the resolution at which low-level features have been extracted. We provide a detailed theoretical analysis of max pooling and average pooling, and give extensive empirical comparisons for object recognition tasks."

But pooling is not local in the feature vector space, so that widely dissimilar features may be pooled together if they are in nearby locations. Recent approaches rely on sophisticated encoding methods and more specialized codebooks (or dictionaries), e.g., learned on subsets of descriptors which are close in feature space, to circumvent this problem. In this work, we argue that a common trait found in much recent work in image recognition or retrieval is that it leverages locality in feature space on top of purely spatial locality. We propose to apply this idea in its simplest form to an object recognition system based on the spatial pyramid framework, to increase the performance of small dictionaries with very little added engineering. State-of-the-art results on several object recognition benchmarks show the promise of this approach."

For this purpose, we propose a novel design for region-based object detectors that integrates efficiently top-down information from scanning-windows part models and global appearance cues. Our detectors produce class-specific scores for bottom-up regions, and then aggregate the votes of multiple overlapping candidates through pixel classification. We evaluate our approach on the PASCAL segmentation challenge, and report competitive performance with respect to current leading techniques. On VOC2010, our method obtains the best results in 6/20 categories and the highest performance on articulated objects."

We differ from existing approaches not only in our seemingly unreasonable assumption that good object-level segments can be obtained in a feed-forward fashion, but also in formulating recognition as a regression problem. Instead of focusing on a one-vs.-all winning margin that may not preserve the ordering of segment qualities inside the non-maximum (non-winning) set, our learning method produces a globally consistent ranking with close ties to segment quality, hence to the extent entire object or part hypotheses are likely to spatially overlap the ground truth. We demonstrate results beyond the current state of the art for image classification, object detection and semantic segmentation, in a number of challenging datasets including Caltech-101, ETHZ-Shape as well as PASCAL VOC 2009 and 2010."

                "text": "Hierarchical conditional random fields have been successfully applied to object segmentation. One reason is their ability to incorporate contextual information at different scales. However, these models do not allow multiple labels to be assigned to a single node. At higher scales in the image, this yields an oversimplified model, since multiple classes can be reasonable expected to appear within one region. This simplified model especially limits the impact that observations at larger scales may have on the CRF model. Neglecting the information at larger scales is undesirable since class-label estimates based on these scales are more reliable than at smaller, noisier scales. To address this problem, we propose a new potential, called harmony potential, which can encode any possible combination of class labels. We propose an effective sampling strategy that renders tractable the underlying optimization problem. Results show that our approach obtains state-of-the-art results on two challenging datasets: Pascal VOC 2009 and MSRC-21."

The next challenge is to integrate all these algorithms and address the problem of scene understanding. This paper is a step towards this goal. We present a probabilistic framework for reasoning about regions, objects, and their attributes such as object class, location, and spatial extent. Our model is a Conditional Random Field defined on pixels, segments and objects. We define a global energy function for the model, which combines results from sliding window detectors, and low-level pixel-based unary and pairwise relations. One of our primary contributions is to show that this energy function can be solved efficiently. Experimental results show that our model achieves significant improvement over the baseline methods on CamVid and PASCAL VOC datasets."

The main advantages of the method are that it is simple, computationally efficient and intrinsically invariant. We present results for simultaneously classifying seven semantic visual categories.

This technique works by partitioning the image into increasingly fine sub-regions and computing histograms of local features found inside each sub-region. The resulting \"spatial pyramid\" is a simple and computationally efficient extension of an orderless bag-of-features image representation, and it shows significantly improved performance on challenging scene categorization tasks. Specifically, our proposed method exceeds the state of the art on the Caltech-101 database and achieves high accuracy on a large database of fifteen natural scene categories. The spatial pyramid framework also offers insights into the success of several recently proposed image descriptions, including Torralba\u2019s \"gist\" and Lowe\u2019s SIFT descriptors."

After reviewing existing edge and gradient based descriptors, we show experimentally that grids of histograms of oriented gradient (HOG) descriptors significantly outperform existing feature sets for human detection. We study the influence of each stage of the computation on performance, concluding that fine-scale gradients, fine orientation binning, relatively coarse spatial binning, and high-quality local contrast normalization in overlapping descriptor blocks are all important for good results. The new approach gives near-perfect separation on the original MIT pedestrian database, so we introduce a more challenging dataset containing over 1800 annotated human images with a large range of pose variations and backgrounds."

In the context of image classification the FK was shown to extend the popular bag-of-visual-words (BOV) by going beyond count statistics. However, in practice, this enriched representation has not yet shown its superiority over the BOV. In the first part we show that with several well-motivated modifications over the original framework we can boost the accuracy of the FK. On PASCAL VOC 2007 we increase the Average Precision (AP) from 47.9% to 58.3%. Similarly, we demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy on CalTech 256. A major advantage is that these results are obtained using only SIFT descriptors and costless linear classifiers. Equipped with this representation, we can now explore image classification on a larger scale. In the second part, as an application, we compare two abundant resources of labeled images to learn classifiers: ImageNet and Flickr groups. In an evaluation involving hundreds of thousands of training images we show that classifiers learned on Flickr groups perform surprisingly well (although they were not intended for this purpose) and that they can complement classifiers learned on more carefully annotated datasets."

The object hypotheses are represented as figure-ground segmentations, and are extracted automatically, without prior knowledge of the properties of individual object classes, by solving a sequence of Constrained Parametric Min-Cut problems (CPMC) on a regular image grid. In a subsequent step, we learn to rank the corresponding segments by training a continuous model to predict how likely they are to exhibit real-world regularities (expressed as putative overlap with ground truth) based on their mid-level region properties, then diversify the estimated overlap score using maximum marginal relevance measures. We show that this algorithm significantly outperforms the state of the art for low-level segmentation in the VOC 2009 and 2010 data sets. In our companion papers [1], [2], we show that the algorithm can be used, successfully, in a segmentation-based visual object category recognition pipeline. This architecture ranked first in the VOC2009 and VOC2010 image segmentation and labeling challenges."

We show that bag-of-words representations commonly used in conjunction with linear classifiers can be viewed as special match kernels, which count 1 if two local features fall into the same regions partitioned by visual words and 0 otherwise. Despite its simplicity, this quantization is too coarse, motivating research into the design of match kernels that more accurately measure the similarity between local features. However, it is impractical to use such kernels for large datasets due to their significant computational cost. To address this problem, we propose efficient match kernels (EMK) that map local features to a low dimensional feature space and average the resulting vectors to form a set-level feature. The local feature maps are learned so their inner products preserve, to the best possible, the values of the specified kernel function. Classifiers based on EMK are linear both in the number of images and in the number of local features. We demonstrate that EMK are extremely efficient and achieve the current state of the art in three difficult computer vision datasets: Scene-15, Caltech-101 and Caltech-256."

We present a probabilistic framework for reasoning about regions, obje cts, and their attributes such as object class, location, and spatial extent. Our mode l is a Conditional Random Field defined on pixels, segments and objects. We define a g lob l energy function for the model, which combines results from sliding window detectors, and low-level pixel-based unary and pairwise relations. On e of our primary contributions is to show that this energy function can be solved efficiently.

This paper presents a simple but effective coding scheme called Locality-constrained Linear Coding (LLC) in place of the VQ coding in traditional SPM. LLC utilizes the locality constraints to project each descriptor into its local-coordinate system, and the projected coordinates are integrated by max pooling to generate the final representation. With linear classifier, the proposed approach performs remarkably better than the traditional nonlinear SPM, achieving state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks. Compared with the sparse coding strategy [22], the objective function used by LLC has an analytical solution. In addition, the paper proposes a fast approximated LLC method by first performing a K-nearest-neighbor search and then solving a constrained least square fitting problem, bearing computational complexity of O(M + K2). Hence even with very large codebooks, our system can still process multiple frames per second. This efficiency significantly adds to the practical values of LLC for real applications."

To perform localization, one can take a sliding window approach, but this strongly increases the computational cost, because the classifier function has to be evaluated over a large set of candidate subwindows. In this paper, we propose a simple yet powerful branch-and-bound scheme that allows efficient maximization of a large class of classifier functions over all possible subimages. It converges to a globally optimal solution typically in sublinear time. We show how our method is applicable to different object detection and retrieval scenarios. The achieved speedup allows the use of classifiers for localization that formerly were considered too slow for this task, such as SVMs with a spatial pyramid kernel or nearest neighbor classifiers based on the chi2-distance. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of the resulting systems on the UIUC Cars dataset, the PASCAL VOC 2006 dataset and in the PASCAL VOC 2007 competition."

The method is based on a segmentation energy defined over all images at the same time, which can be optimized efficiently by techniques used before in interactive segmentation. Over iterations, our method progressively learns a class model by integrating observations over all images. In addition to appearance, this model captures the location and shape of the class with respect to an automatically determined coordinate frame common across images. This frame allows us to build stronger shape and location models, similar to those used in object class detection. Our method is inspired by interactive segmentation methods [1], but it is fully automatic and learns models characteristic for the object class rather than specific to one particular object/image. We experimentally demonstrate on the Caltech4, Caltech101, and Weizmann horses datasets that our method (a) transfers class knowledge across images and this improves results compared to segmenting every image independently; (b) outperforms Grabcut [1] for the task of unsupervised segmentation; (c) offers competitive performance compared to the state-of-the-art in unsupervised segmentation and in particular it outperforms the topic model [2]."

The process of drawing samples from the joint distribution can be interpreted as first sampling tilings, modeled as maximal cliques, from a graph connecting spatially non-overlapping segments in the bag [1], followed by sampling labels for those segments, conditioned on the choice of a particular tiling. We learn the segmentation and labeling parameters jointly, based on Maximum Likelihood with a novel Incremental Saddle Point estimation procedure. The partition function over tilings and labelings is increasingly more accurately approximated by including incorrect configurations that a not-yet-competent model rates probable during learning. We show that the proposed methodology matches the current state of the art in the Stanford dataset [2], as well as in VOC2010, where 41.7% accuracy on the test set is achieved."

This work is distinguished by three key contributions. The first is the introduction of a new image representation called the \"integral image\" which allows the features used by our detector to be computed very quickly. The second is a learning algorithm, based on AdaBoost, which selects a small number of critical visual features from a larger set and yields extremely efficient classifiers. The third contribution is a method for combining increasingly more complex classifiers in a \"cascade\" which allows background regions of the image to be quickly discarded while spending more computation on promising object-like regions. The cascade can be viewed as an object specific focus-of-attention mechanism which unlike previous approaches provides statistical guarantees that discarded regions are unlikely to contain the object of interest. In the domain of face detection the system yields detection rates comparable to the best previous systems. Used in real-time applications, the detector runs at 15 frames per second without resorting to image differencing or skin color detection."

Kernel-based classification methods can learn complex decision boundaries, but a kernel over unordered set inputs must somehow solve for correspondences epsivnerally a computationally expensive task that becomes impractical for large set sizes. We present a new fast kernel function which maps unordered feature sets to multi-resolution histograms and computes a weighted histogram intersection in this space. This \"pyramid match\" computation is linear in the number of features, and it implicitly finds correspondences based on the finest resolution histogram cell where a matched pair first appears. Since the kernel does not penalize the presence of extra features, it is robust to clutter. We show the kernel function is positive-definite, making it valid for use in learning algorithms whose optimal solutions are guaranteed only for Mercer kernels. We demonstrate our algorithm on object recognition tasks and show it to be accurate and dramatically faster than current approaches"

Given a set of images known to contain the target category from a similar viewpoint, learning is translation and scale-invariant; does not require alignment or correspondence between the training images, and is robust to clutter and occlusion. Category models are probabilistic constellations of parts, and their parameters are estimated by maximizing the likelihood of the training data. The appearance of the parts, as well as their mutual position, relative scale and probability of detection are explicitly described in the model. Recognition takes place in two stages. First, a feature-finder identifies promising locations for the model\u201ds parts. Second, the category model is used to compare the likelihood that the observed features are generated by the category model, or are generated by background clutter. The flexible nature of the model is demonstrated by results over six diverse object categories including geometrically constrained categories (e.g. faces, cars) and flexible objects (such as animals)."

The solution of the correspondence problem is traditionally approached with exact or approximate techniques. In this paper we are interested in methods that solve the correspondence problem via the definition of a kernel function that makes it possible to use local features as input to a support vector machine. We single out the match kernel, an exact approach, and the pyramid match kernel, that uses instead an approximate strategy. We present a thorough experimental evaluation of the two methods on three different databases. Results show that the exact method performs consistently better than the approximate one, especially for the object identification task, when training on a decreasing number of images. Based on this findings and on the computational cost of each approach, we suggest some criteria for choosing between the two kernels given the application at hand."

The method is based on recognizing that certain local binary patterns, termed \"uniform,\" are fundamental properties of local image texture and their occurrence histogram is proven to be a very powerful texture feature. We derive a generalized gray-scale and rotation invariant operator presentation that allows for detecting the \"uniform\" patterns for any quantization of the angular space and for any spatial resolution and presents a method for combining multiple operators for multiresolution analysis. The proposed approach is very robust in terms of gray-scale variations since the operator is, by definition, invariant against any monotonic transformation of the gray scale. Another advantage is computational simplicity as the operator can be realized with a few operations in a small neighborhood and a lookup table. Experimental results demonstrate that good discrimination can be achieved with the occurrence statistics of simple rotation invariant local binary patterns."

Our system is able to represent highly variable object classes and achieves state-of-the-art results in the PASCAL object detection challenges. While deformable part models have become quite popular, their value had not been demonstrated on difficult benchmarks such as the PASCAL data sets. Our system relies on new methods for discriminative training with partially labeled data. We combine a margin-sensitive approach for data-mining hard negative examples with a formalism we call latent SVM. A latent SVM is a reformulation of MI--SVM in terms of latent variables. A latent SVM is semiconvex, and the training problem becomes convex once latent information is specified for the positive examples. This leads to an iterative training algorithm that alternates between fixing latent values for positive examples and optimizing the latent SVM objective function."

We derive a generalized presentation that allows for realizing a gray scale and rotation invariant LBP operator for any quantization of the angular space and for any spatial resolution, and present a method for combining multiple operators for multiresolution analysis. The proposed approach is very robust in terms of gray scale variations, since the operator is by definition invariant against any monotonic transformation of the gray scale. Another advantage is computational simplicity, as the operator can be realized with a few operations in a small neighborhood and a lookup table. Excellent experimental results obtained in a true problem of rotation invariance, where the classifier is trained at one particular rotation angle and tested with samples from other rotation angles, demonstrate that good discrimination can be achieved with the occurrence statistics of simple rotation invariant local binary patterns. These operators characterize the spatial configuration of local image texture and the performance can be further improved by combining them with rotation invariant variance measures that characterize the contrast of local image texture. The joint distributions of these orthogonal measures are shown to be very powerful tools for rotation invariant texture analysis."

The underlying image model is a graph whose nodes correspond to a dense set of regions, and edges reflect the underlying grid structure of the image and act as springs to guarantee the geometric consistency of nearby regions during matching. A fast approximate algorithm for matching the graphs associated with two images is presented. This algorithm is used to construct a kernel appropriate for SVM-based image classification, and experiments with the Caltech 101, Caltech 256, and Scenes datasets demonstrate performance that matches or exceeds the state of the art for methods using a single type of features."

Many unsupervised methods are based on reconstructing the input from the representation, while constraining the representation to have certain desirable properties (e.g. low dimension, sparsity, etc). Others are based on approximating density by stochastically reconstructing the input from the representation. We describe a novel and efficient algorithm to learn sparse representations, and compare it theoretically and experimentally with a similar machine trained probabilistically, namely a Restricted Boltzmann Machine. We propose a simple criterion to compare and select different unsupervised machines based on the trade-off between the reconstruction error and the information content of the representation. We demonstrate this method by extracting features from a dataset of handwritten numerals, and from a dataset of natural image patches. We show that by stacking multiple levels of such machines and by training sequentially, high-order dependencies between the input observed variables can be captured."

However, the large performance gap between these two families of approaches rendered NN-based image classifiers useless. We claim that the effectiveness of non-parametric NN-based image classification has been considerably undervalued. We argue that two practices commonly used in image classification methods, have led to the inferior performance of NN-based image classifiers: (i) Quantization of local image descriptors (used to generate \"bags-of-words \", codebooks). (ii) Computation of 'image-to-image' distance, instead of 'image-to-class' distance. We propose a trivial NN-based classifier - NBNN, (Naive-Bayes nearest-neighbor), which employs NN- distances in the space of the local image descriptors (and not in the space of images). NBNN computes direct 'image- to-class' distances without descriptor quantization. We further show that under the Naive-Bayes assumption, the theoretically optimal image classifier can be accurately approximated by NBNN. Although NBNN is extremely simple, efficient, and requires no learning/training phase, its performance ranks among the top leading learning-based image classifiers. Empirical comparisons are shown on several challenging databases (Caltech-101 ,Caltech-256 and Graz-01)."

Since these descriptors do not lie on a vector space, well known machine learning techniques are not adequate to learn the classifiers. The space of d-dimensional nonsingular covariance matrices can be represented as a connected Riemannian manifold. We present a novel approach for classifying points lying on a Riemannian manifold by incorporating the a priori information about the geometry of the space. The algorithm is tested on INRIA human database where superior detection rates are observed over the previous approaches."

These applications involve a large number of examples n as well as a large number of features N, while each example has only s << N non-zero features. This paper presents a Cutting Plane Algorithm for training linear SVMs that provably has training time 0(s,n) for classification problems and o(sn log (n))for ordinal regression problems. The algorithm is based on an alternative, but equivalent formulation of the SVM optimization problem. Empirically, the Cutting-Plane Algorithm is several orders of magnitude faster than decomposition methods like svm light for large datasets."

The main contribution of the paper is a novel approach for classifying points lying on a connected Riemannian manifold using the geometry of the space.

Many researchers have used this tool to examine the geophysical and climatological phenomena. Perhaps more frequent use of EOFs in recent studies is in conjunction with the development of the signal detection and estimation methods of the background uctuations of a detection variable serve as an orthogonal basis set and are used to design optimal techniques for detecting and estimating signals. A detection and prediction approach is to design a lter or optimal weights for the signal to be detected. It has been reported that weighted averaging of data over the surface of the Earth improved the detectability of climatic changes (Hasselmann 1979; Stefanick 1981; Bell 1982). Since the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) varies geographically, there exists an optimal geographical weighting of the signal which maximizes the SNR. The design of an optimal weighting function may require detailed knowledge on the natural uctuation of the climate system. A conceptually similar approach is to employ a particular pattern (or patterns) of climatic change for detection and prediction (e.g., Barnett and Hasselmann 1979; Hasselmann 1979). The patterns of interest (also called the predictors) may include the principal components (empirical orthogonal functions) (e. von Storch 1990) among others. This approach also requires complete knowledge of the natural variability of the climate system. To test and improve the detection and prediction techniques addressed above, a complete cross-spectral covariance matrix, or similarly, a complete set of the principal components of natural uctuations of the climate system for each frequency band of the spectrum is necessary. In reality, a reliable spectrum of observational covariance matrix is not available because observations are not suuciently long and sampling errors contaminate the observational records (Preisendorfer and Barnett 1977; North et al. 1982). Further, inadequate spatial coverage of observations may introduce bias. Therefore, the covariance matrix of the noise response is often estimated from a simple stochastic model. Kim and North (1991, 1992) examined the covariance matrix in terms of various second-moment statistics earlier. Examined here are the principal components of the covariance matrix of the surface temperature uctuations in a simple coupled climate model in comparison with observations. The principal components not only are an"

It employs a Schur decomposition with reordering and blocking followed by the block form of a recurrence of Parlett, with functions of the nontrivial diagonal blocks evaluated via a Taylor series. A parameter is used to balance the conflicting requirements of producing small diagonal blocks and keeping the separations of the blocks large. The algorithm is intended primarily for functions having a Taylor series with an infinite radius of convergence, but it can be adapted for certain other functions, such as the logarithm. Novel features introduced here include a convergence test that avoids premature termination of the Taylor series evaluation and an algorithm for reordering and blocking the Schur form. Numerical experiments show that the algorithm is competitive with existing special-purpose algorithms for the matrix exponential, logarithm, and cosine. Nevertheless, the algorithm can be numerically unstable with the default choice of its blocking parameter (or in certain cases for all choices), and we explain why determining the optimal parameter appears to be a very difficult problem. A MATLAB implementation is available that is much more reliable than the function funm in MATLAB 6.5 (R13)."

These matrices play the same role in noncommutative analysis as positive real numbers do in classical analysis. They have theoretical and computational uses across a broad spectrum of disciplines, including calculus, electrical engineering, statistics, physics, numerical analysis, quantum information theory, and geometry. Through detailed explanations and an authoritative and inspiring writing style, Rajendra Bhatia carefully develops general techniques that have wide applications in the study of such matrices. Bhatia introduces several key topics in functional analysis, operator theory, harmonic analysis, and differential geometry--all built around the central theme of positive definite matrices. He discusses positive and completely positive linear maps, and presents major theorems with simple and direct proofs. He examines matrix means and their applications, and shows how to use positive definite functions to derive operator inequalities that he and others proved in recent years. He guides the reader through the differential geometry of the manifold of positive definite matrices, and explains recent work on the geometric mean of several matrices. Positive Definite Matrices is an informative and useful reference book for mathematicians and other researchers and practitioners. The numerous exercises and notes at the end of each chapter also make it the ideal textbook for graduate-level courses."
