The authors present a new approach to word recognition that uses a lexicon to \"drive\" the recognition process. Lexicon words are encoded in trie data structures, and recognition of a word image is done by searching a lexicon trie for a path whose node characters yield the best match to the word image. This approach has two important advantages. First, it is segmentation-free; there is no need to presegment the text image into isolated characters. Second, it performs recognition by verifying character hypotheses, as opposed to the classification method used in most conventional optical character recognition (OCR) systems. Hence, the recognition process is more efficient and the results are more accurate. They demonstrated the feasibility and the advantage of this approach with a lexicon size of more than 50000 words, on severely degraded images."

The result of performance evaluation using large handwritten address block database is described, and algorithm improvements are described and discussed, in order to achieve higher recognition accuracy and speed. As a result the performance for lexicons of size 10, 100, and 1000 are improved to 98.01%, 95.46%, and 91.49% respectively.

The fundamental paradigm employed is a character-based segment-then-recognize/match strategy. An additional user supplied contextual information in the form of a lexicon guides a graph search to estimate the most likely word image identity. This system is designed to operate robustly in the presence of document noise, poor handwriting, and lexicon errors. A pre-processing step is initially applied to the image to remove noise artifacts and normalize the handwriting. An oversegmentation approach is used to improve the likelihood of capturing the individual characters embedded in the word. A directed graph is constructed that contains many possible interpretations of the word image, many implausible. The most likely graph path and associated confidence is computed for each lexicon word to produce a final lexicon ranking. Experiments highlighting the characteristics of this algorithm are given."

We formulate the address recognition method as a minimum cost search problem. We define the character recognition cost which estimates the reliability of the character recognition result, the arrangement cost which estimates the plausibility of the character string's spatial arrangement, and the word knowledge cost which estimates the plausibility of the linguistic conditions. By using a combination of these costs, the proposed method can recognize an address which has not been extracted as a single line from input images by a conventional method. The efficiency of the proposed method is evaluated through an experiment using 600 Japanese mail images. An address recognition rate of 79.38% was obtained."

Dynamic matching between characters of a lexicon entry and segment(s) of the input word image is used to rank the lexicon entries in order of best match. Variable duration for each character is defined and used during the matching. Experimental results prove that our approach using the variable duration outperforms the method using fixed duration in terms of both accuracy and speed. Speed of the entire recognition process is about 200 msec on a single SPARC-10 platform and the recognition accuracy is 96.8 percent are achieved for lexicon size of 10, on a database of postal words captured at 212 dpi."

In this method, a character string is recognized by searching for a sequence of segmented patterns that fits a string in a lexicon. A remarkable characteristic of this method is that character segmentation and character classification work as subfunctions of the search. The lexical search approach enables the parameters of character classifier to adapt to each segmented pattern. As a result, it improves the recognition accuracy by omitting useless candidates of character classification and by changing the criterion of rejection dynamically. Moreover, the processing time is drastically reduced by using minimum sets of categories for each segmented pattern. The validity of the developed method is shown by the experimental results using a lexicon including 44,700 character strings."

To segment Japanese handwriting accurately, it is necessary to use character recognition results and contexts. However, recognition results might be wrong, or recognition confidence scores might be inaccurate. Dictionary consulting is not sufficient to deal with such ambiguous character recognition results. The paper reports on a method which hierarchically uses transitional information and a word dictionary for recognition results for all possible characters. Experimental results show that, for character line samples written roughly, 91.7% recognition rate is achieved while the recognition rate for a method without transitional information is 78.3%.<<ETX>>"

The higher recognition rates for isolated characters vs. those obtained for words and connected character strings well illustrate this fact. A good part of recent progress in reading unconstrained printed and written text may be ascribed to more insightful handling of segmentation. This paper provides a review of these advances. The aim is to provide an appreciation for the range of techniques that have been developed, rather than to simply list sources. Segmentation methods are listed under four main headings. What may be termed the \"classical\" approach consists of methods that partition the input image into subimages, which are then classified. The operation of attempting to decompose the image into classifiable units is called \"dissection.\" The second class of methods avoids dissection, and segments the image either explicitly, by classification of prespecified windows, or implicitly by classification of subsets of spatial features collected from the image as a whole. The third strategy is a hybrid of the first two, employing dissection together with recombination rules to define potential segments, but using classification to select from the range of admissible segmentation possibilities offered by these subimages. Finally, holistic approaches that avoid segmentation by recognizing entire character strings as units are described."

This approach is based on a split-and-merge strategy by locating possible ligatures between Chinese characters and merging the over-split components. The strategy is proposed by considering the structural properties of Chinese character strings. To guarantee the accuracy of the above segmentation algorithm, a recognizer is involved in order to aid the segmentation process. A maximum a posteriori probability index is derived for joint optimization of the segmentation and recognition results, and a dynamic programming algorithm-a modified level-building algorithm-is used to optimize this index. The whole algorithm is applied to a Chinese bank check amount recognition task, and some promising experimental results are obtained."

Stroke shapes are analyzed and a method of finding the touching positions that separates about 95% of connected numerals correctly is described. Ambiguities are handled by multiple hypotheses and verification by recognition. An extended form of pattern-oriented segmentation, tabular form recognition, is considered. Images of tabular forms are analyzed, and frames in the tabular structure are extracted. By identifying semantic relationships between label frames and data frames, information on the form can be properly recognized. >"

The touching characters are segmented by cutting the connected components in a pre-segmentation process. The proposed segmentation method consists of the following steps: (1) identification of the touching components by checking the size of candidate character patterns; (2) estimation of the breakpoint and cutting of the components; and (3) generation of candidate character patterns by merging the components with adjacent patterns. The proposed method has the feature that the touching components can be identified even if they are comprised of relatively small patterns. The touching components are cut by using stroke width analysis and projection image analysis. This cut-and-merge procedure was able to segment 134 (88.2%) address lines correctly out of 152 Japanese address lines having touching portions, and could generate correct candidate character patterns."

The paper describes an integrated real time system to read names and addresses on tax forms of the Internal Revenue Service of the United States. The Name and Address Block Reader (NABR) system accepts both machine printed and hand printed address block images as input. The application software has two major steps: document analysis (connected component analysis, address block extraction, label detection, hand print/machine print discrimination); and document recognition. Document recognition has two non identical streams for machine print and hand print; key steps are: address parsing, character recognition, word recognition and postal database lookup (ZIP+4 and City-State-ZIP files). Real time throughput (8,500 forms per hour) is achieved by employing a loosely coupled multiprocessing architecture. The functional architecture, software design, system architecture and hardware implementation are described. Performance evaluation on machine printed and handwritten addresses are presented."

Several component processes of a recognition system for isolated offline cursive script words are described. A word image is transformed through a hierarchy of representation levels: points, contours, features, letters, and words. A unique feature representation is generated bottom-up from the image using statistical dependences between letters and features. Ratings for partially formed words are computed using a stack algorithm and a lexicon represented as a trie. Several novel techniques for low- and intermediate-level processing for cursive script are described, including heuristics for reference line finding, letter segmentation based on detecting local minima along the lower contour and areas with low vertical profiles, simultaneous encoding of contours and their topological relationships, extracting features, and finding shape-oriented events. Experiments demonstrating the performance of the system are also described. >"

In this algorithm, a word image is represented by a segmentation graph, and the lexicon is represented by a trie. As opposed to the standard lexicon-driven matching approach, where dynamic programming is invoked independently for matching each entry in the lexicon against the segmentation graph, the proposed algorithm matches the trie with the segmentation graph. Computation is saved by the efficient representation of the lexicon using the trie data structure. The performance of the proposed approach is compared with the standard dynamic programming algorithm. The proposed approach saves about 48.4% (excluding the trie initialization cost) and 15% of computation time from the standard algorithm when a dynamic lexicon is used. Better performance can be expected in static lexicon cases where the trie needs to be constructed only once."

Using dictionaries of this size requires fast search techniques to achieve reasonable recognition times. In this paper we present a search approach yielding recognition times, which are virtually independent of the dictionary size. This approach combines a tree representation of the dictionary with e cent pruning techniques to reduce the search space without loosing much recognition performance compared to a at exhaustive search through all words in the dictionary. The tree search with pruning is about 15 times faster than a at search and allows us to run the NPen++ on-line handwriting recognition system in real-time with dictionary sizes up to 100,000 words."

It is effective especially in character recognition with the over-segmentation process. The method is based on the credibility measurement of each presegmented pattern for being a true character by analyzing peripheral features such as gaps between patterns and widths and heights of patterns. A heuristic statistical method is applied to the analysis. Experimental results show that the developed method increases the accuracy of character segmentation. It is effective especially when no linguistic feedback to segmentation is available and/or the character classifier ability is not high enough. In such cases, the recognition accuracy is increased from 30% to 70% by the new segmentation method."

The algorithm, which has all the features of earlier methods, is inherently based on hidden Markov model (HMM) representations and is described in an easily understood, easily programmable manner. The new features of the algorithm include the capability of recording and determining (unique) word sequences corresponding to the several best paths to each grammar node, and the capability of efficiently incorporating a range of word and state duration scoring techniques directly into the forward search of the algorithm, thereby eliminating the need for a postprocessor as in previous implementations. It is also simple and straightforward to incorporate deterministic word transition rules and statistical constraints (probabilities) from a language model into the forward search of the algorithm. >"

In preprocessing stage, a connectivity-preserving smoothing algorithm is proposed which is executed after normalization. Afterwards, multiresolution statistical features are extracted from stroke contour by directional decomposition and multiscale filtering. Meanwhile, structural features are represented by horizontal crossing counts and horizontal distances between boundary profiles and corresponding convex hulls. The extracted features not only have powerful discriminating ability, but also are less sensitive to shape variation. The extracted features are inputted into a multilayer neural network for training and classification. The efficiency of the proposed method has been demonstrated in recognition experiments on constrained and unconstrained handwritten numerals. The recognition rate on CENPARMI data is as high as 98.00%."

The separating path is assumed to pass between some pair of these significant contour points (SCPs). Nine features of the SCPs are measured and are used to sort the list of all possible pairings of SCPs.

The proposed method is applicable to a wide variety of distance metrics and experiments on Euclidean distance and city block distance have achieved promising results. By confidence evaluation, the distribution of distances is analyzed to derive the probabilities of classes in two steps: output probability evaluation and input probability inference. Using the input probabilities as confidences, several selection rules have been tested and the rule that selects the classes with high confidence ratio to the first rank class produced best results. The experiments were implemented on the ETL9B database and the results show that the proposed method selects about one-fourth as many candidates with accuracy preserved compared to the conventional method that selects a fixed number of candidates."

The main advantages of trie memory over the other memoIw plans just mentioned are shorter access time, greater ease of addition or up-dating, greater convenience in handling arguments of diverse lengths, and the ability to take advantage of redundancies in the information stored. The main disadvantage is relative inefficiency in using storage space, but this inefficiency is not great when the store is large. In this paper several paradigms of trie memory are described and compared with other memory paradigms, their advantages and disadvantages are examined in detail, and applications are discussed. Many essential features of trie memory were mentioned by de la Briandais [1] in a paper presented to the Western Joint Computer Conference in 1959. The present development is essentially independent of his, having been described in memorandum form in January 1959 [2], and it is fuller in that it considers additional paradigms (finitedimensional trie memories) and includes experimental results bearing on the efficiency of utilization of storage space."

Their generalization makes it possible to treat dynamic patterns (of a variable duration or dimension) such as speech as well as static patterns (of a fixed duration or dimension), for pattern classification problems. The key ideas of GPD formulations include the embedding of time normalization and the incorporation of smooth classification error functions into the gradient search optimization objectives. As a result, a family of new discriminative training algorithms can be rigorously formulated for various kinds of classifier frameworks, including the popular dynamic time warping (DTW) and hidden Markov model (HMM). Experimental results are also provided to show the superiority of this new family of GPD-based, adaptive training algorithms for speech recognition.<<ETX>>"

In dealing with a human being and a human society, we enjoy the luxury of being irrational, illogical, inconsistent, and incomplete, and yet of coping. In operating a computer, we must meet the rigorous requirements for detailed instructions and absolute precision. If we understood the ability of the human mind to make effective decisions when confronted by complexity, uncertainty, and irrationality then we could use computers a million times more effectively than we do. Recognition of this fact has been a motivation for the spurt of research in the field of neurophysiology. The more we study the information processing aspects of the mind, the more perplexed and impressed we become. It will be a very long time before we understand these processes sufficiently to reproduce them. In any case, the mathematician sees hundreds and thousands of formidable new problems in dozens of blossoming areas, puzzles galore, and challenges to his heart's content. He may never resolve some of these, but he will never be bored. What more can he ask?"
