For example, the statement \"The number two is blue\" may be syntactically well formed, but at some level it is anomalous-- scBLUE is not a predicate that can be applied to numbers. \nIn this dissertation, I propose a new, information-theoretic account of selectional constraints. Unlike previous approaches, this proposal requires neither the identification of primitive semantic features nor the formalization of complex inferences based on world knowledge. The proposed model assumes instead that lexical items are organized in a conceptual taxonomy according to class membership, where classes are defined simply as sets--that is, extensionally, rather than in terms of explicit features or properties. Selection is formalized in terms of a probabilistic relationship between predicates and concepts: the selectional behavior of a predicate is modeled as its distributional effect on the conceptual classes of its arguments, expressed using the information-theoretic measure of relative entropy. The use of relative entropy leads to an illuminating interpretation of what selectional constraints are: the strength of a predicate's selection for an argument is identified with the quantity of information it carries about that argument. \nIn addition to arguing that the model is empirically adequate, I explore its application to two problems. The first concerns a linguistic question: why some transitive verbs permit implicit direct objects (\"John ate $\\emptyset$\") and others do not (\"*John brought $\\emptyset$\"). It has often been observed informally that the omission of objects is connected to the ease with which the object can be inferred. I have made this observation more formal by positing a relationship between inferability and selectional constraints, and have confirmed the connection between selectional constraints and implicit objects in a set of computational experiments. \nSecond, I have explored the practical applications of the model in resolving syntactic ambiguity. A number of authors have recently begun investigating the use of corpus-based lexical statistics in automatic parsing; the results of computational experiments using the present model suggest that often lexical relationships are better viewed in terms of underlying conceptual relationships such as selectional preference and concept similarity. Thus the information-theoretic measures proposed here can serve not only as components in a theory of selectional constraints, but also as tools for practical natural language processing."

However, little quantitative information is available about the extent of the problem or about the impact that it has on information retrieval systems. We report on an analysis of lexical ambiguity in information retrieval test collections and on experiments to determine the utility of word meanings for separating relevant from nonrelevant documents. The experiments show that there is considerable ambiguity even in a specialized database. Word senses provide a significant separation between relevant and nonrelevant documents, but several factors contribute to determining whether disambiguation will make an improvement in performance. For example, resolving lexical ambiguity was found to have little impact on retrieval effectiveness for documents that have many words in common with the query. Other uses of word sense disambiguation in an information retrieval context are discussed."

Notice that if a user of WEDT had simply gone directly to the WordNet server to look up pole, the full list of 10 senses would have appeared with no indication of which are most potentially related to the WEDT dictionary entry under consideration. In contrast, the WEDT hyperlinks, introduced via the sense selection algorithm, lter out the majority of the irrelevant senses and provide the user a measure of con dence in selecting among those that remain. Although no formal evaluation of the WEDT/WordNet connection has been attempted, the results of the bilingual dictionary experiment suggest that this application of word sense disambiguation | ltering out the least relevant senses, and then leaving the user in the loop | is a task for which the sense disambiguation algorithm is well suited. This is supported by user feedback on the XWN feature of WEDT, which has been favorable (Robert Parks, personal communication). The site has been growing in popularity, with a current estimate of 1000-1500 hits per day. 6. Related Work There is an extensive literature on measuring similarity in general, and on word similarity in particular; for a classic paper see Tversky (1977). Recent work in information retrieval and computational linguistics has emphasized a distributional approach, in which words are represented as vectors in a space of features and similarity measures are de ned in terms of those vectors; see Resnik (1998b) for discussion, and Lee (1997) for a good recent example."

Though they provide good retrieval effectiveness in many cases, they do not support effective weighting schemes for queries and documents and also have several problems resulting from inappropriate evaluation of Boolean operators. We propose a new method called Knowledge\u2010Based Extended Boolean Model (kb\u2010ebm) in which Salton's extended Boolean model is incorporated. kb\u2010ebm evaluates weighted queries and documents effectively, and avoids the problems of the previous methods. kb\u2010ebm provides high quality document rankings by using term dependence information from is\u2010a hierarchies The performance experiments show that the proposed method closely simulates human behaviour."

                "text": "Statistical methods for automatically extracting information about associations between words or documents from large collections of text have the potential to have considerable impact in a number of areas, such as information retrieval and natural-language-based user interfaces. However, even huge bodies of text yield highly unreliable estimates of the probability of relatively common events, and, in fact, perfectly reasonable events may not occur in the training data at all. This is known as the sparse data problem. Traditional approaches to the sparse data problem use crude approximations. We propose a different solution: if we are able to organize the data into classes of similar events, then, if information about an event is lacking, we can estimate its behavior from information about similar events. This thesis presents two such similarity-based approaches, where, in general, we measure similarity by the Kullback-Leibler divergence, an information-theoretic quantity. \nOur first approach is to build soft, hierarchical clusters: soft, because each event belongs to each cluster with some probability; hierarchical, because cluster centroids are iteratively split to model finer distinctions. Our clustering method, which uses the technique of deterministic annealing, represents (to our knowledge) the first application of soft clustering to problems in natural language processing. We use this method to cluster words drawn from 44 million words of Associated Press Newswire and 10 million words from Grolier's encyclopedia, and find that language models built from the clusters have substantial predictive power. Our algorithm also extends with no modification to other domains, such as document clustering. \nOur second approach is a nearest-neighbor approach: instead of calculating a centroid for each class, we in essence build a cluster around each word. We compare several such nearest-neighbor approaches on a word sense disambiguation task and find that as a whole, their performance is far superior to that of standard methods. In another set of experiments, we show that using estimation techniques based on the nearest-neighbor model enables us to achieve perplexity reductions of more than 20 percent over standard techniques in the prediction of low-frequency events, and statistically significant speech recognition error-rate reduction."

Distance is the average minimum path length over all pairwise combinations of nodes between two subsets of nodes. Distance can be successfully used to assess the conceptual distance between sets of concepts when used on a semantic net of hierarchical relations. When other kinds of relationships, like 'cause', are used, distance must be amended but then can again be effective. The judgements of distance significantly correlate with the distance judgements that people make and help to determine whether one semantic net is better or worse than another. The authors focus on the mathematical characteristics of distance that presents novel cases and interpretations. Experiments in which distance is applied to pairs of concepts and to sets of concepts in a hierarchical knowledge base show the power of hierarchical relations in representing information about the conceptual distance between concepts. >"

For similarity to be a useful construct, one must be able to specify the ways or respects in which two things are similar. One solution to this problem is to restrict the notion of similarity to hard-wired perceptual processes. It is argued that this view is too narrow and limiting. Instead, it is proposed that an important source of constraints derives from the similarity comparison process itself. Both new experiments and other evidence are described that support the idea that respects are determined by processes internal to comparisons"

Knowing word relatedness allows a system given a user's query terms to retrieve relevant documents not containing those exact terms. Two words can be said to be related if they appear in the same contexts Document co-occurrence gives a measure of word relatedness that has proved to be too rough to be useful. The relatively recent apparition of on-line dictionaries and robust and rapid parsers permits the extraction of finer word contexts from large corpora. In this paper, we will describe such an extraction technique that uses only coarse syntactic analysis and no domain knowledge. This technique produces lists of words related to any work appearing in a corpus. When the closest related terms were used in query expansion of a standard information retrieval testbed, the results were much better than that given by document co-occurence techniques, and slightly better than using unexpanded queries, supporting the contention that semantically similar words were indeed extracted by this technique."

The result of the indexing procedure is a vector in which some of the terms represent word senses instead of word stems. Retrieval experiments comparing the effectivenss of these sense-based vectors vs. stem-based vectors show the stem-based vectors to be superior overall, although the sense-based vectors do improve the performance of some queries. The overall degradation is due in large part to the difficulty of disambiguating senses in short query statements. An analysis of these results suggests two conclusions: the IS-A links define a generalization/specialization hierarchy that is not sufficient to reliably select the correct sense of a noun from the set of fine sense distinctions in WordNet; and missing correct matches because of incorrect sense resolution has a much more deleterious effect on retrieval performance than does making spurious matches."

Experiments performed on small collections with single-domain thesauri suggest that expanding query vectors with words that are lexically related to the original query words can ameliorate some of the problems of mismatched vocabularies. This paper examines the utility of lexical query expansion in the large, diverse TREC collection. Concepts are represented by WordNet synonym sets and are expanded by following the typed links included in WordNet. Experimental results show this query expansion technique makes little difference in retrieval effectiveness if the original queries are relatively complete descriptions of the information being sought even when the concepts to be expanded are selected by hand. Less well developed queries can be significantly improved by expansion of hand-chosen concepts. However, an automatic procedure that can approximate the set of hand picked synonym sets has yet to be devised, and expanding by the synonym sets that are automatically generated can degrade retrieval performance."

First, search for relevant documents returns irrelevant items when all meanings of a search term are used, rather than just the meaning intended. This causes low precision. Second, relevant items are missed when they are indexed not under the actual search terms, but rather under related terms. This causes low recall. With semantics-free approaches there is generally no way to improve both precision and recall at the same time. Word sense disambiguation during document indexing should improve precision. We have investigated using the massive Word Net semantic network for disambigu at ion during indexing. With the unconstrained text of the SMART ret rieval environment, we have had to derive our own content description from the input text, given only part-ofspeech tagging of the input. We employ the notion of semantic distance between network nodes. Input text terms with multiple senses are disambiguated by finding the combination of senses from a set of contiguous terms which minimizes total pairwise dist ante between senses. Results so far have been encouraging. Improvement in disamblguation compared with chance is clear"

Using Taxonomic Similarity in Word Sense Selection This section considers the application of the semantic similarity measure in resolving another form of ambiguity: selecting the appropriate sense of a noun when it appears in the context of other nouns that are related in meaning. 5.1 Associating Word Senses with Noun Groupings Knowledge about groups of related words plays a role in many natural language applications. As examples, query expansion using related words is a well studied technique in information retrieval (e.g., Harman, 1992; Grefenstette, 1992), clusters of similar words can play a role in smoothing stochastic language models for speech recognition (Brown, Della Pietra, deSouza, Lai, & Mercer, 1992), classes of verbs that share semantic structure form the basis for an approach to interlingual machine translation (Dorr, 1997), and clusterings of related words can be used in characterizing subgroupings of retrieved documents in largescale Web searches (e.g., Digital Equipment Corporation, 1998). There is a wide body of research on the use of distributional methods for measuring word similarity in order to obtain groups of related words (e.g., Bensch & Savitch, 1992; Brill, 1991; Brown et al., 1992; Grefenstette, 1992, 1994; McKeown & Hatzivassiloglou, 1993; Pereira, Tishby, & Lee, 1993; Sch\u007f utze, 1993), and thesauri such as WordNet are another source of word relationships (e.g., Voorhees, 1994). Distributional techniques can sometimes do a good job of identifying groups of related words (see Resnik, 1998b, for an overview and critical discussion), but for some tasks the relevant relationships are not among words, but among word senses. For example, Brown et al. (1992) illustrate the notion of a distributionally derived, \\semantically sticky\" cluster using an automatically derived word group containing attorney, counsel, trial, court, and judge."

The algorithm checks the context surrounding the target noun against that of previously observed instances and chooses the sense for which the most evidence is found, where evidence consists of a set of orthographic, syntactic, and lexical features. Because the sense distinctions made are coarse, the disambiguation can be accomplished without the expense of knowledge bases or inference mechanisms. An implementation of the algorithm is described which, starting with a small set of hand-labeled instances, improves its results automatically via unsupervised training. The approach is compared to other attempts at homograph disambiguation using both machine readable dictionaries and unrestricted text and the use of training instances is determined to be a crucial di erence."

A formula called DISTANCE was developed to measure the conceptual distance between queries and documents encoded as sets of thesaurus terms. DISTANCE references MeSH (Medical Subject Headings) and assesses the degree of match between a MeSH-encoded query and document. The performance of DISTANCE on MeSH is compared to the performance of people in the assessment of conceptual distance between queries and documents, and is found to simulate with surprising accuracy the human performance. The power of the computer simulation stems both from the tendency of people to rely heavily on broader-than (BT) relations in making decisions about conceptual distance and from the thousands of accurate BT relations in MeSH. One source for discrepancy between the algorithms' measurement of closeness between query and document and people's measurement of closeness between query and document is occasional inconsistency in the BT relations. Our experiments with adding non-BT relations to MeSH showed how these non-BT non-BT relations to MeSH showed how these non-BT relations could improve document ranking, if DISTANCE were also appropriately revised to treat these relations differently from BT relations."

As a result, their combination makes the thesaurus specify the similarity between senses which accounts for the similarity between words, produces a kind of semantic classification of the senses defined in the dictionary, and provides reliable information about the lexical items on which the resources don't conform with each other."

None of these has yet proven effective on a large scale. In this paper, we describe a method for lexical disambiguation of text using the definitions in a machine-readable dictionary together with the technique of simulated annealing. The method operates on complete sentences and attempts to select the optimal combinations of word senses for all the words in the sentence simultaneously. The words in the sentences may be any of the 28,000 headwords in Longman's Dictionary of Contemporary English (LDOCE) and are disambiguated relative to the senses given in LDOCE. Our initial results on a sample set of 50 sentences are comparable to those of other researchers, and the fully automatic method requires no hand-coding of lexical entries, or hand-tagging of text."

Subsequent discussion of those proposals resulted in SENSEVAL, the first evaluation exercise for word sense disambiguation (Kilgarriff and Palmer 2000). This article is a revised and extended version of our 1997 workshop paper, reviewing its observations and proposals and discussing them in light of the SENSEVAL exercise. It also includes a new in-depth empirical study of translingually-based sense inventories and distance measures, using statistics collected from native-speaker annotations of 222 polysemous contexts across 12 languages. These data show that monolingual sense distinctions at most levels of granularity can be effectively captured by translations into some set of second languages, especially as language family distance increases. In addition, the probability that a given sense pair will tend to lexicalize differently across languages is shown to correlate with semantic salience and sense granularity; sense hierarchies automatically generated from such distance matrices yield results remarkably similar to those created by professional monolingual lexicographers."

Noun compounds have received comparatively less attention (Kobayasi, Takunaga, & Tanaka, 1994; Lauer, 1994, 1995), as has the problem of coordination ambiguity (Agarwal & Boggess, 1992; Kurohashi & Nagao, 1992). In this section, I investigate the role of semantic similarity in resolving coordination ambiguities involving nominal compounds. I began with noun phrase coordinations of the form n1 and n2 n3, which admit two structural analyses, one in which n1 and n2 are the two noun phrase heads being conjoined (1a) and one in which the conjoined heads are n1 and n3 (1b). (1) a. a (bank and warehouse) guard b. a (policeman) and (park guard) Identifying which two head nouns are conjoined is necessary in order to arrive at a correct interpretation of the phrase's content. For example, analyzing (1b) according to the structure of (1a) could lead a machine translation system to produce a noun phrase describing somebody who guards both policemen and parks. Analyzing (1a) according to the structure of (1b) could lead an information retrieval system to miss this phrase when looking for queries involving the term bank guard. Kurohashi and Nagao (1992) point out that similarity of form and similarity of meaning are important cues to conjoinability."

There is strong evidence that the set of possible lexical features which can be used in a language is unbounded, and thus not innate. Lakoff [Lakoff 87] describes a language in which the feature -I-woman-or-fire-ordangerons-thing exists. This feature is based upon ancient folklore of the society in which it is used. If the set of possible lexieal features is indeed unbounded, then it cannot be par t of the innate Universal Grammar and must be learned. Even if the set is not unbounded, the child is still left with the challenging task of determining which features are used in her language. If a child does not know a priori what lexical features are used in her language, there are two sources for acquiring this information: semantic and syntactic cues. A learner using semantic cues could recognize that words often refer to objects, actions, and properties, and from this deduce the lexical features: noun, verb and adjective. Pinker [Pinker 89] proposes that a combination of semantic cues and innate semantic primitives could account for the acquisition of verb features. He believes that the child can discover semantic properties of a verb by noticing the types of actions typically taking place when the verb is uttered. Once these properties are known, says Pinker, they can be used to reliably predict the distributional behavior of the verb. However, Gleitman [Gleitman 90] presents evidence that semantic cues axe not sufficient for a child to acquire verb features and believes that the use of this semantic information in conjunction with information about the subcategorization properties of the verb may be sufficient for learning verb features. This paper takes Glei tman's suggestion to the extreme, in hope of determining whether syntactic cues may not just aid in feature discovery, but may be all tha t is necessary. We present evidence for the sufficiency of a strictly syntax-based model for discovering"

In pursuit of that goal, the thesis makes two main theoretical contributions: (i) it identifies a new class of designs by specifying an architecture for natural language analysis in which probabilities are given to semantic forms rather than to more superficial linguistic elements; and (ii) it explores the development of a mathematical theory to predict the expected accuracy of statistical language learning systems in terms of the volume of data used to train them. \nThe theoretical work is illustrated by applying statistical language learning designs to the analysis of noun compounds. Both syntactic and semantic analysis of noun compounds are attempted using the proposed architecture. Empirical comparisons demonstrate that the proposed syntactic model is significantly better than those previously suggested, approaching the performance of human judges on the same task, and that the proposed semantic model, the first statistical approach to this problem, exhibits significantly better accuracy than the baseline strategy. These results suggest that the new class of designs identified is a promising one. The experiments also serve to highlight the need for a widely applicable theory of data requirements."

We describe two experiments: one exploring the amount of information relevant to sense disambiguation which is contained in the part-of-speech field of entries in Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English (LDOCE). Another, more practical, experiment attempts sense disambiguation of all open class words in a text assigning LDOCE homographs as sense tags using only part-of-speech information. We report that 92% of open class words can be successfully tagged in this way. We plan to extend this work and to implement an improved large-scale tagger, a description of which is included here."

The theory is based on Quillian's theory of semantic memory search and semantic preparation, or priming. In conjunction with this, several of the miscondeptions concerning Qullian's theory are discussed. A number of additional assumptions are proposed for his theory in order to apply it to recent experiments. The present paper shows how the extended theory can account for results of several production experiments by Loftus, Juola and Atkinson's multiple-category experiment, Conrad's sentence-verification experiments, and several categorization experiments on the effect of semantic relatedness and typicality by Holyoak and Glass, Rips, Shoben, and Smith, and Rosch. The paper also provides a critique of the Smith, Shoben, and Rips model for categorization judgments. Some years ago, Quillian1 (1962, 1967) proposed a spreading-acti vation theory of human semantic processing that he tried to implement in computer simulations of memory search (Quillian, 1966) and comprehension (Quillian, 1969). The theory viewed memory search as activation spreading from two or more concept nodes in a semantic network until an intersection was found. The effects of preparation (or priming) in semantic memory were also explained in terms of spreading activation from the node of the primed concept. Rather than a theory to explain data, it was a theory designed to show how to build human semantic structure and processing into a computer."

Clusters are represented by average context distributions derived from the given words according to their probabilities of cluster membership. In many cases, the clusters can be thought of as encoding coarse sense distinctions. Deterministic annealing is used to find lowest distortion sets of clusters: as the annealing parameter increases, existing clusters become unstable and subdivide, yielding a hierarchical \"soft\" clustering of the data.

The article presents algorithms that take advantage of taxonomic similarity in resolving syntactic and semantic ambiguity, along with experimental results demonstrating their e ectiveness. 1.

In particular, the problem of generalizing values of a case frame slot for a verb is viewed as that of estimating a conditional probability distribution over a partition of words, and a new generalization method based on the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle is proposed. In order to assist with efficiency, the proposed method makes use of an existing thesaurus and restricts its attention to those partitions that are present as \"cuts\" in the thesaurus tree, thus reducing the generalization problem to that of estimating a \"tree cut model\" of the thesaurus tree. An efficient algorithm is given, which provably obtains the optimal tree cut model for the given frequency data of a case slot, in the sense of MDL. Case frame patterns obtained by the method were used to resolve PP-attachment ambiguity. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method improves upon or is at least comparable with existing methods."

There may be hundreds, perhaps thousands, of syntactic parse trees for certain very natural sentences of English. This fact has been a major problem confronting natural language processing, especially when a large percentage of the syntactic parse trees are enumerated during semantic/pragmatic processing. In this paper we propose some methods for dealing with syntactic ambiguity in ways that exploit certain regularities among alternative parse trees. These regularities will be expressed as linear combinations of ATN networks, and also as sums and products of formal power series. We believe that such encoding of ambiguity will enhance processing, whether syntactic and semantic constraints are processed separately in sequence or interleaved together."

It depends on whether or not he is on a steam locomotive. I am trying to decide automatically which sense of a word is intended (in written English) by using machine readable dictionaries, and looking for words in the sense definitions that overlap words in the definition of nearby words. The problem of deciding which sense of a word was intended by the writer is an important problem in information retrieval systems. At present most retrieval systems rely on manual indexing; if this is to be replaced with automatic text processing, it would be very desirable to recognize the correct sense of each word as often as possible. Previous work has generally either suggested (a) detailed frames describing the particular word senses,t*\u2019 or (b) global statistics about the word occurrences.3 The first has not yet been made available in any real application, and the second may give the wrong answer in specific local instances. This procedure uses available dictionaries, so that it will process any text; and uses solely the immediate context. To consider the example in the title, look at the definition of pine in the Oxford Advanced Learner\u2019s Dictionary of Current English: there are, of course, two major senses. \u201ckind of evergreen tree with needle-shaped leaves.. .\u201d and \u201cwaste away through sorrow or illness...\u201d And cone has three separate definitions: \u201csolid body which narrows to a\u2019 point . . . . *\u2019 \u201csomething of this shape w-hether solid or hollow...,\u201d and \u201cfruit of certain evergreen trees...\u201d Note that both evergreen and tree are common to two of the sense definitions: thus a program could guess that if the two words pine cone appear together, the likely senses are those of the tree and its fruit"

                "text": "The 1990s have witnessed a resurgence of interest in 1950s-style empirical and statistical methods of language analysis. Empiricism was at its peak in the 1950s, dominat ing a broad set of fields ranging from psychology (behaviorism) to electrical engineering (information theory). At that time, it was common practice in linguistics to classify words not only on the basis of their meanings but also on the basis of their cooccurrence with other words. Firth, a leading figure in British linguistics during the 1950s, summar ized the approach with the memorable line: \"You shall know a word by the company it keeps\" (Firth 1957). Regrettably, interest in empiricism faded in the late 1950s and early 1960s with a number of significant events including Chomsky 's criticism of n-grams in Syntactic Structures (Chomsky 1957) and Minsky and Papert 's criticism of neural networks in Perceptrons (Minsky and Papert 1969). Perhaps the most immediate reason for this empirical renaissance is the availability of massive quantities of data: more text is available than ever before. Just ten years ago, the one-million word Brown Corpus (Francis and Ku~era, 1982) was considered large, but even then, there were much larger corpora such as the Birmingham Corpus (Sinclair et al. 1987; Sinclair 1987). Today, many locations have samples of text running into the hundreds of millions or even billions of words. Collections of this magni tude are becoming widely available, thanks to data collection efforts such as the Association for Computat ional Linguistics' Data Collection Initiative (ACL/DCI), the European Corpus Initiative (ECI), ICAME, the British National Corpus (BNC), the Linguistic Data Consort ium (LDC), the Consort ium for Lexical Research (CLR), Electronic Dictionary Research (EDR), and standardization efforts such as the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI). 1 The data-intensive approach to language, which is becoming known as Text Analysis, takes a pragmatic approach that is well suited to meet the recent emphasis on numerical evaluations and concrete deliverables. Text Analysis focuses on broad ( though possibly superficial) coverage of unrestricted text, rather than deep analysis of (artificially) restricted domains."

If the conjunctive structures existing in a long sentence can be analyzed correctly, ambiguities can be reduced greatly and a sentence can be parsed in a high successful rate. Since the prior part and the posterior part of a conjunctive structure have a similar structure very often, finding two similar series of words is an essential point in solving this problem. Similarities of all pairs of words are calculated and then the two series of words which have the greatest sum of similarities are found by a technique of dynamic programming. We deal with not only conjunctive noun phrases, but also conjunctive predicative clauses created by \"Renyoh chuushi-ho\". We will illustrate the effectiveness of this method by the analysis of 180 long Japanese sentences."

To our knowledge, however, these investigations have only considered the problem of attaching the first PP, i.e., in a [V NP PP] configuration. In this paper, we consider one technique which has been successfully applied to this problem, backed-off estimation, and demonstrate how it can be extended to deal with the problem of multiple PP attachment. The multiple PP attachment introduces two related problems: sparser data (since multiple PPs are naturally rarer), and greater syntactic ambiguity (more attachment configurations which must be distinguished). We present and algorithm which solves this problem through re-use of the relatively rich data obtained from first PP training, in resolving subsequent PP attachments."
