However, there is still a lack of performance evaluation protocols for video text detection. In this paper, we propose an objective and comprehensive performance evaluation protocol for video text detection algorithms. The protocol includes a positive set and a negative set of indices at the textbox level, which evaluate the detection quality in terms of both location accuracy and fragmentation of the detected textboxes. In the protocol, we assign a detection difficulty (DD) level to each ground truth textbox. The performance indices can then be normalized with respect to the textbox DD level and are therefore tolerant to different ground-truth difficulties to a certain degree. We also assign a detectability index (DI) value to each ground-truth textbox. The overall detection rate is the DI-weighted average of the detection qualities of all ground-truth textboxes, which makes the detection rate more accurate to reveal the real performance. The automatic performance evaluation scheme has been applied to performance evaluation of a text detection approach to determine the best thresholds that can yield the best detection results. The protocol has also been employed to compare the performances of several text detection systems. Hence, we believe that the proposed protocol can be used to compare the performance of different video/image text detection algorithms/systems and can even help improve, select, and design new text detection methods."

In this work, we present algorithms for detecting and tracking text in digital video. Our system implements a scale-space feature extractor that feeds an artificial neural processor to detect text blocks. Our text tracking scheme consists of two modules: a sum of squared difference (SSD)-based module to find the initial position and a contour-based module to refine the position. Experiments conducted with a variety of video sources show that our scheme can detect and track text robustly."

However, many reported methods assume that the faces in an image or an image sequence have been identified and localized. To build fully automated systems that analyze the information contained in face images, robust and efficient face detection algorithms are required. Given a single image, the goal of face detection is to identify all image regions which contain a face, regardless of its 3D position, orientation and lighting conditions. Such a problem is challenging because faces are non-rigid and have a high degree of variability in size, shape, color and texture. Numerous techniques have been developed to detect faces in a single image, and the purpose of this paper is to categorize and evaluate these algorithms. We also discuss relevant issues such as data collection, evaluation metrics and benchmarking. After analyzing these algorithms and identifying their limitations, we conclude with several promising directions for future research."

Our earlier implementation while quite successful, was restricted to applications with a fixed camera. In this paper we present some recent work that removes this restriction. Such systems are required for machine vision from moving platforms such as robots, intelligent vehicles, and unattended large field of regard cameras with a small field of view. Our approach is based on the use of a deformable shape model for humans coupled with a novel variant of the condensation algorithm that uses quasi-random sampling for efficiency. This allows the use of simple motion models which results in algorithm robustness, enabling us to handle unknown camera/human motion with unrestricted camera viewing angles. We present the details of our human tracking algorithms and some examples from pedestrian tracking and automated surveillance."

It was observed that when a row of pixels across such a text region is clustered in perceptually uniform L*a*b* color space, the pixels of one of these clusters would belong to the text strokes. These pixels would appeal as a line of short streaks on the row since a typical text region has many vertical and diagonal strokes. The proposed method examines every third row of the the image and checks whether this row passes through a horizontal text region. For a given row R, the pixels of R are hierarchically clustered in L*a*b* space and each cluster is tested whether similar-colored pixels in R's vicinity are possibly part of a text region. Candidate text blocks are marked by heuristics using information about the cluster's line of shell streaks. The detected text blocks are fused with the text regions. The method was tested on key frames of several video sequences and was able to locate a wide variety of text."
