Inference algorithms based on graph cuts and belief propagation have been found to yield accurate results, but despite recent advances are often too slow for practical use. In this paper we present some algorithmic techniques that substantially improve the running time of the loopy belief propagation approach. One of the techniques reduces the complexity of the inference algorithm to be linear rather than quadratic in the number of possible labels for each pixel, which is important for problems such as image restoration that have a large label set. Another technique speeds up and reduces the memory requirements of belief propagation on grid graphs. A third technique is a multi-grid method that makes it possible to obtain good results with a small fixed number of message passing iterations, independent of the size of the input images. Taken together these techniques speed up the standard algorithm by several orders of magnitude. In practice we obtain results that are as accurate as those of other global methods (e.g., using the Middlebury stereo benchmark) while being nearly as fast as purely local methods."

An important component of an MRF-based approach is the inference algorithm used to find the most likely setting of each node in the MRF. Algorithms have been proposed which use graph cuts or belief propagation for inference. These stereo algorithms differ in both the inference algorithm used and the formulation of the MRF. It is unknown whether to attribute the responsibility for differences in performance to the MRF or the inference algorithm. We address this through controlled experiments by comparing the belief propagation algorithm and the graph cuts algorithm on the same MRF's, which have been created for calculating stereo disparities. We find that the labellings produced by the two algorithms are comparable. The solutions produced by graph cuts have a lower energy than those produced with belief propagation, but this does not necessarily lead to increased performance relative to the ground truth."

After eliminating the line process and the binary process by introducing two robust functions, we obtain the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation in the Markov network by applying a Bayesian belief propagation (BP) algorithm. Furthermore, we extend our basic stereo model to incorporate other visual cues (e.g., image segmentation) that are not modeled in the three MRF's, and again obtain the MAP solution. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-art stereo algorithms for most test cases."

In particular, it is known that using BP on a single-cycle graph or tree reweighted BP on an arbitrary graph will give the MAP solution if the beliefs have no ties. In this paper we extend the setting under which BP can be used to provably extract the MAP. We define Convex BP as BP algorithms based on a convex free energy approximation and show that this class includes ordinary BP with single-cycle, tree reweighted BP and many other BP variants. We show that when there are no ties, fixed-points of convex max-product BP will provably give the MAP solution. We also show that convex sum-product BP at sufficiently small temperatures can be used to solve linear programs that arise from relaxing the MAP problem. Finally, we derive a novel condition that allows us to derive the MAP solution even if some of the convex BP beliefs have ties. In experiments, we show that our theorems allow us to find the MAP in many real-world instances of graphical models where exact inference using junction-tree is impossible."

(Nov. 2005)- tree-reweighted max-product message passing (TRW). It was inspired by the problem of maximizing a lower bound on the energy. However, the algorithm is not guaranteed to increase this bound - it may actually go down. In addition, TRW does not always converge. We develop a modification of this algorithm which we call sequential tree-reweighted message passing. Its main property is that the bound is guaranteed not to decrease. We also give a weak tree agreement condition which characterizes local maxima of the bound with respect to TRW algorithms. We prove that our algorithm has a limit point that achieves weak tree agreement. Finally, we show that, our algorithm requires half as much memory as traditional message passing approaches. Experimental results demonstrate that on certain synthetic and real problems, our algorithm outperforms both the ordinary belief propagation and tree-reweighted algorithm in (M. J. Wainwright, et al., Nov. 2005). In addition, on stereo problems with Potts interactions, we obtain a lower energy than graph cuts"

While a large number of algorithms for stereo correspondence have been developed, relatively little work has been done on characterizing their performance. In this paper, we present a taxonomy of dense, two-frame stereo methods. Our taxonomy is designed to assess the different components and design decisions made in individual stereo algorithms. Using this taxonomy, we compare existing stereo methods and present experiments evaluating the performance of many different variants. In order to establish a common software platform and a collection of data sets for easy evaluation, we have designed a stand-alone, flexible C++ implementation that enables the evaluation of individual components and that can easily be extended to include new algorithms. We have also produced several new multi-frame stereo data sets with ground truth and are making both the code and data sets available on the Web. Finally, we include a comparative evaluation of a large set of today's best-performing stereo algorithms."

The basic idea is to represent the original problem on the graph with cycles as a convex combination of tree-structured problems. A convexity argument then guarantees that the optimal value of the original problem (i.e., the log probability of the MAP assignment) is upper bounded by the combined optimal values of the tree problems. We prove that this upper bound is met with equality if and only if the tree problems share an optimal configuration in common. An important implication is that any such shared configuration must also be the MAP configuration for the original problem. Next we develop a tree-reweighted max-product algorithm for attempting to find convex combinations of tree-structured problems that share a common optimum. We give necessary and sufficient conditions for a fixed point to yield the exact MAP estimate. An attractive feature of our analysis is that it generalizes naturally to convex combinations of hypertree-structured distributions."

The major restriction is that the energy function's smoothness term must only involve pairs of pixels. We propose two algorithms that use graph cuts to compute a local minimum even when very large moves are allowed. The first move we consider is an /spl alpha/-/spl beta/-swap: for a pair of labels /spl alpha/,/spl beta/, this move exchanges the labels between an arbitrary set of pixels labeled a and another arbitrary set labeled /spl beta/. Our first algorithm generates a labeling such that there is no swap move that decreases the energy. The second move we consider is an /spl alpha/-expansion: for a label a, this move assigns an arbitrary set of pixels the label /spl alpha/. Our second algorithm, which requires the smoothness term to be a metric, generates a labeling such that there is no expansion move that decreases the energy. Moreover, this solution is within a known factor of the global minimum. We experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on image restoration, stereo and motion."

Each of these techniques constructs a graph such that the minimum cut on the graph also minimizes the energy. Yet, because these graph constructions are complex and highly specific to a particular energy function, graph cuts have seen limited application to date. In this paper, we give a characterization of the energy functions that can be minimized by graph cuts. Our results are restricted to functions of binary variables. However, our work generalizes many previous constructions and is easily applicable to vision problems that involve large numbers of labels, such as stereo, motion, image restoration, and scene reconstruction. We give a precise characterization of what energy functions can be minimized using graph cuts, among the energy functions that can be written as a sum of terms containing three or fewer binary variables. We also provide a general-purpose construction to minimize such an energy function. Finally, we give a necessary condition for any energy function of binary variables to be minimized by graph cuts. Researchers who are considering the use of graph cuts to optimize a particular energy function can use our results to determine if this is possible and then follow our construction to create the appropriate graph. A software implementation is freely available."

By decomposing the original distribution into a convex combination of tree-structured distributions, we obtain an upper bound on the optimal value of the original problem (i.e., the log probability of the MAP assignment) in terms of the combined optimal values of the tree problems. We prove that this upper bound is tight if and only if all the tree distributions share an optimal configuration in common. An important implication is that any such shared configuration must also be a MAP configuration for the original distribution. Next we develop two approaches to attempting to obtain tight upper bounds: a) a tree-relaxed linear program (LP), which is derived from the Lagrangian dual of the upper bounds; and b) a tree-reweighted max-product message-passing algorithm that is related to but distinct from the max-product algorithm. In this way, we establish a connection between a certain LP relaxation of the mode-finding problem and a reweighted form of the max-product (min-sum) message-passing algorithm."

By decomposing the original distribution into a convex combination of tree-structured distributions, we obtain an upper bound on the optimal value of the original problem (i.e., the log probability of the MAP assignment) in terms of the combined optimal values of the tree problems. We prove that this upper bound is tight if and only if all the tree distributions share an optimal configuration in common. An important implication is that any such shared configuration must also be a MAP configuration for the original distribution. Next we develop two approaches to attempting to obtain tight upper bounds: (a) a {\\em tree-relaxed linear program} (LP), which is derived from the Lagrangian dual of the upper bounds; and (b) a {\\em tree-reweighted max-product message-passing algorithm} that is related to but distinct from the max-product algorithm. In this way, we establish a connection between a certain LP relaxation of the mode-finding problem, and a reweighted form of the max-product (min-sum) message-passing algorithm."

For a TRW fixed point satisfying the strong tree agreement condition, the algorithm outputs a configuration that is provably optimal. In this paper, we focus on the case of binary variables with pairwise couplings, and establish stronger properties of TRW fixed points that satisfy only the milder condition of weak tree agreement (WTA). First, we demonstrate how it is possible to identify part of the optimal solution\u2014i.e., a provably optimal solution for a subset of nodes\u2014 without knowing a complete solution. Second, we show that for submodular functions, a WTA fixed point always yields a globally optimal solution. We establish that for binary variables, any WTA fixed point always achieves the global maximum of the linear programming relaxation underlying the TRW method."

BNT is widely used in teaching and research: the web page has received over 28,000 hits since May 2000. In this paper, we discuss a broad spectrum of issues related to graphical models (directed and undirected), and describe, at a high-level, how BNT was designed to cope with them all. We also compare BNT to other software packages for graphical models, and discuss the nascent OpenBayes e ort."
