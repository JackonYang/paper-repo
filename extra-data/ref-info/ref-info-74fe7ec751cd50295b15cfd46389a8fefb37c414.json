CHILL treats parser acquisition as the learning of search-control rules within a logic program representing a shift-reduce parser and uses techniques from Inductive Logic Programming to learn relational control knowledge. Starting with a general framework for constructing a suitable logical form, CHILL is able to train on a corpus comprising sentences paired with database queries and induce parsers that map subsequent sentences directly into executable queries. Experimental results with a complete database-query application for U.S. geography show that CHILL is able to learn parsers that outperform a preexisting, hand-crafted counterpart. These results demonstrate the ability of a corpus-based system to produce more than purely syntactic representations. They also provide direct evidence of the utility of an empirical approach at the level of a complete natural language application."

The lexicon learned consists of phrases paired with meaning representations. WOLFIE is part of an integrated system that learns to transform sentences into representations such as logical database queries. \n \nExperimental results are presented demonstrating WOLFIE's ability to learn useful lexicons for a database interface in four different natural languages. The usefulness of the lexicons learned by WOLFIE are compared to those acquired by a similar system, with results favorable to WOLFIE. A second set of experiments demonstrates WOLFIE's ability to scale to larger and more difficult, albeit artificially generated, corpora. \n \nIn natural language acquisition, it is difficult to gather the annotated data needed for supervised learning; however, unannotated data is fairly plentiful. Active learning methods attempt to select for annotation and training only the most informative examples, and therefore are potentially very useful in natural language applications. However, most results to date for active learning have only considered standard classification tasks. To reduce annotation effort while maintaining accuracy, we apply active learning to semantic lexicons. We show that active learning can significantly reduce the number of annotated examples required to achieve a given level of performance."

Using the categories and rules, the sentences from the corpus are probabilistically parsed. The parses of this example and the set of parses of earlier examples in the corpus are used to build a lexicon and annotate the corpus. We report the results from experiments on two generated corpora and also on the more complicated LLL corpus, that contains examples from subsets of English syntax. These show that the system is able to generate reasonable lexicons and provide accurately parsed corpora in the process. We also discuss ways in which the approach can be scaled up to deal with larger and more diverse corpora."

However, statistical parsers require training on a massive, labeled corpus, and manually creating such a corpus for each database is prohibitively expensive. To address this quandary, this paper reports on the PRECISE NLI, which uses a statistical parser as a \"plug in\". The paper shows how a strong semantic model coupled with \"light re-training\" enables PRECISE to overcome parser errors, and correctly map from parsed questions to the corresponding SQL queries. We discuss the issues in using statistical parsers to build database-independent NLIs, and report on experimental results with the benchmark ATIS data set where PRECISE achieves 94% accuracy."

Log-linear models can easily encode the long-range dependencies inherent in coordination and extraction phenomena, which CCG was designed to handle. Log-linear models have previously been applied to statistical parsing, under the assumption that all possible parses for a sentence can be enumerated. Enumerating all parses is infeasible for large grammars; however, dynamic programming over a packed chart can be used to efficiently estimate the model parameters. We describe a parellelised implementation which runs on a Beowulf cluster and allows the complete WSJ Penn Treebank to be used for estimation."

Our models can condition on arbitrary features of input sentences, thus incorporating an important kind of lexical information without the added algorithmic complexity of modeling headedness. We provide an efficient algorithm for learning such models and show experimental evidence of the model\u2019s improved performance over a natural baseline model and a lexicalized probabilistic context-free grammar."

Some advantages and disadvantages of NLIDBS are then discussed, comparing NLIDBS to formal query languages, form-based interfaces, and graphical interfaces. An introduction to some of the linguistic problems NLIDBS have to confront follows, for the benefit of readers less familiar with computational linguistics. The discussion then moves on to NLIDB architectures, portability issues, restricted natural language input systems (including menu-based NLIDBS), and NLIDBS with reasoning capabilities. Some less explored areas of NLIDB research are then presented, namely database updates, meta-knowledge questions, temporal questions, and multi-modal NLIDBS. The paper ends with reflections on the current state of the art."

This paper presents a generalization of these algorithms to certain denumerable\u2010state, hidden Markov processes. This algorithm permits automatic training of the stochastic analog of an arbitrary context free grammar. In particular, in contrast to many grammatical inference methods, the new algorithm allows the grammar to have an arbitrary degree of ambiguity. Since natural language is often syntactically ambiguous, it is necessary for the grammatical inference algorithm to allow for this ambiguity. Furthermore, allowing ambiguity in the grammar allows errors in the recognition process to be explicitly modeled in the grammar rather than added as an extra component."

Coordination, relativization, and related prosodic phenomena have been analyzed in CCG in terms of a radically revised notion of surface structure. CCG surface structures do not exhibit traditional notions of syntactic dominance and command, and do not constitute an autonomous level of representation. Instead, they reflect the computations by which a sentence may be realized or analyzed, to synchronously define a predicate-argument structure, or logical form. Surface Structure and Interpretation shows that binding and control can be captured at this level, preserving the advantages of CCG as an account of coordination and unbounded dependency.The core of the book is a detailed treatment of extraction, a focus of syntactic research since the early work of Chomsky and Ross. The topics addressed include the sources of subject-object asymmetries and phenomena attributed to the Empty Category Principle (ECP), asymmetric islands, parasitic gaps, and the relation of coordination and extraction, including their interactions with binding theory. In his conclusion, the author relates CCG to other categorial and type-driven approaches and to proposals for minimalism in linguistic theory.Linguistic Inquiry Monograph No. 30"

Conditional random fields also avoid a fundamental limitation of maximum entropy Markov models (MEMMs) and other discriminative Markov models based on directed graphical models, which can be biased towards states with few successor states.

Kernel-based approaches, such as support vector machines (SVMs), which maximize the margin of confidence of the classifier, are the method of choice for many such tasks. Their popularity stems both from the ability to use high-dimensional feature spaces, and from their strong theoretical guarantees. However, many real-world tasks involve sequential, spatial, or structured data, where multiple labels must be assigned. Existing kernel-based methods ignore structure in the problem, assigning labels independently to each object, losing much useful information. Conversely, probabilistic graphical models, such as Markov networks, can represent correlations between labels, by exploiting problem structure, but cannot handle high-dimensional feature spaces, and lack strong theoretical generalization guarantees. In this paper, we present a new framework that combines the advantages of both approaches: Maximum margin Markov (M3) networks incorporate both kernels, which efficiently deal with high-dimensional features, and the ability to capture correlations in structured data. We present an efficient algorithm for learning M3 networks based on a compact quadratic program formulation. We provide a new theoretical bound for generalization in structured domains. Experiments on the task of handwritten character recognition and collective hypertext classification demonstrate very significant gains over previous approaches."

Given an appropriate network architecture, gradient-based learning algorithms can be used to synthesize a complex decision surface that can classify high-dimensional patterns, such as handwritten characters, with minimal preprocessing. This paper reviews various methods applied to handwritten character recognition and compares them on a standard handwritten digit recognition task. Convolutional neural networks, which are specifically designed to deal with the variability of 2D shapes, are shown to outperform all other techniques. Real-life document recognition systems are composed of multiple modules including field extraction, segmentation recognition, and language modeling. A new learning paradigm, called graph transformer networks (GTN), allows such multimodule systems to be trained globally using gradient-based methods so as to minimize an overall performance measure. Two systems for online handwriting recognition are described. Experiments demonstrate the advantage of global training, and the flexibility of graph transformer networks. A graph transformer network for reading a bank cheque is also described. It uses convolutional neural network character recognizers combined with global training techniques to provide record accuracy on business and personal cheques. It is deployed commercially and reads several million cheques per day."

His purpose is to construct a principle theory of natural grammar that is directly compatible with both expalantory linguistic accounts of a number of problematic syntactic phenomena and a straightforward computational account of the way sentences are mapped onto represenations of meaning. The radical nature of Steedman's proposal stems from his claim that much of the apparent complexity of syntax, prosody and processing follows from the lexical specification of the grammar and from the involvement of a small number of universal rule-types for combining predicates and arguments. These syntactic operations are related to the combinators of Combinatory Logic, engendering a much freer definition of derivational constituency than is traditionally assumed. This property allows Combinatory Categorical Grammar to capture elegantly the structure and interpretation of coordination and intonation contour in English as well as some well-known interactions between word order, coordination and relativization across a number of other languages. It also allows more direct compatibility with incremental semantic interpretation during parsing. The book covers topics in formal linguistics, intonational phonology, computational linguistics and experimental psycholinguistics, presenting them as an integrated theory of the language faculty in a form accessible to readers from any of those fields."
