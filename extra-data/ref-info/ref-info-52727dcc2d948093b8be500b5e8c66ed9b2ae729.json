Ideally, every pixel within each superpixel region will belong to the same real-world object. Existing algorithms generate superpixels that forfeit many useful properties of the regular topology of the original pixels: for example, the nth superpixel has no consistent position or relationship with its neighbors. We propose a novel algorithm that produces superpixels that are forced to conform to a grid (a regular superpixel lattice). Despite this added topological constraint, our algorithm is comparable in terms of speed and accuracy to alternative segmentation approaches. To demonstrate this, we use evaluation metrics based on (i) image reconstruction (ii) comparison to human-segmented images and (iii) stability of segmentation over subsequent frames of video sequences."

This framework is well suited for the task of learning object classifiers from weakly labeled image data, where only the presence of an object in an image is known, but not its location. Some recent work has explored the application of MIL algorithms to the tasks of image categorization and natural scene classification. In this paper we extend these ideas in a framework that uses MIL to recognize and localizeobjects in images. To achieve this we employ state of the art image descriptors and multiple stable segmentations. These components, combined with a powerful MIL algorithm, form our object recognition system called MILSS. We show highly competitive object categorization results on the Caltech dataset. To evaluate the performance of our algorithm further, we introduce the challenging Landmarks-18 dataset, a collection of photographs of famous landmarks from around the world. The results on this new dataset show the great potential of our proposed algorithm."

Our main contribution is a novel framework for combining object-level descriptions (such as position, shape, and color) with pixel-level appearance, boundary, and occlusion reasoning. In training, we exploit a rough 3D object model to learn physically localized part appearances. To find and segment objects in an image, we generate proposals based on the appearance and layout of local parts. The proposals are then refined after incorporating object-level information, and overlapping objects compete for pixels to produce a final description and segmentation of objects in the scene. A further contribution is a novel instance penalty, which is handled very efficiently during inference. We experimentally validate our approach on the challenging PASCAL'06 car database."

One important type of global feature is that of inter-class spatial relationships. For example, identifying \u201ctree\u201d pixels indicates that pixels above and to the sides are more likely to be \u201csky\u201d whereas pixels below are more likely to be \u201cgrass.\u201d Incorporating such global information across the entire image and between all classes is a computational challenge as it is image-dependent, and hence, cannot be precomputed.In this work we propose a method for capturing global information from inter-class spatial relationships and encoding it as a local feature. We employ a two-stage classification process to label all image pixels. First, we generate predictions which are used to compute a local relative location feature from learned relative location maps. In the second stage, we combine this with appearance-based features to provide a final segmentation. We compare our results to recent published results on several multi-class image segmentation databases and show that the incorporation of relative location information allows us to significantly outperform the current state-of-the-art."

Unlike most current localization methods, our approach does not require any hypothesis parameter space to be defined. Instead, it directly generates, evaluates and clusters shape masks. Thus, the presented framework produces more informative results for object class localization. For example, it easily learns and detects possible object viewpoints and articulations, which are often well characterized by the object outline. We evaluate the proposed approach on the challenging natural-scene Graz-02 object classes dataset. The results demonstrate the extended localization capabilities of our method."

To tie these ideas together we compute multiple segmentations of each image and then: (i) learn the object classes; and (ii) choose the correct segmentations.

Exploring all possible pixel subsets is prohibitively expensive, leading to recent approaches which use unsupervised image segmentation to reduce the size of the configuration space. Image segmentation, however, is known to be unstable, strongly affected by small image perturbations, feature choices, or different segmentation algorithms. This instability has led to advocacy for using multiple segmentations of an image. In this paper, we explore the question of how to best integrate the information from multiple bottom-up segmentations of an image to improve object recognition robustness. By integrating the image partition hypotheses in an intuitive combined top-down and bottom-up recognition approach, we improve object and feature support. We further explore possible extensions of our method and whether they provide improved performance. Results are presented on the MSRC 21-class data set and the Pascal VOC2007 object segmentation challenge."

We define a predicate for measuring the evidence for a boundary between two regions using a graph-based representation of the image. We then develop an efficient segmentation algorithm based on this predicate, and show that although this algorithm makes greedy decisions it produces segmentations that satisfy global properties. We apply the algorithm to image segmentation using two different kinds of local neighborhoods in constructing the graph, and illustrate the results with both real and synthetic images. The algorithm runs in time nearly linear in the number of graph edges and is also fast in practice. An important characteristic of the method is its ability to preserve detail in low-variability image regions while ignoring detail in high-variability regions."

It performs very fast categorization of each pixel in an image, a brute-force approach made feasible by three key developments: First, our method reduces the size of a large generic dictionary (on the order of ten thousand words) to the low hundreds while increasing classification performance compared to k-means. This is achieved by creating a discriminative dictionary tailored to the task by following the information bottleneck principle. Second, we perform feature-based categorization efficiently on a dense grid by extending the concept of integral images to the computation of local histograms. Third, we compute SIFT descriptors densely in linear time. We compare our method to the state of the art and find that it excels in accuracy and simplicity, performing better while assuming less."

The learned model is used for automatic visual recognition and semantic segmentation of photographs. Our discriminative model exploits novel features, based on textons, which jointly model shape and texture. Unary classification and feature selection is achieved using shared boosting to give an efficient classifier which can be applied to a large number of classes. Accurate image segmentation is achieved by incorporating these classifiers in a conditional random field. Efficient training of the model on very large datasets is achieved by exploiting both random feature selection and piecewise training methods. \n \nHigh classification and segmentation accuracy are demonstrated on three different databases: i) our own 21-object class database of photographs of real objects viewed under general lighting conditions, poses and viewpoints, ii) the 7-class Corel subset and iii) the 7-class Sowerby database used in [1]. The proposed algorithm gives competitive results both for highly textured (e.g. grass, trees), highly structured (e.g. cars, faces, bikes, aeroplanes) and articulated objects (e.g. body, cow)."

To perform localization, one can take a sliding window approach, but this strongly increases the computational cost, because the classifier function has to be evaluated over a large set of candidate subwindows. In this paper, we propose a simple yet powerful branch-and-bound scheme that allows efficient maximization of a large class of classifier functions over all possible subimages. It converges to a globally optimal solution typically in sublinear time. We show how our method is applicable to different object detection and retrieval scenarios. The achieved speedup allows the use of classifiers for localization that formerly were considered too slow for this task, such as SVMs with a spatial pyramid kernel or nearest neighbor classifiers based on the chi2-distance. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of the resulting systems on the UIUC Cars dataset, the PASCAL VOC 2006 dataset and in the PASCAL VOC 2007 competition."

Components also differ in their scale, as some focus on fine-resolution patterns while others on coarser, more global structure.

In order to improve performance, recent methods have begun to incorporate top-down cues, or object information, into segmentation. In this paper, we propose an approach to utilizing category-based information in segmentation, through a formulation as an image labelling problem. Our approach exploits bottom-up image cues to create an over-segmented representation of an image. The segments are then merged by assigning labels that correspond to the object category. The model is trained on a database of images, and is designed to be modular: it learns a number of image contexts, which simplify training and extend the range of object classes and image database size that the system can handle. The learning method estimates model parameters by maximizing a lower bound of the data likelihood. We examine performance on three real-world image databases, and compare our system to a standard classifier and other conditional random field approaches, as well as a bottom-up segmentation method."

However, training is typically done in a way that is not specific to the localization task. First a binary classifier is trained using a sample of positive and negative examples, and this classifier is subsequently applied to multiple regions within test images. We propose instead to treat object localization in a principled way by posing it as a problem of predicting structured data: we model the problem not as binary classification, but as the prediction of the bounding box of objects located in images. The use of a joint-kernelframework allows us to formulate the training procedure as a generalization of an SVM, which can be solved efficiently. We further improve computational efficiency by using a branch-and-bound strategy for localization during both training and testing. Experimental evaluation on the PASCAL VOC and TU Darmstadt datasets show that the structured training procedure improves performance over binary training as well as the best previously published scores."

We study the influence of each stage of the computation on performance, concluding that fine-scale gradients, fine orientation binning, relatively coarse spatial binning, and high-quality local contrast normalization in overlapping descriptor blocks are all important for good results. The new approach gives near-perfect separation on the original MIT pedestrian database, so we introduce a more challenging dataset containing over 1800 annotated human images with a large range of pose variations and backgrounds."

This technique works by partitioning the image into increasingly fine sub-regions and computing histograms of local features found inside each sub-region. The resulting \"spatial pyramid\" is a simple and computationally efficient extension of an orderless bag-of-features image representation, and it shows significantly improved performance on challenging scene categorization tasks. Specifically, our proposed method exceeds the state of the art on the Caltech-101 database and achieves high accuracy on a large database of fifteen natural scene categories. The spatial pyramid framework also offers insights into the success of several recently proposed image descriptions, including Torralba\u2019s \"gist\" and Lowe\u2019s SIFT descriptors."

More advanced models attempt to improve the coherence of the labellings by introducing some form of inter-patch coupling: traditional spatial models such as MRF's provide crisper local labellings by exploiting neighbourhood-level couplings, while aspect models such as PLSA and LDA use global relevance estimates (global mixing proportions for the classes appearing in the image) to shape the local choices. We point out that the two approaches are complementary, combining them to produce aspect-based spatial field models that outperform both approaches. We study two spatial models: one based on averaging over forests of minimal spanning trees linking neighboring image regions, the other on an efficient chain-based Expectation Propagation method for regular 8-neighbor Markov random fields. The models can be trained using either patch-level labels or image-level keywords. As input features they use factored observation models combining texture, color and position cues. Experimental results on the MSR Cambridge data sets show that combining spatial and aspect models significantly improves the region-level classification accuracy. In fact our models trained with image-level labels outperform PLSA trained with pixel-level ones."

Each layer is modeled as a conditional field that allows one to capture arbitrary observation-dependent label interactions. The proposed framework has two main advantages. First, it encodes both the short-range interactions (e.g., pixelwise label smoothing) as well as the long-range interactions (e.g., relative configurations of objects or regions) in a tractable manner. Second, the formulation is general enough to be applied to different domains ranging from pixelwise image labeling to contextual object detection. The parameters of the model are learned using a sequential maximum-likelihood approximation. The benefits of the proposed framework are demonstrated on four different datasets and comparison results are presented"

These are ensembles of decision trees that act directly on image pixels, and therefore do not need the expensive computation of filter-bank responses or local descriptors. They are extremely fast to both train and test, especially compared with k-means clustering and nearest-neighbor assignment of feature descriptors. The nodes in the trees provide (i) an implicit hierarchical clustering into semantic textons, and (ii) an explicit local classification estimate. Our second contribution, the bag of semantic textons, combines a histogram of semantic textons over an image region with a region prior category distribution. The bag of semantic textons is computed over the whole image for categorization, and over local rectangular regions for segmentation. Including both histogram and region prior allows our segmentation algorithm to exploit both textural and semantic context. Our third contribution is an image-level prior for segmentation that emphasizes those categories that the automatic categorization believes to be present. We evaluate on two datasets including the very challenging VOC 2007 segmentation dataset. Our results significantly advance the state-of-the-art in segmentation accuracy, and furthermore, our use of efficient decision forests gives at least a five-fold increase in execution speed."

The kernels are based on soft matching of subtree-patterns of the respective graphs, leveraging the natural structure of images while remaining robust to the associated segmentation process uncertainty. Indeed, output from morphological segmentation is often represented by a labelled graph, each vertex corresponding to a segmented region, with edges joining neighboring regions. However, such image representations have mostly remained underused for learning tasks, partly because of the observed instability of the segmentation process and the inherent hardness of inexact graph matching with uncertain graphs. Our kernels count common virtual substructures amongst images, which enables to perform efficient supervised classification of natural images with a support vector machine. Moreover, the kernel machinery allows us to take advantage of recent advances in kernel-based learning: (i) semi-supervised learning reduces the required number of labelled images, while (ii) multiple kernel learning algorithms efficiently select the most relevant similarity measures between images within our family."

This approach means that large scale experiments are relatively easy, so we can evaluate the effects of various early and midlevel vision algorithms on recognition performance. We evaluate various image segmentation algorithms by determining word prediction accuracy for images segmented in various ways and represented by various features. We take the view that good segmentations respect object boundaries, and so word prediction should be better for a better segmentation. However, it is usually very difficult in practice to obtain segmentations that do not break up objects, so most practitioners attempt to merge segments to get better putative object representations. We demonstrate that our paradigm of word prediction easily allows us to predict potentially useful segment merges, even for segments that do not look similar (for example, merging the black and white halves of a penguin is not possible with feature-based segmentation; the main cue must be \"familiar configuration\"). These studies focus on unsupervised learning of recognition. However, we show that word prediction can be markedly improved by providing supervised information for a relatively small number of regions together with large quantities of unsupervised information. This supervisory information allows a better and more discriminative choice of features and breaks possible symmetries."

The user marks certain pixels as \"object\" or \"background\" to provide hard constraints for segmentation. Additional soft constraints incorporate both boundary and region information. Graph cuts are used to find the globally optimal segmentation of the N-dimensional image. The obtained solution gives the best balance of boundary and region properties among all segmentations satisfying the constraints. The topology of our segmentation is unrestricted and both \"object\" and \"background\" segments may consist of several isolated parts. Some experimental results are presented in the context of photo/video editing and medical image segmentation. We also demonstrate an interesting Gestalt example. A fast implementation of our segmentation method is possible via a new max-flow algorithm."

In this work we propose to incorporate semantic object context as a post-processing step into any off-the-shelf object categorization model. Using a conditional random field (CRF) framework, our approach maximizes object label agreement according to contextual relevance. We compare two sources of context: one learned from training data and another queried from Google Sets. The overall performance of the proposed framework is evaluated on the PASCAL and MSRC datasets. Our findings conclude that incorporating context into object categorization greatly improves categorization accuracy."

Using the bag-of-words representation and the linear support vector machine, one can partly fulfill the goal, but the accuracy of linear classifiers is not high and the obtained features are not informative for users. We propose to combine item set mining and large margin classifiers to select features from the power set of all visual words. Our resulting classification rule is easier to browse and simpler to understand, because each feature has richer information. As a next step, each image is represented as a graph where nodes correspond to local image features and edges encode geometric relations between features. Combining graph mining and boosting, we can obtain a classification rule based on subgraph features that contain more information than the set features. We evaluate our algorithm in a web-retrieval ranking task where the goal is to reject outliers from a set of images returned for a keyword query. Furthermore, it is evaluated on the supervised classification tasks with the challenging VOC2005 data set. Our approach yields excellent accuracy in the unsupervised ranking task compared to a recently proposed probabilistic model and competitive results in the supervised classification task."

The combinatorial optimization literature provides many min-cut/max-flow algorithms with different polynomial time complexity. Their practical efficiency, however, has to date been studied mainly outside the scope of computer vision. The goal of this paper is to provide an experimental comparison of the efficiency of min-cut/max flow algorithms for applications in vision. We compare the running times of several standard algorithms, as well as a new algorithm that we have recently developed. The algorithms we study include both Goldberg-Tarjan style \"push -relabel\" methods and algorithms based on Ford-Fulkerson style \"augmenting paths.\" We benchmark these algorithms on a number of typical graphs in the contexts of image restoration, stereo, and segmentation. In many cases, our new algorithm works several times faster than any of the other methods, making near real-time performance possible. An implementation of our max-flow/min-cut algorithm is available upon request for research purposes."

It is rooted in ideas of J. J. Gibson, and stands in contrast to traditional information as entropy or coding length of the data regardless of its use, and regardless of the nuisance factors affecting it. The non-invertibility of nuisances such as occlusion and quantization induces an \u201cinformation gap\u201d that can only be bridged by controlling the data acquisition process. Measuring visual information entails early vision operations, tailored to the structure of the nuisances so as to be \u201clossless\u201d with respect to visual decision and control tasks (as opposed to data transmission and storage tasks implicit in traditional Information Theory). I illustrate these ideas on visual exploration, whereby a \u201cShannonian Explorer\u201d guided by the entropy of the data navigates unaware of the structure of the physical space surrounding it, while a \u201cGibsonian Explorer\u201d is guided by the topology of the environment, despite measuring only images of it, without performing 3D reconstruction. The operational definition of visual information suggests desirable properties that a visual representation should possess to best accomplish vision-based decision and control tasks."

Each of these techniques constructs a graph such that the minimum cut on the graph also minimizes the energy. Yet, because these graph constructions are complex and highly specific to a particular energy function, graph cuts have seen limited application to date. In this paper, we give a characterization of the energy functions that can be minimized by graph cuts. Our results are restricted to functions of binary variables. However, our work generalizes many previous constructions and is easily applicable to vision problems that involve large numbers of labels, such as stereo, motion, image restoration, and scene reconstruction. We give a precise characterization of what energy functions can be minimized using graph cuts, among the energy functions that can be written as a sum of terms containing three or fewer binary variables. We also provide a general-purpose construction to minimize such an energy function. Finally, we give a necessary condition for any energy function of binary variables to be minimized by graph cuts. Researchers who are considering the use of graph cuts to optimize a particular energy function can use our results to determine if this is possible and then follow our construction to create the appropriate graph. A software implementation is freely available."

This makes medoid shift considerably faster than mean shift, contrarily to what previously believed. We then exploit kernel methods to extend both mean shift and the improved medoid shift to a large family of distances, with complexity bounded by the effective rank of the resulting kernel matrix, and with explicit regularization constraints. Finally, we show that, under certain conditions, medoid shift fails to cluster data points belonging to the same mode, resulting in over-fragmentation. We propose remedies for this problem, by introducing a novel, simple and extremely efficient clustering algorithm, called quick shift, that explicitly trades off under- and over-fragmentation. Like medoid shift, quick shift operates in non-Euclidean spaces in a straightforward manner. We also show that the accelerated medoid shift can be used to initialize mean shift for increased efficiency. We illustrate our algorithms to clustering data on manifolds, image segmentation, and the automatic discovery of visual categories."
