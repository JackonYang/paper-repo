We formulate the problem as the minimization of an energy measure that combines a smoothness term and a similarity term. The minimization reduces to a dynamic system governed by a set of coupled, first-order differential equations. The dynamic system finds an optimal solution at a coarse scale and then tracks it continuously to a fine scale. Among the major themes in recent work on visual signal matching have been the notions of matching as constrained optimization, of variational surface reconstruction, and of coarse-to-fine matching. Our solution captures these in a precise, succinct, and unified form. Results are presented for one-dimensional signals, a motion sequence, and a stereo pair."

In contrast to traditional, purely geometric models of shape, deformable models are active\u2014their shapes change in response to externally applied forces. We develop a deformable model for 3D shape which has a preference for axial symmetry. Symmetry is represented even though the model does not belong to a parametric shape family such as (generalized) cylinders. Rather, a symmetry-seeking property is designed into internal forces that constrain the deformations of the model. We develop a framework for 3D object reconstruction based on symmetry-seeking models. Instances of these models are formed from monocular image data through the action of external forces derived from the data. The forces proposed in this paper deform the model in space so that the shape of its projection into the image plane is consistent with the 2D silhouette of an object of interest. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated using natural images."

The relations between this representation of the minimization problem and a dynamic programming approach are discussed, showing that the graph search method can lead to substantial improvements in computing time. Moreover, if heuristic search methods are used, the computing time will depend on the amount of noise in the picture. Some experimental results are given; these show how various information about the shape of the contour of an object can be embedded in the figure of merit, thus allowing the extraction of contours from noisy pictures and the separation of touching objects."

Through regularization, they may be reformulated as well-posed variational principles whose solutions are computable. Standard regularization theory employs quadratic stabilizing functionals that impose global smoothness constraints on possible solutions. Discontinuities present serious difficulties to standard regularization, however, since their reconstruction requires a precise spatial control over the smoothing properties of stabilizers. This paper proposes a general class of controlled-continuity stabilizers which provide the necessary control over smoothness. These nonquadratic stabilizing functionals comprise multiple generalized spline kernels combined with (noncontinuous) continuity control functions. In the context of computational vision, they may be thought of as controlled-continuity constraints. These generic constraints are applicable to visual reconstruction problems that involve both continuous regions and discontinuities, for which global smoothness constraints fail."

(1) Intensity changes, which occur in a natural image over a wide range of scales, are detected separately at different scales. An appropriate filter for this purpose at a given scale is found to be the second derivative of a Gaussian, and it is shown that, provided some simple conditions are satisfied, these primary filters need not be orientation-dependent. Thus, intensity changes at a given scale are best detected by finding the zero values of \u22072G(x, y)* I(x, y) for image I, where G(x, y) is a two-dimensional Gaussian distribution and \u22072 is the Laplacian. The intensity changes thus discovered in each of the channels are then represented by oriented primitives called zero-crossing segments, and evidence is given that this representation is complete. (2) Intensity changes in images arise from surface discontinuities or from reflectance or illumination boundaries, and these all have the property that they are spatially localized. Because of this, the zero-crossing segments from the different channels are not independent, and rules are deduced for combining them into a description of the image. This description is called the raw primal sketch. The theory explains several basic psychophysical findings, and the operation of forming oriented zero-crossing segments from the output of centre-surround \u22072G filters acting on the image forms the basis for a physiological model of simple cells (see Marr & Ullman 1979)."

There are nine labels associated with each image point, eight labels indicating line segments at various orientations and one indicating the no-line case. Attached to each label is a probability. In the relaxation process, interaction takes place among the probabilities at neighboring points. This permits line segments in compatible orientations to strengthen one another, and incompatible segments to weaken one another. Similarly, no-line labels are reinforced by neighboring no-line labels and weakened by appropriately oriented line labels. This process converges, in only a few iterations, to a condition in which points lying on long curves have achieved high line probabilities, while other points have high no-line probabilities, There is some tendency, under this process, for curves to thicken; however, a thinning procedure can be incorporated to counteract this. The process is effective even for curves of low contrast, and even when many curves lie close to one another."

A description of this movement is not provided to our visual system directly, however; it must be inferred from the pattern of changing intensity that reaches the eye. This paper examines the problem of motion measurement, which we formulate as the computation of an instantaneous two-dimensional velocity field from the changing image. Initial measurements of motion take place at the location of significant intensity changes. These measurements provide only one component of local velocity, and must be integrated to compute the two-dimensional velocity field. A fundamental problem for this integration stage is that the velocity field is not determined uniquely from information available in the changing image. We formulate an additional constraint of smoothness of the velocity field, based on the physical assumption that surfaces are generally smooth, which allows the computation of a unique velocity field. A theoretical analysis of the conditions under which this computation yields the correct velocity field suggests that the solution is physically plausible. Empirical studies show the predictions of this computation to be consistent with human motion perception."

The algorithm consists of five steps: (1) Each image is filtered at different orientations with bar masks of four sizes that increase with eccentricity; the equivalent filters are one or two octaves wide. (2) Zero-crossings in the filtered images, which roughly correspond to edges, are localized. Positions of the ends of lines and edges are also found. (3) For each mask orientation and size, matching takes place between pairs of zero-crossings or terminations of the same sign in the two images, for a range of disparities up to about the width of the mask\u2019s central region. (4) Wide masks can control vergence movements, thus causing small masks to come into correspondence. (5) When a correspondence is achieved, it is stored in a dynamic buffer, called the 2\u00bd-D sketch. It is shown that this proposal provides a theoretical framework for most existing psychophysical and neurophysiological data about stereopsis. Several critical experimental predictions are also made, for instance about the size of Panum\u2019s area under various conditions. The results of such experiments would tell us whether, for example, co-operativity is necessary for the matching process."

The foim of the solution derives from a number of premises, one of which Ullman calls \u201cthe locality hypothesis\u201d. \u2018Ihis is \u201cbased in part on cxpcrimcntal obscrvntions, and partly on a theoretical consideration\u201d ([I 51 ~2). \u2018I\u2019hc \u201ccxpcrimcntal observation\u201d rcfcrrcd to is the following: suppose that A\u2019 is a point near A on the filled-in contour AB as shown in Figure 1. If the process by which AB was constructed is applied to A\u2019B, it is claimed that it gcneratcs the portion of AJ3, bctwccn A\u2019 and B. Let us call this property \u201ccxtcnsibility\u201d. Ullman argues that cxtcnsibility, togcthcr with the propcrtics of isotropy, smoothness, and having minimal integral curvature, logically entails a solution consisting of two circles which meet smoothly. In the fit11 version of this paper, we analyze the two-cti solution and formulate the condition for minimal integral curvature. This can bc solved by any descent method such as Newton-Raphson. A program has been written which computes the minimum integral curvature two-circle solution given the boundary angles 4, 8, and AB, and which returns as a result the point at which they meet and at which the curvature is discontinuous (the \u2018knot point\u2019). A tortuous version of this simple proof and program recently appcarcd in [13]. We then show by example that the two circle solution is not in fact extensible."

Most processes of early vision such as stereomatching, computation of motion and all the ``structure from\" processes can be regarded as solutions to inverse problems. This common characteristic of early vision can be formalized---{\\it most early vision problems are ``ill-posed problems\" in the sense of Hadamard}. We will show that a mathematical theory developed for regularizing ill-posed problems leads in a natural way to the solution of early vision problems in terms of variational principles of a certain class. This is a new theoretical framework for some of the variational solutions already obtained in the analysis of early vision processes. It also shows how several other problems in early vision can be approached and solved."
