One method assigns a probability to each production associated with G and the other assigns the probabilities on the basis of particular features of the language. Several necessary conditions that must be satisfied by these probability assignment techniques if they are to be consistant are presented. The problem of recognizing languages is also considered. It is shown that under some conditions it is possible to recognize a non finitestate language with a finite state acceptor if one is willing to accept a small probability of making an error."

                "text": "From the Preface (See Front Matter for full Preface) \n \nThe study of formal languages constitutes an important subarea of computer science. This area sprang to life around 1956 when Noam Chomsky gave a mathematical model of a grammar in connection with his study of natural languages. Shortly afterwards, the concept of a grammar was found to be of great importance to the programmer when the syntax of the programming language ALGOL was defined by a context-free grammar. This development led naturally to syntax-directed compiling and the concept of a compiler compiler. Since then a considerable flurry of activity has taken place, the results of which have related formal languages and automata theory to such an extent that it is impossible to treat the areas separately. By now, no serious study of computer science would be complete without a knowledge of the techniques and results from language and automata theory. \n \nThis book presents the theory of formal languages as a coherent theory and makes explicit its relationship to automata. The book begins with an explanation of the notion of a finite description of a language. The fundamental descriptive device--the grammar--is explained, as well as its three major subclasses--regular, context-free, and context-sensitive grammars. The context-free grammars are treated in detail, and such topics as normal forms, derivation trees, and ambiguity are covered. Four types of automata equivalent to the four types of grammars are described. These automata are the finite automaton, the pushdown automaton, the linear bounded automaton, and the Turing machine. The Turing machine is covered in detail, and unsolvability of the halting problem shown. The book concludes with certain advanced topics in language theory--closure properties, computational complexity, deterministic pushdown automata, LR(k) grammars, stack automata, and decidability."
