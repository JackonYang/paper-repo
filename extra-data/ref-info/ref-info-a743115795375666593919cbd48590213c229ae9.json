Our construction is based on localized frequency analysis (a generalization of the windowed Fourier transform to manifolds) that is used to extract the local behavior of some dense intrinsic descriptor, roughly acting as an analogy to patches in images. The resulting local frequency representations are then passed through a bank of filters whose coefficient are determined by a learning procedure minimizing a task\u2010specific cost. Our approach generalizes several previous methods such as HKS, WKS, spectral CNN, and GPS embeddings. Experimental results show that the proposed approach allows learning class\u2010specific shape descriptors significantly outperforming recent state\u2010of\u2010the\u2010art methods on standard benchmarks."

In particular, we propose two constructions, one based upon a hierarchical clustering of the domain, and another based on the spectrum of the graph Laplacian. We show through experiments that for low-dimensional graphs it is possible to learn convolutional layers with a number of parameters independent of the input size, resulting in efficient deep architectures."

For example, they have been successfully employed in correspondence, registration, and retrieval tasks. In recent years, significant attention has been devoted to descriptors obtained from the spectral decomposition of the Laplace-Beltrami operator associated with the shape. Notable examples in this family are the heat kernel signature (HKS) and the recently introduced wave kernel signature (WKS). The Laplacian-based descriptors achieve state-of-the-art performance in numerous shape analysis tasks; they are computationally efficient, isometry-invariant by construction, and can gracefully cope with a variety of transformations. In this paper, we formulate a generic family of parametric spectral descriptors. We argue that to be optimized for a specific task, the descriptor should take into account the statistics of the corpus of shapes to which it is applied (the \"signal\") and those of the class of transformations to which it is made insensitive (the \"noise\"). While such statistics are hard to model axiomatically, they can be learned from examples. Following the spirit of the Wiener filter in signal processing, we show a learning scheme for the construction of optimized spectral descriptors and relate it to Mahalanobis metric learning. The superiority of the proposed approach in generating correspondences is demonstrated on synthetic and scanned human figures. We also show that the learned descriptors are robust enough to be learned on synthetic data and transferred successfully to scanned shapes."

We generalize to surfaces the polar sampling of the image domain used in shape contexts: for this purpose, we chart the surface by shooting geodesic outwards from the point being analyzed; `angle' is treated as tantamount to geodesic shooting direction, and radius as geodesic distance. To deal with orientation ambiguity, we exploit properties of the Fourier transform. Our charting method is intrinsic, i.e., invariant to isometric shape transformations. The resulting descriptor is a meta-descriptor that can be applied to any photometric or geometric property field defined on the shape, in particular, we can leverage recent developments in intrinsic shape analysis and construct ISC based on state-of-the-art dense shape descriptors such as heat kernel signatures. Our experiments demonstrate a notable improvement in shape matching on standard benchmarks."

The covariance of d-features, e.g., the three-dimensional color vector, the norm of first and second derivatives of intensity with respect to x and y, etc., characterizes a region of interest. We describe a fast method for computation of covariances based on integral images. The idea presented here is more general than the image sums or histograms, which were already published before, and with a series of integral images the covariances are obtained by a few arithmetic operations. Covariance matrices do not lie on Euclidean space, therefore we use a distance metric involving generalized eigenvalues which also follows from the Lie group structure of positive definite matrices. Feature matching is a simple nearest neighbor search under the distance metric and performed extremely rapidly using the integral images. The performance of the covariance features is superior to other methods, as it is shown, and large rotations and illumination changes are also absorbed by the covariance matrix."

For this purpose we explore a siamese architecture of Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), with a Hinge embedding loss on the L2 distance between descriptors. Since a siamese architecture uses pairs rather than single image patches to train, there exist a large number of positive samples and an exponential number of negative samples. We propose to explore this space with a stochastic sampling of the training set, in combination with an aggressive mining strategy over both the positive and negative samples which we denote as \"fracking\". We perform a thorough evaluation of the architecture hyper-parameters, and demonstrate large performance gains compared to both standard CNN learning strategies, hand-crafted image descriptors like SIFT, and the state-of-the-art on learned descriptors: up to 2.5x vs SIFT and 1.5x vs the state-of-the-art in terms of the area under the curve (AUC) of the Precision-Recall curve."

Unlike the majority of existing techniques that assume a deformation model, such as intrinsic isometries, a priori and use a pre-defined set of point or part descriptors, we consider the problem of learning a correspondence model given a collection of reference pairs with known mappings between them. Our formulation is purely intrinsic and does not rely on a consistent parametrization or spatial positions of vertices on the shapes. Instead, we consider the problem of finding the optimal set of descriptors that can be jointly used to reproduce the given reference maps. We show how this problem can be formalized and solved for efficiently by using the recently proposed functional maps framework. Moreover, we demonstrate how to extract the functional subspaces that can be mapped reliably across shapes. This gives us a way to not only obtain better functional correspondences, but also to associate a confidence value to the different parts of the mappings. We demonstrate the efficiency and usefulness of the proposedapproach on a variety of challenging shape matching tasks."

In a scenario where this class is represented by a small set of example shapes, the proposed method learns a shape descriptor capturing the variability of the deformations in the given class. The approach enables the wave kernel signature to extend the class of recognized deformations from near isometries to the deformations appearing in the example set by means of a random forest classifier. With the help of the introduced spatial regularization, the proposed method achieves significant improvements over the baseline approach and obtains state-of-the-art results while keeping short computation times."

Key to our approach is a generalization of the notion of map that puts in correspondence real-valued functions rather than points on the shapes. By choosing a multi-scale basis for the function space on each shape, such as the eigenfunctions of its Laplace-Beltrami operator, we obtain a representation of a map that is very compact, yet fully suitable for global inference. Perhaps more remarkably, most natural constraints on a map, such as descriptor preservation, landmark correspondences, part preservation and operator commutativity become linear in this formulation. Moreover, the representation naturally supports certain algebraic operations such as map sum, difference and composition, and enables a number of applications, such as function or annotation transfer without establishing point-to-point correspondences. We exploit these properties to devise an efficient shape matching method, at the core of which is a single linear solve. The new method achieves state-of-the-art results on an isometric shape matching benchmark. We also show how this representation can be used to improve the quality of maps produced by existing shape matching methods, and illustrate its usefulness in segmentation transfer and joint analysis of shape collections."

While such integral invariants enjoy some of the desirable properties of their differential counterparts, such as locality of computation (which allows matching under occlusions) and uniqueness of representation (asymptotically), they do not exhibit the noise sensitivity associated with differential quantities and, therefore, do not require presmoothing of the input shape. Our formulation allows the analysis of shapes at multiple scales. Based on integral invariants, we define a notion of distance between shapes. The proposed distance measure can be computed efficiently and allows warping the shape boundaries onto each other; its computation results in optimal point correspondence as an intermediate step. Numerical results on shape matching demonstrate that this framework can match shapes despite the deformation of subparts, missing parts and noise. As a quantitative analysis, we report matching scores for shape retrieval from a database"

These methods allow representing images as collections of \u201cvisual words\u201d and treat them using text search approaches following the \u201cbag of features\u201d paradigm. In this article, we explore analogous approaches in the 3D world applied to the problem of nonrigid shape retrieval in large databases. Using multiscale diffusion heat kernels as \u201cgeometric words,\u201d we construct compact and informative shape descriptors by means of the \u201cbag of features\u201d approach. We also show that considering pairs of \u201cgeometric words\u201d (\u201cgeometric expressions\u201d) allows creating spatially sensitive bags of features with better discriminative power. Finally, adopting metric learning approaches, we show that shapes can be efficiently represented as binary codes. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on the SHREC 2010 large-scale shape retrieval benchmark."

These deformations are more general than the often assumed isometries, and we use labeled training data to learn optimal descriptors for such cases. Furthermore, instead of explicitly defining the descriptor, we introduce new Mercer kernels, for which we formally show that their corresponding feature space mapping is a generalization of either the Heat Kernel Signature or the Wave Kernel Signature. I.e. the proposed descriptors are guaranteed to be at least as precise as any Heat Kernel Signature or Wave Kernel Signature of any parameterisation. In experiments, we show that our implicitly defined, infinite-dimensional descriptors can better deal with non-isometric deformations than state-of-the-art methods."

Our main contribution is a thorough evaluation of networks of increasing depth using an architecture with very small (3x3) convolution filters, which shows that a significant improvement on the prior-art configurations can be achieved by pushing the depth to 16-19 weight layers. These findings were the basis of our ImageNet Challenge 2014 submission, where our team secured the first and the second places in the localisation and classification tracks respectively. We also show that our representations generalise well to other datasets, where they achieve state-of-the-art results. We have made our two best-performing ConvNet models publicly available to facilitate further research on the use of deep visual representations in computer vision."

We provide methods and tools to detect and describe features on surfaces equiped with scalar functions, such as photometric information. This is motivated by the growing need for matching and tracking photometric surfaces over temporal sequences, due to recent advancements in multiple camera 3D reconstruction. We propose a 3D feature detector (MeshDOG) and a 3D feature descriptor (MeshHOG) for uniformly triangulated meshes, invariant to changes in rotation, translation, and scale. The descriptor is able to capture the local geometric and/or photometric properties in a succinct fashion. Moreover, the method is defined generically for any scalar function, e.g., local curvature. Results with matching rigid and non-rigid meshes demonstrate the interest of the proposed framework."

Many content\u2010based shape retrieval approaches follow the bag\u2010of\u2010features (BoF) paradigm commonly used in text and image retrieval by first computing local shape descriptors, and then representing them in a \u2018geometric dictionary\u2019 using vector quantization. A major drawback of such approaches is that the dictionary is constructed in an unsupervised manner using clustering, unaware of the last stage of the process (pooling of the local descriptors into a BoF, and comparison of the latter using some metric). In this paper, we replace the clustering with dictionary learning, where every atom acts as a feature, followed by sparse coding and pooling to get the final BoF descriptor. Both the dictionary and the sparse codes can be learned in the supervised regime via bi\u2010level optimization using a task\u2010specific objective that promotes invariance desired in the specific application. We show significant performance improvement on several standard shape retrieval benchmarks."

We also introduce a novel deep learning approach to localization by learning to predict object boundaries. Bounding boxes are then accumulated rather than suppressed in order to increase detection confidence. We show that different tasks can be learned simultaneously using a single shared network. This integrated framework is the winner of the localization task of the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge 2013 (ILSVRC2013) and obtained very competitive results for the detection and classifications tasks. In post-competition work, we establish a new state of the art for the detection task. Finally, we release a feature extractor from our best model called OverFeat."

On the test data, we achieved top-1 and top-5 error rates of 37.5% and 17.0%, respectively, which is considerably better than the previous state-of-the-art. The neural network, which has 60 million parameters and 650,000 neurons, consists of five convolutional layers, some of which are followed by max-pooling layers, and three fully connected layers with a final 1000-way softmax. To make training faster, we used non-saturating neurons and a very efficient GPU implementation of the convolution operation. To reduce overfitting in the fully connected layers we employed a recently developed regularization method called \"dropout\" that proved to be very effective. We also entered a variant of this model in the ILSVRC-2012 competition and achieved a winning top-5 test error rate of 15.3%, compared to 26.2% achieved by the second-best entry."

We address this question in the context of learning to recognize 3D shapes from a collection of their rendered views on 2D images. We first present a standard CNN architecture trained to recognize the shapes' rendered views independently of each other, and show that a 3D shape can be recognized even from a single view at an accuracy far higher than using state-of-the-art 3D shape descriptors. Recognition rates further increase when multiple views of the shapes are provided. In addition, we present a novel CNN architecture that combines information from multiple views of a 3D shape into a single and compact shape descriptor offering even better recognition performance. The same architecture can be applied to accurately recognize human hand-drawn sketches of shapes. We conclude that a collection of 2D views can be highly informative for 3D shape recognition and is amenable to emerging CNN architectures and their derivatives."

A challenging aspect of this problem is to find a suitable shape signature that can be constructed and compared quickly, while still discriminating between similar and dissimilar shapes.In this paper, we propose and analyze a method for computing shape signatures for arbitrary (possibly degenerate) 3D polygonal models. The key idea is to represent the signature of an object as a shape distribution sampled from a shape function measuring global geometric properties of an object. The primary motivation for this approach is to reduce the shape matching problem to the comparison of probability distributions, which is simpler than traditional shape matching methods that require pose registration, feature correspondence, or model fitting.We find that the dissimilarities between sampled distributions of simple shape functions (e.g., the distance between two random points on a surface) provide a robust method for discriminating between classes of objects (e.g., cars versus airplanes) in a moderately sized database, despite the presence of arbitrary translations, rotations, scales, mirrors, tessellations, simplifications, and model degeneracies. They can be evaluated quickly, and thus the proposed method could be applied as a pre-classifier in a complete shape-based retrieval or analysis system concerned with finding similar whole objects. The paper describes our early experiences using shape distributions for object classification and for interactive web-based retrieval of 3D models."

Our approach is based on the observation that efficient methods exist to search for nearly isometric maps (e.g., M\u00f6bius Voting or Heat Kernel Maps), but no single solution found with these methods provides low-distortion everywhere for pairs of surfaces differing by large deformations. To address this problem, we suggest using a weighted combination of these maps to produce a \"blended map.\" This approach enables algorithms that leverage efficient search procedures, yet can provide the flexibility to handle large deformations. The main challenges of this approach lie in finding a set of candidate maps {mi} and their associated blending weights {bi(p)} for every point p on the surface. We address these challenges specifically for conformal maps by making the following contributions. First, we provide a way to blend maps, defining the image of p as the weighted geodesic centroid of mi(p). Second, we provide a definition for smooth blending weights at every point p that are proportional to the area preservation of mi at p. Third, we solve a global optimization problem that selects candidate maps based both on their area preservation and consistency with other selected maps. During experiments with these methods, we find that our algorithm produces blended maps that align semantic features better than alternative approaches over a variety of data sets."

Although several methods have been proposed to optimize parameters for graph matching in a way to promote correct correspondences and to restrict wrong ones, our approach is novel in the sense that it aims at improving performance in the more general task of object detection. In our formulation, similarity functions are adjusted so as to increase the overall similarity among a reference model and the observed target, and at the same time reduce the similarity among reference and \"non-target\" objects. We evaluate the proposed method in two challenging scenarios, namely object detection using data captured with a Kinect sensor in a real environment, and intrinsic metric learning for deformable shapes, demonstrating substantial improvements in both settings."

The key algorithmic problem here is that of finding pointwise correspondences between an image shape and a stored prototype shape. We introduce a new shape descriptor, the shape context, which makes this possible, using a simple and robust algorithm. The shape context at a point captures the distribution over relative positions of other shape points and thus summarizes global shape in a rich, local descriptor. We demonstrate that shape contexts greatly simplify recovery of correspondences between points of two given shapes. Once shapes are aligned, shape contexts are used to define a robust score for measuring shape similarity. We have used this score in a nearest-neighbor classifier for recognition of hand written digits as well as 3D objects, using exactly the same distance function. On the benchmark MNIST dataset of handwritten digits, this yields an error rate of 0.63%, outperforming other published techniques."

We present a method to construct a bending invariant signature for such surfaces. This invariant representation is an embedding of the geometric structure of the surface in a small dimensional Euclidean space in which geodesic distances are approximated by Euclidean ones. The bending invariant representation is constructed by first measuring the intergeodesic distances between uniformly distributed points on the surface. Next, a multidimensional scaling technique is applied to extract coordinates in a finite dimensional Euclidean space in which geodesic distances are replaced by Euclidean ones. Applying this transform to various surfaces with similar geodesic structures (first fundamental form) maps them into similar signature surfaces. We thereby translate the problem of matching nonrigid objects in various postures into a simpler problem of matching rigid objects. As an example, we show a simple surface classification method that uses our bending invariant signatures."

With the recent availability of inexpensive 2.5D depth sensors (e.g. Microsoft Kinect), it is becoming increasingly important to have a powerful 3D shape model in the loop. Apart from object recognition on 2.5D depth maps, recovering these incomplete 3D shapes to full 3D is critical for analyzing shape variations. To this end, we propose to represent a geometric 3D shape as a probability distribution of binary variables on a 3D voxel grid, using a Convolutional Deep Belief Network. Our model, 3D ShapeNets, learns the distribution of complex 3D shapes across different object categories and arbitrary poses. It naturally supports joint object recognition and shape reconstruction from 2.5D depth maps, and further, as an additional application it allows active object recognition through view planning. We construct a largescale 3D CAD model dataset to train our model, and conduct extensive experiments to study our new representation."

This is necessary to efficiently map 3D brain structure and connectivity. To segment biological neuron membranes, we use a special type of deep artificial neural network as a pixel classifier. The label of each pixel (membrane or non-membrane) is predicted from raw pixel values in a square window centered on it. The input layer maps each window pixel to a neuron. It is followed by a succession of convolutional and max-pooling layers which preserve 2D information and extract features with increasing levels of abstraction. The output layer produces a calibrated probability for each class. The classifier is trained by plain gradient descent on a 512 \u00d7 512 \u00d7 30 stack with known ground truth, and tested on a stack of the same size (ground truth unknown to the authors) by the organizers of the ISBI 2012 EM Segmentation Challenge. Even without problem-specific postprocessing, our approach outperforms competing techniques by a large margin in all three considered metrics, i.e. rand error, warping error and pixel error. For pixel error, our approach is the only one outperforming a second human observer."

With the recent availability of inexpensive 2.5D depth sensors (e.g. Microsoft Kinect), it is becoming increasingly important to have a powerful 3D shape model in the loop. Apart from object recognition on 2.5D depth maps, recovering these incomplete 3D shapes to full 3D is critical for analyzing shape variations. To this end, we propose to represent a geometric 3D shape as a probability distribution of binary variables on a 3D voxel grid, using a Convolutional Deep Belief Network. Our model, 3D ShapeNets, learns the distribution of complex 3D shapes across different object categories and arbitrary poses. It naturally supports joint object recognition and shape reconstruction from 2.5D depth maps, and further, as an additional application it allows active object recognition through view planning. We construct a largescale 3D CAD model dataset to train our model, and conduct extensive experiments to study our new representation."

After reviewing existing edge and gradient based descriptors, we show experimentally that grids of histograms of oriented gradient (HOG) descriptors significantly outperform existing feature sets for human detection. We study the influence of each stage of the computation on performance, concluding that fine-scale gradients, fine orientation binning, relatively coarse spatial binning, and high-quality local contrast normalization in overlapping descriptor blocks are all important for good results. The new approach gives near-perfect separation on the original MIT pedestrian database, so we introduce a more challenging dataset containing over 1800 annotated human images with a large range of pose variations and backgrounds."

For instance, computing a parameterization of an object helps attaching information to it and converting between various representations. More generally, this family of problems may be thought of in terms of constructing structured function bases attached to surfaces. In this paper, we study a specific type of hierarchical function bases, defined by the eigenfunctions of the Laplace-Beltrami operator. When applied to a sphere, this function basis corresponds to the classical spherical harmonics. On more general objects, this defines a function basis well adapted to the geometry and the topology of the object. Based on physical analogies (vibration modes), we first give an intuitive view before explaining the underlying theory. We then explain in practice how to compute an approximation of the eigenfunctions of a differential operator, and show possible applications in geometry processing"

A new set of image elements that are put into correspondence, the so called extremal regions, is introduced. Extremal regions possess highly desirable properties: the set is closed under 1. continuous (and thus projective) transformation of image coordinates and 2. monotonic transformation of image intensities. An efficient (near linear complexity) and practically fast detection algorithm (near frame rate) is presented for an affinely-invariant stable subset of extremal regions, the maximally stable extremal regions (MSER). A new robust similarity measure for establishing tentative correspondences is proposed. The robustness ensures that invariants from multiple measurement regions (regions obtained by invariant constructions from extremal regions), some that are significantly larger (and hence discriminative) than the MSERs, may be used to establish tentative correspondences. The high utility of MSERs, multiple measurement regions and the robust metric is demonstrated in wide-baseline experiments on image pairs from both indoor and outdoor scenes. Significant change of scale (3.5\u00d7), illumination conditions, out-of-plane rotation, occlusion , locally anisotropic scale change and 3D translation of the viewpoint are all present in the test problems. Good estimates of epipolar geometry (average distance from corresponding points to the epipolar line below 0.09 of the inter-pixel distance) are obtained."

We take an object recognition approach, designing an intermediate body parts representation that maps the difficult pose estimation problem into a simpler per-pixel classification problem. Our large and highly varied training dataset allows the classifier to estimate body parts invariant to pose, body shape, clothing, etc. Finally we generate confidence-scored 3D proposals of several body joints by reprojecting the classification result and finding local modes. The system runs at 200 frames per second on consumer hardware. Our evaluation shows high accuracy on both synthetic and real test sets, and investigates the effect of several training parameters. We achieve state of the art accuracy in our comparison with related work and demonstrate improved generalization over exact whole-skeleton nearest neighbor matching."

The key advantages of this approach is that it is tunable through a few intuitive parameters and is stable under near-isometric deformations. Indeed the method comes with feedback on the stability of the number of segments in the form of a persistence diagram. There are also spatial guarantees on part of the segments. Finally, we present an extension to the method which first detects regions which are inherently unstable and segments them separately. Both approaches are reasonably scalable and come with strong guarantees. We show numerous examples and a comparison with the segmentation benchmark and the curvature function."

The need to study such shapes and model their behavior arises in a wide spectrum of applications, ranging from medicine to security. In recent years, non-rigid shapes have attracted growing interest, which has led to rapid development of the field, where state-of-the-art results from very different sciences - theoretical and numerical geometry, optimization, linear algebra, graph theory, machine learning and computer graphics, to mention several - are applied to find solutions. This book gives an overview of the current state of science in analysis and synthesis of non-rigid shapes. Everyday examples are used to explain concepts and to illustrate different techniques. The presentation unfolds systematically and numerous figures enrich the engaging exposition. Practice problems follow at the end of each chapter, with detailed solutions to selected problems in the appendix. A gallery of colored images enhances the text. This book will be of interest to graduate students, researchers and professionals in different fields of mathematics, computer science and engineering. It may be used for courses in computer vision, numerical geometry and geometric modeling and computer graphics or for self-study."

Our approach leverages datasets of images and their sentence descriptions to learn about the inter-modal correspondences between language and visual data. Our alignment model is based on a novel combination of Convolutional Neural Networks over image regions, bidirectional Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) over sentences, and a structured objective that aligns the two modalities through a multimodal embedding. We then describe a Multimodal Recurrent Neural Network architecture that uses the inferred alignments to learn to generate novel descriptions of image regions. We demonstrate that our alignment model produces state of the art results in retrieval experiments on Flickr8K, Flickr30K and MSCOCO datasets. We then show that the generated descriptions outperform retrieval baselines on both full images and on a new dataset of region-level annotations. Finally, we conduct large-scale analysis of our RNN language model on the Visual Genome dataset of 4.1 million captions and highlight the differences between image and region-level caption statistics."

Our starting point is a combination of log-polar sampling and spatially-varying smoothing that converts image scalings and rotations into translations. Scale invariance can then be guaranteed by estimating the Fourier transform modulus (FTM) of the formed signal as the FTM is translation invariant. We build our descriptors using phase, orientation and amplitude features that compactly capture the local image structure. Our results show that the constructed SIDs outperform state-of-the-art descriptors on standard datasets. A main advantage of SIDs is that they are applicable to a broader range of image structures, such as edges, for which scale selection is unreliable. We demonstrate this by combining SIDs with contour segments and show that the performance of a boundary-based model is systematically improved on an object detection task."

The WKS represents the average probability of measuring a quantum mechanical particle at a specific location. By letting vary the energy of the particle, the WKS encodes and separates information from various different Laplace eigenfrequencies. This clear scale separation makes the WKS well suited for a large variety of applications. Both theoretically and in quantitative experiments we demonstrate that the WKS is substantially more discriminative and therefore allows for better feature matching than the commonly used Heat Kernel Signature (HKS). As an application of the WKS in shape analysis we show results on shape matching."

The network is self-organized by \u201clearning without a teacher\u201d, and acquires an ability to recognize stimulus patterns based on the geometrical similarity (Gestalt) of their shapes without affected by their positions. This network is given a nickname \u201cneocognitron\u201d. After completion of self-organization, the network has a structure similar to the hierarchy model of the visual nervous system proposed by Hubel and Wiesel. The network consits of an input layer (photoreceptor array) followed by a cascade connection of a number of modular structures, each of which is composed of two layers of cells connected in a cascade. The first layer of each module consists of \u201cS-cells\u201d, which show characteristics similar to simple cells or lower order hypercomplex cells, and the second layer consists of \u201cC-cells\u201d similar to complex cells or higher order hypercomplex cells. The afferent synapses to each S-cell have plasticity and are modifiable. The network has an ability of unsupervised learning: We do not need any \u201cteacher\u201d during the process of self-organization, and it is only needed to present a set of stimulus patterns repeatedly to the input layer of the network. The network has been simulated on a digital computer. After repetitive presentation of a set of stimulus patterns, each stimulus pattern has become to elicit an output only from one of the C-cell of the last layer, and conversely, this C-cell has become selectively responsive only to that stimulus pattern. That is, none of the C-cells of the last layer responds to more than one stimulus pattern. The response of the C-cells of the last layer is not affected by the pattern's position at all. Neither is it affected by a small change in shape nor in size of the stimulus pattern."

Our signature, called the Heat Kernel Signature (or HKS), is obtained by restricting the well\u2010known heat kernel to the temporal domain. Remarkably we show that under certain mild assumptions, HKS captures all of the information contained in the heat kernel, and characterizes the shape up to isometry. This means that the restriction to the temporal domain, on the one hand, makes HKS much more concise and easily commensurable, while on the other hand, it preserves all of the information about the intrinsic geometry of the shape. In addition, HKS inherits many useful properties from the heat kernel, which means, in particular, that it is stable under perturbations of the shape. Our signature also provides a natural and efficiently computable multi\u2010scale way to capture information about neighborhoods of a given point, which can be extremely useful in many applications. To demonstrate the practical relevance of our signature, we present several methods for non\u2010rigid multi\u2010scale matching based on the HKS and use it to detect repeated structure within the same shape and across a collection of shapes."

We use multiple instance learning to train visual detectors for words that commonly occur in captions, including many different parts of speech such as nouns, verbs, and adjectives. The word detector outputs serve as conditional inputs to a maximum-entropy language model. The language model learns from a set of over 400,000 image descriptions to capture the statistics of word usage. We capture global semantics by re-ranking caption candidates using sentence-level features and a deep multimodal similarity model. Our system is state-of-the-art on the official Microsoft COCO benchmark, producing a BLEU-4 score of 29.1%. When human judges compare the system captions to ones written by other people on our held-out test set, the system captions have equal or better quality 34% of the time."

The spin image is a data level shape descriptor that is used to match surfaces represented as surface meshes. We present a compression scheme for spin images that results in efficient multiple object recognition which we verify with results showing the simultaneous recognition of multiple objects from a library of 20 models. Furthermore, we demonstrate the robust performance of recognition in the presence of clutter and occlusion through analysis of recognition trials on 100 scenes."

Surface registration is important for building full 3D models from partial scans, creating statistical shape models, shape retrieval, and tracking. The problem is particularly challenging for non-rigid and articulated objects like human bodies. While the challenges of real-world data registration are not present in existing synthetic datasets, establishing ground-truth correspondences for real 3D scans is difficult. We address this with a novel mesh registration technique that combines 3D shape and appearance information to produce high-quality alignments. We define a new dataset called FAUST that contains 300 scans of 10 people in a wide range of poses together with an evaluation methodology. To achieve accurate registration, we paint the subjects with high-frequency textures and use an extensive validation process to ensure accurate ground truth. We find that current shape registration methods have trouble with this real-world data. The dataset and evaluation website are available for research purposes at http://faust.is.tue.mpg.de."

The method dynamically adapts over time using only first order information and has minimal computational overhead beyond vanilla stochastic gradient descent. The method requires no manual tuning of a learning rate and appears robust to noisy gradient information, different model architecture choices, various data modalities and selection of hyperparameters. We show promising results compared to other methods on the MNIST digit classification task using a single machine and on a large scale voice dataset in a distributed cluster environment."

The algorithm is based on a novel, artificial neural network, called a \"Siamese\" neural network. This network consists of two identical sub-networks joined at their outputs. During training the two sub-networks extract features from two signatures, while the joining neuron measures the distance between the two feature vectors. Verification consists of comparing an extracted feature vector with a stored feature vector for the signer. Signatures closer to this stored representation than a chosen threshold are accepted, all other signatures are rejected as forgeries."
