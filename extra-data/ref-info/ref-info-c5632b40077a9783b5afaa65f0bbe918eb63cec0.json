The easiest case is when the configurations form the subsets of some finite lattice (thus the state space is finite). In this case we look at the relationships between time-reversibility, nearest neighbour interactions, and the equilibrium state being a Markov random field. A more interesting case is when the entities which can be born or die can do so at any point in some bounded region of space (or the plane). This gives us a pure jump process, whose general properties are well-known, (see for example, Feller (1966) Vol. II Chapter X.3). We examine some particular examples and compute equilibrium distributions."

In practice, the sites may represent points or regions in space and the random variables may be either continuous or discrete. The main statistical objectives are the following: firstly, to provide a means of using the available concomitant information, particularly the configuration of the sites, to attach a plausible probability distribution to the random vector X; secondly, to estimate any unknown parameters in the distribution from the realization x; thirdly, where possible, to quantify the extent of disagreement between hypothesis and observation."

In both cases, the field (iv) is defined onZv, and (v) at anyx\u03b5Zv, takes on one of two states. The current paper shows that a MRF is a GRF and vice versa even when (i)\u2212(v) are relaxed, i.e., even if one relaxes translation invariance, replaces first order bykth order, allows for many states and replaces finite domains of Zv by arbitrary finite sets. This is achieved at the expense of using a many body rather than a pair potential, which turns out to be natural even in the classical (nearest neighbor) case when Zv is replaced by a triangular lattice."

                "text": "Ising lattices model spatial interaction among binary variables, and consequently, are relevant to many scientific disciplines. They are intuitively appealing models because their conditional distributions are given locally (they are Markov fields). On the other hand, their marginal distributions (even for pairs of sites, let alone triples, etc.) are relatively intractable. Indeed, even for the simplest Ising model it is remarkably difficult to obtain the correlation structure (cf. Kaufmann and Onsager (1949), Hurst and Green (1960)). Furthermore, general Ising models are not amenable to direct simulation. Recently, a number of articles have appeared which consider rather specialized binary lattice processes (cf. Bartlett (1967), Besag (1972), Welberry and Galbraith (1973), (1975), Galbraith and Walley (1976), Welberry (1977), Verhagen (1978), Enting (1977), Pickard (1977a)). These models admit direct simulation and have relatively simple marginals. For the most part, however, this work has been rather fragmentary and heuristic. The purpose of the present paper is to report briefly the beginnings of a unified theory (Pickard (1977b)). Proofs are omitted as there is insufficient space. A more detailed account will appear elsewhere."

Hammersley and Clifford [3] proved the same result for the more general case when the domain is the set of sites of an arbitrary finite graph and the number of possible states for each site is finite. In order to show this, they extended the notion of a Gibbs ensemble to embrace more complex interactions than occur on the cubic lattice. Their method was circuitous and showed merely the existence of a potential function for a Markov field with little indication of its form. In [4], Preston gives a more direct approach to the two-state problem and presents an explicit formula for the potential. We show here that the equivalence of Markov fields and Gibbs ensembles follows immediately from a very simple application of the Mobius inversion theorem of [5] which allows us to construct a natural expression for the potential function of a Markov field. We confine our attention to the set of sites of an arbitrary finite graph and allow each site to be in any one of a countable set of states. The two-state solution of Preston emerges as a corollary."

These models are hierarchical models that can be represented by a simple, undirected graph on as many vertices as the dimension of the corresponding table. Further all these models can be given an interpretation in terms of conditional independence and the interpretation can be read directly off the graph in the form of a Markov property. The class of graphical models contains that of decomposable models and we give a simple criterion for decomposability of a given graphical model. To some extent we discuss estimation problems and give suggestions for further work."

My contribution to a conference at Sheffield in 1973 aimed, at least in part, to supply such a review and forms the basis of this monograph; but in these prefatory remarks I must still make clear what I decided to discuss, and what I have omitted. Broadly speaking, the coverage is that included in seminars and lectures I have given on this theme since 1969. We may divide problems of spatial pattern (in contrast with complete random chaos) into (i) detecting departures from randomness, Oi) analysing such departures when detected, for example, in relation to some stochastic model and (iii) special problems which require separate consideration; for example, sophisticated problems of pattern recognition in specific fields, such as the computer reading of handwriting or recognition of chromosomes."

Following introductory chapters on kinetic theory, thermodynamics, the Gibbs ensembles, and the thermodynamic limit, later chapters discuss the classical theories of phase transitions, the Ising model, algebraic methods and combinatorial methods for solving the two-dimensional model in zero field, and some applications of the Ising model to biology. Originally published in 1979. The Princeton Legacy Library uses the latest print-on-demand technology to again make available previously out-of-print books from the distinguished backlist of Princeton University Press. These paperback editions preserve the original texts of these important books while presenting them in durable paperback editions. The goal of the Princeton Legacy Library is to vastly increase access to the rich scholarly heritage found in the thousands of books published by Princeton University Press since its founding in 1905."

Hence, if the critical temperatureTc is defined as the temperature where the spontaneous magnetization (which is a non-increasing function of the temperature) becomes positive, then the equilibrium state is unique forT>Tc and is non-unique forT<Tc (when the external field is zero). This implies that the correlation functions have a cluster property forT>Tc.We also show that for an anti-ferromagnet consisting of two sublattices there is a unique equilibrium state if and only if the staggered magnetization is continuous with respect to a change in the staggered field."
