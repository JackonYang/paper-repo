We consider the so-called the generalized cylindrical surfaces that are wrapped with low-rank textures. They can be used to model most curved building facades in urban areas or deformed book pages scanned for text recognition. Our method leverages on the recent new techniques for low-rank matrix recovery and sparse error correction and it generalizes existing techniques from planar surfaces to a much larger class of important 3D surfaces. As we will show with extensive simulations and experiments, the proposed algorithm can precisely rectify deformation of textures caused by both perspective projection and surface shape. It works for a wide range of symmetric or regular textures that are ubiquitous in images of urban environments, objects, or texts, and it is very robust to sparse occlusion, noise, and saturation."

This new method can work under a wide range of practical scenarios: using multiple images of a known pattern, multiple images of an unknown pattern, single or multiple image(s) of multiple patterns, etc. Moreover, this new method does not rely on extracting any low-level features such as corners or edges. It can tolerate considerably large lens distortion, noise, error, illumination and viewpoint change, and still obtain accurate estimation of the camera parameters. The new method leverages on the recent breakthroughs in powerful high-dimensional convex optimization tools, especially those for matrix rank minimization and sparse signal recovery. We will show how the camera calibration problem can be formulated as an important extension to principal component pursuit, and solved by similar techniques. We characterize to exactly what extent the parameters can be recovered in case of ambiguity. We verify the efficacy and accuracy of the proposed algorithm with extensive experiments on real images."

Instead, we use semi-global or global features based on transform invariant low-rank textures, which are ubiquitous in urban scenes. Modern high-dimensional optimization techniques enable us to accurately and robustly recover precise and consistent camera calibration and scene geometry from single or multiple images of the scene.

Our method seeks an optimal set of image domain transformations such that the matrix of transformed images can be decomposed as the sum of a sparse matrix of errors and a low-rank matrix of recovered aligned images. We reduce this extremely challenging optimization problem to a sequence of convex programs that minimize the sum of \u21131-norm and nuclear norm of the two component matrices, which can be efficiently solved by scalable convex optimization techniques with guaranteed fast convergence. We verify the efficacy of the proposed robust alignment algorithm with extensive experiments with both controlled and uncontrolled real data, demonstrating higher accuracy and efficiency than existing methods over a wide range of realistic misalignments and corruptions."

Such natural textures arise from spatial variation of two surface attributes: (1) reflectance and (2) surface normal. In this paper, we provide a unified model to address both these aspects of natural texture. The main idea is to construct a vocabulary of prototype tiny surface patches with associated local geometric and photometric properties. We call these 3D textons. Examples might be ridges, grooves, spots or stripes or combinations thereof. Associated with each texton is an appearance vector, which characterizes the local irradiance distribution, represented as a set of linear Gaussian derivative filter outputs, under different lighting and viewing conditions.Given a large collection of images of different materials, a clustering approach is used to acquire a small (on the order of 100) 3D texton vocabulary. Given a few (1 to 4) images of any material, it can be characterized using these textons. We demonstrate the application of this representation for recognition of the material viewed under novel lighting and viewing conditions. We also illustrate how the 3D texton model can be used to predict the appearance of materials under novel conditions."

                "text": "If a physical object has a smooth or piecewise smooth boundary, its images obtained by cameras in varying positions undergo smooth apparent deformations. These deformations are locally well approximated by affine transforms of the image plane. In consequence the solid object recognition problem has often been led back to the computation of affine invariant image local features. Such invariant features could be obtained by normalization methods, but no fully affine normalization method exists for the time being. Even scale invariance is dealt with rigorously only by the scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) method. By simulating zooms out and normalizing translation and rotation, SIFT is invariant to four out of the six parameters of an affine transform. The method proposed in this paper, affine-SIFT (ASIFT), simulates all image views obtainable by varying the two camera axis orientation parameters, namely, the latitude and the longitude angles, left over by the SIFT method. Then it covers the other four parameters by using the SIFT method itself. The resulting method will be mathematically proved to be fully affine invariant. Against any prognosis, simulating all views depending on the two camera orientation parameters is feasible with no dramatic computational load. A two-resolution scheme further reduces the ASIFT complexity to about twice that of SIFT. A new notion, the transition tilt, measuring the amount of distortion from one view to another, is introduced. While an absolute tilt from a frontal to a slanted view exceeding 6 is rare, much higher transition tilts are common when two slanted views of an object are compared (see Figure hightransitiontiltsillustration). The attainable transition tilt is measured for each affine image comparison method. The new method permits one to reliably identify features that have undergone transition tilts of large magnitude, up to 36 and higher. This fact is substantiated by many experiments which show that ASIFT significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods SIFT, maximally stable extremal region (MSER), Harris-affine, and Hessian-affine."

We show that three dimensional geometric transformations of a surface in the scene produce corresponding transformations in these correlation functions. From this analysis, we derive invariants of color correlation functions that can be computed efficiently and used for geometry invariant recognition. We show experimentally that these invariants are effective for recognition in situations where neither color distributions nor gray scale texture are sufficient. Following recognition, the estimated color correlation functions can be used to recover the three dimensional location and orientation of surfaces. The color texture invariants can be used in the recognition of three dimensional objects, the segmentation of images of three dimensional scenes, and the searching of image databases.<<ETX>>"

Notably, this descriptor comprises two scale parameters; a local scale parameter describing the amount of smoothing used in derivative computations, and an integration scale parameter determining over how large a region in space the statistics of regional descriptors is accumulated.Experimental results for both synthetic and natural images are presented, and the relation with models of biological vision is briefly discussed."

                "text": "In the past decades, exactly recovering the intrinsic data structure from corrupted observations, which is known as robust principal component analysis (RPCA), has attracted tremendous interests and found many applications in computer vision. Recently, this problem has been formulated as recovering a low-rank component and a sparse component from the observed data matrix. It is proved that under some suitable conditions, this problem can be exactly solved by principal component pursuit (PCP), i.e., minimizing a combination of nuclear norm and $l_1$ norm. Most of the existing methods for solving PCP require singular value decompositions (SVD) of the data matrix, resulting in a high computational complexity, hence preventing the applications of RPCA to very large scale computer vision problems. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm, called $l_1$ filtering, for \\emph{exactly} solving PCP with an $O(r^2(m+n))$ complexity, where $m\\times n$ is the size of data matrix and $r$ is the rank of the matrix to recover, which is supposed to be much smaller than $m$ and $n$. Moreover, $l_1$ filtering is \\emph{highly parallelizable}. It is the first algorithm that can \\emph{exactly} solve a nuclear norm minimization problem in \\emph{linear time} (with respect to the data size). Experiments on both synthetic data and real applications testify to the great advantage of $l_1$ filtering in speed over state-of-the-art algorithms."

Applications range from optical flow and tracking to layered motion, mosaic construction, and face coding. Numerous algorithms have been proposed and a wide variety of extensions have been made to the original formulation. We present an overview of image alignment, describing most of the algorithms and their extensions in a consistent framework. We concentrate on the inverse compositional algorithm, an efficient algorithm that we recently proposed. We examine which of the extensions to Lucas-Kanade can be used with the inverse compositional algorithm without any significant loss of efficiency, and which cannot. In this paper, Part 1 in a series of papers, we cover the quantity approximated, the warp update rule, and the gradient descent approximation. In future papers, we will cover the choice of the error function, how to allow linear appearance variation, and how to impose priors on the parameters."

With a small number of parameters, the new model captures both the subband marginal distributions and the dependencies across scales and orientations of the wavelet descriptors. Applied to the steerable pyramid, once it is trained for an input texture image, the model can be easily steered to characterize that texture at any other orientation. Furthermore, after a diagonalization operation, we obtain a rotation-invariant model of the texture image. We also propose a fast algorithm to approximate the Kullback-Leibler distance between two wavelet-domain hidden Markov models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the new texture models in retrieval experiments with large image databases, where significant improvements are shown."

Features in different bands, which form a vector sequence, are then modeled as a hidden Markov model (BMM). During classification, the unknown texture is matched against all the models and the best match is taken as the classification result.

The training texture images (parent classes) are modeled by Gaussian Markov random fields (GMRFs). To classify a rotated and scaled test texture, the rotation and scale changes are incorporated in the texture model through an appropriate transformation of the power spectral density of the GMRF. For the rotated and scaled image, a bona fide likelihood function that shows the explicit dependence of the likelihood function on the GMRF parameters, as well as on the rotation and scale parameters, is derived. Although, in general, the scaled and/or rotated texture does not correspond to a finite-order GMRF, it is possible nonetheless to write down a likelihood function for the image data. The likelihood function of the discrete Fourier transform of the image data corresponds to that of a white nonstationary Gaussian random field, with the variance at each pixel (i,j) being a known function of the rotation, the scale, the GMRF model parameters, and (i,j). The variance is an explicit function of the appropriately sampled power spectral density of the GMRF. The estimation of the rotation and scale parameters is performed in the frequency domain by maximizing the likelihood function associated with the discrete Fourier transform of the image data. Cramer-Rao error bounds on the scale and rotation estimates are easily computed. A modified Bayes decision rule is used to classify a given test image into one of C possible texture classes. The classification power of the method is demonstrated through experimental results on natural textures from the Brodatz album. >"

Though grouping is generally acknowledged to be a crucial component of the mid-level visual system, in computer vision there is a scarcity of mid-level cues due to computational difficulties in constructing feature detectors for such cues. We propose a novel mid-level visual feature detector where the visual elements are grouped based on the 2D translation subgroup of a wallpaper pattern. Different from previous state-of-the-art lattice detection algorithms for near-regular wallpaper patterns, our proposed method can detect multiple, semantically relevant 2D lattices in a scene simultaneously, achieving an effective translation-symmetry-based segmentation. Our experimental results on urban scenes demonstrate the use of translation-symmetry for building facade super-resolution and orientation estimation from a single view."

Can we recover each component individually? We prove that under some suitable assumptions, it is possible to recover both the low-rank and the sparse components exactly by solving a very convenient convex program called Principal Component Pursuit; among all feasible decompositions, simply minimize a weighted combination of the nuclear norm and of the \u21131 norm. This suggests the possibility of a principled approach to robust principal component analysis since our methodology and results assert that one can recover the principal components of a data matrix even though a positive fraction of its entries are arbitrarily corrupted. This extends to the situation where a fraction of the entries are missing as well. We discuss an algorithm for solving this optimization problem, and present applications in the area of video surveillance, where our methodology allows for the detection of objects in a cluttered background, and in the area of face recognition, where it offers a principled way of removing shadows and specularities in images of faces."

We examine the building blocks of descriptor algorithms and evaluate numerous combinations of components. Various published descriptors such as SIFT, GLOH, and Spin images can be cast into our framework. For each candidate algorithm we learn good choices for parameters using a training set consisting of patches from a multi-image 3D reconstruction where accurate ground-truth matches are known. The best descriptors were those with log polar histogramming regions and feature vectors constructed from rectified outputs of steerable quadrature filters. At a 95% detection rate these gave one third of the incorrect matches produced by SIFT."

Ideally, this would be a statistic (a function of the image) that does not depend on viewpoint and illumination, and yet is sufficient for the task. In this manuscript, we show that such statistics exist. That is, one can compute deterministic functions of the image that contain all the \"information\" present in the original image, except for the effects of viewpoint and illumination. We also show that such statistics are supported on a \"thin\" (zero-measure) subset of the image domain, and thus the \"information\" in an image that is relevant for recognition is sparse. Yet, from this thin set one can reconstruct an image that is equivalent to the original up to a change of viewpoint and local illumination (contrast). Finally, we formalize the notion of \"information\" an image contains for the purpose of viewpoint- and illumination- invariant tasks, which we call \"actionable information\" following ideas of J. J. Gibson."

This approach includes principal component analysis, independent component analysis and factor analysis. In practice, images are subjected to randomly selected transformations of a known nature, such as translation and rotation. Direct use of the above methods will lead to severely blurred components that tend to ignore the more interesting and useful structure. In previous work, we introduced a clustering algorithm that is invariant to transformations. In this paper, we propose a method called transformed component analysis, which incorporates a discrete, hidden variable that accounts for transformations and uses the expectation maximization algorithm to jointly extract components and normalize for transformations. We illustrate the algorithm using a shading problem, facial expression modeling and written digit recognition."

For over three decades, automatic symmetry detection from images/patterns has been a standing topic in computer vision. We present a timely, systematic, and quantitative performance evaluation of three state of the art discrete symmetry detection algorithms. This evaluation scheme includes a set of carefully chosen synthetic and real images presenting justified, unambiguous single or multiple dominant symmetries, and a pair of well-defined success rates for validation. We make our 176 test images with associated hand-labeled ground truth publicly available with this paper. In addition, we explore the potential contribution of symmetry detection for object recognition by testing the symmetry detection algorithm on three publicly available object recognition image sets (PASCAL VOC'07, MSRC and Caltech-256). Our results indicate that even after several decades of effort, symmetry detection in real-world images remains a challenging, unsolved problem in computer vision. Meanwhile, we illustrate its future potential in object recognition."

Many different descriptors have been proposed in the literature. It is unclear which descriptors are more appropriate and how their performance depends on the interest region detector. The descriptors should be distinctive and at the same time robust to changes in viewing conditions as well as to errors of the detector. Our evaluation uses as criterion recall with respect to precision and is carried out for different image transformations. We compare shape context [Belongie, S, et al., April 2002], steerable filters [Freeman, W and Adelson, E, Setp. 1991], PCA-SIFT [Ke, Y and Sukthankar, R, 2004], differential invariants [Koenderink, J and van Doorn, A, 1987], spin images [Lazebnik, S, et al., 2003], SIFT [Lowe, D. G., 1999], complex filters [Schaffalitzky, F and Zisserman, A, 2002], moment invariants [Van Gool, L, et al., 1996], and cross-correlation for different types of interest regions. We also propose an extension of the SIFT descriptor and show that it outperforms the original method. Furthermore, we observe that the ranking of the descriptors is mostly independent of the interest region detector and that the SIFT-based descriptors perform best. Moments and steerable filters show the best performance among the low dimensional descriptors."

This problem can be viewed as a robust version of classical PCA, and arises in a number of application domains, including image processing, web data ranking, and bioinformatic data analysis. It was recently shown that under surprisingly broad conditions, it can be exactly solved via a convex programming surrogate that combines nuclear norm minimization and \u21131-norm minimization. This paper develops and compares two complementary approaches for solving this convex program. The first is an accelerated proximal gradient algorithm directly applied to the primal; while the second is a gradient algorithm applied to the dual problem. Both are several orders of magnitude faster than the previous state-of-the-art algorithm for this problem, which was based on iterative thresholding. Simulations demonstrate the performance improvement that can be obtained via these two algorithms, and clarify their relative merits."

We define a complete skewed rotation symmetry detection problem as discovering five independent properties of a skewed rotation symmetry group: 1) the center of rotation, 2) the affine deformation, 3) the type of the symmetry group, 4) the cardinality of the symmetry group, and 5) the supporting region of the symmetry group in the image. We propose a frieze-expansion (FE) method that transforms rotation symmetry group detection into a simple, 1D translation symmetry detection problem. We define and construct a pair of rotational symmetry saliency maps, complemented by a local feature method. Frequency analysis, using Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), is applied to the frieze-expansion patterns (FEPs) to uncover the types (cyclic, dihedral, and O(2)), the cardinalities, and the corresponding supporting regions, concentric or otherwise, of multiple rotation symmetry groups in an image. The phase information of the FEP is used to rectify affinely skewed rotation symmetry groups. Our result advances the state of the art in symmetry detection by offering a unique combination of region-based, feature-based, and frequency-based approaches. Experimental results on 170 synthetic and natural images demonstrate superior performance of our rotation symmetry detection algorithm over existing methods."

Recently, it was discovered that this nondeterministic polynomial-time hard (NP-hard) task can be well accomplished, both theoretically and numerically, via heuristically solving a convex relaxation problem where the widely acknowledged nuclear norm and $l_1$ norm are utilized to induce low-rank and sparsity. This paper studies the recovery task in the general settings that only a fraction of entries of the matrix can be observed and the observation is corrupted by both impulsive and Gaussian noise. We show that the resulting model falls into the applicable scope of the classical augmented Lagrangian method. Moreover, the separable structure of the new model enables us to solve the involved subproblems more efficiently by splitting the augmented Lagrangian function. Hence, some splitting numerical algorithms are developed for solving the new recovery model. Some preliminary numerical experiments verify that these augmented-Lagrangian-based splitting algorithms are easily implementable and surprisingly efficient for tackling the new recovery model."

The approach works as follows: first, determine a conic formulation of the problem; second, determine its dual; third, apply smoothing; and fourth, solve using an optimal first-order method. A merit of this approach is its flexibility: for example, all compressed sensing problems can be solved via this approach. These include models with objective functionals such as the total-variation norm, ||Wx||1 where W is arbitrary, or a combination thereof. In addition, the paper introduces a number of technical contributions such as a novel continuation scheme and a novel approach for controlling the step size, and applies results showing that the smooth and unsmoothed problems are sometimes formally equivalent. Combined with our framework, these lead to novel, stable and computationally efficient algorithms. For instance, our general implementation is competitive with state-of-the-art methods for solving intensively studied problems such as the LASSO. Further, numerical experiments show that one can solve the Dantzig selector problem, for which no efficient large-scale solvers exist, in a few hundred iterations. Finally, the paper is accompanied with a software release. This software is not a single, monolithic solver; rather, it is a suite of programs and routines designed to serve as building blocks for constructing complete algorithms."

Our scale and affine invariant detectors are based on the following recent results: (1) Interest points extracted with the Harris detector can be adapted to affine transformations and give repeatable results (geometrically stable). (2) The characteristic scale of a local structure is indicated by a local extremum over scale of normalized derivatives (the Laplacian). (3) The affine shape of a point neighborhood is estimated based on the second moment matrix.Our scale invariant detector computes a multi-scale representation for the Harris interest point detector and then selects points at which a local measure (the Laplacian) is maximal over scales. This provides a set of distinctive points which are invariant to scale, rotation and translation as well as robust to illumination changes and limited changes of viewpoint. The characteristic scale determines a scale invariant region for each point. We extend the scale invariant detector to affine invariance by estimating the affine shape of a point neighborhood. An iterative algorithm modifies location, scale and neighborhood of each point and converges to affine invariant points. This method can deal with significant affine transformations including large scale changes. The characteristic scale and the affine shape of neighborhood determine an affine invariant region for each point.We present a comparative evaluation of different detectors and show that our approach provides better results than existing methods. The performance of our detector is also confirmed by excellent matching results; the image is described by a set of scale/affine invariant descriptors computed on the regions associated with our points."

The motivation for this paper comes from relating a heuristic texture synthesis algorithm popular in computer vision to general nonparametric bootstrapping of stationary random fields. We give a formal resampling scheme for the heuristic texture algorithm and prove that it produces a consistent estimate of the joint distribution of pixels in a window of certain size under mixing and regularity conditions on the random field. The joint distribution of pixels is the quantity of interest here because theories of human perception of texture suggest that two textures with the same joint distribution of pixel values in a suitably chosen window will appear similar to a human. Thus we provide theoretical justification for an algorithm that has already been very successful in practice, and suggest an explanation for its perceptually good results."

                "text": "This paper introduces a novel algorithm to approximate the matrix with minimum nuclear norm among all matrices obeying a set of convex constraints. This problem may be understood as the convex relaxation of a rank minimization problem and arises in many important applications as in the task of recovering a large matrix from a small subset of its entries (the famous Netflix problem). Off-the-shelf algorithms such as interior point methods are not directly amenable to large problems of this kind with over a million unknown entries. This paper develops a simple first-order and easy-to-implement algorithm that is extremely efficient at addressing problems in which the optimal solution has low rank. The algorithm is iterative, produces a sequence of matrices $\\{\\boldsymbol{X}^k,\\boldsymbol{Y}^k\\}$, and at each step mainly performs a soft-thresholding operation on the singular values of the matrix $\\boldsymbol{Y}^k$. There are two remarkable features making this attractive for low-rank matrix completion problems. The first is that the soft-thresholding operation is applied to a sparse matrix; the second is that the rank of the iterates $\\{\\boldsymbol{X}^k\\}$ is empirically nondecreasing. Both these facts allow the algorithm to make use of very minimal storage space and keep the computational cost of each iteration low. On the theoretical side, we provide a convergence analysis showing that the sequence of iterates converges. On the practical side, we provide numerical examples in which $1,000\\times1,000$ matrices are recovered in less than a minute on a modest desktop computer. We also demonstrate that our approach is amenable to very large scale problems by recovering matrices of rank about 10 with nearly a billion unknowns from just about 0.4% of their sampled entries. Our methods are connected with the recent literature on linearized Bregman iterations for $\\ell_1$ minimization, and we develop a framework in which one can understand these algorithms in terms of well-known Lagrange multiplier algorithms."

In the first stage, the QMF bank is used as the wavelet transform to decompose the texture image into subbands. The gray scale transform invariant features derived from the statistics based on first-order distribution of gray levels are then extracted from each subband image. In the second stage, the sequence of subbands is modeled as a hidden Markov model (HMM), and one HMM is designed for each class of textures. The HMM is used to exploit the dependence among these subbands, and is able to capture the trend of changes caused by rotation. During recognition, the unknown texture is matched against all the models. The best matched model identifies the texture class. Up to 93.33% classification accuracy is reported. >"

The proposed method uses six statistical features obtained from two scales of this invariant encoder to result in indices for roughness, anisotropy, and other higher-order textural features. Classification results for synthetic and natural textures are presented.

For example, we desire to obtain an understanding of natural scenes, containing roads, buildings, trees, bushes, etc., as typified by the two frames from a sequence illustrated in Figure 1. The solution to this problem that we are pursuing is to use a computer vision system based upon motion analysis of a monocular image sequence from a mobile camera. By extraction and tracking of image features, representations of the 3D analogues of these features can be constructed."

A polar, analytic form of a two-dimensional (2-D) Gabor wavelet is developed, and a multiresolution family of these wavelets is used to compute information-conserving microfeatures. From these microfeatures a micromodel, which characterizes spatially localized amplitude, frequency, and directional behavior of the texture, is formed. The essential characteristics of a texture sample, its macrofeatures, are derived from the estimated selected parameters of the micromodel. Classification of texture samples is based on the macromodel derived from a rotation invariant subset of macrofeatures. In experiments, comparatively high correct classification rates were obtained using large sample sets."

Such problems have appeared in the literature of a diverse set of fields including system identification and control, Euclidean embedding, and collaborative filtering. Although specific instances can often be solved with specialized algorithms, the general affine rank minimization problem is NP-hard because it contains vector cardinality minimization as a special case. \n \nIn this paper, we show that if a certain restricted isometry property holds for the linear transformation defining the constraints, the minimum-rank solution can be recovered by solving a convex optimization problem, namely, the minimization of the nuclear norm over the given affine space. We present several random ensembles of equations where the restricted isometry property holds with overwhelming probability, provided the codimension of the subspace is sufficiently large. \n \nThe techniques used in our analysis have strong parallels in the compressed sensing framework. We discuss how affine rank minimization generalizes this preexisting concept and outline a dictionary relating concepts from cardinality minimization to those of rank minimization. We also discuss several algorithmic approaches to minimizing the nuclear norm and illustrate our results with numerical examples."

Suppose that we observe m entries selected uniformly at random from a matrix M. Can we complete the matrix and recover the entries that we have not seen?We show that one can perfectly recover most low-rank matrices from what appears to be an incomplete set of entries. We prove that if the number m of sampled entries obeys $$m\\ge C\\,n^{1.2}r\\log n$$ for some positive numerical constant C, then with very high probability, most n\u00d7n matrices of rank r can be perfectly recovered by solving a simple convex optimization program. This program finds the matrix with minimum nuclear norm that fits the data. The condition above assumes that the rank is not too large. However, if one replaces the 1.2 exponent with 1.25, then the result holds for all values of the rank. Similar results hold for arbitrary rectangular matrices as well. Our results are connected with the recent literature on compressed sensing, and show that objects other than signals and images can be perfectly reconstructed from very limited information."

Highly repetitive environments introduce numerous correspondence ambiguities and are problematic for traditional wide-baseline matching methods. Our method exploits the highly repetitive nature of urban environments, detecting multiple perspectively distorted periodic 2D patterns in an image and matching them to a 3D database of textured facades by reasoning about the underlying canonical forms of each pattern. Multiple 2D-to-3D pattern correspondences enable robust recovery of camera orientation and location. We demonstrate the success of this method in a large urban environment."

This is known as the matrix completion problem, and comes up in a great number of applications, including the famous Netflix Prize and other similar questions in collaborative filtering. In general, accurate recovery of a matrix from a small number of entries is impossible, but the knowledge that the unknown matrix has low rank radically changes this premise, making the search for solutions meaningful. This paper presents optimality results quantifying the minimum number of entries needed to recover a matrix of rank r exactly by any method whatsoever (the information theoretic limit). More importantly, the paper shows that, under certain incoherence assumptions on the singular vectors of the matrix, recovery is possible by solving a convenient convex program as soon as the number of entries is on the order of the information theoretic limit (up to logarithmic factors). This convex program simply finds, among all matrices consistent with the observed entries, that with minimum nuclear norm. As an example, we show that on the order of nr log(n) samples are needed to recover a random n x n matrix of rank r by any method, and to be sure, nuclear norm minimization succeeds as soon as the number of entries is of the form nr polylog(n)."

A specific rank minimization problem is the matrix completion problem, in which we wish to recover a (low-rank) data matrix from incomplete samples of its entries. A recent convex relaxation of the rank minimization problem minimizes the nuclear norm instead of the rank of the matrix. Another possible model for the rank minimization problem is the nuclear norm regularized linear least squares problem. This regularized problem is a special case of an unconstrained nonsmooth convex optimization problem, in which the objective function is the sum of a convex smooth function with Lipschitz continuous gradient and a convex function on a set of matrices. In this paper, we propose an accelerated proximal gradient algorithm, which terminates in O(1/ \u221a ) iterations with an -optimal solution, to solve this unconstrained nonsmooth convex optimization problem, and in particular, the nuclear norm regularized linear least squares problem. We report numerical results for solving large-scale randomly generated matrix completion problems. The numerical results suggest that our algorithm is efficient and robust in solving large-scale random matrix completion problems. In particular, we are able to solve random matrix completion problems with matrix dimensions up to 105 each in less than 3.5 hours on a modest PC."

The success of the approach depends on the definition of a comprehensive set of goals for the computation of edge points. These goals must be precise enough to delimit the desired behavior of the detector while making minimal assumptions about the form of the solution. We define detection and localization criteria for a class of edges, and present mathematical forms for these criteria as functionals on the operator impulse response. A third criterion is then added to ensure that the detector has only one response to a single edge. We use the criteria in numerical optimization to derive detectors for several common image features, including step edges. On specializing the analysis to step edges, we find that there is a natural uncertainty principle between detection and localization performance, which are the two main goals. With this principle we derive a single operator shape which is optimal at any scale. The optimal detector has a simple approximate implementation in which edges are marked at maxima in gradient magnitude of a Gaussian-smoothed image. We extend this simple detector using operators of several widths to cope with different signal-to-noise ratios in the image. We present a general method, called feature synthesis, for the fine-to-coarse integration of information from operators at different scales. Finally we show that step edge detector performance improves considerably as the operator point spread function is extended along the edge."

                "text": "The a\u2010ne rank minimization problem, which consists of flnding a matrix of minimum rank subject to linear equality constraints, has been proposed in many areas of engineering and science. A speciflc rank minimization problem is the matrix completion problem, in which we wish to recover a (low-rank) data matrix from incomplete samples of its entries. A recent convex relaxation of the rank minimization problem minimizes the nuclear norm instead of the rank of the matrix. Another possible model for the rank minimization problem is the nuclear norm regularized linear least squares problem. This regularized problem is a special case of an unconstrained nonsmooth convex optimization problem, in which the objective function is the sum of a convex smooth function with Lipschitz continuous gradient and a convex function on a set of matrices. In this paper, we propose an accelerated proximal gradient algorithm, which terminates in O(1= p \u2020) iterations with an \u2020-optimal solution, to solve this unconstrained nonsmooth convex optimization problem, and in particular, the nuclear norm regularized linear least squares problem. We report numerical results for solving large-scale randomly generated matrix completion problems. The numerical results suggest that our algorithm is e\u2010cient and robust in solving large-scale random matrix completion problems. In particular, we are able to solve random matrix completion problems with matrix dimensions up to 10 5 each in less than 10 minutes on a modest PC."

But the convergence of extending ADM to the general case of $m\\ge 3$ is still open. In this paper, we show that the straightforward extension of ADM is valid for the general case of $m\\ge 3$ if it is combined with a Gaussian back substitution procedure. The resulting ADM with Gaussian back substitution is a novel approach towards the extension of ADM from $m=2$ to $m\\ge 3$, and its algorithmic framework is new in the literature. For the ADM with Gaussian back substitution, we prove its convergence via the analytic framework of contractive-type methods, and we show its numerical efficiency by some application problems."

In 2D space, there are seven frieze groups describing monochrome patterns that repeat along one direction and 17 wallpaper groups for patterns that repeat along two linearly independent directions to tile the plane. We develop a set of computer algorithms that \"understand\" a given periodic pattern by automatically finding its underlying lattice, identifying its symmetry group, and extracting its representative motifs. We also extend this computational model for near-periodic patterns using geometric AIC. Applications of such a computational model include pattern indexing, texture synthesis, image compression, and gait analysis."

Included in this classification are methods for solving systems of equations, the Remes algorithm, methods for nonlinear Chebyshev-approximation, the classical Newton method along with its variants such as Newton's method for partially ordered spaces and for degenerate tangent spaces.

Therefore, applications of Douglas\u2014Rachford splitting, such as the alternating direction method of multipliers for convex programming decomposition, are also special cases of the proximal point algorithm. This observation allows the unification and generalization of a variety of convex programming algorithms. By introducing a modified version of the proximal point algorithm, we derive a new,generalized alternating direction method of multipliers for convex programming. Advances of this sort illustrate the power and generality gained by adopting monotone operator theory as a conceptual framework."

Assume that, based on the instruction given by the leader, each follower can solve the individual equilibrium sub-problems in his own way. The responsibility of the leader is to give a more reasonable instruction for the next iteration loop based on the feedback information from the followers. This consideration leads us to present a parallel splitting augmented Lagrangian method (abbreviated to PSALM). The proposed method can be extended to solve the system of equilibrium problems with three separable operators. Finally, it is explained why we cannot use the same technique to develop similar methods for problems with more than three separable operators.\n"
