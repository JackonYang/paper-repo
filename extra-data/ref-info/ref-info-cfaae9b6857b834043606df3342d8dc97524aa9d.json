In many applications, though, only one sample per class is available to the system. In this contribution, we describe a probabilistic approach that is able to compensate for imprecisely localized, partially occluded, and expression-variant faces even when only one single training sample per class is available to the system. To solve the localization problem, we find the subspace (within the feature space, e.g., eigenspace) that represents this error for each of the training images. To resolve the occlusion problem, each face is divided into k local regions which are analyzed in isolation. In contrast with other approaches where a simple voting space is used, we present a probabilistic method that analyzes how \"good\" a local match is. To make the recognition system less sensitive to the differences between the facial expression displayed on the training and the testing images, we weight the results obtained on each local area on the basis of how much of this local area is affected by the expression displayed on the current test image."

Taking a pattern classification approach, we consider each pixel in an image as a coordinate in a high-dimensional space. We take advantage of the observation that the images of a particular face, under varying illumination but fixed pose, lie in a 3D linear subspace of the high dimensional image space-if the face is a Lambertian surface without shadowing. However, since faces are not truly Lambertian surfaces and do indeed produce self-shadowing, images will deviate from this linear subspace. Rather than explicitly modeling this deviation, we linearly project the image into a subspace in a manner which discounts those regions of the face with large deviation. Our projection method is based on Fisher's linear discriminant and produces well separated classes in a low-dimensional subspace, even under severe variation in lighting and facial expressions. The eigenface technique, another method based on linearly projecting the image space to a low dimensional subspace, has similar computational requirements. Yet, extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed \"Fisherface\" method has error rates that are lower than those of the eigenface technique for tests on the Harvard and Yale face databases."

The system combines local image sampling, a self-organizing map (SOM) neural network, and a convolutional neural network. The SOM provides a quantization of the image samples into a topological space where inputs that are nearby in the original space are also nearby in the output space, thereby providing dimensionality reduction and invariance to minor changes in the image sample, and the convolutional neural network provides partial invariance to translation, rotation, scale, and deformation. The convolutional network extracts successively larger features in a hierarchical set of layers. We present results using the Karhunen-Loeve transform in place of the SOM, and a multilayer perceptron (MLP) in place of the convolutional network for comparison. We use a database of 400 images of 40 individuals which contains quite a high degree of variability in expression, pose, and facial details. We analyze the computational complexity and discuss how new classes could be added to the trained recognizer."

The computational approach taken in this system is motivated by both physiology and information theory, as well as by the practical requirements of near-real-time performance and accuracy. Our approach treats the face recognition problem as an intrinsically two-dimensional (2-D) recognition problem rather than requiring recovery of three-dimensional geometry, taking advantage of the fact that faces are normally upright and thus may be described by a small set of 2-D characteristic views. The system functions by projecting face images onto a feature space that spans the significant variations among known face images. The significant features are known as \"eigenfaces,\" because they are the eigenvectors (principal components) of the set of faces; they do not necessarily correspond to features such as eyes, ears, and noses. The projection operation characterizes an individual face by a weighted sum of the eigenface features, and so to recognize a particular face it is necessary only to compare these weights to those of known individuals. Some particular advantages of our approach are that it provides for the ability to learn and later recognize new faces in an unsupervised manner, and that it is easy to implement using a neural network architecture."

                "text": "An object recognition system based on the dynamic link architecture, an extension to classical artificial neural networks (ANNs), is presented. The dynamic link architecture exploits correlations in the fine-scale temporal structure of cellular signals to group neurons dynamically into higher-order entities. These entities represent a rich structure and can code for high-level objects. To demonstrate the capabilities of the dynamic link architecture, a program was implemented that can recognize human faces and other objects from video images. Memorized objects are represented by sparse graphs, whose vertices are labeled by a multiresolution description in terms of a local power spectrum, and whose edges are labeled by geometrical distance vectors. Object recognition can be formulated as elastic graph matching, which is performed here by stochastic optimization of a matching cost function. The implementation on a transputer network achieved recognition of human faces and office objects from gray-level camera images. The performance of the program is evaluated by a statistical analysis of recognition results from a portrait gallery comprising images of 87 persons. >"

Energy-based models (EBM) associate an energy to those configurations, eliminating the need for proper normalization of probability distributions. Making a decision (an inference) with an EBM consists in comparing the energies associated with various configurations of the variable to be predicted, and choosing the one with the smallest energy. Such systems must be trained discriminatively to associate low energies to the desired configurations and higher energies to undesired configurations. A wide variety of loss function can be used for this purpose. We give sufficient conditions that a loss function should satisfy so that its minimization will cause the system to approach to desired behavior. We give many specific examples of suitable loss functions, and show an application to object recognition in images."

The representation in PCA is based on the second order statistics of the image set, and does not address higher order statistical dependencies such as the relationships among three or more pixels. Higher order statistics (HOS) have been used as a more informative low dimensional representation than PCA for face and vehicle detection. We investigate a generalization of PCA, kernel principal component analysis (kernel PCA), for learning low dimensional representations in the context of face recognition. In contrast to HOS, kernel PCA computes the higher order statistics without the combinatorial explosion of time and memory complexity. While PCA aims to find a second order correlation of patterns, kernel PCA provides a replacement which takes into account higher order correlations. We compare the recognition results using kernel methods with eigenface methods on two benchmarks. Empirical results show that kernel PCA outperforms the eigenface method in face recognition."

In contrast to the causal generative extensions of ICA which maintain marginal independence of sources, we define features as deterministic (linear) functions of the inputs. This assumption results in marginal dependencies among the features, but conditional independence of the features given the inputs. By assigning energies to the features a probability distribution over the input states is defined through the Boltzmann distribution. Free parameters of this model are trained using the contrastive divergence objective (Hinton, 2002). When the number of features is equal to the number of input dimensions this energy-based model reduces to noiseless ICA and we show experimentally that the proposed learning algorithm is able to perform blind source separation on speech data. In additional experiments we train overcomplete energy-based models to extract features from various standard data-sets containing speech, natural images, hand-written digits and faces."

The training criterion used in SVMs is not appropriate for this purpose so we adopt the simple criterion that is generally used when training neural networks for classification tasks.

Invariance of the output with respect to certain transformations of the input is a typical example of such a priori knowledge.

If the amount of data and computational resources are near infinite, many algorithmes will probably converge to the optimal solution. When this is not the case, one has to introduce regularizers and a-priori knowledge to supplement the available data in order to boost the performance. Invariance (or known dependance) with respect to transformation of the input is a frequent occurrence of such an a-priori knowledge. In this chapter, we introduce the concept of tangent vectors, which compactly represent the essence of these transformation invariances, and two classes of algorithms, \u201cTangent distance\u201d and \u2018Tangent propagation\u201d, which make use of these invariances to improve performance."

We consider the images as points in a metric space in which we wish to move around so as to locate image neighborhoods of interest, based on color information. The data base images are mapped to distributions in color space, these distributions are appropriately compressed, and then the distances between all pairs I; J of images are computed based on the work needed to rearrange the mass in the compressed distribution representing I to that of J . We also propose the use of multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) techniques to embed a group of images as points in a twoor three-dimensional Euclidean space so that their distances are preserved as much as possible. Such geometric embeddings allow the user to perceive the dominant axes of variation in the displayed image group. In particular, displays of 2-d MDS embeddings can be used to organize and re ne the results of a nearest-neighbor query in a perceptually intuitive way. By iterating this process, the user is able to quickly navigate to the portion of the image space of interest."

The need to analyze large amounts of multivariate data raises the fundamental problem of dimensionality reduction: how to discover compact representations of high-dimensional data. Here, we introduce locally linear embedding (LLE), an unsupervised learning algorithm that computes low-dimensional, neighborhood-preserving embeddings of high-dimensional inputs. Unlike clustering methods for local dimensionality reduction, LLE maps its inputs into a single global coordinate system of lower dimensionality, and its optimizations do not involve local minima. By exploiting the local symmetries of linear reconstructions, LLE is able to learn the global structure of nonlinear manifolds, such as those generated by images of faces or documents of text."
