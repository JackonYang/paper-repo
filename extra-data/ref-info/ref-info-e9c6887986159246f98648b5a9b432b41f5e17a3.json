The key idea is to recognize and use underlying structure in such environments using simple components with specified performance guarantees connected by effective communication protocols. This paper brings together ideas from systems and theory: the design of mobile robots in unstructured physical environments, work in electronic libraries and know bets, topology, as well as the rich research in information retrieval and filtering to design a concrete software architecture for solving a wide range of highlevel user queries in multi-media environments."

This processing can be accomplished by using a traditional client-server network interface, which constrains the client to the set of queries supported by the server, or requires the server to send all data to the client for processing. The former is inflexible; the latter is inefficient. Transportable agents, which support the movement of the client computation to the location of the remote resource, have the potential to be more flexible and more efficient. Transportable agents are capable of suspending their execution, transporting themselves to another host on a network, and resuming execution from the point at which they were suspended. Transportable agents consume fewer network resources and can support systems that do not have permanent network connections, such as mobile computers and personal digital assistants. We describe a prototype transportable-agent implementation that facilitates research in this area. Agents are written in a script language that supports agent relocation, and the language is processed at each host by an agent interpreter. Electronic mail and UNIX remote shell (rsh) are the two current transport mechanisms and we plan to explore others. We present a technical-report searching agent as a demonstration of the capabilities of our prototype implementation."

                "text": "he creation of software agents has generated much recent interest. A variety of approaches and prw jects use the term \" agents \"-ranging from adaptive user interfaces (W) to systems that use planning algorithms to generate shell scripts [ 1, 2, 41. In our own approach, agents assist users in a range of daily, mundane activities-setting up meetings, sending out papers, locating information in multiple databases, tracking the whereabouts of people, and so on. Our objective is to design agents that blend transparently into normal work environments, while relieving users of low-level adminis trative and clerical tasks. The practical aspects of software agents are taken seriously. Users should be able to assume the agents are reliable and predictable and the human user remains in ultimate control. One of the most difficult aspects of agent design is to define specific tasks that are both feasible using current technology, and are truly useful to the everyday user. Furthermore, it became clear during the testing of our initial protm type that users have little patience when it comes to interacting with software agents. We therefore paid special attention to the Ul aspects of our system. In particular, whenever possible, we opted for graphically oriented interfaces over pure text-based interfaces. In addition, reliability and error handling is crucial in all parts of a software agent system. The real world is unpredictable: messages between agents may be lost or delayed, pea-pie may respond inappropriately rounding the scheduling of a visitor to our laboratory. We designed and implemented a set of software agents to handle this task. We deliberately made no commitment in advance to a particular agent architecture. We then tested the system with ordinary users, providing feedback that led to many improvements in the design of the agents and the human/ agent interfaces, as well as to the development of a general and flexible framework for agent interaction. The key feature of the framework is the use of personal-ized agents called \" userbots \" that mediate communication between users and task-specific agents. We believe the bottom-up approach is crucial in identifying the necessary properties of a successful agent platform. Our initial experiments have already led us to formulate some key properties. Examples include the separation of task-specific agents from user-centered agents, the need to handle issues of security and privacy, and as mentioned earlier, the need for good human interfaces and high reliability.

                "text": "The software world is one of great richness and diversity. Many thousands of software products are available to users today, providing a wide variety of information and services in a wide variety of domains. While most of these programs provide their users with significant value when used in isolation, there is increasing demand for programs that can interoperate \u2013 to exchange information and services with other programs and thereby solve problems that cannot be solved alone. Part of what makes interoperation difficult is heterogeneity. Programs are written by different people, at different times, in different languages; and, as a result, they often provide different interfaces. The difficulties created by heterogeneity are exacerbated by dynamics in the software environment. Programs are frequently rewritten; new programs are added; old programs removed. Agent-based software engineering was invented to facilitate the creation of software able to interoperate in such settings. In this approach to software development, application programs are written as software agents, i.e. software \u201ccomponents\u201d that communicate with their peers by exchanging messages in an expressive agent communication language. Agents can be as simple as subroutines; but typically they are larger entities with some sort of persistent control (e.g. distinct control threads within a single address space, distinct processes on a single machine, or separate processes on different machines). The salient feature of the language used by agents is its expressiveness. It allows for the exchange of data and logical information, individual commands and scripts (i.e. programs). Using this language, agents can communicate complex information and goals, directly or indirectly \u201cprogramming\u201d each other in useful ways. Agent-based software engineering is often compared to object-oriented programming. Like an \u201cobject\u201d, an agent provides a message-based interface independent of its internal data structures and algorithms. The primary difference between the two approaches lies in the language of the interface. In general object-oriented programming, the meaning of a message can vary from one object to another. In agent-based software engineering, agents use a common language with an agent-independent semantics. The concept of agent-based software engineering raises a number of important questions."

Acquisition of news and information, mail and even social interactions and entertainment have become more and more computer based. These technological developments are not in line with a change in the way people interact with computers. Techniques from the field of AI, in particular so-called autonomous agents, can be used to implement a complementary style of interaction, which has been referred to as indirect management. Agents assist users in a range of different ways. They hide the complexity of difficult tasks, they perform tasks on the user's behalf, they can train or teach the user, they help different users collaborate, and they monitor events and procedures. The chapter focuses on an approach to building interface agents. It presents results from several prototype agents that have been built using this approach, including agents that provide personalized assistance with meeting scheduling, email handling, electronic news filtering, and selection of entertainment."

The method is termed GlOSS--Glossary of Servers Server. The second part of this paper evaluates GlOSS using four different semantics to answer a user''s queries.

Typically, these systems provide retrieval capabilities for fairly static corpora, their algorithms are language dependent, and they don\u2019t perform well when presented with misspelled words or text that has been degraded by optical character recognition techniques. In addition, the capabilities needed by a variety of researchers, analysts, and investigative reporters from these methods and tools go beyond the traditional indexing systems. The ability to find related documents, to query using natural language, and to filter out desired information suggest a more interactive and robust user interface. We describe our work in progress for generating a dynamic hypertext environment that provides the capabilities of relating, querying, and iiltering in a largescale, dynamic environment that is robust in the sense that it is language independent and capable of dealing with misspelled words."

The softbot uses a UNIX shell and the World-Wide Web to interact with a wide range of internet resources. The softbot\u2019s effectors include ftp, telnet, mail, and numerous file manipulation commaslds. Its sensors include internet facilities such as archie, gopher, netfind, and many more. The softbot is designed to incorporate new facilities into its repertoirc as they become available. The softbot\u2019s \"added value\" is three-fold. First, it provides an integrated and expressive interface to the internet. Second, the softbot dynamically chooses which facilities to invoke, and in what sequence. For example, the softbot might use netfind to determine David McAllester\u2019s e-mail address. Since it knows that netfind requires a person\u2019s institution as input, the softbot would first search bibliographic databases for a technical report by McAllester which would reveal his institutkm, and then feed that information to netfind. Third, the softbot fluidly backtracks from one facility to another based on information collected at run time. As a result., the softbot\u2019s behavior changes in response to transient system conditions (e.g., the UUCP gateway is down). In this article, we focus on the ideas underlying the softbot-based interface."

In other words, the program can suspend its execution at an arbitrary point, transport itself to another machine, and then resume execution from the point of suspension. Mobile agents have the potential to provide a {\\em single, general framework} in which a wide range of distributed applications can be implemented efficiently and easily. Several challenges must be faced, however, most notably reducing migration overhead, protecting a machine from malicious agents (and an agent from malicious machines), and insulating the agent against network and machine failures. Agent Tcl is a mobile-agent system under development at Dartmouth College that has evolved from a Tcl-only system into a multiple-language system that currently supports Tcl, Java, and Scheme. In this thesis, we examine the motivation behind mobile agents, describe the base Agent Tcl system and its security mechanisms for protecting a machine against malicious agents, and analyze the system''s current performance. Finally, we discuss the security, fault-tolerance and performance enhancements that will be necessary for Agent Tcl and mobile agents in general to realize their full potential."

Using this structure, we can make a distinction between the main topics, which occur throughout the length of the text, and the subtopics, which are of only limited extent. We discuss why recognition of subtopic structure is important and how, to some degree of accuracy, it can be found. We describe a new way of specifying queries on full-length documents and then describe an experiment in which making use of the recognition of local structure achieves better results on a typical information retrieval task than does a standard IR measure."

Our experience using mobile robots for the manipulation of large objects (couches, boxes, file cabinets, etc.) leads us to recommend a minimalist architecture for multi-agent programming. In particular, our methodology has led us to derive asynchronous distributed strategies that require no direct communication between agents, and very sparse geometric and dynamic models of the objects our robots manipulate. We argue for a design principle called supermodularity, which is orthogonal both to the notion of modularity in cognitive AI and also to horizontal decomposition (the non-modularity advocated in the subsumption/connectionist literature.) Finally, we discuss a simple mobotscheme infrastructure to implement supermodular architectures. In the past few years we have programmed many supermodular m..."

For example, an assistant that helps schedule a particular user\u2019s calendar will have to know that user\u2019s scheduling preferences. This paper explores the potential of machine learning methods to automatically create and maintain such customized knowledge for personal software assistants. We describe the design of one particular learning assistant: a calendar manager, called CAP (Calendar APprentice), that learns user scheduling preferences from experience. Results are summarized from approximately five user-years of experience, during which CAP has learned an evolving set of several thousand rules that characterize the scheduling preferences of its users. Based on this experience, we suggest that machine learning methods may play an important role in future personal software assistants."

In Gobbledoc, image processing, document analysis, and OCR operations take place in batch mode when the documents are acquired. The document image acquisition process and the knowledge base that must be entered into the system to process a family of page images are described. The process by which the X-Y tree data structure converts a 2-D page-segmentation problem into a series of 1-D string-parsing problems that can be tackled using conventional compiler tools is also described. Syntactic analysis is used in Gobbledoc to divide each page into labeled rectangular blocks. Blocks labeled text are converted by OCR to obtain a secondary (ASCII) document representation. Since such symbolic files are better suited for computerized search than for human access to the document content and because too many visual layout clues are lost in the OCR process (including some special characters), Gobbledoc preserves the original block images for human browsing. Storage, networking, and display issues specific to document images are also discussed.<<ETX>>"

Several critical functions have been investigated and the technical approaches are discussed. The first is the segmentation and classification of digitized printed documents into regions of text and images. A nonlinear, run-length smoothing algorithm has been used for this purpose. By using the regular features of text lines, a linear adaptive classification scheme discriminates text regions from others. The second technique studied is an adaptive approach to the recognition of the hundreds of font styles and sizes that can occur on printed documents. A preclassifier is constructed during the input process and used to speed up a well-known pattern-matching method for clustering characters from an arbitrary print source into a small sample of prototypes. Experimental results are included."

A framework for such a theory is proposed, providing both a precise vocabulary and also appropriate computational machinery for working with issues of information flow in and through a robot system equipped with various types of sensors and operating in a dynamic unstructured environment. The authors focus on the problem of constructing virtual sensors out of concrete sensors. Virtual sensors may be defined in terms of existing concrete sensors. A method of task-directed construction of such virtual sensors is described. Virtual sensors are queried in robot programs much as their concrete counterparts are. In allowing the task to direct the composition of virtual sensors, robot programs which are organized in such a way as to guide the robot toward acquiring the information it needs to accomplish the task can be derived. Many information-acquisition and representational issues are made explicit.<<ETX>>"

In order to improve this document input system's performance, an appropriate document structure analysis technique is indispen~able(''~'). When storing data from general printed documents into a database, it is necessary to represent the document structure. Therefore, a document layout structure generation method is especially important(*)(6). For this purpose, the authors have developed a document image structure analysis method to generate a layout structure, as well as to detect such document elements as characters, pictures and figures. This method was developed on a personal computer. Its usability is described in this paper."

It does so by exploiting the human perceptual system in ways similar to Scientific Visualization, which allows scientists to perceive patterns in large data collections. While Scientific Visualization typically works on data from simulations of physical processes, Information Visualization works on the structure of information inherent in large information spaces. This video shows a prototype system, called the Information Visualizer, and two information visualization techniques used to access information both by structure and by content. Cone Trees are used for visualizing hierarchical information structures. The Perspective Wall is used for visualizing linear information structures. Both techniques use 3D to maximize effective use of available screen space and enable visualization of the whole structure. Interactive animation is used to shift some of the user\u2019s cognitive load to the human perceptual system. The video concludes with a series of examples from an application scenario, based on managing an organization."

This volume is written for undergraduate students who have taken a first course in Formal Language Theory. It presents the basic concepts of structural complexity, thus providing the background necessary for the understanding of complexity theory. The second corrected edition has been extended by an appendix with recent results on nondeterministic space classes and updated with regard to the bibliographical remarks and the references."

Layers are made up of asynchronous modules that communicate over low-bandwidth channels. Each module is an instance of a fairly simple computational machine. Higher-level layers can subsume the roles of lower levels by suppressing their outputs. However, lower levels continue to function as higher levels are added. The result is a robust and flexible robot control system. The system has been used to control a mobile robot wandering around unconstrained laboratory areas and computer machine rooms. Eventually it is intended to control a robot that wanders the office areas of our laboratory, building maps of its surroundings using an onboard arm to perform simple tasks."

The particular problems we consider are: finding Hamiltonian circuits in directed graphs (DHC), finding Hamiltonian circuits in undirected graphs (UHC), and finding perfect matchings in undirected graphs (PM). We show that for each problem there is an algorithm that is extremely fast (0(n(log n)2) for DHC and UHC, and 0(nlog n) for PM), and which with probability tending to one finds a solution in randomly chosen graphs of sufficient density. These results contrast with the known NP-completeness of the first two problems [2,12] and the best worst-case upper bound known of 0(n2.5) for the last [9]."

The method operates by extracting two-dimensional models of an object from a sequence of images. The basic idea underlying the technique is to decompose the image of a solid object moving in space into two components: a two-dimensional motion and a two-dimensional shape change. The motion component is factored out and the shape change is represented explicitly by a sequence of two-dimensional models, one corresponding to each image frame. The major assumption underlying the method is that the two-dimensional shape of an object will change slowly from one frame to the next. There is no assumption, however, that the two-dimensional image motion between successive frames will be small.<<ETX>>"

Thus, this distance can be used to determine the degree of resemblance between two objects that are superimposed on one another. Efficient algorithms for computing the Hausdorff distance between all possible relative positions of a binary image and a model are presented. The focus is primarily on the case in which the model is only allowed to translate with respect to the image. The techniques are extended to rigid motion. The Hausdorff distance computation differs from many other shape comparison methods in that no correspondence between the model and the image is derived. The method is quite tolerant of small position errors such as those that occur with edge detectors and other feature extraction methods. It is shown that the method extends naturally to the problem of comparing a portion of a model against an image. >"

The systems also deal primarily with textual information, but they may also entail images, voice, video or other data types that are part of multimedia information systems. Information filtering systems also involve a large amount of data and streams of incoming data, whether broadcast from a remote source or sent directly by other sources. Filtering is based on descriptions of individual or group information preferences, or profiles, that typically represent long-term interests. Filtering also implies removal of data from an incoming stream rather than finding data in the stream; users see only the data that is extracted. Models of information retrieval and filtering, and lessons for filtering from retrieval research are presented."
