                "text": "This paper examines the possibility of automatically discovering the lexieal features of a language. There is strong evidence that the set of possible lexical features which can be used in a language is unbounded, and thus not innate. Lakoff [Lakoff 87] describes a language in which the feature -I-woman-or-fire-ordangerons-thing exists. This feature is based upon ancient folklore of the society in which it is used. If the set of possible lexieal features is indeed unbounded, then it cannot be par t of the innate Universal Grammar and must be learned. Even if the set is not unbounded, the child is still left with the challenging task of determining which features are used in her language. If a child does not know a priori what lexical features are used in her language, there are two sources for acquiring this information: semantic and syntactic cues. A learner using semantic cues could recognize that words often refer to objects, actions, and properties, and from this deduce the lexical features: noun, verb and adjective. Pinker [Pinker 89] proposes that a combination of semantic cues and innate semantic primitives could account for the acquisition of verb features. He believes that the child can discover semantic properties of a verb by noticing the types of actions typically taking place when the verb is uttered. Once these properties are known, says Pinker, they can be used to reliably predict the distributional behavior of the verb. However, Gleitman [Gleitman 90] presents evidence that semantic cues axe not sufficient for a child to acquire verb features and believes that the use of this semantic information in conjunction with information about the subcategorization properties of the verb may be sufficient for learning verb features. This paper takes Glei tman's suggestion to the extreme, in hope of determining whether syntactic cues may not just aid in feature discovery, but may be all tha t is necessary. We present evidence for the sufficiency of a strictly syntax-based model for discovering"

It is commonly agreed that a poor encoding of the semantic lexicon is the bottleneck of many existing systems. A hand encoding of semantic knowledge on an extensive basis is not realistic; hence, it is important to devise methods by which such knowledge can be acquired in part or entirely by a computer. But what type of semantic knowledge could be automatically learned, from which sources, and by what methods? This paper explores the above issues and proposes an algorithm to learn syncategorematic concepts from text exemplars. What is learned about a concept is not its defining features, such as kinship, but rather its patterns of use.The knowledge acquisition method is based on learning by observations; observations are examples of word co-occurrences (collocations) in a large corpus, detected by a morphosyntactic analyzer. A semantic bias is used to associate collocations with the appropriate meaning relation, if one exists. Based upon single or multiple examples, the acquired knowledge is then generalized to create semantic rules on concept uses.Interactive human intervention is required in the training phase, when the bias is defined and refined. The duration of this phase depends upon the semantic closure of the sublanguage on which the experiment is carried out. After training, final approval by a linguist is still needed for the acquired semantic rules. At the current stage of experimentation of this system, it is unclear whether and when human supervision could be further reduced."

This paperl does not attempt to present a semantic theory of a natural language, but rather to characterize the form of such a theory. A semantic theory of a natural language is part of a linguistic description of that language. Our problem, on the other hand, is part of the general theory of language, fully on a par with the problem of characterizing the structure of grammars of natural languages. A characterization of the abstract form of a semantic theory is given by a metatheory which answers such questions as these: What is the domain of a semantic theory? What are the descriptive and explanatory goals of a semantic theory? What mechanisms are employed in pursuit of these goals? What are the empirical and methodological constraints upon a semantic theory? The present paper approaches the problem of characterizing the form of semantic theories by describing the structure of a semantic theory of English. There can be little doubt but that the results achieved will apply directly to semantic theories of languages closely related to English. The question of their applicability to semantic theories of more distant languages will be left for subsequent investigations to explore. Nevertheless, the present investigation will provide results that can be applied to semantic theories of languages unrelated to English and suggestions about how to proceed with the construction of such theories. We may put our problem this way: What form should a semantic theory of a natural language take to accommodate in the most revealing way the facts about the semantic structure of that language supplied by descriptive research? This question is of primary importance at the present stage of the development of semantics because semantics suffers not from a dearth of facts about meanings and meaning relations in natural languages, but rather from the lack of an adequate theory to organize, systematize, and generalize these facts. Facts about the semantics of natural languages have been contributed in abundance by many diverse fields, including philosophy, linguistics, philology, and \u2026"

                "text": "As a novel attack on the perennially vexing questions of the theoretical status of thematic roles and the inventory of possible roles, this paper defends a strategy of basing accounts of roles on more unified domains of linguistic data than have been used in the past to motivate roles, addressing in particular the problem of ARGUMENT SELECTION (principles determining which roles are associated with which grammatical relations). It is concluded that the best theory for describing this domain is not a traditional system of discrete roles (Agent, Patient, Source, etc.) but a theory in which the only roles are two cluster-concepts called PROTO-AGENT and PROTO-PATIENT, each characterized by a set of verbal entailments: an argument of a verb may bear either of the two proto-roles (or both) to varying degrees, according to the number of entailments of each kind the verb gives it. Both fine-grained and coarse-grained classes of verbal arguments (corresponding to traditional thematic roles and other classes as well) follow automatically, as do desired 'role hierarchies'. By examining occurrences of the 'same' verb with different argument configurations\u2014e.g. two forms of psych predicates and object-oblique alternations as in the familiar spray/load class\u2014it can also be argued that proto-roles act as defaults in the learning of lexical meanings. Are proto-role categories manifested elsewhere in language or as cognitive categories? If so, they might be a means of making grammar acquisition easier for the child, they might explain certain other typological and acquisitional observations, and they may lead to an account of contrasts between unaccusative and unergative intransitive verbs that does not rely on deriving unaccusatives from underlying direct objects."

Both quantitive and qualitative methods have been tried, but much of this work has been stymied by difficulties in acquiring appropriate lexical resources. The availability of this testing and training material has enabled us to develop quantitative disambiguation methods that achieve 92% accuracy in discriminating between two very distinct senses of a noun. In the training phase, we collect a number of instances of each sense of the polysemous noun. Then in the testing phase, we are given a new instance of the noun, and are asked to assign the instance to one of the senses. We attempt to answer this question by comparing the context of the unknown instance with contexts of known instances using a Bayesian argument that has been applied successfully in related tasks such as author identification and information retrieval. The proposed method is probably most appropriate for those aspects of sense disambiguation that are closest to the information retrieval task. In particular, the proposed method was designed to disambiguate senses that are usually associated with different topics."

The algorithm is novel in the sense that it not only learns rules for a given concept (classification), but it simultaneously learns rules relating multiple concepts. This type of learning, known as generalized rule induction, is considerably more general than existing algorithms, which tend to be classification oriented. Initially, it is focused on the problem of determining a quantitative, well-defined rule preference measure. In particular, a quantity called the J-measure is proposed as an information-theoretic alternative to existing approaches. The J-measure quantifies the information content of a rule or a hypothesis. The information theoretic origins of this measure are outlined, and its plausibility as a hypothesis preference measure is examined. The ITRULE algorithm, which uses the measure to learn a set of optimal rules from a set of data samples, is defined. Experimental results on real-world data are analyzed. >"

For each rule there are perfectly straightforward and indefinitely large classes of simple counterexamples. We then examine suggestions by Ford et al., Schubert and Hirst which are quasi-semantic in nature and which we consider ingenious but unsatisfactory. We offer a straightforward solution within the framework of preference semantics, and argue that the principal issue is not the type and nature of information required to get appropriate phrase attachments, but the issue of where to store the information and with what processes to apply it. We present a prolog implementation of a best first algorithm covering the data and contrast it with closely related ones, all of which are based on the preferences of nouns and prepositions, as well as verbs."

A completely naive parser will generate three parses for sentences of the form NP-V-Det-N-PP. The prepositions alone are insufficiently precise in meaning to guide selection among competing parses. The method is imbedded in the Kind Types System (KT) which employs commonsense knowledge of concepts, including prototype and inherent features (generic information) and ontological classifications. The generic information is drawn from published psycholinguistic studies on how average people typically view the world. This method is employed in preference strategies which appeal to the meaning of the preposition combined with information about the verbs and nouns associated with it drawn from the text and from the generic and ontological databases. These determine which syntactic structures generated by a semantically naive parser are commonsensically plausible. The method was successful in 93% of cases tested."

In addressing these issues, I will discuss what I think are some of the central problems facing the lexical semantics community, and suggest ways of best approaching these issues. Then, I will provide a method for the decomposition of lexical categories and outline a theory of lexical semantics embodying a notion of cocompositionality and type coercion, as well as several levels of semantic description, where the semantic load is spread more evenly throughout the lexicon. I argue that lexical decomposition is possible if it is performed generatively. Rather than assuming a fixed set of primitives. I will assume a fixed number of generative devices that can be seen as constructing semantic expressions. I develop a theory of Qualia Structure, a representation language for lexical items, which renders much lexical ambiguity in the lexicon unnecessary, while still explaining the systematic polysemy that words carry. Finally, I discuss how individual lexical structures can be integrated into the larger lexical knowledge base through a theory of lexical inheritance. This provides us with the necessary principles of global organization for the lexicon, enabling us to fully integrate our natural language lexicon into a conceptual whole."

I argue that a purely structural apprach, exemplified by probabilistic context-free grammar, lacks sufficient sensitivity to lexical context, and, conversely, that lexical co-occurence analyses require a richer notion of locality that is best provided by importing some notion of structure.I then propose probabilistic TAG as a framework for statistical language modelling, arguing that it provides an advantageous combination of structure, locality, and lexical sensitivity.

These lexical chains are a direct result of units of text being \"about the same thing,\" and finding text structure involves finding units of text that are about the same thing. Hence, computing the chains is useful, since they will have a correspondence to the structure of the text. Determining the structure of text is an essential step in determining the deep meaning of the text. In this paper, a thesaurus is used as the major knowledge base for computing lexical chains. Correspondences between lexical chains and structural elements are shown to exist. Since the lexical chains are computable, and exist in non-domain-specific text, they provide a valuable indicator of text structure. The lexical chains also provide a semantic context for interpreting words, concepts, and sentences."

Such patterns are typically needed to guide syntactic analysis (as selectional constraints) and to control the translation into a predicate-argument representation. As systems are ported to more complex domains, the set of patterns grows and the task of accumulating them manually becomes more formidable. There has therefore been increasing interest in acquiring such patterns automatically froin a sample of text in the domain, through an analysis of word co-occurrence patterns either in raw text (word sequences) or in parsed text. We briefly review some of this work later in the article. We have been specificaily concerned about the practicality of using such techniques in place of manual encoding to develop the selectional patterns for new domains. In the experiments reported here, we have therefore been particularly concerned with the evaluation of our automatically generated patterns, in terms of their completehess and accuracy and in terms of their efficacy in performing selection during parsing."

It normally takes a long time and requires painful trial and error processes to adapt knowledge, for example, in existing MT systems in order to translate documents of a new text-type and of a new subject domain. Semantic classification schemes for words, for example, usually reflect ontologies of subject domains so that we cannot expect a single classification scheme to be effective across different domains. To treat different suhlanguages requires different word classification schemes. We have to construct appropriate schemes for given sublanguages from scratch [1]. It has also been reported that not only knowledge concerned with extra-linguistic domains but also syntactic knowledge, such as subcategorization frames of verbs (which is usually conceived as a par t of general language knowledge), often varies from one sublanguage to another [2]. Though re-usability of linguistic knowledge is currently and intensively prescribed [3], our contention is that the adaptation of existing knowledge requires processes beyond mere re-use. Tha t is,"

An experimental system embodying this mechanism has been implemented for processing definitions from the Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English. A property of this dictionary, exploited by the system, is that it uses a restricted vocabulary in its word sense definitions. The structures generated by the experimental system are intended to be used for the classification of new word senses in terms of the senses of words in the restricted vocabulary. Examples illustrating the output generated are presented, and some qualitative performance results and problems that were encountered are discussed. The analysis process applies successively more specific phrasal analysis rules as determined by a hierarchy of patterns in which less specific patterns dominate more specific ones. This ensures that reasonable incomplete analyses of the definitions are produced when more complete analyses are not possible, resulting in a relatively robust analysis mechanism. Thus the work reported addresses two robustness problems faced by current experimental natural language processing systems: coping with an incomplete lexicon and with incomplete knowledge of phrasal constructions."

Words relate to each other in many different, often queer, ways: this information is rarely found in dictionaries, and it is quite hard to be invented a priori, despite the imagination that linguists exhibit at inventing esoteric examples.In this paper we present the results of an experiment in learning from corpora the frequent selectional restrictions holding between content words. The method is based on the analysis of word associations augmented with syntactic markers and semantic tags. Word pairs are extracted by a morphosyntactic analyzer and clustered according to their semantic tags. A statistical measure is applied to the data to evaluate the significance of a detected relation. Clustered association data render the study of word associations more interesting with several respects: data are more reliable even for smaller corpora, more easy to interpret, and have many practical applications in NLP."

This approach exploits the differences between mappings of words to senses in different languages. The paper concentrates on the problem of target word selection in machine translation, for which the approach is directly applicable. The presented algorithm identifies syntactic relations between words, using a source language parser, and maps the alternative interpretations of these relations to the target language, using a bilingual lexicon. The preferred senses are then selected according to statistics on lexical relations in the target language. The selection is based on a statistical model and on a constraint propagation algorithm, which simultaneously handles all ambiguities in the sentence. The method was evaluated using three sets of Hebrew and German examples and was found to be very useful for disambiguation. The paper includes a detailed comparative analysis of statistical sense disambiguation methods."

We have recently reported on two new word-sense disambiguation systems, one trained on bilingual material (the Canadian Hansards) and the other trained on monolingual material (Roget's Thesaurus and Grolier's Encyclopedia). As this work was nearing completion, we observed a very strong discourse effect. That is, if a polysemous word such as sentence appears two or more times in a well-written discourse, it is extremely likely that they will all share the same sense. This paper describes an experiment which confirmed this hypothesis and found that the tendency to share sense in the same discourse is extremely strong (98%). This result can be used as an additional source of constraint for improving the performance of the word-sense disambiguation algorithm. In addition, it could also be used to help evaluate disambiguation algorithms that did not make use of the discourse constraint."

Roget's categories serve as approximations of conceptual classes. The categories listed for a word in Roget's index tend to correspond to sense distinctions; thus selecting the most likely category provides a useful level of sense disambiguation. The selection of categories is accomplished by identifying and weighting words that are indicative of each category when seen in context, using a Bayesian theoretical framework.Other statistical approaches have required special corpora or hand-labeled training examples for much of the lexicon. Our use of class models overcomes this knowledge acquisition bottleneck, enabling training on unrestricted monolingual text without human intervention. Applied to the 10 million word Grolier's Encyclopedia, the system correctly disambiguated 92% of the instances of 12 polysemous words that have been previously studied in the literature."

In particular, we show how to organize an augmented transition network (ATN) and how to write lexical entries in order to compute presupposition and entailment.Presupposition and entailment are a subclass of inferences that seem to be tied to the structure of language. Distinguishing presupposition and entailment from the general class of inferences enables this subclass to be computed while parsing. This subclass of inferences is further distinguished in that they appear to be relatively independent of context."

Previous research i our lab demonstrated that argument structure influences the gap-filling process. Experiment I extended that work by demonstrating that dative verbs pattern with other complex transitive verbs (i.e., a fronted filler that is implausible as the direct object will not be interpreted as the direct object until the absence of a noun phrase after the verb forces the postulation of a direct object gap. This pattern contrasts with that of transitive verbs that subcategorize for a single internal argument position, where fronted fillers are obligatorily interpreted as the direct object). Experiments 2 and 3 investigate the prediction that semantic analyses precede syntactic analyses in dative questions. It is argued that the lexical information about argument structure and thematic roles can guide semantic interpretation."

                "text": "This thesis focuses on the Gold model of inductive inference from positive data. There are several aspects in which the model appears unsatisfactory for language learning: the class of families of learnable languages is highly restricted; even if a family is learnable, there exists no uniform method to obtain a learner for it, and the learner itself is complex. In this thesis, some such criticisms are being addressed. \nIt is shown that no automatic synthesis of a learner from the description of a learnable family is possible. Nevertheless, in some special cases, this synthesis can be achieved and a general result is developed. In order to make the learner simpler, it is stipulated that the learner can change its guess only when the guess is inconsistent with the input evidence. Such a conservative learner never overgeneralizes. Exactly learnable families are characterized for prudent learners with the following types of constraints: (0) conservative, (1) conservative and consistent, (2) conservative and responsive, and (3) conservative, consistent, and responsive. It is also shown that, when exactness is not required, prudence, consistency, and responsiveness, even together, do not restrict the power of conservative learners. \nConservative learners are simple in only one respect; even though it is easy to determine when to make a new guess, it is still hard to know what this guess should be. Finally, a learner that exploits pattern evident in the input is developed. Absence of a particular string over a suitable interval of the input can be viewed as a kind of 'indirect negative evidence'. Now, the learning criterion needs to be weakened to allow limited failure. It is shown that any family of languages can be learned with probability 1 from stochastic input, provided something is known about the probability distribution according to which the input is presented. Given the family, the learner is uniformly constructible. Further, the behavior of the learner is simpler in many aspects. It is expected that a variety of other natural constraints can be imposed on this learner without additional cost."

In this paper, a Generalized Probabilistic Semantic Model (GPSM) is proposed for preference computation. An effective semantic tagging procedure is proposed for tagging semantic features. A semantic score function is derived based on a score function, which integrates lexical, syntactic and semantic preference under a uniform formulation. The semantic score measure shows substantial improvement in structural disambiguation over a syntax-based approach."

Frazier and Rayner (1987, Journal of Memory and Language, 26, 505-526) argued that these ambiguities were resolved with a delay strategy that is not used for other ambiguities. Experiment l\u2032s self-paced reading data replicated Frazier & Rayner\u2032s results but also showed that evidence taken to support delay had other explanations. Experiment 2 investigated the influence of semantic biases on ambiguity resolution and found that three probabilistic factors influenced lexical category ambiguity resolution: (1) the relative frequency of head vs. modifying noun usage of a biasing noun, (2) the frequency of cooccurrence of a biasing noun and category ambiguous word in English, and (3) the combinatorial semantic information in the sentence. The extent to which alternative models account for the use of probabilistic information in ambiguity resolution is discussed."

Words are represented by the relative frequency distributions of contexts in which they appear, and relative entropy between those distributions is used as the similarity measure for clustering. Clusters are represented by average context distributions derived from the given words according to their probabilities of cluster membership. In many cases, the clusters can be thought of as encoding coarse sense distinctions. Deterministic annealing is used to find lowest distortion sets of clusters: as the annealing parameter increases, existing clusters become unstable and subdivide, yielding a hierarchical \"soft\" clustering of the data. Clusters are used as the basis for class models of word coocurrence, and the models evaluated with respect to held-out test data."

                "text": "The 1990s have witnessed a resurgence of interest in 1950s-style empirical and statistical methods of language analysis. Empiricism was at its peak in the 1950s, dominat ing a broad set of fields ranging from psychology (behaviorism) to electrical engineering (information theory). At that time, it was common practice in linguistics to classify words not only on the basis of their meanings but also on the basis of their cooccurrence with other words. Firth, a leading figure in British linguistics during the 1950s, summar ized the approach with the memorable line: \"You shall know a word by the company it keeps\" (Firth 1957). Regrettably, interest in empiricism faded in the late 1950s and early 1960s with a number of significant events including Chomsky 's criticism of n-grams in Syntactic Structures (Chomsky 1957) and Minsky and Papert 's criticism of neural networks in Perceptrons (Minsky and Papert 1969). Perhaps the most immediate reason for this empirical renaissance is the availability of massive quantities of data: more text is available than ever before. Just ten years ago, the one-million word Brown Corpus (Francis and Ku~era, 1982) was considered large, but even then, there were much larger corpora such as the Birmingham Corpus (Sinclair et al. 1987; Sinclair 1987). Today, many locations have samples of text running into the hundreds of millions or even billions of words. Collections of this magni tude are becoming widely available, thanks to data collection efforts such as the Association for Computat ional Linguistics' Data Collection Initiative (ACL/DCI), the European Corpus Initiative (ECI), ICAME, the British National Corpus (BNC), the Linguistic Data Consort ium (LDC), the Consort ium for Lexical Research (CLR), Electronic Dictionary Research (EDR), and standardization efforts such as the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI). 1 The data-intensive approach to language, which is becoming known as Text Analysis, takes a pragmatic approach that is well suited to meet the recent emphasis on numerical evaluations and concrete deliverables. Text Analysis focuses on broad ( though possibly superficial) coverage of unrestricted text, rather than deep analysis of (artificially) restricted domains."

Despite their similar syntactic sub-categorization, there are at least three different semantic subclasses that allow undergoer omission. Information sources based on surface structure, for example, syntactic bootstrapping, cannot inform the child of the semantic representation of these verbs. The focus of this paper is the acquisition of a single English verb, eat. The transcripts of 40 children, who were audiotaped monthly from 1;0 to 3;0, showed that eat was the first member of this verb class to be acquired. Some 1276 eat sentences were analysed for the presence of overt undergoer arguments across levels of cumulative verb lexicon (CVL) size, and two discourse conditions: (1) UNDERGOER ACCESSIBLE and (2) OPEN (to undergoer omission). Results indicate that undergoer omission became associated with discourse conditions when CVL size rose above 75 types, at MLU approximately 2\u00b74 and age approximately 2;3. This suggests that two-year-old children are sensitive to a relationship between undergoer omission and discourse context."

This paper sustains that claim by describing a set of computational tools and techniques used to disambiguate prepositional phrase attachments in English sentences, by accessing on-line dictionary definitions. Such techniques offer hope for eliminating the time-consuming, and often incomplete, hand coding of semantic information that has been conventional in natural language understanding systems."

                "text": "\"Generalized Phrase Structure Grammar\" provides the definitive exposition of the theory of grammar originally proposed by Gerald Gazdar and developed during half a dozen years' work with his colleagues Ewan Klein, Geoffrey Pullum, and Ivan Sag. This long-awaited book contains both detailed specifications of the theory and extensive illustrations of its power to describe large parts of English grammar. Experts who wish to evaluate the theory and students learning GPSP for the first time will find this book an invaluable guide.The initial chapters lay out the theoretical machinery of GPSP in a readily intelligible way. Combining informal discussion with precise formalization, the authors describe all major aspects of their grammatical system, including a complete theory of syntactic features, phrase structure rules, meta rules, and feature instantiation principles. The book then shows just what a GPSP analysis of English syntax can accomplish. Topics include the internal structure of phrases, unbounded dependency constructions of many varieties, and coordinate conjunction a construction long considered the sticking point for phrase structure approaches to syntax.The book concludes with a well developed proposal for a model theoretic semantic system to go along with GPSP syntax. Throughout, the authors maintain the highest standards of explicitness and rigor in developing and assessing their grammatical system. Their aim is to provide the best possible test of the hypothesis that syntactic description can be accomplished in a single-level system. And more generally, it is their intention to formulate a grammatical framework in which linguistic universals follow directly from the form of the system and therefore require no explicit statement. Their book sets new methodological standards for work in generative grammar while presenting a grammatical system of extraordinary scope.\""

                "text": "How do children learn the language-specific components of their native language? How is language grounded in perception? Knowledge of the meanings of utterances containing unknown words presumably aids children in the process of determining their meanings. A complete account of such a process must ultimately explain how children extract utterance meanings from their non-linguistic context. Algorithms are presented which utilize a cross-situational learning strategy whereby the learner finds a language model which is consistent across several utterances paired with their non-linguistic context. This allows the learner to acquire partial knowledge from ambiguous situations and combine it across situations to infer a unique language model. M scAIMRA learns word-to-meaning and word-to-category mappings from a corpus pairing utterances with sets of expressions representing the potential meanings of those utterances hypothesized by the learner from the non-linguistic context. M scAIMRA's syntactic theory is embodied in a fixed context-free grammar. D scAVRA extends M scAIMRA by replacing the context-free grammar with a parameterized variant of X theory. K scENUNIA incorporates a more comprehensive model of universal grammar supporting movement, adjunction, and empty categories, as well as more extensive parameterization of its X theory component. \nI advance three claims about event perception and the process of grounding language in visual perception. Notions of support, contact, and attachment play a central role in defining the meanings of simple spatial motion verbs in a way that delineates prototypical occurrences of events described by those verbs from non-occurrences. Support, contact, and attachment relations between objects are recovered from images by a process of counterfactual simulation. This imagination capacity, while superficially similar in intent to traditional kinematic simulation, is actually based on a drastically different foundation which takes naive physical constraints such as substantiality, continuity, and attachment relations between objects to be primary. This theory of event perception has been implemented in a program called A scBIGAIL which watches a computer-generated animated movie and produces a description of the objects and events which occur in that movie. A scBIGAIL's event perception processes rely on counter-factual simulation to recover changing support, contact, and attachment relations between objects.

This paper will propose an objective measure based on the information theoretic notion of mutual information, for estimating word association norms from computer readable corpora. (The standard method of obtaining word association norms, testing a few thousand subjects on a few hundred words, is both costly and unreliable.) The proposed measure, the association ratio, estimates word association norms directly from computer readable corpora, making it possible to estimate norms for tens of thousands of words."

There may be hundreds, perhaps thousands, of syntactic parse trees for certain very natural sentences of English. This fact has been a major problem confronting natural language processing, especially when a large percentage of the syntactic parse trees are enumerated during semantic/pragmatic processing. In this paper we propose some methods for dealing with syntactic ambiguity in ways that exploit certain regularities among alternative parse trees. These regularities will be expressed as linear combinations of ATN networks, and also as sums and products of formal power series. We believe that such encoding of ambiguity will enhance processing, whether syntactic and semantic constraints are processed separately in sequence or interleaved together."

Semantic similarity is estimated by subjective ratings; contextual similarity is estimated by the method of sorting sentential contexts. The results show an inverse linear relationship between similarity of meaning and the discriminability of contexts. This relation, is obtained for two separate corpora of sentence contexts. It is concluded that, on average, for words in the same language drawn from the same syntactic and semantic categories, the more often two words can be substituted into the same contexts the more similar in meaning they are judged to be."

                "text": "We describe a workbench (XTAG) for the development of tree-adjoining grammars and their parsers, and discuss some issues that arise in the design of the graphical interface.Contrary to string rewriting grammars generating trees, the elementary objects manipulated by a tree-adjoining grammar are extended trees (i.e. trees of depth one or more) which capture syntactic information of lexical items. The unique characteristics of tree-adjoining grammars, its elementary objects found in the lexicon (extended trees) and the derivational history of derived trees (also a tree), require a specially crafted interface in which the perspective has shifted from a string-based to a tree-based system. XTAG provides such a graphical interface in which the elementary objects are trees (or tree sets) and not symbols (or strings).The kernel of XTAG is a predictive left to right parser for unification-based tree-adjoining grammar [Schabes, 1991]. XTAG includes a graphical editor for trees, a graphical tree printer, utilities for manipulating and displaying feature structures for unification-based tree-adjoining grammar, facilities for keeping track of the derivational history of TAG trees combined with adjoining and substitution, a parser for unification based tree-adjoining grammars, utilities for defining grammars and lexicons for tree-adjoining grammars, a morphological recognizer for English (75 000 stems deriving 280 000 inflected forms) and a tree-adjoining grammar for English that covers a large range of linguistic phenomena.Considerations of portability, efficiency, homogeneity and ease of maintenance, lead us to the use of Common Lisp without its object language addition and to the use of the X Window interface to Common Lisp (CLX) for the implementation of XTAG.XTAG without the large morphological and syntactic lexicons is public domain software. The large morphological and syntactic lexicons can be obtained through an agreement with ACL's Data Collection Initiative.XTAG runs under Common Lisp and X Window (CLX)."

It addresses two issues: Can connectionist models develop representations which possess internal structure and which provide the basis for productive and systematic behavior; and Can representations which are fundamentally context-sensitive support grammatical behavior which appears to be abstract and general? Results from two simulations are reported.. The simulations address problems in the distinction between type and token, the representation of lexical categories, and the representation of grammatical structure. The results suggest that connectionist representations can indeed possess internal structure and enable systematic behavior, and that a mechanism which is sensitive to context is capable of capturing generalizations of varying degrees of abstractness."

If the conjunctive structures existing in a long sentence can be analyzed correctly, ambiguities can be reduced greatly and a sentence can be parsed in a high successful rate. Since the prior part and the posterior part of a conjunctive structure have a similar structure very often, finding two similar series of words is an essential point in solving this problem. Similarities of all pairs of words are calculated and then the two series of words which have the greatest sum of similarities are found by a technique of dynamic programming. We deal with not only conjunctive noun phrases, but also conjunctive predicative clauses created by \"Renyoh chuushi-ho\". We will illustrate the effectiveness of this method by the analysis of 180 long Japanese sentences."

The approach is to take advantage of implicit higher-order structure in the association of terms with documents (\u201csemantic structure\u201d) in order to improve the detection of relevant documents on the basis of terms found in queries. The particular technique used is singular-value decomposition, in which a large term by document matrix is decomposed into a set of ca. 100 orthogonal factors from which the original matrix can be approximated by linear combination. Documents are represented by ca. 100 item vectors of factor weights. Queries are represented as pseudo-document vectors formed from weighted combinations of terms, and documents with supra-threshold cosine values are returned. initial tests find this completely automatic method for retrieval to be promising."

These hypotheses are shown to be incompatible with the hypotheses underlying traditional cognitive models. The connectionist models considered are massively parallel numerical computational systems that are a kind of continuous dynamical system. The numerical variables in the system correspond semantically to fine-grained features below the level of the concepts consciously used to describe the task domain. The level of analysis is intermediate between those of symbolic cognitive models and neural models. The explanations of behavior provided are like those traditional in the physical sciences, unlike the explanations provided by symbolic models. Higher-level analyses of these connectionist models reveal subtle relations to symbolic models. Parallel connectionist memory and linguistic processes are hypothesized to give rise to processes that are describable at a higher level as sequential rule application. At the lower level, computation has the character of massively parallel satisfaction of soft numerical constraints; at the higher level, this can lead to competence characterizable by hard rules. Performance will typically deviate from this competence since behavior is achieved not by interpreting hard rules but by satisfying soft constraints. The result is a picture in which traditional and connectionist theoretical constructs collaborate intimately to provide an understanding of cognition."

In other experiment the authors have investigated whether a distributional analysis can discover a part of speech tag set which might prove adequate to support experiments. The state of a tagged natural language corpus to aid such experiments is summarized.<<ETX>>"

The range of work to which statistical analysis is applicable is vast: including, for example, language acquisition, language variation and many aspects of applied linguistics. The authors give a wide variety of linguistic examples to demonstrate the use of statistics in summarising data in the most appropriate way, and then making helpful inferences from the processed information. The range of techniques introduced by the book will help the reader both to evaluate and make use of literature which employs statistical analysis, and to apply statistics in their own research. Each chapter gives step-by-step explanations of particular techniques using examples from a number of fields, and is followed by extensive exercises. The early part of the book provides a thorough grounding in probability and statistical inference, and then progresses through methods such as chi-squared and analysis of variance, to multivariate methods such as cluster analysis, principal components analysis and factor analysis. None of these techniques requires the reader to have a grasp of mathematics more complex than simple algebra. Students and researchers in many fields of linguistics will find this book an invaluable introduction to the use of statistics, and a practical text for the development of skills in the application of statistics."

[Class 132 (ii).] The reinforcing ring at the mouth of a golfclub bag is made in two or more parts so interconnected that they may be moved relatively to expand or contract the compass of the mouth. As shown in the Figure, the ring is composed of two bars 12, 13 h n ed together at their right-hand ends and pivoted at their other ends to links 17, 18 hinged together at 19. By pressing the links 17, 18 downwards the ends 12, 13 of the bars may be brought together and the links may be retained in this position by a catch. A rigid reinforcing ring may be provided at the base of the bag or a collapsable one similar to that at the mouth may be used. The bag is provided with flexible stiffeners 21, 22, carrying straps 26, 27, hood 25, dividing strap 24, and umbrella strap 31 and support 32."

                "text": "Mental Models offers nothing less than a unified theory of the major properties of mind: comprehension, inference, and consciousness. In spirited and graceful prose, Johnson-Laird argues that we apprehend the world by building inner mental replicas of the relations among objects and events that concern us. The mind is essentially a model-building device that can itself be modeled on a digital computer. This book provides both a blueprint for building such a model and numerous important illustrations of how to do it. In several key areas of cognition, Johnson-Laird shows how an explanation based on mental modeling is clearly superior to previous theory. For example, he argues compellingly that deductive reasoning does not take place by tacitly applying the rules of logic, but by mentally manipulating models of the states of affairs from which inferences are drawn. Similarly, linguistic comprehension is best understood not as a matter of applying inference rules to propositions derived from sentences, but rather as the mind's effort to construct and update a model of the situation described by a text or a discourse. Most provocative, perhaps, is Johnson-Laird's theory of consciousness: the mind's necessarily incomplete model of itself allows only a partial control over the many unconscious and parallel processes of cognition. This an extraordinarily rich book, providing a coherent account of much recent experimental work in cognitive psychology, along with lucid explanations of relevant theory in linguistics, computer science, and philosophy Not since Miller, Galanter, and Pribram's classic Plans and the Structure of Behavior has a book in cognitive science combined such sweep, style, and good sense. Like its distinguished predecessor, Mental Models may well serve to fix a point of view for a generation. (http://books.google.fr/books?id=FS3zSKAfLGMC&printsec=frontcover&hl=fr#v=onepage&q&f=false)"

                "text": "Time underlies many interesting human behaviors. Thus, the question of how to represent time in connectionist models is very important. One approach is to represent time implicitly by its effects on processing rather than explicitly (as in a spatial representation). The current report develops a proposal along these lines first described by Jordan (1986) which involves the use of recurrent links in order to provide networks with a dynamic memory. In this approach, hidden unit patterns are fed back to themselves; the internal representations which develop thus reflect task demands in the context of prior internal states. A set of simulations is reported which range from relatively simple problems (temporal version of XOR) to discovering syntactic/semantic features for words. The networks are able to learn interesting internal representations which incorporate task demands with memory demands; indeed, in this approach the notion of memory is inextricably bound up with task processing. These representations reveal a rich structure, which allows them to be highly context-dependent while also expressing generalizations across classes of items. These representations suggest a method for representing lexical categories and the type/token distinction."

Specifically, the problem is to estimate the probability that a given word will be the next word uttered. Algorithms are presented for automatically constructing a binary decision tree designed to estimate these probabilities. At each node of the tree there is a yes/no question relating to the words already spoken, and at each leaf there is a probability distribution over the allowable vocabulary. Ideally, these nodal questions can take the form of arbitrarily complex Boolean expressions, but computationally cheaper alternatives are also discussed. Some results obtained on a 5000-word vocabulary with a tree designed to predict the next word spoken from the preceding 20 words are included. The tree is compared to an equivalent trigram model and shown to be superior. >"

The recent history of expert systems, for example highlights how constricting the brittleness and knowledge acquisition bottlenecks are. Moreover, standard software methodology (e.g., working from a detailed \"spec\") has proven of little use in AI, a field which by definition tackles ill- structured problems. How can these bottlenecks be widened? Attractive, elegant answers have included machine learning, automatic programming, and natural language understanding. But decades of work on such systems have convinced us that each of these approaches has difficulty \"scaling up\" for want a substantial base of real world knowledge."

                "text": "ABSTRACT It is often assumed that children go through a stage in which they systematically overapply irregular past tense patterns to inappropriate verbs, as in wipe-wope, bring-brang, trick-truck, walk-has walken. Such errors have been interpreted both as reflecting over-use of minor grammatical rules (e.g. \u2018change i to a\u2019), and as reflecting the operation of a connectionist pattern associator network that superimposes and blends patterns of various degrees of generality. But the actual rate, time course, and nature of these errors have never been documented. We analysed 20,000 past tense and participle usages from nine children in the CHILDES database, looking for overapplications of irregular vowel-change patterns, as in brang, blends, as in branged, productive suffixations of -en, as in walken, gross distortions, as in mail-membled, and double-suffixation, as in walkeded. These errors were collectively quite rare; children made them in about two tenths of one per cent of the opportunities, and with few stable patterns: the errors were not predominantly word-substitutions, did not occur predominantly with irregular stems, showed no consistency across verbs or ages, and showed no clear age trend. Most (though not all) of the errors were based closely on existing irregular verbs; gross distortions never occurred. We suggest that both rule-theories and connectionist theories have tended to overestimate the predominance of such errors. Children master irregular forms quite accurately, presumably because irregular forms are just a special case of the arbitrary sound-meaning pairings that define words, and because children are good at learning words."

The current research takes the approach of asking whether the prosodic characteristics that are distinctive to motherese could play a special role in facilitating the acquisition of syntax. Hirsh-Pasek, Kemler Nelson, Jusczyk, Cassidy, Druss & Kennedy (1987) showed that infants aged 0;7\u20130;10 are sensitive to prosodic cues that would help them segment the speech stream into perceptual units that correspond to clauses. The present study shows that infants' sensitivity to segment-marking cues in ongoing speech holds for motherese but not for adult-directed speech. The finding is that, for motherese only, infants orient longer to speech that has been interrupted at clausal boundaries than to matched speech that has been interrupted at within-clause locations. This selective preference indicates that the prosodie qualities of motherese provide infants with cues to units of speech that correspond to grammatical units of language \u2013 a potentially fundamental contribution of motherese to the learning of syntax."

This new technology led to major breakthroughs in the quality of both data and theory. The field is now at the threshold of a possible second major breakthrough stimulated by the dissemination of personal computing. Researchers are now able to transcribe tape-recorded data into computer files. With this new medium it is easy to conduct global searches for word combinations across collections of files. It is also possible to enter new codings of the basic text line. Because of the speed and accuracy with which computer files can be copied, it is now much easier to share data between researchers. To foster this sharing of computerized data, a group of child language researchers has established the Child Language Data Exchange System (CHILDES). This article details the formation of the CHILDES, the governance of the system, the nature of the database, the shape of the coding conventions, and the types of computer programs being developed."

The paper concludes with a discussion of my most recent work in the area of modelling memory. It presents a theory of MOPs (Memory Organization Packets), which serve as both processors and organizers of information in memory. This enables effective categorization of experiences in episodic memory, which in turn enables better predictive understanding of new experiences."

The method is an adapted version of the letter-guessing procedure originally devised by Shannon [Bell Syst. Tech. J. 30, 50-64 (1951)]. It is applied to sentences included in a widely used test to measure speech-reception thresholds and originally selected to be approximately equally redundant. Results of a first experiment reveal that this method enables one to detect subtle differences between sentences and sentence lists with respect to linguistic entropy. Results of a second experiment show that (1) in young listeners and with the sentences employed, manipulating linguistic entropy can result in an effect on SRT of approximately 4 dB in terms of signal-to-noise ratio; (2) the range of this effect is approximately the same in elderly listeners."

                "text": "Language research thrives on data collected from spontaneous interactions in naturally occurring situations. However, the process of collecting, transcribing, and analyzing naturalistic data can be extremely time-consuming and often unreliable. This book describes three basic tools for language analysis of transcript data by computer that have been developed in the context of the \"Child Language Data Exchange System (CHILDES)\" project. These are: the \"CHAT\" transcription and coding format, the \"CLAN\" package of analysis programs, and the \"CHILDES\" database. These tools have brought about significant changes in the way research is conducted in the child language field. They are being used with great success by researchers working with second language learning, adult conversational interactions, sociological content analyses, and language recovery in aphasia, as well as by students of child language development. The tools are widely applicable, although this book concentrates on their use in the child language field, believing that researchers from other areas can make the necessary analogies to their own topics. This thoroughly revised 2nd edition includes documentation on a dozen new computer programs that have been added to the basic system for transcript analysis. The most important of these new programs is the \"CHILDES\" Text Editor (CED) which can be used for a wide variety of purposes, including editing non-Roman orthographies, systematically adding codes to transcripts, checking the files for correct use of \"CHAT,\" and linking the files to digitized audio and videotape. In addition to information on the new computer programs, the manual documents changed the shape of the \"CHILDES/BIB\" system--given a major update in 1994--which now uses a new computer database system. The documentation for the \"CHILDES\" transcript database has been updated to include new information on old corpora and information on more than a dozen new corpora from many different languages. Finally, the system of \"CHAT\" notations for file transcript have been clarified to emphasize the ways in which the codes are used by particular \"CLAN\" programs. The new edition concludes with a discussion of new directions in transcript analysis and links between the \"CHILDES\" database and other developments in multimedia computing and global networking. It also includes complete references organized by research topic area for the more than 300 published articles that have made use of the \"CHILDES\" database and/or the \"CLAN\" programs. LEA also distributes the \"CLAN\" programs and the complete \"CHILDES\" Database--including corpora from several languages and discourse situations--described in \"The CHILDES Project.\" Be sure to choose the correct platform (IBM or Macintosh) for the \"CLAN\" programs; the \"CHILDES\" Database CD-ROM runs on both platforms."
