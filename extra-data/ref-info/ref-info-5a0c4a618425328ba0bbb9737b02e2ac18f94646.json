                "text": "Nervous activity has been recorded from the unopened eye of decerebrate cats. Recordings were made with metal electrodes or with small micropipettes from ganglion cells or nerve fibers. Continuous maintained discharges were seen in all ganglion cells during steady illumination of their receptive fields, as well as in complete darkness. Possible artefacts, such as electrode pressure, abnormal circulation, anesthetic, and several other factors have been excluded as the source of the maintained discharge. Visual stimuli are therefore transmitted by modulating the ever present background activity. Discharge frequencies were measured following changes of retinal illumination. No consistent patterns of frequency change were found. The maintained discharge frequency may be permanently increased or decreased, or may remain practically unchanged by altering the steady level of illumination. In addition, there were often transient frequency changes during the first 5 to 10 minutes after changing illumination, before a final steady rate was established. A statistical analysis of the impulse intervals of the maintained discharge showed: (a) the intervals were distributed according to the gamma distribution (Pearson's type III), (b) the first serial correlation coefficient of the intervals was between \u20130.10 and \u20130.24, with a mean value of \u20130.17, which is significantly different from zero, (c) the higher order serial correlation coefficients were not significantly different from zero. Thus the firing probability at any time depends on the times of occurrence of the two preceding impulses only, and in such a way as to indicate that each impulse is followed by a transient depression of excitability that outlasts the following impulse. The possible sites at which spontaneous or maintained activity may originate in the retina are discussed."

The drop in threshold was rather small compared to that found in human dark adaptation, and the final threshold reached was not nearly as low as one would expect in an eye adapted for nocturnal vision. Pirenne (1954) has emphasized that there is a big discrepancy (a factor of 103-106) between the lowest threshold obtained by electro-physiological methods and the much lower thresholds found by psychophysical methods in humans (Hecht, Shlaer & Pirenne, 1942). In addition, the existence of a random maintained discharge from retinal ganglion cells (Kuffler, FitzHugh & Barlow, 1957) raises some doubts about the relative parts played by the retina and the central nervous system in determining thresholds. We therefore set out to measure the absolute threshold of the large type of ganglion cell (Rushton, 1949) isolated by metallic micro-electrodes of the type used by Granit & Svaetichin (1939). The opportunity was taken of following threshold through the period of dark adaptation, and some observations of the Purkinje shift were made."

                "text": "THE DISCHARGES carried in the optic nerve fibers contain all the information which the central nervous system receives from the retina. A correct interpretation of discharge patterns therefore constitutes an important step in the analysis of visual events. Further, investigations of nervous activity arising in the eye reveal many aspects of the functional organization of the neural elements within the retina itself. Following studies of discharges in the optic nerve of the eel\u2019s eye by Adrian and Matthews (2,3), Hartline and his colleagues described the discharge pattern in the eye of the Limulus in a series of important and lucid papers (for a summary see 20). In the Limulus the relationship between the stimulus to the primary receptor cell and the nerve discharges proved relatively simple, apparently because the connection between sense cell and nerve fiber was a direct one. Thus, when stimulation is confined to one receptor the discharge in a single Limulus nerve fiber will provide a good indication of excitatory events which take place as a result of photochemical processes. Discharges last for the duration of illumination and their frequency is a measure of stimulus strength. Lately, however, it was shown by Hartline et al. (22) that inhibitory interactions may be revealed when several receptors are excited. On the whole, the Limulus preparation shows many features which are similar to other simple sense organs, for instance, stretch receptors. In the latter, however, instead of photochemical events, stretch-deformation acts as the adequate stimulus on sensory terminals and is translated into a characteristic discharge pattern. The discharge from the cold-blooded vertebrate retina (mainly frogs) proved much more complex. Hartline found three main types when recording from single optic nerve fibers: (i) \u201con\u201d discharges, similar to those in the Limulus, firing for the duration of the light stimulus, (ii) \u201coff\u201d discharges appearing when a light stimulus was withdrawn, and (iii) \u2018con-off\u201d discharges, a combination of the former two, with activity confined mainly to onset and cessation of illumination. The mammalian discharge patterns were studied in a number of species by Granit and his co-workers in the course of their extensive work on the physiology of the visual system (summaries in 13, 15). On the whole, they did not observe any fundamental differences between frog and mammalian discharge types (see later)."

                "text": "Appreciation of the form of the retinal image depends upon a correspondence between the distribution of light on the retina and the distribution of activity among the fibers of the optic nerve. This correspondence may be studied directly by recording the activity in single optic nerve fibers in response to illuminating various parts of the retina. A given optic nerve fiber responds to light only if a particular region of the retina receives illumination. This region is termed the receptive field of that fiber. In a previous paper describing the responses in single optic nerve fibers from the cold-blooded vertebrate eye (Hartline, 1938) it was noted that the receptive fields of the optic nerve fibers are of small but appreciable extent, and that their locations on the retina are fixed. It is the purpose of the present paper to describe further the characteristics of receptive fields, and to discuss some of the spatial factors involved in the excitation of the fibers of the optic nerve. METHOD. The method for recording the activity in single optic nerve fibers from the eyes of cold-blooded vertebrates has been described in the previous paper (lot. cit.). An eye is excised, cut open, and small bundles of optic nerve fibers are dissected from the anterior surface of the exposed retina. The action potentials in these bundles are amplified and recorded with an oscillograph. When such a bundle has been split successfully , until only a single active fiber remains, the retina must be searched with a small spot of light to determine the region supplying that fiber. This search is aided by noting the direction, on the retina, from which the nerve fibers in the small bundle come, and by using large spots of light at first to locate the approximate position of the sensitive region. The optical system employed in these experiments has likewise been described. A spot of light of suitable size is projected upon the exposed retina; the coordinates of its position, referred to an arbitrary point of origin on the retina, are obtained from readings of crossed micrometers which control its location. The micrometer readings are reduced to millimeters on the retina by multiplying them by the magnification of the optical system (0.32 or 0.15). Sharpness of focus of the spot on the retina 690"

By comparing fields mapped by the two methods we may gain some idea of how asymmetries in responses to movement originate. We may find, for example, that a cortical unit which responds differently to rightward and leftward movements has a stationary-spot receptive field in which the inhibitory and excitatory areas are specifically arranged, differing from the usual symmetry of retinal fields. With a knowledge of stationary-spot fields it may be possible to predict movement asymmetries. If, as this work suggests, some units do not respond at all to stationary spots, it may become necessary to use more elaborate methods, such as a pair of spots spaced a variable distance apart and timed so that one precedes and conditions the response to the other. The observation that movement can activate a unit over a relatively large region of the visual field-of the order of 200 (5 mm on the retina) and perhaps more-suggests that convergence from a large retinal field must occur on some cortical units. This has already been suggested on anatomical grounds by O'Leary (1941). One must conclude that the striate cortex is not simply a retinotopically organized 'point-to-point' relay station along the visual pathway."

Wiesel & Brown (1958) have shown that such a rise in threshold is especially marked in ganglion cells of the cat's area centralis. This may be relevant to the present work, since recordings were presumably made from the corresponding cortical area. In view of the suggestion of similarity in responses of cortical and retinal units, it is curious that changes in response type were not observed on stimulating peripheral parts of receptive fields. Specifically, 'on'-type responses were not observed to give way to 'off'-responses, and vice versa, when the spot was moved from the most sensitive area to closely adjacent regions. This has been seen in the great majority of ganglion cells in the light-adapted cat retina. With the present light-stimulation methods, in the unrestrained preparation, it has been possible to change discharge types of optic tract neurones, in confirmation of the findings of Kuffler and his co-workers. Thus the method itself is capable of demonstrating the phenomenon. However, even at the ganglion-cell level the inhibitory surround is spread over a large region compared with the concentrated centre, and peripheral-type responses are best produced with annular stimuli. In the cortex the phenomenon may be reproducable only by using special stimuli confined to a large portion of the inhibitory region-whether annular or not one cannot say, since one has no idea of the shape of cortical receptive fields. That some cortical elements respond to restricted light stimuli is consistent with the observations of Thompson, Woolsey & Talbot (1950) and Talbot & Marshall (1941), that localized cortical slow waves are evoked in response to restricted light stimuli in anaesthetized rabbits, cats, and monkeys."
