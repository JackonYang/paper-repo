Suppose now that we ask a subject to name a member of a category, and some time later ask him to name a different member of that category. Will the speed with which he retrieves the second instance depend at all on his having retrieved the first instance? Several recent lines of investigation suggest that producing an instance of a category will facilitate later production of another instance of that category. In one such investigation, Collins and Quillian (1970) presented sentences such as 'A canary is a bird' and required subjects to decide whether the sentences were true or false. Prior exposure to one sentence reduced reaction time to a second sentence, sometimes by as much as 600 msec, whenever the same subject noun was used. For example, prior exposure to 'A canary is a bird' reduced reaction time to other sentences about canaries."

This model is built up within a computer by 'recoding' a body of information from an ordinary dictionary into a complex network of elements and associations. Then the ability of a program to use the resulting model memory effectively for simulating human performance provides a test of its design. One simulation program, now running, is given the model memory and is required to compare and contrast the meanings of arbitrary pairs of English words. For each pair, the program locates any relevant semantic information within the model memory, draws inferences on the basis of this, and thereby discovers various relationships between the meanings of the two words. Finally, it creates English text to express its conclusions. The design principles embodied in the memory model together with some of the methods used by the program constitute a theory of how human memory for semantic and other conceptual material may be formatted, organized, and used.

They are very damaging to the category-search model. There are two reasons why spreadingactivation theory predicts that atypical instances will take longer to categorize than typical instances. The most important reason derives from the way evidence is aggregated (see Assumptions 8-13). Because different connections that are found are combined as evidence, distinguishing properties can slow down a positive decision based on a superordinate connection or on matching properties. For example, the decision that a chicken is a bird (i.e., an atypical instance) might be made on the basis of a superordinate connection from \"chicken\" to \"bird,\" which people learn because chickens are frequently referred to as birds. But the fact that people eat chickens, that they are raised on farms, and that they are rather large are all properties that distinguish chickens from most birds. If these distinguishing properties are found during the memory search, as some are likely to be, they act to slow down the positive decision, because they are negative evidence. Similarly, matching properties can slow down a negative decision. For example, the decision that a goose is not a duck might be made on the basis of the difference in their necks (a distinguishing property) or simply because they are stored as mutually exclusive kinds of birds (see Assumption 12), but the matching properties that are found (e.g., their affinity to ponds, their webbed feet, their large size) will slow down the decision that they are different. The argument here is similar to that of Smith et al. (1974), which we will discuss in comparing the two theories."

It also maintains that all human meaning may be exhaustively represented in terms of readings on a practically infinite number of calibrated standards, or, alternatively, by elaborate constellations of readings on a very small number of \u201celement\u201d standards. It is proposed that representing the meanings of natural language words in terms of such constellations is to represent them in a medium appropriate to serve as a mechanical equivalent of human understanding, at least for the purposes of mechanical translation. Such representation of meaning would also permit the overall body of semantic information to be stratified in accord with the dimensional complexity of concepts. This would allow encyclopedic amounts of information about the meaning of each natural language word to be stored in memory for use when a decision dependent on \u201cunderstanding\u201d arose, while at the same time only very brief summational symbols of this information would ordinarily be adequate as a translation interlingua. Several general characteristics of such representation and storage of semantic information, and some of the standards possibly usable as element standards, are described."

The second approach, however, enables systematic analysis of the influence of various environments and test situations on behavior of the species. The existence of interactions between variables does not imply that general statements cannot be made about genetic , age, or environmental factors per se. Significant main effects may still be the primary concern of the investigator and may frequently emerge. The value of such results increases considerably, however, if it is known that the effect occurs over a wide range of conditions and if the investigator is aware of specific interactions. How is symbolic information retrieved from recent memory? The study of short-term memory (1) has revealed some of the determinants of failures to remember, but has provided little insight into error-free performance and the retrieval processes that underlie it. One reason for the neglect of retrieval mechanisms may be the implicit assumption that a short time after several items have been memorized, they can be immediately and simultaneously available for expression in recall or in other responses, rather than having to be retrieved first. In another vocabulary (2), this is to assume the equivalence of the \"span of immediate mem-ory\" (the number of items that can be recalled without error) and the \"mo-mentary capacity of consciousness\" (the number of items immediately available). The experiments reported here (3) show that the assumption is unwarranted. Underlying the paradigm of these experiments is the supposition that if the selection of a response requires the use of information that is in memory, the latency of the response will reveal something about the process by which 652 References and Notes 1. 6. A longer, more detailed paper describing the complete study, including diallel cross and correlation analyses and a discussion of specific gamete, treatment, and sex effects is in preparation. Among previously undisturbed mice, mode of inheritance interacts with sex, and dominance appears within sexes. This finding is consist-ant with the results of J. H. Bruell: \"Mode of inheritance of emotional defecation in mice,\" unpublished. E the information is retrieved. Of particular interest in the study of retrieval is the effect of the number of elements in memory on the response latency. The subject first memorizes a short series of symbols. He is then shown a test stimulus, and is required to decide whether or not it \u2026"

Recently Loftus (Note 2) has found two different ways in which presenting a letter acts differently from presenting an adjective, in variations of the Freedman and Loftus paradigm. This has led her to the development of a dictionary-network model, which we will translate into spreading-activation terms. The first difference between presenting a letter and an adjective appeared when Grober and Loftus (1974) compared reaction time in two conditions: one where noun-adjective (e.g., \"fruit-red\") and nounletter (e.g., \"fruit-A\") trials were randomly intermixed, and one where nounadjective and noun-letter trials were separated into blocks. In all cases the noun preceded the adjective or letter. The results of this experiment are shown in Figure 2. It is clear that when the subject knows a letter is coming, he can prepare for it. But in the mixed condition, the subject apparently prepares for either kind of trial the same way he prepares for an adjective trial, since adjective trials take the same amount of time in either case. The theory's description of semantic processing on the adjective trials is the same as that given earlier for the Freedman and Loftus (1971) experiment, with the amendment that only the semantic network and not the lexical network would be diffusely primed before the adjective is presented."

Bartlett both used stories in research on complex cognitive skills in children and adults. However, with the advent of Ebbinghaus' monumental work on memory using \"nonsense syllables,\" theoretical psychology turned away from the use of meaningful material. With the use of nonsense syllables, researchers hoped to isolate the variables of memory and individual content associations. Recently, there has been a renewal of interest in the study of narrative and memory due to the recognition that narrative taps certain processes that syllables and isolated words do not. In addition, narrative and memory studies have generated interest among those researchers concerned with the applicability of memory studies to educational settings.

When text which the program has not seen before is input to it, it comprehends that text by correctly relating each (explicit or implicit) assertion of the new text to a large memory. This memory is a \u201csemantic network\u201d representing factual assertions about the world.\nThe program also creates copies of the parts of its memory which have been found to relate to the new text, adapting and combining these copies to represent the meaning of the new text. By this means, the meaning of all text the program successfully comprehends is encoded into the same format as that of the memory. In this form it can be added into the memory.\nBoth factual assertions for the memory and the capabilities for correctly relating text to the memory's prior content are to be taught to the program as they are needed. TLC presently contains a relatively small number of examples of such assertions and capabilities, but within the system, notations for expressing either of these are provided. Thus the program now corresponds to a general process for comprehending language, and it provides a methodology for adding the additional information this process requires to actually comprehend text of any particular kind.\nThe memory structure and comprehension process of TLC allow new factual assertions and capabilities for relating text to such stored assertions to generalize automatically. That is, once such an assertion or capability is put into the system, it becomes available to help comprehend a great many other sentences in the future. Thus the addition of a single factual assertion or linguistic capability will often provide a large increment in TLC's effective knowledge of the world and in its overall ability to comprehend text.\nThe program's strategy is presented as a general theory of"
