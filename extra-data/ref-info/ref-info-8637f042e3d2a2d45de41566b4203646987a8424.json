By adequate adaptive preprocessing it can be supposed that the observed source mixture x is 'white'. Then a separating matrix H (such that y=Hx has independent components) can be assumed unitary. A new contrast function is defined whose maximum occurs when H is separating. Its (simple) form admits an associated adaptive algorithm. Two different algorithms are proposed to estimate H, either directly or through its equivalent product of Givens rotations. Computer simulations illustrate the contribution of the cross-cumulants on the convergence of the algorithms. In the three-sources case, they show that the performances are improved substantially.<<ETX>>"

The first method is specially adapted to temporally independent non-Gaussian sources and is based on the use of nonlinear separating functions. The second method is specially adapted to correlated sources with distinct spectra and is based on the use of linear separating filters. A theoretical analysis of the performance of the methods has been made. A simple procedure for optimally choosing the separating functions is proposed. Further, in the second method, a simple implementation based on the simultaneous diagonalization of two symmetric matrices is provided. Finally, some numerical and simulation results are given, illustrating the performance of the method and the good agreement between the experiments and the theory."

It is proven analytically that decorrelating the output signals at different time lags is sufficient provided that the normalised autocorrelation functions of the source signals are sufficiently distinct. The method involves an iterative least-squares solution of a set of nonlinear equations. Alternatively, a gradient search algorithm can also be used to find the minimum of the sum of squares of these equations. Both time- and frequency-domain formulations are given. Some convergence and stability issues are discussed and a small example is given at the end.<<ETX>>"

It is shown that the channel can be blindly identified if and only if there is not more than one Gaussian source. This condition suggests that waveform-preserving blind estimation can be achieved over a wide range of signal processing applications, including those cases in which the source signals have identical nonGaussian distributions. The constructive proof of the necessary and sufficient condition serves as a foundation for the development of waveform-preserving blind signal estimation algorithms.

In the absence of multiple paths, this gain matching consists of a linear combination of signals received by the antenna sensors. One of the most generally used methods for this modeling is to separate the source signals. The sources can be discriminated by making use of the fundamental differences between the source signals: decorrelation; different powers; different spectra; and statistical independence. The two first points require traditional source signal separation methods. They consist of orthogonalizing sensor signals. These are substantially sub-optimal. The last two points, that is to say spectral differences and statistical independence, have led the authors to develop original separation methods. There are very nearly optimal."

The key point is to use estimates of directional vectors rather than resort to their hypothesised value. By using estimates of the directional vectors obtained via blind identification, i.e. without knowing the array manifold, beamforming is made robust with respect to array deformations, distortion of the wave front, pointing errors etc., so that neither array calibration nor physical modelling is necessary. Rather suprisingly, \u2018blind beamformers\u2019 may outperform \u2018informed beamformers\u2019 in a plausible range of parameters, even when the array is perfectly known to the informed beamformer. The key assumption on which blind identification relies is the statistical independence of the sources, which is exploited using fourth-order cumulants. A computationally efficient technique is presented for the blind estimation of directional vectors, based on joint diagonalisation of fourth-order cumulant matrices; its implementation is described, and its performance is investigated by numerical experiments."

Each point is the average of 10 experiments. to estimate the cross-cumulants. Each point in Fig. 1 corresponds to the average over 10 experiments, in which the mixing matrix is randomly chosen: The matrix entries mC3 (i # j) are random numbers in the range [-1, +1]. With 500 samples, a residual crosstalk of about-20 dB is obtained. In the case of nonstationary signals, cross-cumulant estimation must be done on few samples and has a larger variance. Consequently, it can lead to more inaccurate estimation of the mixing matrix. We still obtained an interesting performance: a residual crosstalk of about-15 to-20 dB, with various signals (colored noise, speech) and statistics estimated over 500 samples. In this correspondence, we proved that the mixing matrix can be. estimated using fourth-ordercross-cumulants, for two mixtures of two non-Gaussian sources. Solutions are obtained by rooting a fourth-order polynomial equation. Using second-order cross-cumulants allows us to simplify the method; the solution is then obtained by rooting two second-order polynomial equations and gives the result if one source is Gaussian. The methods are then quite simple, but its roots are very sensitive to the accuracy of the estimated cumulants. In fact, this direct solution is less accurate than indirect methods, especially adaptive a l g o r i b s. Moreover, we restricted the study to the separation of two sources, and theoretical solutions for three sources or more seems not easily tractable. However, in the case of two mixtures of two sources, it may give a good starting point with a small computation cost for any adaptive algorithm. REFERENCES J.-F.

There exist counterexamples which show existence of false local maxima when finite-length equalizers are used. Finally, it is also noted that in the presence of additive Gaussian noise of unknown power spectral density at the input to the equalizer (equivalently, at the channel output), it is not clear if the methods proposed in the paper will yield the desired response up to a constant gain. >"

These diverse areas echo the classes of models which conveniently describe each corresponding system. Thus although there can hardly be a \"general theory of adaptive systems\" encompassing both the modelling task and the design of the adaptation procedure, nevertheless, these diverse issues have a major common component: namely the use of adaptive algorithms, also known as stochastic approximations in the mathematical statistics literature, that is to say the adaptation procedure (once all modelling problems have been resolved). The juxtaposition of these two expressions in the title reflects the ambition of the authors to produce a reference work, both for engineers who use these adaptive algorithms and for probabilists or statisticians who would like to study stochastic approximations in terms of problems arising from real applications. Hence the book is organised in two parts, the first one user-oriented, and the second providing the mathematical foundations to support the practice described in the first part. The book covers the topcis of convergence, convergence rate, permanent adaptation and tracking, change detection, and is illustrated by various realistic applications originating from these areas of applications."

A mathematical structure is formulated from which the acceptable indeterminacy is represented by an equivalence relation. The concept of identifiability is then defined. Two identifiable cases are shown along with blind identification algorithms. The performance of FOBI (fourth-order blind identification), EFOBI (extended FOBI), and AMUSE algorithms is evaluated by some heuristic arguments and simulation results. It is shown that EFOBI outperforms the FOBI algorithm, and the AMUSE algorithm performs better than EFOBI in the case of nonwhite source signals. AMUSE is applied to a speech extraction problem and shown to have promising results. >"
