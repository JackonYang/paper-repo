The saliency measure incorporates the Gestalt principles of proximity and good continuity that previous methods have also exploited. Unlike previous methods, we incorporate contour closure by finding the eigenvector with the largest positive real eigenvalue of a transition matrix for a Markov process where edges from the image serve as states. Element (i, j) of the transition matrix is the conditional probability that a contour which contains edge j will also contain edge i. We show how the saliency measure, defined for individual edges, can be used to derive a saliency relation, defined for pairs of edges, and further show that strongly-connected components of the graph representing the saliency relation correspond to smooth closed contours in the image. Finally, we report for the first time, results on large real images for which segmentation takes an average of about 10 seconds per object on a general-purpose workstation."

                "text": "Existing methods for grouping edges on the basis of local smoothness measures fail to compute complete contours in natural images: it appears that a stronger global constraint is required. Motivated by growing evidence that the human visual system exploits contour closure for the purposes of perceptual grouping [6, 7, 14, 15, 25], we present an algorithm for computing highly closed bounding contours from images. Unlike previous algorithms [11, 18, 26], no restrictions are placed on the type of structure bounded or its shape. Contours are represented locally by tangent vectors, augmented by image intensity estimates. A Bayesian model is developed for the likelihood that two tangent vectors form contiguous components of the same contour. Based on this model, a sparsely-connected graph is constructed, and the problem of computing closed contours is posed as the computation of shortest-path cycles in this graph. We show that simple tangent cycles can be efficiently computed in natural images containing many local ambiguities, and that these cycles generally correspond to bounding contours in the image. These closure computations can potentially complement region-grouping methods by extending the class of structures segmented to include heterogeneous structures."

A probabilistic formulation of contours demands a prior model and a measurement model. From the image statistics of boundary contours, we derive both the prior model of contour shape and the local likelihood model of image measurements. We observe multi-scale phenomena in the data, and accordingly propose a higher-order Markov model over scales for the contour continuity prior. Various image cues derived from orientation energy are evaluated and incorporated into the measurement model. Based on these models, we have designed a multi-scale algorithm for contour completion, which exploits both contour continuity and texture. Experimental results are shown on a wide range of images."

We formulate features that respond to characteristic changes in brightness, color, and texture associated with natural boundaries. In order to combine the information from these features in an optimal way, we train a classifier using human labeled images as ground truth. The output of this classifier provides the posterior probability of a boundary at each image location and orientation. We present precision-recall curves showing that the resulting detector significantly outperforms existing approaches. Our two main results are 1) that cue combination can be performed adequately with a simple linear model and 2) that a proper, explicit treatment of texture is required to detect boundaries in natural images."

Unlike previous theories, our model is derived from a single assumption: that the prior probability distribution of boundary completion shape can be modeled by a random walk in a lattice whose points are positions and orientations in the image plane (i.e., the space that one can reasonably assume is represented by neurons of the mammalian visual cortex). Our model does not employ numerical relaxation or other explicit minimization, but instead relies on the fact that the probability that a particle following a random walk will pass through a given position and orientation on a path joining two boundary fragments can be computed directly as the product of two vector-field convolutions. We show that for the random walk we define, the maximum likelihood paths are curves of least energy, that is, on average, random walks follow paths commonly assumed to model the shape of illusory contours. A computer model is demonstrated on numerous illusory contour stimuli from the literature."

Approaches to grouping based on invariants assume objects are in restricted classes, while those based on minimal energy continuations assume a shape for the missing contours and require this shape to drive the grouping process. While these assumptions may be appropriate for certain specific tasks or when contour gaps are small, in general occlusion can give rise to large gaps, and thus long-distance contour fragment grouping is a different type of perceptual organization problem. We propose the long-distance principle that those fragments should be grouped whose fragmentation could have arisen from a shared, simple occluder. The gap skeleton is introduced as a representation of this virtual occluder, and an algorithm for computing it is given. Finally, we show that a view of the virtual occluder as a disk can be interpreted as an equivalence class of curves interpolating the fragment endpoints."

Edges are first detected in the original image using a combination of operators for intensity gra- dient and texture discontinuities. To preserve the spatial coherence of the edges and their surrounding image regions, the detected edges are vectorized into connected line segments which serve as the basis for a constrained Delaunay triangulation. Segmentation is first performed on the triangulation using graph cuts. Our method favors segmentations that pass through more vectorized line segments. Finally, the obtained segmentation on the triangulation is projected onto the original image and region boundaries are refined to achieve pixel accuracy. Experimen- tal results show that the two-level approach can achieve accurate edge localization, better spatial coherence and improved efficiency."

As defined in the new measure, the saliency of an edge is the fraction of closed random walks which contain that edge. The transition-probability matrix defining the random walk between edges is based on a distribution of natural shapes modeled by a stochastic motion. Each of the saliency measures in our comparison is a function of a set of affinity values assigned to pairs of edges. Although the authors of each measure define the affinity between a pair of edges somewhat differently, all incorporate the Gestalt principles of good-continuation and proximity in some form. In order to make the comparison meaningful, we use a single definition of affinity and focus instead on the performance of the different functions for combining affinity values. The primary performance criterion is accuracy. We compute false-positive rates in classifying edges as signal or noise for a large set of test figures. In almost every case, the new measure significantly outperforms previous measures."

An efficient method of computing this distance is developed, based on a multi-resolution tessellation of the space is possible transformations of the model set. One of the key ideas is that entire cells in this tessellation can be ruled out quickly, without actually computing the Hausdorff distance for many of them. Emphasis is placed on the case in which the model is allowed to translate and scale (independently in x and y) with respect to the image. This four-dimensional transformation space is searched rapidly while guaranteeing that no match will be missed. Some examples of identifying an object in a cluttered scene are presented, including cases where the object is partially hidden from view.<<ETX>>"

In this framework, the detection and recognition of objects proceed simultaneously with image segmentation in a competitive and cooperative manner. We illustrate our approach on natural images of complex city scenes where the objects of primary interest are faces and text. This method makes use of bottom-up proposals combined with top-down generative models using the Data Driven Markov Chain Monte Carlo (DDMCMC) algorithm which is guaranteed to converge to the optimal estimate asymptotically. More precisely, we define generative models for faces, text, and generic regions\u2013 e.g. shading, texture, and clutter. These models are activated by bottom-up proposals. The proposals for faces and text are learnt using a probabilistic version of AdaBoost. The DDMCMC combines reversible jump and diffusion dynamics to enable the generative models to explain the input images in a competitive and cooperative manner. Our experiments illustrate the advantages and importance of combining bottom-up and top-down models and of performing segmentation and object detection/recognition simultaneously."

The inference procedure is divided into two stages: a trace inference stage, which is the subject of the present work, and a curve synthesis stage. It is shown that recovery of the trace of a curve requires estimating local models for the curve at the same time, and that tangent and curvature information are sufficient. These make it possible to specify powerful constraints between estimated tangents to a curve, in terms of a neighborhood relationship called cocircularity, and between curvature estimates, in terms of a curvature consistency relation. Because all curve information is quantized, special care must be taken to obtain accurate estimates of trace points, tangents, and curvatures. This issue is addressed specifically to the introduction of a smoothness constraint and a maximum curvature constraint. The procedure is applied to two types of images: artificial images designed to evaluate curvature and noise sensitivity, and natural images. >"

In particular, spectral clustering methods such as \"normalized cuts\" (ncuts) can efficiently calculate good segmentations using eigenvector calculations. However, spectral methods when applied to images with local connectivity often oversegment homogenous regions. More importantly, they lack a straightforward probabilistic interpretation which makes it difficult to automatically set parameters using training data. In this paper we revisit the typical cut criterion proposed by Blatt et al. (1997) and Gdalyahu et al (2001). We show that computing the typical cut is equivalent to performing inference in an undirected graphical model. This equivalence allows us to use the powerful machinery of graphical models for learning and inferring image segmentations. For inferring segmentations we show that the generalized belief propagation (GBP) algorithm can give excellent results with a runtime that is usually faster than the ncut eigensolver. For learning segmentations we derive a maximum likelihood learning algorithm to learn affinity matrices from labelled datasets. We illustrate both learning and inference on challenging real and synthetic images."

The matching is performed in a series of images depicting the same scene with different resolutions, i.e. in a resolution pyramid. Using this hierarchical structure reduces the computational load significantly. The algorithm is reasonably simple to implement and is insensitive to noise and other disturbances. The algorithm has been tested in several applications. Two of them are briefly presented. In the first application the outlines of common tools are matched to gray-level images of the same tools, with overlapping. In the second application lake edges from aerial photographs are matched to lake edges from a map, with translation, rotation, scale, and perspective changes. The hierarchical chamfer matching algorithm gives correct results using a reasonable amount of computational resources in all tested applications. >"

The features are incorporated into a probabilistic framework, which combines the outputs of several components. Components differ in the information they encode. Some focus on the image-label mapping, while others focus solely on patterns within the label field. Components also differ in their scale, as some focus on fine-resolution patterns while others on coarser, more global structure. A supervised version of the contrastive divergence algorithm is applied to learn these features from labeled image data. We demonstrate performance on two real-world image databases and compare it to a classifier and a Markov random field."

The discriminative random fields offer several advantages over the conventional Markov random field (MRF) framework. First, the DRFs allow to relax the strong assumption of conditional independence of the observed data generally used in the MRF framework for tractability. This assumption is too restrictive for a large number of applications in vision. Second, the DRFs derive their classification power by exploiting the probabilistic discriminative models instead of the generative models used in the MRF framework. Finally, all the parameters in the DRF model are estimated simultaneously from the training data unlike the MRF framework where likelihood parameters are usually learned separately from the field parameters. We illustrate the advantages of the DRFs over the MRF framework in an application of man-made structure detection in natural images taken from the Corel database."

In this study, we conducted experiments in which human participants trace perceived contours in natural images. These contours are automatically mapped to sequences of discrete tangent elements detected in the image. By examining relational properties between pairs of successive tangents on these traced curves, and between randomly selected pairs of tangents, we are able to estimate the likelihood distributions required to construct an optimal Bayesian model for contour grouping. We employed this novel methodology to investigate the inferential power of three classical Gestalt cues for contour grouping: proximity, good continuation, and luminance similarity. The study yielded a number of important results: (1) these cues, when appropriately defined, are approximately uncorrelated, suggesting a simple factorial model for statistical inference; (2) moderate image-to-image variation of the statistics indicates the utility of general probabilistic models for perceptual organization; (3) these cues differ greatly in their inferential power, proximity being by far the most powerful; and (4) statistical modeling of the proximity cue indicates a scale-invariant power law in close agreement with prior psychophysics."

In our framework, the measurement of similarity is preceded by (1) solving for correspondences between points on the two shapes, (2) using the correspondences to estimate an aligning transform. In order to solve the correspondence problem, we attach a descriptor, the shape context, to each point. The shape context at a reference point captures the distribution of the remaining points relative to it, thus offering a globally discriminative characterization. Corresponding points on two similar shapes will have similar shape contexts, enabling us to solve for correspondences as an optimal assignment problem. Given the point correspondences, we estimate the transformation that best aligns the two shapes; regularized thin-plate splines provide a flexible class of transformation maps for this purpose. Dis-similarity between two shapes is computed as a sum of matching errors between corresponding points, together with a term measuring the magnitude of the aligning transform. We treat recognition in a nearest-neighbor classification framework. Results are presented for silhouettes, trademarks, handwritten digits and the COIL dataset."

The approach that we take is to use segmentation to guide our recognition algorithm to salient bits of the image. We use this segmentation approach to build limb and torso detectors, the outputs of which are assembled into human figures.

When the graph is singly connected, local propagation rules of the sort proposed by Pearl (1988) are guaranteed to converge to the correct posterior probabilities. Recently a number of researchers have empirically demonstrated good performance of these same local propagation schemes on graphs with loops, but a theoretical understanding of this performance has yet to be achieved. For graphical models with a single loop, we derive an analytical relationship between the probabilities computed using local propagation and the correct marginals. Using this relationship we show a category of graphical models with loops for which local propagation gives rise to provably optimal maximum a posteriori assignments (although the computed marginals will be incorrect). We also show how nodes can use local information in the messages they receive in order to correct their computed marginals. We discuss how these results can be extended to graphical models with multiple loops and show simulation results suggesting that some properties of propagation on single-loop graphs may hold for a larger class of graphs. Specifically we discuss the implication of our results for understanding a class of recently proposed error-correcting codes known as turbo codes."

Conditional random fields also avoid a fundamental limitation of maximum entropy Markov models (MEMMs) and other discriminative Markov models based on directed graphical models, which can be biased towards states with few successor states. We present iterative parameter estimation algorithms for conditional random fields and compare the performance of the resulting models to HMMs and MEMMs on synthetic and natural-language data."

                "text": "In the words of the authors, the goal of this book was to \u201cbring together many of the important new ideas in learning, and explain them in a statistical framework.\u201d The authors have been quite successful in achieving this objective, and their work is a welcome addition to the statistics and learning literatures. Statistics has always been interdisciplinary, borrowing ideas from diverse \u008e elds and repaying the debt with contributions, both theoretical and practical, to the other intellectual disciplines. For statistical learning, this cross-fertilization is especially noticeable. This book is a valuable resource, both for the statistician needing an introduction to machine learning and related \u008e elds and for the computer scientist wishing to learn more about statistics. Statisticians will especially appreciate that it is written in their own language. The level of the book is roughly that of a second-year doctoral student in statistics, and it will be useful as a textbook for such students. In a stimulating article, Breiman (2001) argued that statistics has been focused too much on a \u201cdata modeling culture,\u201d where the model is paramount. Breiman argued instead for an \u201calgorithmic modeling culture,\u201d with emphasis on black-box types of prediction. Breiman\u2019s article is controversial, and in his discussion, Efron objects that \u201cprediction is certainly an interesting subject, but Leo\u2019s paper overstates both its role and our profession\u2019s lack of interest in it.\u201d Although I mostly agree with Efron, I worry that the courses offered by most statistics departments include little, if any, treatment of statistical learning and prediction. (Stanford, where Efron and the authors of this book teach, is an exception.) Graduate students in statistics certainly need to know more than they do now about prediction, machine learning, statistical learning, and data mining (not disjoint subjects). I hope that graduate courses covering the topics of this book will become more common in statistics curricula. Most of the book is focused on supervised learning, where one has inputs and outputs from some system and wishes to predict unknown outputs corresponding to known inputs. The methods discussed for supervised learning include linear and logistic regression; basis expansion, such as splines and wavelets; kernel techniques, such as local regression, local likelihood, and radial basis functions; neural networks; additive models; decision trees based on recursive partitioning, such as CART; and support vector machines. There is a \u008e nal chapter on unsupervised learning, including association rules, cluster analysis, self-organizing maps, principal components and curves, and independent component analysis. Many statisticians will be unfamiliar with at least some of these algorithms. Association rules are popular for mining commercial data in what is called \u201cmarket basket analysis.\u201d The aim is to discover types of products often purchased together. Such knowledge can be used to develop marketing strategies, such as store or catalog layouts. Self-organizing maps (SOMs) involve essentially constrained k-means clustering, where prototypes are mapped to a two-dimensional curved coordinate system. Independent components analysis is similar to principal components analysis and factor analysis, but it uses higher-order moments to achieve independence, not merely zero correlation between components. A strength of the book is the attempt to organize a plethora of methods into a coherent whole. The relationships among the methods are emphasized. I know of no other book that covers so much ground. Of course, with such broad coverage, it is not possible to cover any single topic in great depth, so this book will encourage further reading. Fortunately, each chapter includes bibliographic notes surveying the recent literature. These notes and the extensive references provide a good introduction to the learning literature, including much outside of statistics. The book might be more suitable as a textbook if less material were covered in greater depth; however, such a change would compromise the book\u2019s usefulness as a reference, and so I am happier with the book as it was written."
