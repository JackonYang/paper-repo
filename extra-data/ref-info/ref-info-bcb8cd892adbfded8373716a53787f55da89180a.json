In the first step, edge feature and morphology operation are employed to locate edge-dense image blocks. Empirically rules are applied on these blocks to get candidate text. In the second step, wavelet-based features are employed to represent the texture property of text. A SVM classifier is used to identify text from the candidate ones. Experiments show that this algorithm has 93.9% detection rate for English text and a 92.4% detection rate for Chinese text. The algorithm is robust to language, font-color and size."

If these text occurrences could be detected, segmented, and recognized automatically, they would be a valuable source of high-level semantics for indexing and retrieval. We propose a novel method for localizing and segmenting text in complex images and videos. Text lines are identified by using a complex-valued multilayer feed-forward network trained to detect text at a fixed scale and position. The network's output at all scales and positions is integrated into a single text-saliency map, serving as a starting point for candidate text lines. In the case of video, these candidate text lines are refined by exploiting the temporal redundancy of text in video. Localized text lines are then scaled to a fixed height of 100 pixels and segmented into a binary image with black characters on white background. For videos, temporal redundancy is exploited to improve segmentation performance. Input images and videos can be of any size due to a true multiresolution approach. Moreover, the system is not only able to locate and segment text occurrences into large binary images, but is also able to track each text line with sub-pixel accuracy over the entire occurrence in a video, so that one text bitmap is created for all instances of that text line. Therefore, our text segmentation results can also be used for object-based video encoding such as that enabled by MPEG-4."

No external texture feature extraction module is used, but rather the intensities of the raw pixels that make up the textural pattern are fed directly to the SVM, which works well even in high-dimensional spaces. Next, text regions are identified by applying a continuously adaptive mean shift algorithm (CAMSHIFT) to the results of the texture analysis. The combination of CAMSHIFT and SVMs produces both robust and efficient text detection, as time-consuming texture analyses for less relevant pixels are restricted, leaving only a small part of the input image to be texture-analyzed."

The performance of our automatic text location algorithm is shown in several applications.

In this work, we present algorithms for detecting and tracking text in digital video. Our system implements a scale-space feature extractor that feeds an artificial neural processor to detect text blocks. Our text tracking scheme consists of two modules: a sum of squared difference (SSD)-based module to find the initial position and a contour-based module to refine the position. Experiments conducted with a variety of video sources show that our scheme can detect and track text robustly."

Many efforts have been made for videotext detection and recognition (video OCR). The main difficulties of video OCR are the low resolution and the background complexity. We present efficient schemes to deal with the second difficulty by sufficiently utilizing multiple frames that contain the same text to get every clear word from these frames. Firstly, we use multiple frame verification to reduce text detection false alarms. We then choose those frames where the text is most likely clear, thus it is more possible to be correctly recognized. We then detect and joint every clear text block from those frames to form a clearer \"man-made\" frame. Later we apply a block-based adaptive thresholding procedure on these \"man-made\" frames. Finally, the binarized frames are sent to an OCR engine for recognition. Experiments show that the word recognition rate has been increased over 28% by these methods."

The assignment is based on prior of the contextual information, which is modeled by a Markov random field (MRF) with online estimated coefficients. Each layer is then processed through a connected component analysis module and forwarded to the OCR system as one segmentation hypothesis. By varying the number of gaussians, multiple hypotheses are provided to an OCR system and the final result is selected from the set of outputs, leading to an improvement of the system's performances."

To achieve this goal, we present a technique, called Video OCR (Optical Character Reader), which detects, extracts, and reads text areas in digital video data. In this paper, we address problems, describe the method by which Video OCR operates, and suggest applications for its use in digital news archives. To solve two problems of character recognition for videos, low-resolution characters and extremely complex backgrounds, we apply an interpolation filter, multi-frame integration and character extraction filters. Character segmentation is performed by a recognition-based segmentation method, and intermediate character recognition results are used to improve the segmentation. We also include a method for locating text areas using text-like properties and the use of a language-based postprocessing technique to increase word recognition rates. The overall recognition results are satisfactory for use in news indexing. Performing Video OCR on news video and combining its results with other video understanding techniques will improve the overall understanding of the news video content."

To reduce the amount of small variations in color, a clustering algorithm is applied in a preprocessing step. Two methods have been developed for extracting text hypotheses. One is based on a top-down analysis using successive splitting of image regions. The other is a bottom-up region growing algorithm. The results of both methods are combined to robustly distinguish between text and non-text elements. Text elements are binarized using automatically extracted information about text color. The binarized text regions can be used as input for a conventional OCR module. Results are shown for parts of book and journal covers of different complexity. The proposed method is not restricted to cover pages, but can be applied to the extraction of text from other types of color images as well."

Segmenting characters is done by a recognition-based segmentation method and intermediate character recognition results are used to improve the segmentation.

After extracting a reference text block, we use an image matching technique to find the corresponding text blocks in consecutive frames.

The registered text blocks are averaged to obtain a new text block with a clean background and a higher resolution.

However, there is still a lack of performance evaluation protocols for video text detection. In this paper, we propose an objective and comprehensive performance evaluation protocol for video text detection algorithms. The protocol includes a positive set and a negative set of indices at the textbox level, which evaluate the detection quality in terms of both location accuracy and fragmentation of the detected textboxes. In the protocol, we assign a detection difficulty (DD) level to each ground truth textbox. The performance indices can then be normalized with respect to the textbox DD level and are therefore tolerant to different ground-truth difficulties to a certain degree. We also assign a detectability index (DI) value to each ground-truth textbox. The overall detection rate is the DI-weighted average of the detection qualities of all ground-truth textboxes, which makes the detection rate more accurate to reveal the real performance. The automatic performance evaluation scheme has been applied to performance evaluation of a text detection approach to determine the best thresholds that can yield the best detection results. The protocol has also been employed to compare the performances of several text detection systems. Hence, we believe that the proposed protocol can be used to compare the performance of different video/image text detection algorithms/systems and can even help improve, select, and design new text detection methods."

In a first step we perform feature reduction by choosing relevant image features according to a measure derived from statistical learning theory. In a second step we build a hierarchy of classifiers. On the bottom level, a simple and fast classifier analyzes the whole image and rejects large parts of the background On the top level, a slower but more accurate classifier performs the final detection. Experiments with a face detection system show that combining feature reduction with hierarchical classification leads to a speed-up by a factor of 170 with similar classification performance."

By analyzing the statistical pixel changes in the sequence, we can effectively locate the (dis)appealing frames of captions. Finally we extract the captions to create a summary of the video segment."

We conjecture that texture can be characterized by the statistics of these coe cients and introduce 2 feature sets for this purpose: the wavelet histogram signatures and the wavelet cooccurrence signatures. Using a model based approach, we show that all rst order statistics of the wavelet detail coe cients can be captured in the wavelet histogram signatures. Further improvement in texture characterization can be obtained from the coefcients second order statistics, which are re ected in the wavelet cooccurrence signatures. We verify experimentally the validity of the model for the detail histogram and compare the introduced feature sets to the traditionally used energy signatures in a classi cation experiment. Best classi cation performance is shown to be achieved by combining histogram and cooccurrence signatures."

In this paper, we present a formal Bayesian framework for videotext recognition by combining multiple knowledge using mixture models, and describe a learning approach based on Expectation-Maximization (EM). In order to handle unseen words, a back-off smoothing approach derived from the Bayesian model is also presented. We exploited a prototype that fuses the model from closed caption and that from the British National Corpus. The model from closed caption is based on a unique time distance distribution model of videotext words and closed caption words. Our method achieves a significant performance gain, with word recognition rate of 76.8% and character recognition rate of 86.7%. The proposed methods also reduce false videotext detection significantly, with a false alarm rate of 8.2% without substantial loss of recall."

A trained classifier determines, based on the difference feature vector measurements, whether or not a human face exists at the current image location.

Among the various frameworks in which pattern recognition has been traditionally formulated, the statistical approach has been most intensively studied and used in practice. More recently, neural network techniques and methods imported from statistical learning theory have been receiving increasing attention. The design of a recognition system requires careful attention to the following issues: definition of pattern classes, sensing environment, pattern representation, feature extraction and selection, cluster analysis, classifier design and learning, selection of training and test samples, and performance evaluation. In spite of almost 50 years of research and development in this field, the general problem of recognizing complex patterns with arbitrary orientation, location, and scale remains unsolved. New and emerging applications, such as data mining, web searching, retrieval of multimedia data, face recognition, and cursive handwriting recognition, require robust and efficient pattern recognition techniques. The objective of this review paper is to summarize and compare some of the well-known methods used in various stages of a pattern recognition system and identify research topics and applications which are at the forefront of this exciting and challenging field."

The properties of the operator which approximates a signal at a given resolution were studied. It is shown that the difference of information between the approximation of a signal at the resolutions 2/sup j+1/ and 2/sup j/ (where j is an integer) can be extracted by decomposing this signal on a wavelet orthonormal basis of L/sup 2/(R/sup n/), the vector space of measurable, square-integrable n-dimensional functions. In L/sup 2/(R), a wavelet orthonormal basis is a family of functions which is built by dilating and translating a unique function psi (x). This decomposition defines an orthogonal multiresolution representation called a wavelet representation. It is computed with a pyramidal algorithm based on convolutions with quadrature mirror filters. Wavelet representation lies between the spatial and Fourier domains. For images, the wavelet representation differentiates several spatial orientations. The application of this representation to data compression in image coding, texture discrimination and fractal analysis is discussed. >"
