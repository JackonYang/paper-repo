Local belief propagation rules of the sort proposed by Pearl (1988) are guaranteed to converge to the correct posterior probabilities in singly connected graphs. Recently, good performance has been obtained by using these same rules on graphs with loops, a method we refer to as loopy belief propagation. Perhaps the most dramatic instance is the near Shannon-limit performance of Turbo codes, whose decoding algorithm is equivalent to loopy propagation. Except for the case of graphs with a single loop, there has been little theoretical understanding of loopy propagation. Here we analyze belief propagation in networks with arbitrary topologies when the nodes in the graph describe jointly gaussian random variables. We give an analytical formula relating the true posterior probabilities with those calculated using loopy propagation. We give sufficient conditions for convergence and show that when belief propagation converges, it gives the correct posterior means for all graph topologies, not just networks with a single loop. These results motivate using the powerful belief propagation algorithm in a broader class of networks and help clarify the empirical performance results."

Recently, a n umber of researchers have empirically demonstrated good performance of these same algorithms on networks with loops, but a theoretical understanding of this performance has yet to be achieved. Here we l a y a foundation for an understanding of belief propagation in networks with loops. For networks with a single loop, we derive an analytical relationship between the steady state beliefs in the loopy network and the true posterior probability. Using this relationship we show a category of networks for which the MAP estimate obtained by belief update and by belief revision can be proven to be optimal (although the beliefs will be incorrect). We s h o w h o w nodes can use local information in the messages they receive in order to correct the steady state beliefs. Furthermore we p r o ve that for all networks with a single loop, the MAP estimate obtained by belief revision at convergence is guaranteed to give the globally optimal sequence of states. The result is independent of the length of the cycle and the size of the state space. For networks with multiple loops, we i n troduce the concept of a \\balanced network\" and show simulation results comparing belief revision and update in such networks. We show t h a t t h e T urbo code structure is balanced and present simulations on a toy T urbo code problem indicating the decoding obtained by belief revision at convergence is signiicantly more likely to be correct.

The max-product \"belief propagation\" algorithm is a local-message-passing algorithm on this graph that is known to converge to a unique fixed point when the graph is a tree. Furthermore, when the graph is a tree, the assignment based on the fixed point yields the most probable values of the unobserved variables given the observed ones. Good empirical performance has been obtained by running the max-product algorithm (or the equivalent min-sum algorithm) on graphs with loops, for applications including the decoding of \"turbo\" codes. Except for two simple graphs (cycle codes and single-loop graphs) there has been little theoretical understanding of the max-product algorithm on graphs with loops. Here we prove a result on the fixed points of max-product on a graph with arbitrary topology and with arbitrary probability distributions (discrete- or continuous-valued nodes). We show that the assignment based on a fixed point is a \"neighborhood maximum\" of the posterior probability: the posterior probability of the max-product assignment is guaranteed to be greater than all other assignments in a particular large region around that assignment. The region includes all assignments that differ from the max-product assignment in any subset of nodes that form no more than a single loop in the graph. In some graphs, this neighborhood is exponentially large. We illustrate the analysis with examples."

Formalisms for manipulating these models have been developed relatively independently in these research communities. In this paper we explore hidden Markov models (HMMs) and related structures within the general framework of probabilistic independence networks (PINs). The paper presents a self-contained review of the basic principles of PINs. It is shown that the well-known forward-backward (F-B) and Viterbi algorithms for HMMs are special cases of more general inference algorithms for arbitrary PINs. Furthermore, the existence of inference and estimation algorithms for more general graphical models provides a set of analysis tools for HMM practitioners who wish to explore a richer class of HMM structures. Examples of relatively complex models to handle sensor fusion and coarticulation in speech recognition are introduced and treated within the graphical model framework to illustrate the advantages of the general approach."

In this context, we are able to show that, under certain conditions, the algorithm converges and that-somewhat surprisingly-though the density generated by belief propagation may differ significantly from the desired posterior density, the means of these two densities coincide. Since computation of posterior distributions is tractable when densities are Gaussian, use of belief propagation in such a setting may appear unwarranted. Indeed, our primary motivation for studying belief propagation in this context stems from a desire to enhance our understanding of the algorithm's dynamics in a non-Gaussian setting, and to gain insights into its excellent performance in turbo codes. Nevertheless, even when the densities are Gaussian, belief propagation may sometimes provide a more efficient alternative to traditional inference methods."

                "text": "Bayesian belief networks (BBN) are a widely studied graphical model for representing uncertainty and probabilistic interdependence among variables. One of the factors that restricts the model's wide acceptance in practical applications is that the general inference with BBN is NP-hard. This is also true for the maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) problem, which is to find the most probable joint value assignment to all uninstantiated variables, given instantiation of some variables in a BBN. To circumvent the difficulty caused by MAP's computational complexity, we suggest in this paper a neural network approximation approach. With this approach, a BBN is treated as a neural network without any change or transformation of the network structure, and the node activation functions are derived based on an energy function defined over a given BBN. Three methods are developed. They are the hill-climbing style discrete method, the simulated annealing method, and the continuous method based on the mean field theory. All three methods are for BBN of general structures, with the restriction that nodes of BBN are binary variables. In addition, rules for applying these methods to noisy-or networks are also developed, which may lead to more efficient computation in some cases. These methods' convergence is analyzed, and their validity tested through a series of computer experiments with two BBN of moderate size and complexity. Although additional theoretical and empirical work is needed, the analysis and experiments suggest that this approach may lead to effective and accurate approximation for MAP problems."

After reviewing a variety of graphical models (Markov random fields, Tanner graphs, and Bayesian networks), we derive a general distributed marginalization algorithm for functions described by factor graphs. From this general algorithm, Pearl's (1986) belief propagation algorithm is easily derived as a special case. We point out that iterative decoding algorithms for various codes, including \"turbo decoding\" of parallel-concatenated convolutional codes, may be viewed as probability propagation in a graphical model of the code. We focus on Bayesian network descriptions of codes, which give a natural input/state/output/channel description of a code and channel, and we indicate how iterative decoders can be developed for parallel-and serially concatenated coding systems, product codes, and low-density parity-check codes."

Many authors have therefore suggested solving vision problems using architectures of locally connected units updating their activity in parallel. Unfortunately, the convergence of traditional relaxation methods on such architectures has proven to be excruciatingly slow and in general they do not guarantee that the stable point will be a global minimum. \n \nIn this paper we show that an architecture in which Bayesian Beliefs about image properties are propagated between neighboring units yields convergence times which are several orders of magnitude faster than traditional methods and avoids local minima. In particular our architecture is non-iterative in the sense of Marr [5]: at every time step, the local estimates at a given location are optimal given the information which has already been propagated to that location. We illustrate the algorithm's performance on real images and compare it to several existing methods."

In this paper we investigate the behavior of an PPA in graphs with a single cycle such as the graph of a tail-biting code. First, we show that for strictly positive local kernels, the iterations of the PPA converge to a unique fixed point, (which was also observed by Anderson and Hladik (1998) and Weiss (1997)). Secondly, we shall generalize a result of McEliece and Rodemich (1995), by showing that if the hidden variables in the cycle are binary-valued, the PPA will always make an optimal decision. (This was also observed independently by Weiss). When the hidden variables can assume 3 or more values, the behavior of the PPA is much harder to characterize."

Pixel gray levels and the presence and orientation of edges are viewed as states of atoms or molecules in a lattice-like physical system. The assignment of an energy function in the physical system determines its Gibbs distribution. Because of the Gibbs distribution, Markov random field (MRF) equivalence, this assignment also determines an MRF image model. The energy function is a more convenient and natural mechanism for embodying picture attributes than are the local characteristics of the MRF. For a range of degradation mechanisms, including blurring, nonlinear deformations, and multiplicative or additive noise, the posterior distribution is an MRF with a structure akin to the image model. By the analogy, the posterior distribution defines another (imaginary) physical system. Gradual temperature reduction in the physical system isolates low energy states (``annealing''), or what is the same thing, the most probable states under the Gibbs distribution. The analogous operation under the posterior distribution yields the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the image given the degraded observations. The result is a highly parallel ``relaxation'' algorithm for MAP estimation. We establish convergence properties of the algorithm and we experiment with some simple pictures, for which good restorations are obtained at low signal-to-noise ratios."

Graphical models provide a general methodology for approaching these problems, and indeed many of the models developed by researchers in these applied fields are instances of the general graphical model formalism. We review some of the basic ideas underlying graphical models, including the algorithmic ideas that allow graphical models to be deployed in large-scale data analysis problems. We also present examples of graphical models in bioinformatics, error-control coding and language processing."

(1993) and an algorithm that has been well known in the artificial intelligence community for a decade, but which is relatively unknown to information theorists: Pearl's (1982) belief propagation algorithm. We see that if Pearl's algorithm is applied to the \"belief network\" of a parallel concatenation of two or more codes, the turbo decoding algorithm immediately results. Unfortunately, however, this belief diagram has loops, and Pearl only proved that his algorithm works when there are no loops, so an explanation of the experimental performance of turbo decoding is still lacking. However, we also show that Pearl's algorithm can be used to routinely derive previously known iterative, but suboptimal, decoding algorithms for a number of other error-control systems, including Gallager's (1962) low-density parity-check codes, serially concatenated codes, and product codes. Thus, belief propagation provides a very attractive general methodology for devising low-complexity iterative decoding algorithms for hybrid coded systems."

Patterns that we wish to classify are a consequence of a causal physical process. Images that we wish to compress are also a consequence of a causal physical process. Noisy outputs from a telephone line are corrupted versions of a signal produced by a structured man-made telephone modem. Not only are these tasks characterized by complex structure, but they also contain random elements. Graphical models such as Bayesian networks provide a way to describe the relationships between random variables in a stochastic system. \nIn this thesis, I use Bayesian networks as an overarching framework to describe and solve problems in the areas of pattern classification, data compression, and channel coding. Results on the classification of handwritten digits show that Bayesian network pattern classifiers outperform other standard methods, such as the k-nearest neighbor method. When Bayesian networks are used as source models for data compression, an exponentially large number of codewords are associated with each input pattern. It turns out that the code can still be used efficiently, if a new technique called \"bits-back coding\" is used. Several new error-correcting decoding algorithms are instances of \"probability propagation\" in various Bayesian networks. These new schemes are rapidly closing the gap between the performances of practical channel coding systems and Shannon's 50-year-old channel coding limit. The Bayesian network framework exposes the similarities between these codes and leads the way to a new class of \"trellis-constraint codes\" which also operate close to Shannon's limit."

In particular, the recent success of turbo codes indicates that performance close to the Shannon limit may be achieved. In this thesis, it is showed that many iterative decoding algorithms are special cases of two generic algorithms, the min-sum and sum-product algorithms, which also include non-iterative algorithms such as Viterbi decoding. The min-sum and sum-product algorithms are developed and presented as generalized trellis algorithms, where the time axis of the trellis is replaced by an arbitrary graph, the \u201cTanner graph\u201d. With cycle-free Tanner graphs, the resulting decoding algorithms (e.g., Viterbi decoding) are maximum-likelihood but suffer from an exponentially increasing complexity. Iterative decoding occurs when the Tanner graph has cycles (e.g., turbo codes); the resulting algorithms are in general suboptimal, but significant complexity reductions are possible compared to the cycle-free case. Several performance estimates for iterative decoding are developed, including a generalization of the union bound used with Viterbi decoding and a characterization of errors that are uncorrectable after infinitely many decoding iterations."

A third goal is to provide several alternate viewpoints for this body of work, as the methods and concepts we describe intersect with a number of other fields. The principle focus of our presentation is the class of MR Markov processes defined on pyramidally organized trees. The attractiveness of these models stems from both the very efficient algorithms they admit and their expressive power and broad applicability.

The author provides a coherent explication of probability as a language for reasoning with partial belief and offers a unifying perspective on other AI approaches to uncertainty, such as the Dempster-Shafer formalism, truth maintenance systems, and nonmonotonic logic. The author distinguishes syntactic and semantic approaches to uncertainty\u0097and offers techniques, based on belief networks, that provide a mechanism for making semantics-based systems operational. Specifically, network-propagation techniques serve as a mechanism for combining the theoretical coherence of probability theory with modern demands of reasoning-systems technology: modular declarative inputs, conceptually meaningful inferences, and parallel distributed computation. Application areas include diagnosis, forecasting, image interpretation, multi-sensor fusion, decision support systems, plan recognition, planning, speech recognition\u0097in short, almost every task requiring that conclusions be drawn from uncertain clues and incomplete information. \nProbabilistic Reasoning in Intelligent Systems will be of special interest to scholars and researchers in AI, decision theory, statistics, logic, philosophy, cognitive psychology, and the management sciences. Professionals in the areas of knowledge-based systems, operations research, engineering, and statistics will find theoretical and computational tools of immediate practical use. The book can also be used as an excellent text for graduate-level courses in AI, operations research, or applied probability."

We focus on turbo decoding of product codes, and based on the geometric framework, we extend the analytical results and show how analysis tools can be practically adapted for this case. Specifically, we investigate the algorithm's stability and its convergence rate. We present new results concerning the structure and properties of stability matrices of the algorithm, and develop upper bounds on the algorithm's convergence rate. We prove that for any 2/spl times/2 (information bits) product codes, there is a unique and stable fixed point. For the general case, we present sufficient conditions for stability. The interpretation of these conditions provides an insight to the behavior of the decoding algorithm. Simulation results, which support and extend the theoretical analysis, are presented for Hamming [(7,4,3)]/sup 2/ and Golay [(24,12,8)]/sup 2/ product codes."

When used with maximum likelihood decoding on a sufficiently quiet binary-input symmetric channel, the typical probability of decoding error decreases exponentially with block length for a fixed rate and fixed j . A simple but nonoptimum decoding scheme operating directly from the channel a posteriori probabilities is described. Both the equipment complexity and the data-handling capacity in bits per second of this decoder increase approximately linearly with block length. For j > 3 and a sufficiently low rate, the probability of error using this decoder on a binary symmetric channel is shown to decrease at least exponentially with a root of the block length.

On a Gaussian channel, maximum a posteriori (MAP) codeword decoding (or \"maximum-likelihood decoding\") decodes to the codeword signal that is closest to the channel output in Euclidean distance. In contrast, we show that iterative decoding decodes to the \"pseudosignal\" that has highest correlation with the channel output. The set of pseudosignals corresponds to \"pseudocodewords\", only a vanishingly small number of which correspond to codewords. We show that some pseudocodewords cause decoding errors, but that there are also pseudocodewords that frequently correct the deleterious effects of other pseudocodewords."

A heuristic explanation is also given of how to embed the maximum a posteriori algorithms into the iterative decoding of parallel concatenated codes (turbo codes). The performances of the two algorithms are compared on the basis of a powerful rate 1/3 parallel concatenated code. Basic circuits to implement the simplified a posteriori decoding algorithm using lookup tables, and two further approximations (linear and threshold), with a very small penalty, to eliminate the need for lookup tables are proposed."

We develop some elementary theory, and present several intriguing examples, which we hope will stimulate further developments in this field. In particular, we construct a 16-state 12-section structurally invariant tail-biting trellis for the (24, 12, 8) binary Golay code. This tail-biting trellis representation is minimal: it simultaneously minimizes all conceivable measures of state complexity. Moreover, it compares favorably with the minimal conventional 12-section trellis for the Golay code, which has 256 states at its midpoint, or with the best quasi-cyclic representation of this code, which leads to a 64-state tail-biting trellis. Unwrapping this tail-biting trellis produces a periodically time-varying 16-state rate-1/2 \"convolutional Golay code\" with d=8, which has attractive performance/complexity properties. We furthermore show that the (6, 3, 4) quaternary hexacode has a minimal 8-state group tail-biting trellis, even though it has no such linear trellis over F/sub 4/. Minimal tail-biting trellises are also constructed for the (8, 4, 4) binary Hamming code, the (4, 2, 3) ternary tetracode, the (4, 2, 3) code over F/sub 4/, and the Z/sub 4/-linear (8. 4, 4) octacode."

                "text": "This review deals particularly with the recent literature on the structural and functional aspects of the retino\u2010brain\u2010pituitary system that controls the physiological process of background adaptation in the aquatic toad Xenopus laevis. Taking together the large amount of multidisciplinary data, a consistent picture emerges of a highly plastic system that efficiently responds to changes in the environmental light condition by releasing POMC\u2010derived peptides, such as the peptide \u03b1\u2010melanophore\u2010stimulating hormone (\u03b1\u2010MSH), into the circulation. This plasticity is exhibited by both the central nervous system and the pituitary pars intermedia, at the level of molecules, subcellular structures, synapses, and cells. Signal transduction in the pars intermedia of the pituitary gland of Xenopus laevis appears to be a complex event, involving various environmental factors (e.g., light and temperature) that act via distinct brain centres and neuronal messengers converging on the melanotrope cells. In the melanotropes, these messages are translated by specific receptors and second messenger systems, in particular via Ca2+ oscillations, controlling main secretory events such as gene transcription, POMC\u2010precursor translation and processing, posttranslational peptide modifications, and release of a bouquet of POMC\u2010derived peptides. In conclusion, the Xenopus hypothalamo\u2010hypophyseal system involved in background adaptation reveals how neuronal plasticity at the molecular, cellular and organismal levels, enable an organism to respond adequately to the continuously changing environmental factors demanding physiological adaptation.
