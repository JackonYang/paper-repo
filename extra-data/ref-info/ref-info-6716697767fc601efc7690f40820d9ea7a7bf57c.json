In pattern recognition, the SV algorithm constructs nonlinear decision functions by training a classiier to perform a linear separation in some high-dimensional space which is nonlinearly related to input space. Recently, we have developed a technique for Nonlinear Principal Component Analysis (Kernel PCA) based on the same types of kernels. This way, we can for instance eeciently extract polynomial features of arbitrary order by computing projections onto principal components in the space of all products of n pixels of images. We explain the idea of Mercer kernels and associated feature spaces, and describe connections to the theory of reproducing kernels and to regularization theory, followed by an overview of the above algorithms employing these kernels."

To develop such a technique, it was necessary to rst extract factors responsible for future generalization, to obtain bounds on generalization that depend on these factors, and lastly to develop a technique that constructively minimizes these bounds. The subject of this book are methods based on combining advanced branches of statistics and functional analysis, developing these theories into practical algorithms that perform better than existing heuristic approaches. The book provides a comprehensive analysis of what can be done using Support Vector Machines, achieving record results in real-life pattern recognition problems. In addition, it proposes a new form of nonlinear Principal Component Analysis using Support Vector kernel techniques, which I consider as the most natural and elegant way for generalization of classical Principal Component Analysis. In many ways the Support Vector machine became so popular thanks to works of Bernhard Schh olkopf. The work, submitted for the title of Doktor der Naturwis-senschaften, appears as excellent. It is a substantial contribution to Machine Learning technology."

It is proved that for strictly convex problems the algorithm converges to the solution, and that if the solution is nondegenerate, then the algorithm terminates at the solution in a finite number of steps. Numerical results are presented for the obstacle problem, the elastic-plastic torsion problem, and the journal bearing problems. On a selection of these problems with dimensions ranging from 5000 to 15,000, the algorithm determines the solution in fewer than 15 iterations, and with a small number of function-gradient evaluations and Hessian-vector products per iteration."

In these comments, we will try to clarify the relation among some of the algorithms discussed in LMS. In addition, we will compare the implementation strategy described in LMS, which is based on solving the so-called normal equations, to an alternative implementation strategy based on solving the so-called reduced Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) system.

We present a tutorial on nonparametric inference and its relation to neural networks, and we use the statistical viewpoint to highlight strengths and weaknesses of neural models. We illustrate the main points with some recognition experiments involving artificial data as well as handwritten numerals. In way of conclusion, we suggest that current-generation feedforward neural networks are largely inadequate for difficult problems in machine perception and machine learning, regardless of parallel-versus-serial hardware or other implementation issues. Furthermore, we suggest that the fundamental challenges in neural modeling are about representation rather than learning per se.

Vapnik and his team (AT&T Bell Labs., 1985) that can be seen as a new method for training polynomial, neural network, or Radial Basis Functions classifiers. The decision surfaces are found by solving a linearly constrained quadratic programming problem. This optimization problem is challenging because the quadratic form is completely dense and the memory requirements grow with the square of the number of data points. We present a decomposition algorithm that guarantees global optimality, and can be used to train SVM's over very large data sets. The main idea behind the decomposition is the iterative solution of sub-problems and the evaluation of optimality conditions which are used both to generate improved iterative values, and also establish the stopping criteria for the algorithm. We present experimental results of our implementation of SVM, and demonstrate the feasibility of our approach on a face detection problem that involves a data set of 50,000 data points."

Training a SVM is equivalent to solving a linearly constrained quadratic programming (QP) problem in a number of variables equal to the number of data points. This optimization problem is known to be challenging when the number of data points exceeds few thousands. In previous work done by us as well as by other researchers, the strategy used to solve the large scale QP problem takes advantage of the fact that the expected number of support vectors is small (<3,000). Therefore, the existing algorithms cannot deal with more than a few thousand support vectors. In this paper we present a decomposition algorithm that is guaranteed to solve the QP problem and that does not make assumptions on the expected number of support vectors. In order to present the feasibility of our approach we consider a foreign exchange rate time series database with 110,000 data points that generates 100,000 support vectors."

In the RBF case, the SV algorithm automatically determines centers, weights, and threshold that minimize an upper bound on the expected test error. The present study is devoted to an experimental comparison of these machines with a classical approach, where the centers are determined by X-means clustering, and the weights are computed using error backpropagation. We consider three machines, namely, a classical RBF machine, an SV machine with Gaussian kernel, and a hybrid system with the centers determined by the SV method and the weights trained by error backpropagation. Our results show that on the United States postal service database of handwritten digits, the SV machine achieves the highest recognition accuracy, followed by the hybrid system. The SV approach is thus not only theoretically well-founded but also superior in a practical application."

As well as making explicit some of the details on SRM, it provides a result that allows one to trade off errors on the training sample against improved generalization performance. It then considers the more general case when the hierarchy of classes is chosen in response to the data. A result is presented on the generalization performance of classifiers with a \"large margin\". This theoretically explains the impressive generalization performance of the maximal margin hyperplane algorithm of Vapnik and co-workers (which is the basis for their support vector machines). The paper concludes with a more general result in terms of \"luckiness\" functions, which provides a quite general way for exploiting serendipitous simplicity in observed data to obtain better prediction accuracy from small training sets. Four examples are given of such functions, including the Vapnik-Chervonenkis (1971) dimension measured on the sample."

Two applications are considered: data from (a) a noisy (normal and uniform noise) Mackey Glass equation and (b) the Santa Fe competition (set D). In both cases Support Vector Machines show an excellent performance. In case (b) the Support Vector approach improves the best known result on the benchmark by a factor of 29%."

The technique can be seen as a new training algorithm for Polynomial, Radial Basis Function and Multi-Layer Perceptron networks. SVMs are currently considered slower at run-time than other techniques with similar generalization performance. In this paper we focus on SVM for classiication and investigate the problem of reducing its run-time complexity. We present two relevant results: a) the use of SVM itself as a regression tool to approximate the decision surface with a user-speciied accuracy; and b) a reformulation of the training problem that yields the exact same decision surface using a smaller number of basis functions. We believe that this reformulation ooers great potential for future improvements of the technique. For most of the selected problems, both approaches give reductions of run-time in the 50-95% range, with no system degradation."

This finding opens up the possibility of compressing data bases significantly by disposing of the data which is not important for the solution of a given task. \n \nIn addition, we show that the theory allows us to predict the classifier that will have the best generalization ability, based solely on performance on the training set and characteristics of the learning machines. This finding is important for cases where the amount of available data is limited."

Adopting a regularization-theoretic framework, the above are formulated as constrained optimization problems. Previous approaches such as ridge regression, support vector methods, and regularization networks are included as special cases. We show connections between the cost function and some properties up to now believed to apply to support vector machines only. For appropriately chosen cost functions, the optimal solution of all the problems described above can be found by solving a simple quadratic programming problem."

This theoretically explains the impressive performance of the maximal margin hyperplane algorithm of Vapnik. It may also provide a general technique for exploitingserendipitous simplicity in observed data to obtain better prediction accuracy from small training sets."
