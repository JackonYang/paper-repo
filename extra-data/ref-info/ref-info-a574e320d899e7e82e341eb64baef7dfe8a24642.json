The main novelty of these experiments is the use of untagged text in the training of the model. We have used a simple triclass Markov model and are looking for the best way to estimate the parameters of this model, depending on the kind and amount of training data provided. Two approaches in particular are compared and combined:using text that has been tagged by hand and computing relative frequency counts,using text without tags and training the model as a hidden Markov process, according to a Maximum Likelihood principle.Experminents show that the best training is obtained by using as much tagged text as possible. They also show that Maximum Likelihood training, the procedure that is routinely used to estimate hidden Markov models parameters from training data, will not necessarily improve the tagging accuracy. In fact, it will generally degrade this accuracy, except when only a limited amount of hand-tagged text is available."

While these taggers obtain high accuracy, linguistic information is captured indirectly, typically in tens of thousands of lexical and contextual probabilities. In (Brill 1992), a trainable rule-based tagger was described that obtained performance comparable to that of stochastic taggers, but captured relevant linguistic information in a small number of simple non-stochastic rules. In this paper, we describe a number of extensions to this rule-based tagger. First, we describe a method for expressing lexical relations in tagging that stochastic taggers are currently unable to express. Next, we show a rule-based approach to tagging unknown words. Finally, we show how the tagger-can be extended into a k-best tagger, where multiple tags can be assigned to words in some cases of uncertainty."

Central to our approach is the Maximum Entropy (ME) Principle, allowing us to combine evidence from multiple sources, such as long-distance triggers and conventional short-distance trigrams. Given consistent statistical evidence, a unique ME solution is guaranteed to exist, and an iterative algorithm exists which is guaranteed to converge to it. Among the advantages of this approach are its simplicity, its generality, and its incremental nature. Among its disadvantages are its computational requirements. We describe a succession of ME models, culminating in our current Maximum Likelihood/Maximum Entropy (ML/ME) model.

In this paper, I describe SPATTER, a statistical parser based on decision-tree learning techniques which constructs a complete parse for every sentence and achieves accuracy rates far better than any published result. This work is based on the following premises: (1) grammars are too complex and detailed to develop manually for most interesting domains; (2) parsing models must rely heavily on lexical and contextual information to analyze sentences accurately; and (3) existing n-gram modeling techniques are inadequate for parsing models. In experiments comparing SPATTER with IBM's computer manuals parser, SPATTER significantly outperforms the grammar-based parser. Evaluating SPATTER against the Penn Treebank Wall Street Journal corpus using the PARSEVAL measures, SPATTER achieves 86% precision, 86% recall, and 1.3 crossing brackets per sentence for sentences of 40 words or less, and 91% precision, 90% recall, and 0.5 crossing brackets for sentences between 10 and 20 words in length."

corpora which have been manually annotated with POS information many taggers use anno tated text to learn either probability distribu tions or rules and use them to automatically assign POS tags to unseen text\nThe experiments in this paper were conducted on the Wall Street Journal corpus from the Penn Treebank project Marcus et al although the model can train from any large corpus anno tated with POS tags Since most realistic natu ral language applications must process words that were never seen before in training data all exper iments in this paper are conducted on test data that include unknown words\nSeveral recent papers Brill Magerman have reported tag ging accuracy on the Wall St Journal corpus The experiments in this paper test the hy pothesis that better use of context will improve the accuracy A Maximum Entropy model is well suited for such experiments since it com\nbines diverse forms of contextual information in a principled manner and does not impose any distributional assumptions on the train ing data Previous uses of this model include language modeling Lau et al machine translation Berger et al prepositional phrase attachment Ratnaparkhi et al and word morphology Della Pietra et al This paper brie y describes the maximum entropy and maximum likelihood properties of the model features used for POS tagging and the experi ments on the Penn Treebank Wall St Journal corpus It then discusses the consistency problems discovered during an attempt to use specialized features on the word context Lastly the results in this paper are compared to those from previous work on POS tagging\nThe Probability Model\nThe probability model is de ned overH T where H is the set of possible word and tag contexts or histories and T is the set of allowable tags The model s probability of a history h together with a tag t is de ned as\np h t kY\nj\nfj h t j\nwhere is a normalization constant f kg are the positive model parameters and ff fkg are known as features where fj h t f g Note that each parameter j corresponds to a feature fj\nGiven a sequence of words fw wng and tags ft tng as training data de ne hi as the history available when predicting ti The param eters f kg are then chosen to maximize\nthe likelihood of the training data using p\nL p nY\ni\np hi ti nY\ni\nkY j fj hi ti j\nThis model also can be interpreted under the Maximum Entropy formalism in which the goal is to maximize the entropy of a distribution subject to certain constraints Here the entropy of the distribution p is de ned as\nH p X\nh H t T\np h t logp h t\nand the constraints are given by\nEfj Efj j k\nwhere the model s feature expectation is\nEfj X\nh H t T\np h t fj h t\nand the observed feature expectation is\nEfj nX\ni\np hi ti fj hi ti\nand where p hi ti denotes the observed probabil ity of hi ti in the training data Thus the con straints force the model to match its feature expec tations with those observed in the training data In practice H is very large and the model s ex pectation Efj cannot be computed directly so the following approximation Lau et al is used\nEfj nX i p hi p tijhi fj hi ti\nwhere p hi is the observed probability of the his tory hi in the training set\nIt can be shown Darroch and Ratcli that if p has the form and satis es the k constraints it uniquely maximizes the en tropy H p over distributions that satisfy and uniquely maximizes the likelihood L p over dis tributions of the form The model parameters for the distribution p are obtained via Generalized Iterative Scaling Darroch and Ratcli\nFeatures for POS Tagging\nThe joint probability of a history h and tag t is determined by those parameters whose corre sponding features are active i e those j such\nthat fj h t A feature given h t may ac tivate on any word or tag in the history h and must encode any information that might help pre dict t such as the spelling of the current word or the identity of the previous two tags The speci c word and tag context available to a feature is given in the following de nition of a history hi\nhi fwi wi wi wi wi ti ti g\nFor example\nfj hi ti\nif su x wi ing ti VBG otherwise\nIf the above feature exists in the feature set of the model its corresponding model parameter will contribute towards the joint probability p hi ti when wi ends with ing and when ti VBG Thus a model parameter j e ectively serves as a weight for a certain contextual predictor in this case the su x ing towards the probability of observing a certain tag in this case a VBG\nThe model generates the space of features by scanning each pair hi ti in the training data with the feature templates given in Table Given hi as the current history a feature always asks some yes no question about hi and furthermore constrains ti to be a certain tag The instantia tions for the variables X Y and T in Table are obtained automatically from the training data\nThe generation of features for tagging un known words relies on the hypothesized distinction that rare words in the training set are similar to unknown words in test data with respect to how their spellings help predict their tags The rare word features in Table which look at the word spellings will apply to both rare words and unknown words in test data\nFor example Table contains an excerpt from training data while Table contains the features generated while scanning h t in which the cur rent word is about and Table contains features generated while scanning h t in which the cur rent word well heeled occurs times in train ing data and is therefore classi ed as rare\nThe behavior of a feature that occurs very sparsely in the training set is often di cult to pre dict since its statistics may not be reliable There fore the model uses the heuristic that any feature\nVBG is the Treebank POS tag for Verb Gerund A rare word here denotes a word which occurs less than times in the training set The count of was chosen by subjective inspection of words in the training data\nCondition Features\nwi is not rare wi X ti T wi is rare X is pre x of wi jXj ti T\nX is su x of wi jXj ti T wi contains number ti T wi contains uppercase character ti T wi contains hyphen ti

The learning paradigm builds increasingly complex fields by allowing potential functions, or features, that are supported by increasingly large subgraphs. Each feature has a weight that is trained by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the model and the empirical distribution of the training data. A greedy algorithm determines how features are incrementally added to the field and an iterative scaling algorithm is used to estimate the optimal values of the weights. The random field models and techniques introduced in this paper differ from those common to much of the computer vision literature in that the underlying random fields are non-Markovian and have a large number of parameters that must be estimated. Relations to other learning approaches, including decision trees, are given. As a demonstration of the method, we describe its application to the problem of automatic word classification in natural language processing."
