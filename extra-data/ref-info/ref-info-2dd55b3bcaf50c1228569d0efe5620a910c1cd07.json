We assume images are labeled with category, but not location, of an instance. We estimate models with an iterative procedure: the current model is used to produce a saliency score, which, together with a homogeneity cue, identifies likely locations for the object (resp. attribute); then those locations are used to produce better models with multiple instance learning. Crucially, the object and attribute models must agree on the potential locations of an object. This means that the more accurate of the two models can guide the improvement of the less accurate model. Our method is evaluated on two data sets of images of real scenes, one in which the attribute is color and the other in which it is material. We show that our joint learning produces improved detectors. We demonstrate generalization by detecting attribute-object pairs which do not appear in our training data. The iteration gives significant improvement in performance."

Other types of objects of amorphous spatial extent (e.g., trees, sky), however, are more naturally classified based on texture or color. In this paper, we seek to combine recognition of these two types of objects into a system that leverages \"context\" toward improving detection. In particular, we cluster image regions based on their ability to serve as context for the detection of objects. Rather than providing an explicit training set with region labels, our method automatically groups regions based on both their appearance and their relationships to the detections in the image. We show that our things and stuff (TAS) context model produces meaningful clusters that are readily interpretable, and helps improve our detection ability over state-of-the-art detectors. We also present a method for learning the active set of relationships for a particular dataset. We present results on object detection in images from the PASCAL VOC 2005/2006 datasets and on the task of overhead car detection in satellite images, demonstrating significant improvements over state-of-the-art detectors."

                "text": "Many state-of-the-art approaches for object recognition reduce the problem to a 0-1 classification task. This allows one to leverage sophisticated machine learning techniques for training classifiers from labeled examples. However, these models are typically trained independently for each class using positive and negative examples cropped from images. At test-time, various post-processing heuristics such as non-maxima suppression (NMS) are required to reconcile multiple detections within and between different classes for each image. Though crucial to good performance on benchmarks, this post-processing is usually defined heuristically.We introduce a unified model for multi-class object recognition that casts the problem as a structured prediction task. Rather than predicting a binary label for each image window independently, our model simultaneously predicts a structured labeling of the entire image (Fig.\u00a01). Our model learns statistics that capture the spatial arrangements of various object classes in real images, both in terms of which arrangements to suppress through NMS and which arrangements to favor through spatial co-occurrence statistics.We formulate parameter estimation in our model as a max-margin learning problem. Given training images with ground-truth object locations, we show how to formulate learning as a convex optimization problem. We employ the cutting plane algorithm of Joachims et al. (Mach. Learn.\u00a02009) to efficiently learn a model from thousands of training images. We show state-of-the-art results on the PASCAL VOC benchmark that indicate the benefits of learning a global model encapsulating the spatial layout of multiple object classes (a preliminary version of this work appeared in ICCV 2009, Desai et al., IEEE international conference on computer vision,\u00a02009)."

Previous works generally require objects covering a large portion of the images. We present a novel approach that can cope with extensive clutter as well as large scale and appearance variations between object instances. To make this possible we propose a conditional random field that starts from generic knowledge and then progressively adapts to the new class. Our approach simultaneously localizes object instances while learning an appearance model specific for the class. We demonstrate this on the challenging PASCAL VOC 2007 dataset. Furthermore, our method enables to train any state-of-the-art object detector in a weakly supervised fashion, although it would normally require object location annotations."

We formulate this problem as a binary labeling task where we separate the salient object from the background. We propose a set of novel features, including multiscale contrast, center-surround histogram, and color spatial distribution, to describe a salient object locally, regionally, and globally. A conditional random field is learned to effectively combine these features for salient object detection. Further, we extend the proposed approach to detect a salient object from sequential images by introducing the dynamic salient features. We collected a large image database containing tens of thousands of carefully labeled images by multiple users and a video segment database, and conducted a set of experiments over them to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach."

To perform localization, one can take a sliding window approach, but this strongly increases the computational cost, because the classifier function has to be evaluated over a large set of candidate subwindows. In this paper, we propose a simple yet powerful branch-and-bound scheme that allows efficient maximization of a large class of classifier functions over all possible subimages. It converges to a globally optimal solution typically in sublinear time. We show how our method is applicable to different object detection and retrieval scenarios. The achieved speedup allows the use of classifiers for localization that formerly were considered too slow for this task, such as SVMs with a spatial pyramid kernel or nearest neighbor classifiers based on the chi2-distance. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of the resulting systems on the UIUC Cars dataset, the PASCAL VOC 2006 dataset and in the PASCAL VOC 2007 competition."

We introduce LOCUS (learning object classes with unsupervised segmentation) which uses a generative probabilistic model to combine bottom-up cues of color and edge with top-down cues of shape and pose. A key aspect of this model is that the object appearance is allowed to vary from image to image, allowing for significant within-class variation. By iteratively updating the belief in the object's position, size, segmentation and pose, LOCUS avoids making hard decisions about any of these quantities and so allows for each to be refined at any stage. We show that LOCUS successfully learns an object class model from unlabeled images, whilst also giving segmentation accuracies that rival existing supervised methods. Finally, we demonstrate simultaneous recognition and segmentation in novel images using the learned models for a number of object classes, as well as unsupervised object discovery and tracking in video."

The method is based on the idea that salient objects should have local characteristics that are different than the rest of the scene, being edges, color or shape. By using a novel operator, these characteristics are combined to infer global information. The obtained information is used as a weighting for the output of a segmentation algorithm so that the salient object in the scene can easily be distinguished from the background. The proposed approach is fast and it does not require any learning. The experimentation shows that the system can enhance interesting objects in images and it is able to correctly locate the same object annotated by humans with an F-measure of 85.61% when the object size is known, and 79.19% when the object size is unknown, improving the state of the art performance on a public dataset."

For use in a real-world system, it is important that this includes the ability to recognize objects at multiple scales. In this paper, we present an approach to multi-scale object categorization using scale-invariant interest points and a scale-adaptive Mean-Shift search. The approach builds on the method from [12], which has been demonstrated to achieve excellent results for the single-scale case, and extends it to multiple scales.

Objects are modeled as flexible constellations of parts. A probabilistic representation is used for all aspects of the object: shape, appearance, occlusion and relative scale. An entropy-based feature detector is used to select regions and their scale within the image. In learning the parameters of the scale-invariant object model are estimated. This is done using expectation-maximization in a maximum-likelihood setting. In recognition, this model is used in a Bayesian manner to classify images. The flexible nature of the model is demonstrated by excellent results over a range of datasets including geometrically constrained classes (e.g. faces, cars) and flexible objects (such as animals)."

Our system is able to represent highly variable object classes and achieves state-of-the-art results in the PASCAL object detection challenges. While deformable part models have become quite popular, their value had not been demonstrated on difficult benchmarks such as the PASCAL data sets. Our system relies on new methods for discriminative training with partially labeled data. We combine a margin-sensitive approach for data-mining hard negative examples with a formalism we call latent SVM. A latent SVM is a reformulation of MI--SVM in terms of latent variables. A latent SVM is semiconvex, and the training problem becomes convex once latent information is specified for the positive examples. This leads to an iterative training algorithm that alternates between fixing latent values for positive examples and optimizing the latent SVM objective function."

The saliency of a given location of the visual field is defined as the power of a Gabor-like feature set to discriminate between the visual appearance of 1) a neighborhood centered at that location (the center) and 2) a neighborhood that surrounds it (the surround). Discrimination is defined in an information-theoretic sense and the optimal saliency detector derived for a class of stimuli that complies with known statistical properties of natural images, so as to achieve a computationally efficient solution. The resulting saliency detector is shown to replicate the fundamental properties of the psychophysics of pre-attentive vision, including stimulus pop-out, inability to detect feature conjunctions, asymmetries with respect to feature presence vs. absence, and compliance with Weber's law. It is also shown that the detector produces better predictions of human eye fixations than two previously proposed bottom-up saliency detectors."

Finally, we refine the maps and we extract thumbnails. We show that in spite of its simplicity, our framework outperforms state-of-the art approaches. Another advantage is its ability to deal with visual pop-up and application/task-driven saliency, if appropriately annotated images are available."

The features are invariant to image scaling, translation, and rotation, and partially invariant to illumination changes and affine or 3D projection. These features share similar properties with neurons in inferior temporal cortex that are used for object recognition in primate vision. Features are efficiently detected through a staged filtering approach that identifies stable points in scale space. Image keys are created that allow for local geometric deformations by representing blurred image gradients in multiple orientation planes and at multiple scales. The keys are used as input to a nearest neighbor indexing method that identifies candidate object matches. Final verification of each match is achieved by finding a low residual least squares solution for the unknown model parameters. Experimental results show that robust object recognition can be achieved in cluttered partially occluded images with a computation time of under 2 seconds."

The method handles deformations of the object by first breaking the given model into segments at high curvature points. We allow bending at these points as it has been studied that deformation typically happens at high curvature points. The broken segments are then scaled, rotated, deformed and searched independently in the gradient image. Point maps are generated for each segment that represent the locations of the matches for that segment. We then group kpoints from the point maps of kadjacent segments using a cost function that takes into account local scale variations as well as inter-segment orientations. These matched groups yield plausible locations for the objects. In the fine matching stage, the entire object contour in the localized regions is built from the k-segment groups and given a comprehensive score in a method that uses dynamic programming. An evaluation of our algorithm on a standard dataset yielded results that are better than published work on the same dataset. At the same time, we also evaluate our algorithm on additional images with considerable object deformations to verify the robustness of our method."

It is further shown that the proposed salicney measure may be extended to address issues that currently elude explanation in the domain of saliency based models. Results on natural images are compared with experimental eye tracking data revealing the efficacy of the model in predicting the deployment of overt attention as compared with existing efforts."

However, computational modeling of this basic intelligent behavior still remains a challenge. This paper presents a simple method for the visual saliency detection. Our model is independent of features, categories, or other forms of prior knowledge of the objects. By analyzing the log-spectrum of an input image, we extract the spectral residual of an image in spectral domain, and propose a fast method to construct the corresponding saliency map in spatial domain. We test this model on both natural pictures and artificial images such as psychological patterns. The result indicate fast and robust saliency detection of our method."

Our scale and affine invariant detectors are based on the following recent results: (1) Interest points extracted with the Harris detector can be adapted to affine transformations and give repeatable results (geometrically stable). (2) The characteristic scale of a local structure is indicated by a local extremum over scale of normalized derivatives (the Laplacian). (3) The affine shape of a point neighborhood is estimated based on the second moment matrix.Our scale invariant detector computes a multi-scale representation for the Harris interest point detector and then selects points at which a local measure (the Laplacian) is maximal over scales. This provides a set of distinctive points which are invariant to scale, rotation and translation as well as robust to illumination changes and limited changes of viewpoint. The characteristic scale determines a scale invariant region for each point. We extend the scale invariant detector to affine invariance by estimating the affine shape of a point neighborhood. An iterative algorithm modifies location, scale and neighborhood of each point and converges to affine invariant points. This method can deal with significant affine transformations including large scale changes. The characteristic scale and the affine shape of neighborhood determine an affine invariant region for each point.We present a comparative evaluation of different detectors and show that our approach provides better results than existing methods. The performance of our detector is also confirmed by excellent matching results; the image is described by a set of scale/affine invariant descriptors computed on the regions associated with our points."

In this paper, we propose a feasible and fast approach to attention area detection in images based on contrast analysis. The main contributions are threefold: 1) a new saliency map generation method based on local contrast analysis is proposed; 2) by simulating human perception, a fuzzy growing method is used to extract attended areas or objects from the saliency map; and 3) a practicable framework for image attention analysis is presented, which provides three-level attention analysis, i.e., attended view, attended areas and attended points. This framework facilitates visual analysis tools or vision systems to automatically extract attentions from images in a manner like human perception. User study results indicate that the proposed approach is effective and practicable."

Kalman filtering is inadequate because it is based on Gaussian densities which, being unimo dal, cannot represent simultaneous alternative hypotheses. The Condensation algorithm uses \u201cfactored sampling\u201d, previously applied to the interpretation of static images, in which the probability distribution of possible interpretations is represented by a randomly generated set. Condensation uses learned dynamical models, together with visual observations, to propagate the random set over time. The result is highly robust tracking of agile motion. Notwithstanding the use of stochastic methods, the algorithm runs in near real-time."

The first example of this technique, the \u201cmip\u201d map, uses a set of tables containing successively lower-resolution representations filtered down from the discrete texture function. An alternative method using a single table of values representing the integral over the texture function rather than the function itself may yield superior results at similar cost. The necessary algorithms to support the new technique are explained. Finally, the cost and performance of the new technique is compared to previous techniques."
