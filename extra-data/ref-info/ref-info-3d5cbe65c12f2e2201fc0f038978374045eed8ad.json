However, cascades of detectors are slow to train due to the high number of detectors and corresponding thresholds to learn. Furthermore, they do not use any prior knowledge about the scene structure to decide where to focus the search. To handle these problems, we propose a new way to scan an image, where we couple a recursive coarse-to-fine refinement together with spatial constraints of the object location. For doing that we split an image into a set of uniformly distributed neighborhood regions, and for each of these we apply a local greedy search over feature resolutions. The neighborhood is defined as a scanning region that only one object can occupy. Therefore the best hypothesis is obtained as the location with maximum score and no thresholds are needed. We present an implementation of our method using a pyramid of HOG features and we evaluate it on two standard databases, VOC2007 and INRIA dataset. Results show that the Recursive Coarse-to-Fine Localization (RCFL) achieves a 12x speed-up compared to standard sliding windows. Compared with a cascade of multiple resolutions approach our method has slightly better performance in speed and Average-Precision. Furthermore, in contrast to cascading approach, the speed-up is independent of image conditions, the number of detected objects and clutter."

Our approach is sequential testing which is coarse-to-fine in both in the exploration of poses and the representation of objects. All the tests are binary and indicate the presence or absence of loose spatial arrangements of oriented edge fragments. Starting from training examples, we recursively find larger and larger arrangements which are \u201cdecomposable,\u201d which implies the probability of an arrangement appearing on an object decays slowly with its size. Detection means finding a sufficient number of arrangements of each size along a decreasing sequence of pose cells. At the beginning, the tests are simple and universal, accommodating many poses simultaneously, but the false alarm rate is relatively high. Eventually, the tests are more discriminating, but also more complex and dedicated to specific poses. As a result, the spatial distribution of processing is highly skewed and detection is rapid, but at the expense of (isolated) false alarms which, presumably, could be eliminated with localized, more intensive, processing."

This work is distinguished by three key contributions. The first is the introduction of a new image representation called the \"integral image\" which allows the features used by our detector to be computed very quickly. The second is a learning algorithm, based on AdaBoost, which selects a small number of critical visual features from a larger set and yields extremely efficient classifiers. The third contribution is a method for combining increasingly more complex classifiers in a \"cascade\" which allows background regions of the image to be quickly discarded while spending more computation on promising object-like regions. The cascade can be viewed as an object specific focus-of-attention mechanism which unlike previous approaches provides statistical guarantees that discarded regions are unlikely to contain the object of interest. In the domain of face detection the system yields detection rates comparable to the best previous systems. Used in real-time applications, the detector runs at 15 frames per second without resorting to image differencing or skin color detection."

We exploit locality-sensitive hashing to replace the dot-product kernel operator in the convolution with a fixed number of hash-table probes that effectively sample all of the filter responses in time independent of the size of the filter bank. To show the effectiveness of the technique, we apply it to evaluate 100,000 deformable-part models requiring over a million (part) filters on multiple scales of a target image in less than 20 seconds using a single multi-core processor with 20GB of RAM. This represents a speed-up of approximately 20,000 times - four orders of magnitude - when compared with performing the convolutions explicitly on the same hardware. While mean average precision over the full set of 100,000 object classes is around 0.16 due in large part to the challenges in gathering training data and collecting ground truth for so many classes, we achieve a mAP of at least 0.20 on a third of the classes and 0.30 or better on about 20% of the classes."

We focus primarily on the case of star-structured models and show how a simple algorithm based on partial hypothesis pruning can speed up object detection by more than one order of magnitude without sacrificing detection accuracy. In our algorithm, partial hypotheses are pruned with a sequence of thresholds. In analogy to probably approximately correct (PAC) learning, we introduce the notion of probably approximately admissible (PAA) thresholds. Such thresholds provide theoretical guarantees on the performance of the cascade method and can be computed from a small sample of positive examples. Finally, we outline a cascade detection algorithm for a general class of models defined by a grammar formalism. This class includes not only tree-structured pictorial structures but also richer models that can represent each part recursively as a mixture of other parts."

To perform localization, one can take a sliding window approach, but this strongly increases the computational cost, because the classifier function has to be evaluated over a large set of candidate subwindows. In this paper, we propose a simple yet powerful branch-and-bound scheme that allows efficient maximization of a large class of classifier functions over all possible subimages. It converges to a globally optimal solution typically in sublinear time. We show how our method is applicable to different object detection and retrieval scenarios. The achieved speedup allows the use of classifiers for localization that formerly were considered too slow for this task, such as SVMs with a spatial pyramid kernel or nearest neighbor classifiers based on the chi2-distance. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of the resulting systems on the UIUC Cars dataset, the PASCAL VOC 2006 dataset and in the PASCAL VOC 2007 competition."

We introduce selective search which combines the strength of both an exhaustive search and segmentation. Like segmentation, we use the image structure to guide our sampling process. Like exhaustive search, we aim to capture all possible object locations. Instead of a single technique to generate possible object locations, we diversify our search and use a variety of complementary image partitionings to deal with as many image conditions as possible. Our selective search results in a small set of data-driven, class-independent, high quality locations, yielding 99\u00a0% recall and a Mean Average Best Overlap of 0.879 at 10,097 locations. The reduced number of locations compared to an exhaustive search enables the use of stronger machine learning techniques and stronger appearance models for object recognition. In this paper we show that our selective search enables the use of the powerful Bag-of-Words model for recognition. The selective search software is made publicly available (Software: http://disi.unitn.it/~uijlings/SelectiveSearch.html)."

We explicitly train it to distinguish objects with a well-defined boundary in space, such as cows and telephones, from amorphous background elements, such as grass and road. The measure combines in a Bayesian framework several image cues measuring characteristics of objects, such as appearing different from their surroundings and having a closed boundary. These include an innovative cue to measure the closed boundary characteristic. In experiments on the challenging PASCAL VOC 07 dataset, we show this new cue to outperform a state-of-the-art saliency measure, and the combined objectness measure to perform better than any cue alone. We also compare to interest point operators, a HOG detector, and three recent works aiming at automatic object segmentation. Finally, we present two applications of objectness. In the first, we sample a small numberof windows according to their objectness probability and give an algorithm to employ them as location priors for modern class-specific object detectors. As we show experimentally, this greatly reduces the number of windows evaluated by the expensive class-specific model. In the second application, we use objectness as a complementary score in addition to the class-specific model, which leads to fewer false positives. As shown in several recent papers, objectness can act as a valuable focus of attention mechanism in many other applications operating on image windows, including weakly supervised learning of object categories, unsupervised pixelwise segmentation, and object tracking in video. Computing objectness is very efficient and takes only about 4 sec. per image."

An object is represented by a mixture of hierarchical tree models where the nodes represent object parts. The nodes can move spatially to allow both local and global shape deformations. The models can be trained discriminatively using latent structural SVM learning, where the latent variables are the node positions and the mixture component. But current learning methods are slow, due to the large number of parameters and latent variables, and have been restricted to hierarchies with two layers. In this paper we describe an incremental concave-convex procedure (iCCCP) which allows us to learn both two and three layer models efficiently. We show that iCCCP leads to a simple training algorithm which avoids complex multi-stage layer-wise training, careful part selection, and achieves good performance without requiring elaborate initialization. We perform object detection using our learnt models and obtain performance comparable with state-of-the-art methods when evaluated on challenging public PASCAL datasets. We demonstrate the advantages of three layer hierarchies - outperforming Felzenszwalb et al.'s two layer models on all 20 classes."

The computational bottleneck of many modern detectors is the construction of an image pyramid, typically sampled at 8-16 scales per octave, and associated feature computations at each scale. We propose a technique to avoid constructing such a finely sampled image pyramid without sacrificing performance: our key insight is that for a broad family of features, including gradient histograms, the feature responses computed at a single scale can be used to approximate feature responses at nearby scales. The approximation is accurate within an entire scale octave. This allows us to decouple the sampling of the image pyramid from the sampling of detection scales. Overall, our approximation yields a speedup of 10-100 times over competing methods with only a minor loss in detection accuracy of about 1-2% on the Caltech Pedestrian dataset across a wide range of evaluation settings. The results are confirmed on three additional datasets (INRIA, ETH, and TUD-Brussels) where our method always scores within a few percent of the state-of-the-art while being 1-2 orders of magnitude faster. The approach is general and should be widely applicable."

However, training is typically done in a way that is not specific to the localization task. First a binary classifier is trained using a sample of positive and negative examples, and this classifier is subsequently applied to multiple regions within test images. We propose instead to treat object localization in a principled way by posing it as a problem of predicting structured data: we model the problem not as binary classification, but as the prediction of the bounding box of objects located in images. The use of a joint-kernelframework allows us to formulate the training procedure as a generalization of an SVM, which can be solved efficiently. We further improve computational efficiency by using a branch-and-bound strategy for localization during both training and testing. Experimental evaluation on the PASCAL VOC and TU Darmstadt datasets show that the structured training procedure improves performance over binary training as well as the best previously published scores."

They exploit sliding window search, spanning the whole image: the patches, at all possible positions and sizes, are sent to the classifier. Several methods have been proposed to speed up the search (adding complementary features or using specialized hardware). In this paper we propose a statistical-based search approach for object detection which uses a Monte Carlo sampling approach for estimating the likelihood density function with Gaussian kernels. The estimation relies on a multi-stage strategy where the proposal distribution is progressively refined by taking into account the feedback of the classifier (i.e. its response). For videos, this approach is plugged in a Bayesian-recursive framework which exploits the temporal coherency of the pedestrians. Several tests on both still images and videos on common datasets are provided in order to demonstrate the relevant speedup and the increased localization accuracy with respect to sliding window strategy using a pedestrian classifier based on covariance descriptors and a cascade of Logitboost classifiers."

Our system achieves a two-fold improvement in average precision over the best performance in the 2006 PASCAL person detection challenge. It also outperforms the best results in the 2007 challenge in ten out of twenty categories. The system relies heavily on deformable parts. While deformable part models have become quite popular, their value had not been demonstrated on difficult benchmarks such as the PASCAL challenge. Our system also relies heavily on new methods for discriminative training. We combine a margin-sensitive approach for data mining hard negative examples with a formalism we call latent SVM. A latent SVM, like a hidden CRF, leads to a non-convex training problem. However, a latent SVM is semi-convex and the training problem becomes convex once latent information is specified for the positive examples. We believe that our training methods will eventually make possible the effective use of more latent information such as hierarchical (grammar) models and models involving latent three dimensional pose."

Our work is motivated by the pictorial structure models introduced by Fischler and Elschlager. The basic idea is to represent an object by a collection of parts arranged in a deformable configuration. The appearance of each part is modeled separately, and the deformable configuration is represented by spring-like connections between pairs of parts. These models allow for qualitative descriptions of visual appearance, and are suitable for generic recognition problems. We address the problem of using pictorial structure models to find instances of an object in an image as well as the problem of learning an object model from training examples, presenting efficient algorithms in both cases. We demonstrate the techniques by learning models that represent faces and human bodies and using the resulting models to locate the corresponding objects in novel images."

Our model uses sparse coding of part filters to represent each filter as a sparse linear combination of shared dictionary elements. This leads to a universal set of parts that are shared among all object classes. Reconstruction of the original part filter responses via sparse matrix-vector product reduces computation relative to conventional part filter convolutions. Our model is well suited to a parallel implementation, and we report a new GPU DPM implementation that takes advantage of sparse coding of part filters. The speed-up offered by our intermediate representation and parallel computation enable real-time DPM detection of 20 different object classes on a laptop computer."

In this work we show that motion features derived from optic flow yield substantial improvements on image sequences, if implemented correctly \u2014 even in the case of low-quality video and consequently degraded flow fields. Furthermore, we introduce a new feature, self-similarity on color channels, which consistently improves detection performance both for static images and for video sequences, across different datasets. In combination with HOG, these two features outperform the state-of-the-art by up to 20%. Finally, we report two insights concerning detector evaluations, which apply to classifier-based object detection in general. First, we show that a commonly under-estimated detail of training, the number of bootstrapping rounds, has a drastic influence on the relative (and absolute) performance of different feature/classifier combinations. Second, we discuss important intricacies of detector evaluation and show that current benchmarking protocols lack crucial details, which can distort evaluations."

Our system is able to represent highly variable object classes and achieves state-of-the-art results in the PASCAL object detection challenges. While deformable part models have become quite popular, their value had not been demonstrated on difficult benchmarks such as the PASCAL data sets. Our system relies on new methods for discriminative training with partially labeled data. We combine a margin-sensitive approach for data-mining hard negative examples with a formalism we call latent SVM. A latent SVM is a reformulation of MI--SVM in terms of latent variables. A latent SVM is semiconvex, and the training problem becomes convex once latent information is specified for the positive examples. This leads to an iterative training algorithm that alternates between fixing latent values for positive examples and optimizing the latent SVM objective function."

This paper presents a large-scale evaluation of an approach that represents images as distributions (signatures or histograms) of features extracted from a sparse set of keypoint locations and learns a Support Vector Machine classifier with kernels based on two effective measures for comparing distributions, the Earth Mover\u2019s Distance and the \u03c72 distance. We first evaluate the performance of our approach with different keypoint detectors and descriptors, as well as different kernels and classifiers. We then conduct a comparative evaluation with several state-of-the-art recognition methods on four texture and five object databases. On most of these databases, our implementation exceeds the best reported results and achieves comparable performance on the rest. Finally, we investigate the influence of background correlations on recognition performance via extensive tests on the PASCAL database, for which ground-truth object localization information is available. Our experiments demonstrate that image representations based on distributions of local features are surprisingly effective for classification of texture and object images under challenging real-world conditions, including significant intra-class variations and substantial background clutter."

While the fine-level state-space of poses of individual parts is too large to permit the use of rich appearance models, most possibilities can be ruled out by efficient structured models at a coarser scale. We propose to learn a sequence of structured models at different pose resolutions, where coarse models filter the pose space for the next level via their max-marginals. The cascade is trained to prune as much as possible while preserving true poses for the final level pictorial structure model. The final level uses much more expensive segmentation, contour and shape features in the model for the remaining filtered set of candidates. We evaluate our framework on the challenging Buffy and PASCAL human pose datasets, improving the state-of-the-art."

                "text": "We explore a new approach to shape recognition based on a virtually infinite family of binary features (queries) of the image data, designed to accommodate prior information about shape invariance and regularity. Each query corresponds to a spatial arrangement of several local topographic codes (or tags), which are in themselves too primitive and common to be informative about shape. All the discriminating power derives from relative angles and distances among the tags. The important attributes of the queries are a natural partial ordering corresponding to increasing structure and complexity; semi-invariance, meaning that most shapes of a given class will answer the same way to two queries that are successive in the ordering; and stability, since the queries are not based on distinguished points and substructures. No classifier based on the full feature set can be evaluated, and it is impossible to determine a priori which arrangements are informative. Our approach is to select informative features and build tree classifiers at the same time by inductive learning. In effect, each tree provides an approximation to the full posterior where the features chosen depend on the branch that is traversed. Due to the number and nature of the queries, standard decision tree construction based on a fixed-length feature vector is not feasible. Instead we entertain only a small random sample of queries at each node, constrain their complexity to increase with tree depth, and grow multiple trees. The terminal nodes are labeled by estimates of the corresponding posterior distribution over shape classes. An image is classified by sending it down every tree and aggregating the resulting distributions. The method is applied to classifying handwritten digits and synthetic linear and nonlinear deformations of three hundred symbols. State-of-the-art error rates are achieved on the National Institute of Standards and Technology database of digits. The principal goal of the experiments on symbols is to analyze invariance, generalization error and related issues, and a comparison with artificial neural networks methods is presented in this context.

The temporal continuity of the video within a shot is used to track the regions in order to reject unstable regions and reduce the effects of noise in the descriptors. The analogy with text retrieval is in the implementation where matches on descriptors are pre-computed (using vector quantization), and inverted file systems and document rankings are used. The result is that retrieved is immediate, returning a ranked list of key frames/shots in the manner of Google. The method is illustrated for matching in two full length feature films."

In this paper we describe a human detection method that augments widely used edge-based features with texture and color information, providing us with a much richer descriptor set. This augmentation results in an extremely high-dimensional feature space (more than 170,000 dimensions). In such high-dimensional spaces, classical machine learning algorithms such as SVMs are nearly intractable with respect to training. Furthermore, the number of training samples is much smaller than the dimensionality of the feature space, by at least an order of magnitude. Finally, the extraction of features from a densely sampled grid structure leads to a high degree of multicollinearity. To circumvent these data characteristics, we employ Partial Least Squares (PLS) analysis, an efficient dimensionality reduction technique, one which preserves significant discriminative information, to project the data onto a much lower dimensional subspace (20 dimensions, reduced from the original 170,000). Our human detection system, employing PLS analysis over the enriched descriptor set, is shown to outperform state-of-the-art techniques on three varied datasets including the popular INRIA pedestrian dataset, the low-resolution gray-scale DaimlerChrysler pedestrian dataset, and the ETHZ pedestrian dataset consisting of full-length videos of crowded scenes."

We built on the optimal SPRT test and enlarge its capabilities to problems with dependent measurements. We show how to overcome the requirements of SPRT - (i) a priori ordered measurements and (ii) known joint probability density functions. We propose an algorithm with near optimal time and error rate trade-off, called WaldBoost, which integrates the AdaBoost algorithm for measurement selection and ordering and the joint probability density estimation with the optimal SPRT decision strategy. The WaldBoost algorithm is tested on the face detection problem. The results are superior to the state-of-the-art methods in the average evaluation time and comparable in detection rates."

The general idea behind integral channel features is that multiple registered image channels are computed using linear and \nnon-linear transformations of the input image, and then features such as local sums, histograms, and Haar features and their various generalizations are efficiently computed \nusing integral images. Such features have been used in recent literature for a variety of \ntasks \u2013 indeed, variations appear to have been invented independently multiple times. \nAlthough integral channel features have proven effective, little effort has been devoted to \nanalyzing or optimizing the features themselves. In this work we present a unified view \nof the relevant work in this area and perform a detailed experimental evaluation. We \ndemonstrate that when designed properly, integral channel features not only outperform \nother features including histogram of oriented gradient (HOG), they also (1) naturally \nintegrate heterogeneous sources of information, (2) have few parameters and are insensitive to exact parameter settings, (3) allow for more accurate spatial localization during \ndetection, and (4) result in fast detectors when coupled with cascade classifiers."

In data mining, one typically works with immense volumes of raw data, which demands effective algorithms to explore the data space. In analogy to data mining, the space of meaningful features for image analysis is also quite vast. Recently, the challenges associated with these problem areas have become more tractable through progress made in machine learning and concerted research effort in manual feature design by domain experts. In this paper, we propose a feature mining paradigm for image classification and examine several feature mining strategies. We also derive a principled approach for dealing with features with varying computational demands. Our goal is to alleviate the burden of manual feature design, which is a key problem in computer vision and machine learning. We include an in-depth empirical study on three typical data sets and offer theoretical explanations for the performance of various feature mining strategies. As a final confirmation of our ideas, we show results of a system, that utilizing feature mining strategies matches or outperforms the best reported results on pedestrian classification (where considerable effort has been devoted to expert feature design)."

After reviewing existing edge and gradient based descriptors, we show experimentally that grids of histograms of oriented gradient (HOG) descriptors significantly outperform existing feature sets for human detection. We study the influence of each stage of the computation on performance, concluding that fine-scale gradients, fine orientation binning, relatively coarse spatial binning, and high-quality local contrast normalization in overlapping descriptor blocks are all important for good results. The new approach gives near-perfect separation on the original MIT pedestrian database, so we introduce a more challenging dataset containing over 1800 annotated human images with a large range of pose variations and backgrounds."

This bag of keypoints method is based on vector quantization of affine invariant descriptors of image patches. We propose and compare two alternative implementations using different classifiers: Naive Bayes and SVM. The main advantages of the method are that it is simple, computationally efficient and intrinsically invariant. We present results for simultaneously classifying seven semantic visual categories. These results clearly demonstrate that the method is robust to background clutter and produces good categorization accuracy even without exploiting geometric information."

In general, the target is subjected to some particular type of transformation, hence we have a set of target signals to be detected. In this context, the set of non-target samples are referred to as clutter. In practice, the target detection problem can be characterized as designing a classifier C(z), which, given an input vector z, has to decide whether z belongs to the target class X or the clutter class Y. In example based classification, this classifier is designed using two training sets -X/spl circ/={xi}/sub i=1..Lx/ (target samples) and Y/spl circ/={y/sub i/}/sub i=1..Ly/ (clutter samples), drawn from the above two classes."

For a class of kernels we show that one can do this much more efficiently. In particular we show that one can build histogram intersection kernel SVMs (IKSVMs) with runtime complexity of the classifier logarithmic in the number of support vectors as opposed to linear for the standard approach. We further show that by precomputing auxiliary tables we can construct an approximate classifier with constant runtime and space requirements, independent of the number of support vectors, with negligible loss in classification accuracy on various tasks. This approximation also applies to 1 - chi2 and other kernels of similar form. We also introduce novel features based on a multi-level histograms of oriented edge energy and present experiments on various detection datasets. On the INRIA pedestrian dataset an approximate IKSVM classifier based on these features has the current best performance, with a miss rate 13% lower at 10-6 False Positive Per Window than the linear SVM detector of Dalal & Triggs. On the Daimler Chrysler pedestrian dataset IKSVM gives comparable accuracy to the best results (based on quadratic SVM), while being 15times faster. In these experiments our approximate IKSVM is up to 2000times faster than a standard implementation and requires 200times less memory. Finally we show that a 50times speedup is possible using approximate IKSVM based on spatial pyramid features on the Caltech 101 dataset with negligible loss of accuracy."

In this work, we propose sidestepping intractable inference altogether by learning ensembles of tractable sub-models as part of a structured prediction cascade. We focus in particular on problems with high-treewidth and large state-spaces, which occur in many computer vision tasks. Unlike other variational methods, our ensembles do not enforce agreement between sub-models, but filter the space of possible outputs by simply adding and thresholding the max-marginals of each constituent model. Our framework jointly estimates parameters for all models in the ensemble for each level of the cascade by minimizing a novel, convex loss function, yet requires only a linear increase in computation over learning or inference in a single tractable sub-model. We provide a generalization bound on the filtering loss of the ensemble as a theoretical justification of our approach, and we evaluate our method on both synthetic data and the task of estimating articulated human pose from challenging videos. We find that our approach significantly outperforms loopy belief propagation on the synthetic data and a state-of-the-art model on the pose estimation/tracking problem."

We derive an alternating minimization procedure for simultaneously learning codebooks in the Euclidean feature space and in the simplex of posterior class distributions. The resulting quantizer can be used to encode unlabeled points outside the training set and to predict their posterior class distributions, and has an elegant interpretation in terms of universal lossless coding. The promise of our method is demonstrated for the application of learning discriminative visual vocabularies for bag-of-features image classification."

Currently, evaluation of adjacent windows proceeds independently; this is suboptimal as detector responses at nearby locations and scales are correlated. We propose to exploit these correlations by tightly coupling detector evaluation of nearby windows. We introduce two opposing mechanisms: detector excitation of promising neighbors and inhibition of inferior neighbors. By enabling neighboring detectors to communicate, crosstalk cascades achieve major gains (4-30\u00d7 speedup) over cascades evaluated independently at each image location. Combined with recent advances in fast multi-scale feature computation, for which we provide an optimized implementation, our approach runs at 35-65 fps on 640\u00d7480 images while attaining state-of-the-art accuracy."
