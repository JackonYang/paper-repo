Moving targets are detected using the pixel wise difference between consecutive image frames. A classification metric is applied these targets with a temporal consistency constraint to classify them into three categories: human, vehicle or background clutter. Once classified targets are tracked by a combination of temporal differencing and template matching. The resulting system robustly identifies targets of interest, rejects background clutter and continually tracks over large distances and periods of time despite occlusions, appearance changes and cessation of target motion."

A deformable region model is presented: its optimisation is based on texture correlation and is constrained by the use of a motion model, such as rigid, affine or homographic. The use of texture information (versus edge information) noticeably improves the tracking performances of deformable models in the presence of texture. Then the region contour is refined using an edge based deformable model in order to better deal with specularities, non planar objects and occlusions. The method is illustrated and validated by experimental results on real images.<<ETX>>"

In this framework, the probability density of the tracker state is represented as a set of modes with piecewise Gaussians characterizing the neighborhood around these modes. The temporal evolution of the probability density is achieved through sampling from the prior distribution, followed by local optimization of the sample positions to obtain updated modes. This method of generating hypotheses from state-space search does not require the use of discrete features unlike classical multiple-hypothesis tracking. The parametric form of the model is suited for high dimensional state-spaces which cannot be efficiently modeled using non-parametric approaches. Results are shown for tracking Fred Astaire in a movie dance sequence."

This is obtained by employing a geodesic active region model where the designed objective function is composed of boundary and region-based terms and optimizes the curve position with respect to motion and intensity properties. The main novelty of our approach is that we deal with the motion estimation (linear models are assumed) and the tracking problem simultaneously. In other words, the optimization problem contains a coupled set of unknown variables; the curve position and the corresponding motion model. The designed objective function is minimized using a gradient descent method; the curve is propagated towards the object boundaries under the influence of boundary, intensity and motion-based forces using a PDE, while given the curve position an incremental analytical solution is obtained for the motion model. Besides, this PDE is implemented using a level set approach where topological changes are naturally handled. Very promising experimental results are provided using real video sequences."

It is assumed that the system observes multiple moving objects via a single, uncalibrated video camera. A novel extended Kalman filter formulation is used in estimating the relative 3D motion trajectories up to a scale factor. The recursive estimation process provides a prediction and error measure that is exploited in higher-level stages of action recognition. Conversely, higher-level mechanisms provide feedback that allows the system to reliable segment and maintain the tracking of moving objects before, during, and after occlusion. The 3D trajectory, occlusion, and segmentation information are utilized in extracting stabilized views of the moving object. Trajectory-guided recognition (TGR) is proposed as a new and efficient method for adaptive classification of action. The TGR approach is demonstrated using \"motion history images\" that are then recognized via a mixture of Gaussian classifier. The system was tested in recognizing various dynamic human outdoor activities; e.g., running, walking, roller blading, and cycling. Experiments with synthetic data sets are used to evaluate stability of the trajectory estimator with respect to noise."

The MHT algorithm is then applied to several motion sequences. The MHT capabilities of track initiation, termination, and continuation are demonstrated together with the latter's capability to provide low level support of temporary occlusion of tracks. Between 50 and 150 corner features are simultaneously tracked in the image plane over a sequence of up to 51 frames. Each corner is tracked using a simple linear Kalman filter and any data association uncertainty is resolved by the MHT. Kalman filter parameter estimation is discussed, and experimental results show that the algorithm is robust to errors in the motion model. An investigation of the performance of the algorithm as a function of look-ahead (tree depth) indicates that high accuracy can be obtained for tree depths as shallow as three. Experimental results suggest that a real-time MHT solution to the motion correspondence problem is possible for certain classes of scenes."

The head's projection onto the image plane is modeled as an ellipse whose position and size are continually updated by a local search combining the output of a module concentrating on the intensity gradient around the ellipse's perimeter with that of another module focusing on the color histogram of the ellipse's interior. Since these two modules have roughly orthogonal failure modes, they serve to complement one another. The result is a robust, real-time system that is able to track a person's head with enough accuracy to automatically control the camera's pan, tilt, and zoom in order to keep the person centered in the field of view at a desired size. Extensive experimentation shows the algorithm's robustness with respect to full 360-degree out-of-plane rotation, up to 90-degree tilting, severe but brief occlusion, arbitrary camera movement, and multiple moving people in the background."

Properties of the mean shift are reviewed and its convergence on lattices is proven. The proposed filtering method associates with each pixel in the image the closest local mode in the density distribution of the joint domain. Segmentation into a piecewise constant structure requires only one more step, fusion of the regions associated with nearby modes. The proposed technique has two parameters controlling the resolution in the spatial and range domains. Since convergence is guaranteed, the technique does not require the intervention of the user to stop the filtering at the desired image quality. Several examples, for gray and color images, show the versatility of the method and compare favorably with results described in the literature for the same images."

Real-time high-level systems perform poorly in clutter and initialisation for most high-level systems is either performed manually or by a separate module. This paper presents a new technique to combine low- and high-level information in a consistent probabilistic framework, using the statistical technique of importance sampling combined with the Condensation algorithm. The general framework, which we term Icondensation, is described, and a hand tracker is demonstrated which combines colour blob-tracking with a contour model. The resulting tracker is robust to rapid motion, heavy clutter and hand-coloured distractors, and re-initialises automatically. The system runs comfortably in real time on an entry-level desktop workstation."

The new algorithm is based on matching local histograms with the model, instead of directly replacing pixels with a confidence that they belong to the object. It is proved that a simple version of this algorithm degenerates into backprojection in the worst case. The authors show how to estimate the scale of the model.

The system has the following features: 1) it is constantly aware of the global surrounding, 2) it can dynamically determine its attention to focus on some important events, 3) it achieves real time and reliable performance. In the current implementation, we focus on the events which are triggered by moving persons. Two types of visual agents are used to track moving objects: a peripheral sensing agent that performs global monitoring tasks and a foveal agent that performs focused monitoring tasks. These two heterogeneous sensing agents are coupled in a unique way to work not only asynchronously but also collaboratively via a facilitator. Compared with existing approaches, the proposed scheme provides many advantages in handling the unrestricted movement and various types of occlusions."

Local edge cues, implemented by filters, provide information about the likely positions of edges which can be used as input to higher-level models. Different edge cues can be evaluated by the statistical effectiveness of their corresponding filters evaluated on a dataset of 100 presegmented images. We use information theoretic measures to determine the effectiveness of a variety of different edge detectors working at multiple scales on black and white and color images. Our results give quantitative measures for the advantages of multi-level processing, for the use of chromaticity in addition to greyscale, and for the relative effectiveness of different detectors."

This new distance measure is often easier to evaluate than the divergence. In the problems we have worked, it gives results that are at least as good as, and are often better, than those given by the divergence."
