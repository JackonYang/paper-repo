Although HMMs are a natural choice to warp the time axis and model the temporal phenomena in the speech signal, their conditional independence properties limit their ability to model spectral phenomena well. In this paper, a new acoustic modeling paradigm based on augmented conditional random fields (ACRFs) is investigated and developed. This paradigm addresses some limitations of HMMs while maintaining many of the aspects which have made them successful. In particular, the acoustic modeling problem is reformulated in a data driven, sparse, augmented space to increase discrimination. Acoustic context modeling is explicitly integrated to handle the sequential phenomena of the speech signal. We present an efficient framework for estimating these models that ensures scalability and generality. In the TIMIT phone recognition task, a phone error rate of 23.0% was recorded on the full test set, a significant improvement over comparable HMM-based systems."

A standard problem when using multivariate GMMs to classify data is how to accurately represent the correlations in the feature vector. Full covariance matrices yield a good model, but dramatically increase the number of model parameters. Hence, diagonal covariance matrices are commonly used. Structured precision matrix approximations provide an alternative, flexible, and compact representation. Schemes in this category include the extended maximum likelihood linear transform and subspace for precision and mean models. This paper examines how these precision matrix models can be discriminatively trained and used on state-of-the-art speech recognition tasks. In particular, the use of the minimum phone error criterion is investigated. Implementation issues associated with building LVCSR systems are also addressed. These models are evaluated and compared using large vocabulary continuous telephone speech and broadcast news English tasks."

The formulation of this generalized HTM is presented in the generative-modeling framework, enabling efficient computation of the joint likelihood for both static and delta cepstral sequences as the acoustic features given the model. The parameter estimation techniques for the new model are developed and presented, giving closed-form estimation formulas after the use of vector Taylor series approximation. We show principled generalization from the earlier static-cepstra HTM to the new static/delta-cepstra HTM not only in terms of model formulations but also in terms of their respective analytical forms in (monophone) parameter estimation. Experimental results on the standard TIMIT phonetic recognition task demonstrate recognition accuracy improvement over the earlier best HTM system, both significantly better than state-of-the-art triphone HMM systems."

Using multiple codebooks of various linear-predictive-coding (LPC) parameters and discrete hidden Markov models (HMMs) the authors obtain a speaker-independent phone recognition accuracy of 58.8-73.8% on the TIMIT database, depending on the type of acoustic and language models used. In comparison, the performance of expert spectrogram readers is only 69% without use of higher level knowledge. The authors introduce the co-occurrence smoothing algorithm, which enables accurate recognition even with very limited training data.

First, heterogeneous acoustic measurements are chosen in order to maximize the acoustic-phonetic information extracted from the speech signal in preprocessing. Second, classifier systems are presented for successfully utilizing high-dimensional acoustic measurement spaces. The techniques used for achieving these two goals can be broadly categorized as hierarchical, committeebased, or a hybrid of these two. This paper presents committeebased and hybrid approaches. In context-independent classification and context-dependent recognition on the TIMIT core test set using 39 classes, the system achieved error rates of 18.3% and 24.4%, respectively. These error rates are the lowest we have seen reported on these tasks. In addition, experiments with a telephone-based weather information word recognition task led to word error rate reductions of 10\u201316%."

Starting from a description of the speech signal and its parameterisation, the various modelling assumptions and their consequences are discussed. It then describes various techniques by which the effects of these assumptions can be mitigated. Despite the progress that has been made, ther limitations of current modelling techniques are still evident. The paper therefore concludes with a brief review of some of the more fundamental modelling work now in progress."

Large margin GMMs have many parallels to support vector machines (SVMs) but use ellipsoids to model classes instead of half-spaces. Model parameters are trained discriminatively to maximize the margin of correct classification, as measured in terms of Mahalanobis distances. The required optimization is convex over the model's parameter space of positive semidefinite matrices and can be performed efficiently. Large margin GMMs are naturally suited to large problems in multiway classification; we apply them to phonetic classification and recognition on the TIMIT database. On both tasks, we obtain significant improvement over baseline systems trained by maximum likelihood estimation. For the problem of phonetic classification, our results are competitive with other state-of-the-art classifiers, such as hidden conditional random fields"

The problem lies in the restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) which is used as a module for learning deep belief nets one layer at a time.

We propose a factored 3-way RBM that uses the states of its hidden units to represent abnormalities in the local covariance structure of an image. This provides a probabilistic framework for the widely used simple/complex cell architecture. Our model learns binary features that work very well for object recognition on the \u201ctiny images\u201d data set.

Previous work on learning such models has focused on methods in which the latent features are used to determine the mean and variance of each pixel independently, or on methods in which the hidden units determine the covariance matrix of a zero-mean Gaussian distribution. In this work, we propose a probabilistic model that combines these two approaches into a single framework. We represent each image using one set of binary latent features that model the image-specific covariance and a separate set that model the mean. We show that this approach provides a probabilistic framework for the widely used simple-cell complex-cell architecture, it produces very realistic samples of natural images and it extracts features that yield state-of-the-art recognition accuracy on the challenging CIFAR 10 dataset."

The top-level model is a third-order Boltzmann machine, trained using a hybrid algorithm that combines both generative and discriminative gradients. Performance is evaluated on the NORB database (normalized-uniform version), which contains stereo-pair images of objects under different lighting conditions and viewpoints. Our model achieves 6.5% error on the test set, which is close to the best published result for NORB (5.9%) using a convolutional neural net that has built-in knowledge of translation invariance. It substantially outperforms shallow models such as SVMs (11.6%). DBNs are especially suited for semi-supervised learning, and to demonstrate this we consider a modified version of the NORB recognition task in which additional unlabeled images are created by applying small translations to the images in the database. With the extra unlabeled data (and the same amount of labeled data as before), our model achieves 5.2% error."

                "text": "While research in large vocabulary continuous speech recognition (LVCSR) has sparked the development of many state of the art research ideas, research in this domain suffers from two main drawbacks. First, because of the large number of parameters and poorly labeled transcriptions, gaining insight into further improvements based on error analysis is very difficult. Second, LVCSR systems often take a significantly longer time to train and test new research ideas compared to small vocabulary tasks. A small vocabulary task like TIMIT provides a phonetically rich and hand-labeled corpus and offers a good test bed to study algorithmic improvements. However, oftentimes research ideas explored for small vocabulary tasks do not always provide gains on LVCSR systems. In this paper, we address these issues by taking the standard \u021crecipe\u021d used in typical LVCSR systems and applying it to the TIMIT phonetic recognition corpus, which provides a standard benchmark to compare methods. We find that at the speaker-independent (SI) level, our results offer comparable performance to other SI HMM systems. By taking advantage of speaker adaptation and discriminative training techniques commonly used in LVCSR systems, we achieve an error rate of 20%, the best results reported on the TIMIT task to date, moving us closer to the human reported phonetic recognition error rate of 15%. We propose the use of this system as the baseline for future research and believe that it will serve as a good framework to explore ideas that will carry over to LVCSR systems."

Using complementary priors, we derive a fast, greedy algorithm that can learn deep, directed belief networks one layer at a time, provided the top two layers form an undirected associative memory. The fast, greedy algorithm is used to initialize a slower learning procedure that fine-tunes the weights using a contrastive version of the wake-sleep algorithm. After fine-tuning, a network with three hidden layers forms a very good generative model of the joint distribution of handwritten digit images and their labels. This generative model gives better digit classification than the best discriminative learning algorithms. The low-dimensional manifolds on which the digits lie are modeled by long ravines in the free-energy landscape of the top-level associative memory, and it is easy to explore these ravines by using the directed connections to display what the associative memory has in mind."

The need for efficient exploitation of context information is discussed; a role for which the recurrent net appears suitable. An overview of early developments of recurrent nets for phone recognition is given along with the more recent improvements that include their integration with Markov models. Recognition results are presented for the DARPA TIMIT and Resource Management tasks, and it is concluded that recurrent nets are competitive with traditional means for performing phone probability estimation."

With this system, we show that this CRF model achieves an accuracy level in a phone recognition task that is superior to a similarly trained HMM model.

The approach uses a fast segment classification method that reduces computation by a factor of two to four, depending on the confidence of choosing the most probable model. A split-and-merge segmentation algorithm is proposed as an alternative to the typical dynamic programming solution of the segmentation and recognition problem, with computation savings increasing proportionally with model complexity. Although the current recognizer uses context-independent phone models, the results reported for the TIMIT database for speaker-independent joint segmentation and recognition are comparable to those of systems that use context information. >"

This book demonstrates how Bayesian methods allow complex neural network models to be used without fear of the \"overfitting\" that can occur with traditional training methods. Insight into the nature of these complex Bayesian models is provided by a theoretical investigation of the priors over functions that underlie them. A practical implementation of Bayesian neural network learning using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods is also described, and software for it is freely available over the Internet. Presupposing only basic knowledge of probability and statistics, this book should be of interest to researchers in statistics, engineering, and artificial intelligence."
