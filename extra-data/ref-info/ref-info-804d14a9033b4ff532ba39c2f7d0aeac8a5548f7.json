It also confronts vision researchers the problem of finding effective methods to navigate the vast amount of visual information. Semantic image understanding plays a vital role towards solving this problem. One important task in image understanding is object recognition, in particular, generic object categorization. Critical to this problem are the issues of learning and dataset. Abundant data helps to train a robust recognition system, while a good object classifier can help to collect a large amount of images. This paper presents a novel object recognition algorithm that performs automatic dataset collecting and incremental model learning simultaneously. The goal of this work is to use the tremendous resources of the web to learn robust object category models for detecting and searching for objects in real-world cluttered scenes. Humans contiguously update the knowledge of objects when new examples are observed. Our framework emulates this human learning process by iteratively accumulating model knowledge and image examples. We adapt a non-parametric latent topic model and propose an incremental learning framework. Our algorithm is capable of automatically collecting much larger object category datasets for 22 randomly selected classes from the Caltech 101 dataset. Furthermore, our system offers not only more images in each object category but also a robust object category model and meaningful image annotation. Our experiments show that OPTIMOL is capable of collecting image datasets that are superior to the well known manually collected object datasets Caltech 101 and LabelMe."

However, manually creating labels is not only time-consuming but also subject to human errors, and eventually, becomes impossible for a very large amount of data (e.g. 24/7 surveillance video). To minimize the human effort in labeling, we propose a unified multiclass active learning approach for automatically labeling video data. We include extending active learning from binary classes to multiple classes and evaluating several practical sample selection strategies. The experimental results show that the proposed approach works effectively even with a significantly reduced amount of labeled data. The best sample selection strategy can achieve more than a 50% error reduction over random sample selection."

The original Caltech-101 [1] was collected by choosing a set of object categories, downloading examples from Google Images and then manually screening out all images that did not fit the category. Caltech-256 is collected in a similar manner with several improvements: a) the number of categories is more than doubled, b) the minimum number of images in any category is increased from 31 to 80, c) artifacts due to image rotation are avoided and d) a new and larger clutter category is introduced for testing background rejection. We suggest several testing paradigms to measure classification performance, then benchmark the dataset using two simple metrics as well as a state-of-the-art spatial pyramid matching [2] algorithm. Finally we use the clutter category to train an interest detector which rejects uninformative background regions."

Such data is useful for supervised learning and quantitative evaluation. To achieve this, we developed a web-based tool that allows easy image annotation and instant sharing of such annotations. Using this annotation tool, we have collected a large dataset that spans many object categories, often containing multiple instances over a wide variety of images. We quantify the contents of the dataset and compare against existing state of the art datasets used for object recognition and detection. Also, we show how to extend the dataset to automatically enhance object labels with WordNet, discover object parts, recover a depth ordering of objects in a scene, and increase the number of labels using minimal user supervision and images from the web.\n"

Mainly off-line training methods have been used, which implies that all training data has to be a priori given; training and usage of the classifier are separate steps. Training the classifier on-line and incrementally as new data becomes available has several advantages and opens new areas of application for boosting in computer vision. In this paper we propose a novel on-line AdaBoost feature selection method. In conjunction with efficient feature extraction methods the method is real time capable. We demonstrate the multifariousness of the method on such diverse tasks as learning complex background models, visual tracking and object detection. All approaches benefit significantly by the on-line training."

Much of this data has not appeared in previous databases. In addition, And-Or Graph is used to organize visual elements to facilitate top-down labeling. An annotation tool is developed to realize and integrate all tasks. With this tool, we've been able to create a database consisting of more than 636,748 annotated images and video frames. Lastly, the data is organized into 13 common subsets to serve as benchmarks for diverse evaluation endeavors."

Motivated by these observations, we explore the space of 32 \u00d7 32 images using a database of 10 32\u00d7 32 color images gathered from the Internet using image search engines. Each image is loosely labeled with one of the 70, 399 non-abstract nouns in English, as listed in the Wordnet lexical database. Hence the image database represents a dense sampling of all object categories and scenes. With this dataset, we use nearest neighbor methods to perform object recognition across the 10 images."

This paper provides a benchmark for evaluating progress on this fundamental task. Several methods have recently proposed to utilize the commonalities between object classes in order to improve generalization accuracy. Such methods can be termed interclass transfer techniques. However, it is currently difficult to asses which of the proposed methods maximally utilizes the shared structure of related classes. In order to facilitate the development, as well as the assessment of methods for dealing with multiple related classes, a new dataset including images of several hundred mammal classes, is provided, together with preliminary results of its use. The images in this dataset are organized into five levels of variability, and their labels include information on the objects\u2019 identity, location and pose. From this dataset, a classification benchmark has been derived, requiring fine distinctions between 72 mammal classes. It is then demonstrated that a recognition method which is highly successful on the Caltech101, attains limited accuracy on the current benchmark (36.5%). Since this method does not utilize the shared structure between classes, the question remains as to whether interclass transfer methods can increase the accuracy to the level of human performance (90%). We suggest that a labeled benchmark of the type provided, containing a large number of related classes is crucial for the development and evaluation of classification methods which make efficient use of interclass transfer.\n"

A multi-modal approach employing both text, meta data and visual features is used to gather many, high-quality images from the Web. Candidate images are obtained by a text based Web search querying on the object identifier (the word penguin). The Web pages and the images they contain are downloaded. The task is then to remove irrelevant images and re-rank the remainder. First, the images are re-ranked using a Bayes posterior estimator trained on the text surrounding the image and meta data features (such as the image alternative tag, image title tag, and image filename). No visual information is used at this stage. Second, the top-ranked images are used as (noisy) training data and a SVM visual classifier is learnt to improve the ranking further. The principal novelty is in combining text/meta-data and visual features in order to achieve a completely automatic ranking of the images. Examples are given for a selection of animals (e.g. camels, sharks, penguins), vehicles (cars, airplanes, bikes) and other classes (guitar, wristwatch), totalling 18 classes. The results are assessed by precision/recall curves on ground truth annotated data and by comparison to previous approaches including those of Berg et al. (on an additional six classes) and Fergus et al."

The images we classify depict animals in a wide range of aspects, configurations and appearances. In addition, the images typically portray multiple species that differ in appearance (e.g. ukari\u2019s, vervet monkeys, spider monkeys, rhesus monkeys, etc.). Our method is accurate despite this variation and relies on four simple cues: text, color, shape and texture. Visual cues are evaluated by a voting method that compares local image phenomena with a number of visual exemplars for the category. The visual exemplars are obtained using a clustering method applied to text on web pages. The only supervision required involves identifying which clusters of exemplars refer to which sense of a term (for example, \"monkey\" can refer to an animal or a bandmember). Because our method is applied to web pages with free text, the word cue is extremely noisy. We show unequivocal evidence that visual information improves performance for our task. Our method allows us to produce large, accurate and challenging visual datasets mostly automatically."

Such natural textures arise from spatial variation of two surface attributes: (1) reflectance and (2) surface normal. In this paper, we provide a unified model to address both these aspects of natural texture. The main idea is to construct a vocabulary of prototype tiny surface patches with associated local geometric and photometric properties. We call these 3D textons. Examples might be ridges, grooves, spots or stripes or combinations thereof. Associated with each texton is an appearance vector, which characterizes the local irradiance distribution, represented as a set of linear Gaussian derivative filter outputs, under different lighting and viewing conditions.Given a large collection of images of different materials, a clustering approach is used to acquire a small (on the order of 100) 3D texton vocabulary. Given a few (1 to 4) images of any material, it can be characterized using these textons. We demonstrate the application of this representation for recognition of the material viewed under novel lighting and viewing conditions. We also illustrate how the 3D texton model can be used to predict the appearance of materials under novel conditions."

In the traditional supervised passive approach, the system is trained on a given number of annotated data samples and evaluated using a separate test set. Then more data is collected arbitrarily, annotated, and the whole cycle is repeated. In this article, we propose the active approach where the system itself selects its own training data, evaluates itself and re-trains when necessary. We first employ active learning which aims to automatically select the examples that are likely to be the most informative for a given task. We use active learning for both selecting the examples to label and the examples to re-label in order to correct labeling errors. Furthermore, the system automatically evaluates itself using active evaluation to keep track of the unexpected events and decides on-demand to label more examples. The active approach enables dynamic adaptation of spoken language processing systems to unseen or unexpected events for nonstationary input while reducing the manual annotation effort significantly. We have evaluated the active approach with the AT&T spoken dialog system used for customer care applications. In this article, we present our results for both automatic speech recognition and spoken language understanding."

In this paper, we present online versions of bagging and boosting that require only one pass through the training data. We build on previously presented work by describing some theoretical results.

The accelerated algorithm avoids unnecessary distance calculations by applying the triangle inequality in two different ways, and by keeping track of lower and upper bounds for distances between points and centers. Experiments show that the new algorithm is effective for datasets with up to 1000 dimensions, and becomes more and more effective as the number k of clusters increases. For k \u2265 20 it is many times faster than the best previously known accelerated k-means method."

We assume that the number of mixture components is unknown a priori and is to be inferred from the data. In this setting it is natural to consider sets of Dirichlet processes, one for each group, where the well-known clustering property of the Dirichlet process provides a nonparametric prior for the number of mixture components within each group. Given our desire to tie the mixture models in the various groups, we consider a hierarchical model, specifically one in which the base measure for the child Dirichlet processes is itself distributed according to a Dirichlet process. Such a base measure being discrete, the child Dirichlet processes necessarily share atoms. Thus, as desired, the mixture models in the different groups necessarily share mixture components. We discuss representations of hierarchical Dirichlet processes in terms of a stick-breaking process, and a generalization of the Chinese restaurant process that we refer to as the \u201cChinese restaurant franchise.\u201d We present Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms for posterior inference in hierarchical Dirichlet process mixtures and describe applications to problems in information retrieval and text modeling."
