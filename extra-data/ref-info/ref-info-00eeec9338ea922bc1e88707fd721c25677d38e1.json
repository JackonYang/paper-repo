More complex, better suited distance measures are often expensive and rather ad-hoc (elastic matching, deformable templates). We propose a new distance measure which (a) can be made locally invariant to any set of transformations of the input and (b) can be computed efficiently. We tested the method on large handwritten character databases provided by the Post Office and the NIST. Using invariances with respect to translation, rotation, scaling, shearing and line thickness, the method consistently outperformed all other systems tested on the same databases."

Our method has in theory the same recognition accuracy as other recent methods based on \"tangent distance\" [Simard et al., 1994], since it uses the same categorization rule. Nevertheless ours is significantly faster during classification because far fewer tangent distances need be computed. Crucial to the success of our system are 1) a novel graph architecture in which transformation constraints and geometric relationships among prototypes are encoded during learning, and 2) an improved graph search criterion, used during classification. These architectural insights are applicable to a wide range of problem domains. Here we demonstrate that on a handwriting recognition task, a basic implementation of our system requires less than half the computation of the Euclidean sorting method."

In this paper we optimize the searching process for tangent distance (Simard, LeCun and Denker, 1993) to improve speed performance. The closest prototypes are found by recursively searching included subsets of the database using distances of increasing complexity. This is done by using a hierarchy of tangent distances (increasing the Humber of tangent. vectors from 0 to its maximum) and multiresolution (using wavelets). At each stage, a confidence level of the classification is computed. If the confidence is high enough, the computation of more complex distances is avoided. The resulting algorithm applied to character recognition is close to three orders of magnitude faster than computing the full tangent distance on every prototypes."
