We obtained excellent results when dividing the face images into several regions from which the LBP features are extracted and concatenated into an enhanced feature vector as a face descriptor. However, it was unclear whether the obtained results were due to the use of local regions (instead of a holistic approach) or to the discriminative power of LBP. In this work, we investigated this issue by adopting and comparing four different texture features when using the appearances of local regions. The experimental results clearly showed and confirmed the validity of using LBP for face description."

LBP is a very powerful method to describe the texture and shape of a digital image. Therefore it appeared to be suitable for feature extraction in face recognition systems. A face image is first divided into small regions from which LBP histograms are extracted and then concatenated into a single feature vector. This feature vector forms an efficient representation of the face and can be used to measure similarities between images. The report describes the principles of the method and how exactly it can be implemented to perform face recognition. Experiments have been carried out on the different sets of the FERET database. High recognition rates are obtained, especially compared to other face recognition methods. Also a few extensions are investigated to further improve the performance of the method. It appeared that LBP can easily be combined with Principal Component Analysis to reduce the length of the feature vector, while the recognition performance only slightly decreases."

Our approach is based on the simple local binary patterns (LBP) for representing salient micro-patterns of face images. Compared to Gabor wavelets, the LBP features can be extracted faster in a single scan through the raw image and lie in a lower dimensional space, whilst still retaining facial information efficiently. Template matching with weighted Chi square statistic and support vector machine are adopted to classify facial expressions. Extensive experiments on the Cohn-Kanade Database illustrate that the LBP features are effective and efficient for facial expression discrimination. Additionally, experiments on face images with different resolutions show that the LBP features are robust to low-resolution images, which is critical in real-world applications where only low-resolution video input is available."

The face representation is based on local binary patterns (LBP) and consists of encoding both local and global facial characteristics into a compact feature histogram. The proposed representation is invariant with respect to monotonic gray scale transformations and can be derived in a single scan through the image. Considering the derived feature space, a second-degree polynomial kernel SVM classifier was trained to detect frontal faces in gray scale images. Experimental results using several complex images show that the proposed approach performs favorably compared to the state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, experiments with detecting and recognizing low-resolution faces from video sequences were carried out, demonstrating that the same facial representation can be efficiently used for both detection and recognition."

Nevertheless, these approaches are always suffering from the generalizability problem. This paper proposes a novel non-statistics based face representation approach, local Gabor binary pattern histogram sequence (LGBPHS), in which training procedure is unnecessary to construct the face model, so that the generalizability problem is naturally avoided. In this approach, a face image is modeled as a \"histogram sequence\" by concatenating the histograms of all the local regions of all the local Gabor magnitude binary pattern maps. For recognition, histogram intersection is used to measure the similarity of different LGBPHSs and the nearest neighborhood is exploited for final classification. Additionally, we have further proposed to assign different weights for each histogram piece when measuring two LGBPHSes. Our experimental results on AR and FERET face database show the validity of the proposed approach especially for partially occluded face images, and more impressively, we have achieved the best result on FERET face database."

As opposed to PCA, 2DPCA is based on 2D image matrices rather than 1D vectors so the image matrix does not need to be transformed into a vector prior to feature extraction. Instead, an image covariance matrix is constructed directly using the original image matrices, and its eigenvectors are derived for image feature extraction. To test 2DPCA and evaluate its performance, a series of experiments were performed on three face image databases: ORL, AR, and Yale face databases. The recognition rate across all trials was higher using 2DPCA than PCA. The experimental results also indicated that the extraction of image features is computationally more efficient using 2DPCA than PCA."

The novelties are: (1) a novel design of camera hardware, and (2) a learning based procedure for effective face and eye detection and recognition with the resulting imagery. The hardware minimizes environmental lighting and delivers face images with frontal lighting. This avoids many problems in subsequent face processing to a great extent. The face detection and recognition algorithms are based on a local feature representation. Statistical learning is applied to learn most effective features and classifiers for building face detection and recognition engines. The novel imaging system and the detection and recognition engines are integrated into a powerful face recognition system. Evaluated in real-world user scenario, a condition that is harder than a technology evaluation such as Face Recognition Vendor Tests (FRVT), the system has demonstrated excellent accuracy, speed and usability."

Using Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) of different aspects of human faces in spatial domain, we first evaluate the significance of visual information in different parts/features of the face for identifying the human subject. The LDA of faces also provides us with a small set of features that carry the most relevant information for classification purposes. The features are obtained through eigenvector analysis of scatter matrices with the objective of maximizing between-class and minimizing within-class variations. The result is an efficient projection-based feature extraction and classification scheme for AFR. Soft decisions made based on each of the projections are combined, using probabilistic or evidential approaches to multisource data analysis. For medium-sized databases of human faces, good classification accuracy is achieved using very low-dimensional feature vectors."

Accurate visual recognition is demonstrated using a database of O(10/sup 3/) faces. The problem of recognition under general viewing orientation is also examined. A view-based multiple-observer eigenspace technique is proposed for use in face recognition under variable pose. In addition, a modular eigenspace description technique is used which incorporates salient features such as the eyes, nose and mouth, in an eigenfeature layer. This modular representation yields higher recognition rates as well as a more robust framework for face recognition. An automatic feature extraction technique using feature eigentemplates is also demonstrated.<<ETX>>"

The color and texture descriptors that are described in this paper have undergone extensive evaluation and development during the past two years. Evaluation criteria include effectiveness of the descriptors in similarity retrieval, as well as extraction, storage, and representation complexities. The color descriptors in the standard include a histogram descriptor that is coded using the Haar transform, a color structure histogram, a dominant color descriptor, and a color layout descriptor. The three texture descriptors include one that characterizes homogeneous texture regions and another that represents the local edge distribution. A compact descriptor that facilitates texture browsing is also defined. Each of the descriptors is explained in detail by their semantics, extraction and usage. The effectiveness is documented by experimental results."

At least two reasons account for this trend: the first is the wide range of commercial and law enforcement applications, and the second is the availability of feasible technologies after 30 years of research. Even though current machine recognition systems have reached a certain level of maturity, their success is limited by the conditions imposed by many real applications. For example, recognition of face images acquired in an outdoor environment with changes in illumination and/or pose remains a largely unsolved problem. In other words, current systems are still far away from the capability of the human perception system.This paper provides an up-to-date critical survey of still- and video-based face recognition research. There are two underlying motivations for us to write this survey paper: the first is to provide an up-to-date review of the existing literature, and the second is to offer some insights into the studies of machine recognition of faces. To provide a comprehensive survey, we not only categorize existing recognition techniques but also present detailed descriptions of representative methods within each category. In addition, relevant topics such as psychophysical studies, system evaluation, and issues of illumination and pose variation are covered."

The system includes standardized image pre-processing software, three distinct face recognition algorithms, analysis software to study algorithm performance, and Unix shell scripts to run standard experiments. All code is written in ANSI C. The preprocessing code replicates feature of preprocessing used in the FERET evaluations. The three algorithms provided are Principle Components Analysis (PCA), a.k.a Eigenfaces, a combined Principle Components Analysis and Linear Discriminant Analysis algorithm (PCA+LDA), and a Bayesian Intrapersonal/Extrapersonal Classifier (BIC). The PCA+LDA and BIC algorithms are based upon algorithms used in the FERET study contributed by the University of Maryland and MIT respectively. There are two analysis. The first takes as input a set of probe images, a set of gallery images, and similarity matrix produced by one of the three algorithms. It generates a Cumulative Match Curve of recognition rate versus recognition rank. The second analysis tool generates a sample probability distribution for recognition rate at recognition rank 1, 2, etc. It takes as input multiple images per subject, and uses Monte Carlo sampling in the space of possible probe and gallery choices. This procedure will, among other things, add standard error bars to a Cumulative Match Curve. The System is available through our website and we hope it will be used by others to rigorously compare novel face identification algorithms to standard algorithms using a common implementation and known comparison techniques."

The method is based on recognizing that certain local binary patterns, termed \"uniform,\" are fundamental properties of local image texture and their occurrence histogram is proven to be a very powerful texture feature. We derive a generalized gray-scale and rotation invariant operator presentation that allows for detecting the \"uniform\" patterns for any quantization of the angular space and for any spatial resolution and presents a method for combining multiple operators for multiresolution analysis. The proposed approach is very robust in terms of gray-scale variations since the operator is, by definition, invariant against any monotonic transformation of the gray scale. Another advantage is computational simplicity as the operator can be realized with a few operations in a small neighborhood and a lookup table. Experimental results demonstrate that good discrimination can be achieved with the occurrence statistics of simple rotation invariant local binary patterns."

All code is written in ANSII C. The four algorithms provided are principle components analysis (PCA), a.k.a eigenfaces, a combined principle components analysis and linear discriminant analysis algorithm (PCA + LDA), an intrapersonal/extrapersonal image difference classifier (IIDC), and an elastic bunch graph matching (EBGM) algorithm. The PCA + LDA, IIDC, and EBGM algorithms are based upon algorithms used in the FERET study contributed by the University of Maryland, MIT, and USC, respectively. One analysis tool generates cumulative match curves; the other generates a sample probability distribution for recognition rate at recognition rank 1, 2, etc., using Monte Carlo sampling to generate probe and gallery choices. The sample probability distributions at each rank allow standard error bars to be added to cumulative match curves. The tool also generates sample probability distributions for the paired difference of recognition rates for two algorithms. Whether one algorithm consistently outperforms another is easily tested using this distribution. The CSU Face Identification Evaluation System is available through our Web site and we hope it will be used by others to rigorously compare novel face identification algorithms to standard algorithms using a common implementation and known comparison techniques."

We model two classes of variation in object appearance: intra-object and extra-object. The probability density functions for each class are then estimated from training data and used to compute a similarity measure based on the a posteriori probabilities. Furthermore, we use a novel representation for characterizing image differences using a deformable technique for obtaining pixel-wise correspondences. This representation, which is based on a deformable 3D mesh in XYI-space, is then experimentally compared with two simpler representations: intensity differences and optical flow. The performance advantage of our deformable matching technique is demonstrated using a typically hard test set drawn from the US Army's FERET face database."

The computational approach taken in this system is motivated by both physiology and information theory, as well as by the practical requirements of near-real-time performance and accuracy. Our approach treats the face recognition problem as an intrinsically two-dimensional (2-D) recognition problem rather than requiring recovery of three-dimensional geometry, taking advantage of the fact that faces are normally upright and thus may be described by a small set of 2-D characteristic views. The system functions by projecting face images onto a feature space that spans the significant variations among known face images. The significant features are known as \"eigenfaces,\" because they are the eigenvectors (principal components) of the set of faces; they do not necessarily correspond to features such as eyes, ears, and noses. The projection operation characterizes an individual face by a weighted sum of the eigenface features, and so to recognize a particular face it is necessary only to compare these weights to those of known individuals. Some particular advantages of our approach are that it provides for the ability to learn and later recognize new faces in an unsupervised manner, and that it is easy to implement using a neural network architecture."

It is demonstrated that textures can be classified using the joint distribution of intensity values over extremely compact neighborhoods (starting from as small as 3 /spl times/ 3 pixels square), and that this outperforms classification using filter banks with large support. We develop a novel texton based representation, which is suited to modeling this joint neighborhood distribution for MRFs. The representation is learnt from training images, and then used to classify novel images (with unknown viewpoint and lighting) into texture classes. The power of the method is demonstrated by classifying over 2800 images of all 61 textures present in the Columbia-Utrecht database. The classification performance surpasses that of recent state-of-the-art filter bank based classifiers such as Leung & Malik, Cula & Dana, and Varma & Zisserman."

Many different descriptors have been proposed in the literature. It is unclear which descriptors are more appropriate and how their performance depends on the interest region detector. The descriptors should be distinctive and at the same time robust to changes in viewing conditions as well as to errors of the detector. Our evaluation uses as criterion recall with respect to precision and is carried out for different image transformations. We compare shape context [Belongie, S, et al., April 2002], steerable filters [Freeman, W and Adelson, E, Setp. 1991], PCA-SIFT [Ke, Y and Sukthankar, R, 2004], differential invariants [Koenderink, J and van Doorn, A, 1987], spin images [Lazebnik, S, et al., 2003], SIFT [Lowe, D. G., 1999], complex filters [Schaffalitzky, F and Zisserman, A, 2002], moment invariants [Van Gool, L, et al., 1996], and cross-correlation for different types of interest regions. We also propose an extension of the SIFT descriptor and show that it outperforms the original method. Furthermore, we observe that the ranking of the descriptors is mostly independent of the interest region detector and that the SIFT-based descriptors perform best. Moments and steerable filters show the best performance among the low dimensional descriptors."

Therefore, how to use frequent classes to help learning rare classes for which it is harder to collect the training data is an open question. Learning with Shared Information is an emerging topic in machine learning, computer vision and multimedia analysis. There are different level of components that can be shared during concept modeling and machine learning stages, such as sharing generic object parts, sharing attributes, sharing transformations, sharing regularization parameters and sharing training examples, etc. Regarding the specific methods, multi-task learning, transfer learning and deep learning can be seen as using different strategies to share information. These learning with shared information methods are very effective in solving real-world large-scale problems. This special issue aims at gathering the recent advances in learning with shared information methods and their applications in computer vision and multimedia analysis. Both state-of-the-art works, as well as literature reviews, are welcome for submission. Papers addressing interesting real-world computer vision and multimedia applications are especially encouraged. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:  \u2022 Multi-task learning or transfer learning for large-scale computer vision and multimedia analysis \u2022 Deep learning for large-scale computer vision and multimedia analysis \u2022 Multi-modal approach for large-scale computer vision and multimedia analysis \u2022 Different sharing strategies, e.g., sharing generic object parts, sharing attributes, sharing transformations, sharing regularization parameters and sharing training examples, \u2022 Real-world computer vision and multimedia applications based on learning with shared information, e.g., event detection, object recognition, object detection, action recognition, human head pose estimation, object tracking, location-based services, semantic indexing. \u2022 New datasets and metrics to evaluate the benefit of the proposed sharing ability for the specific computer vision or multimedia problem. \u2022 Survey papers regarding the topic of learning with shared information.
