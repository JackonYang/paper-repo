A texture model is a mathematical procedure capable of producing and describing a textured image. We explore the use of Markov random fields as texture models. The binomial model, where each point in the texture has a binomial distribution with parameter controlled by its neighbors and ``number of tries'' equal to the number of gray levels, was taken to be the basic model for the analysis. A method of generating samples from the binomial model is given, followed by a theoretical and practical analysis of the method's convergence. Examples show how the parameters of the Markov random field control the strength and direction of the clustering in the image. The power of the binomial model to produce blurry, sharp, line-like, and blob-like textures is demonstrated. Natural texture samples were digitized and their parameters were estimated under the Markov random field model. A hypothesis test was used for an objective assessment of goodness-of-fit under the Markov random field model. Overall, microtextures fit the model well. The estimated parameters of the natural textures were used as input to the generation procedure. The synthetic microtextures closely resembled their real counterparts, while the regular and inhomogeneous textures did not."

The channels are characterized by a bank of Gabor filters that nearly uniformly covers the spatial-frequency domain. A systematic filter selection scheme based on reconstruction of the input image from the filtered images is proposed. Texture features are obtained by subjecting each (selected) filtered image to a nonlinear transformation and computing a measure of energy in a window around each pixel. An unsupervised square-error clustering algorithm is then used to integrate the feature images and produce a segmentation. A simple procedure to incorporate spatial adjacency information in the clustering process is proposed. Experiments on images with natural textures as well as artificial textures with identical second and third-order statistics are reported.

An energy detector is developed in the cumulant domain by exploiting the noise insensitivity of higher order statistics. An efficient implementation of this detector is described, using matched filtering. Its performance is analyzed using asymptotic distributions in a binary hypothesis-testing framework. The object and texture discriminant functions are minimum distance classifiers in the cumulant domain and can be efficiently implemented using a bank of matched filters. They are immune to additive Gaussian noise and insensitive to object shifts. Important extensions, which can handle object rotation and scaling, are also discussed. An alternative texture classifier is derived from a ML viewpoint and is statistically efficient at the expense of complexity. The application of these algorithms to the texture-modeling problem is indicated, and consistent parameter estimates are obtained. >"

With the help of well-developed methods in the time series analysis the process that generates the pixels of the parent texture is identified.

Our model combines kernel estimation with clustering, to obtain a semiparametric probability mass function estimate which summarizes -- rather than contains -- the training data. Because the model is cluster based, it is inferable from a limited set of training data, despite the model's high dimensionality. Moreover, its functional form allows recursive implementation that avoids exponential growth in required memory as the number of dimensions increases. Experimental results are presented for each of the three applications considered."

Pixel gray levels and the presence and orientation of edges are viewed as states of atoms or molecules in a lattice-like physical system. The assignment of an energy function in the physical system determines its Gibbs distribution. Because of the Gibbs distribution, Markov random field (MRF) equivalence, this assignment also determines an MRF image model. The energy function is a more convenient and natural mechanism for embodying picture attributes than are the local characteristics of the MRF. For a range of degradation mechanisms, including blurring, nonlinear deformations, and multiplicative or additive noise, the posterior distribution is an MRF with a structure akin to the image model. By the analogy, the posterior distribution defines another (imaginary) physical system. Gradual temperature reduction in the physical system isolates low energy states (``annealing''), or what is the same thing, the most probable states under the Gibbs distribution. The analogous operation under the posterior distribution yields the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the image given the degraded observations. The result is a highly parallel ``relaxation'' algorithm for MAP estimation. We establish convergence properties of the algorithm and we experiment with some simple pictures, for which good restorations are obtained at low signal-to-noise ratios."

Completeness criteria for 2D Gabor image representations are important because of their increasing role in many computer vision applications and also in modeling biological vision, since recent neurophysiological evidence from the visual cortex of mammalian brains suggests that the filter response profiles of the main class of linearly-responding cortical neurons (called simple cells) are best modeled as a family of self-similar 2D Gabor wavelets. We therefore derive the conditions under which a set of continuous 2D Gabor wavelets will provide a complete representation of any image, and we also find self-similar wavelet parametrization which allow stable reconstruction by summation as though the wavelets formed an orthonormal basis. Approximating a \"tight frame\" generates redundancy which allows low-resolution neural responses to represent high-resolution images."

To understand the representation of images by the mammalian visual system, it might therefore be useful to consider the statistics of images from the natural environment (i.e., images with trees, rocks, bushes, etc). In this study, various coding schemes are compared in relation to how they represent the information in such natural images. The coefficients of such codes are represented by arrays of mechanisms that respond to local regions of space, spatial frequency, and orientation (Gabor-like transforms). For many classes of image, such codes will not be an efficient means of representing information. However, the results obtained with six natural images suggest that the orientation and the spatial-frequency tuning of mammalian simple cells are well suited for coding the information in such images if the goal of the code is to convert higher-order redundancy (e.g., correlation between the intensities of neighboring pixels) into first-order redundancy (i.e., the response distribution of the coefficients). Such coding produces a relatively high signal-to-noise ratio and permits information to be transmitted with only a subset of the total number of cells. These results support Barlow's theory that the goal of natural vision is to represent the information in the natural environment with minimal redundancy."

This algorithm is derived by minimizing a generalized Bayes/minimum description length (MDL) criterion using the variational principle. The algorithm is guaranteed to converge to a local minimum and combines aspects of snakes/balloons and region growing. The classic snakes/balloons and region growing algorithms can be directly derived from our approach. We provide theoretical analysis of region competition including accuracy of boundary location, criteria for initial conditions, and the relationship to edge detection using filters. It is straightforward to generalize the algorithm to multiband segmentation and we demonstrate it on gray level images, color images and texture images. The novel color model allows us to eliminate intensity gradients and shadows, thereby obtaining segmentation based on the albedos of objects. It also helps detect highlight regions."

The theoretical lower limit for the joint entropy, or uncertainty, of these variables is achieved by an optimal 2D filter family whose spatial weighting functions are generated by exponentiated bivariate second-order polynomials with complex coefficients, the elliptic generalization of the one-dimensional elementary functions proposed in Gabor's famous theory of communication [J. Inst. Electr. Eng. 93, 429 (1946)]. The set includes filters with various orientation bandwidths, spatial-frequency bandwidths, and spatial dimensions, favoring the extraction of various kinds of information from an image. Each such filter occupies an irreducible quantal volume (corresponding to an independent datum) in a four-dimensional information hyperspace whose axes are interpretable as 2D visual space, orientation, and spatial frequency, and thus such a filter set could subserve an optimally efficient sampling of these variables. Evidence is presented that the 2D receptive-field profiles of simple cells in mammalian visual cortex are well described by members of this optimal 2D filter family, and thus such visual neurons could be said to optimize the general uncertainty relations for joint 2D-spatial-2D-spectral information resolution. The variety of their receptive-field dimensions and orientation and spatial-frequency bandwidths, and the correlations among these, reveal several underlying constraints, particularly in width/length aspect ratio and principal axis organization, suggesting a polar division of labor in occupying the quantal volumes of information hyperspace.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

It permits efficient compression of a variety of signals, such as sound and images. The predefined libraries of modulated waveforms include orthogonal wavelet-packets and localized trigonometric functions, and have reasonably well-controlled time-frequency localization properties. The idea is to build out of the library functions an orthonormal basis relative to which the given signal or collection of signals has the lowest information cost. The method relies heavily on the remarkable orthogonality properties of the new libraries: all expansions in a given library conserve energy and are thus comparable. Several cost functionals are useful; one of the most attractive is Shannon entropy, which has a geometric interpretation in this context. >"

Wavelet transforms are also unstable with respect to dilations of the input signal and, in two dimensions, rotations of the input signal. The authors formalize these problems by defining a type of translation invariance called shiftability. In the spatial domain, shiftability corresponds to a lack of aliasing; thus, the conditions under which the property holds are specified by the sampling theorem. Shiftability may also be applied in the context of other domains, particularly orientation and scale. Jointly shiftable transforms that are simultaneously shiftable in more than one domain are explored. Two examples of jointly shiftable transforms are designed and implemented: a 1-D transform that is jointly shiftable in position and scale, and a 2-D transform that is jointly shiftable in position and orientation. The usefulness of these image representations for scale-space analysis, stereo disparity measurement, and image enhancement is demonstrated. >"

Finding a Minimum Entropy Code is a possible method of forming such a representation, and methods for doing this are explored in this paper. The main results are (1) to show how to find such a code when the probabilities of the input states form a geometric progression, as is shown to be nearly true for keyboard characters in normal text; (2) to show how a Minimum Entropy Code can be approximated by repeatedly recoding pairs, triples, etc. of an original 7-bit code for keyboard characters; (3) to prove that in some cases enlarging the capacity of the output channel can lower the entropy."

(i) Is there a periodic anatomical arrangement of cells tuned to different spatial-frequency ranges? We found there is, because the spatial-frequency tuning of cells along tangential probes changed systematically, varying from a low frequency to a middle range to high frequencies and back again repeatedly over distances of about 0.6-0.7 mm. (ii) Are there just two populations of cells, low-frequency and high-frequency units, at a given eccentricity (perhaps corresponding to the magno- and parvocellular geniculate pathways) or is there a continuum of spatial-frequency peaks? We found a continuum of peak tuning. Most cells are tuned to intermediate spatial frequencies and form a unimodal rather than a bimodal distribution of cell peaks. Furthermore, the cells with different peak frequencies were found to be continuously and smoothly distributed across a module. (iii) What is the relation between the physiological spatial-frequency organization and the regions of high CytOx concentration (\"blobs\")? We found a systematic correlation between the topographical variation in spatial-frequency tuning and the modular CytOx pattern, which also varied continuously in density. Low-frequency cells are at the center of the blobs, and cells tuned to increasingly higher spatial frequencies are at increasing radial distances."

Our samplers mix rapidly enough to be usable for problems in which other methods would require eons of computing time. They simulate realizations from a sequence of distributions, allowing the distribution being simulated to vary randomly over time. If the sequence of distributions is well chosen, then the sampler will mix well and produce accurate answers for all the distributions. Even when there is only one distribution of interest, these annealing-like samplers may be the only known way to get a rapidly mixing sampler. These methods are essential for attacking very hard problems, which arise in areas such as statistical genetics. We illustrate the methods wi..."

A preliminary discussion is given of the second law of thermodynamics and of a certain class of irreversible processes, in an approximation equivalent to that of the semiclassical theory of radiation."
