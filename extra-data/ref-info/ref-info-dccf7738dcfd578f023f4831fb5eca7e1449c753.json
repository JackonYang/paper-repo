To avoid the expense and limitations of text, there is considerable interest in navigation by perceptual and other automatically extractable attributes. Unfortunately, the relevance of an attribute for a query is not always obvious. Queries which go beyond explicit color, shape, and positional cues must incorporate multiple features in complex ways. This dissertation uses machine learning to automatically select and combine features to satisfy a query, based on positive and negative examples from the user. The learning algorithm does not just learn during the course of one session: it learns continuously, across sessions. The learner improves its learning ability by dynamically modifying its inductive bias, based on experience over multiple sessions. Experiments demonstrate the ability to assist image classiication, segmentation, and annotation (labeling of image regions). The common theme of this work, applied to computer vision, database retrieval, and machine learning, is building in enough exibility to allow adaptation to changing goals."

In applications such as database retrieval, it is important that image features used in pattern comparison provide good measures of image perceptual similarities. We present an image model with a new set of features that address the challenge of perceptual similarity. The model is based on the 2D Wold decomposition of homogeneous random fields. The three resulting mutually orthogonal subfields have perceptual properties which can be described as \"periodicity,\" \"directionality,\" and \"randomness,\" approximating what are indicated to be the three most important dimensions of human texture perception. The method presented improves upon earlier Wold-based models in its tolerance to a variety of local inhomogeneities which arise in natural textures and its invariance under image transformation such as rotation. An image retrieval algorithm based on the new texture model is presented. Different types of image features are aggregated for similarity comparison by using a Bayesian probabilistic approach. The, effectiveness of the Wold model at retrieving perceptually similar natural textures is demonstrated in comparison to that of two other well-known pattern recognition methods. The Wold model appears to offer a perceptually more satisfying measure of pattern similarity while exceeding the performance of these other methods by traditional pattern recognition criteria. Examples of natural scene Wold texture modeling are also presented."

Rather than using an edge-based approach to represent the segmentation of a scene, we propose a multilayer estimation framework which uses support maps to represent the segmentation of the image into homogeneous chunks. This support-based approach can represent objects that are split into disjoint regions, or have surfaces that are transparently interleaved. Our framework is based on an extension of robust estimation methods that provide a theoretical basis for support-based estimation. We use a selection criteria derived from the minimum description length principle to decide how many support maps to use in describing an image. Our method has been applied to a number of different domains, including the decomposition of range images into constituent objects, the segmentation of image sequences into homogeneous higher-order motion fields, and the separation of tracked motion features into distinct rigid-body motions. >"

We have been exploring perceptually supported sketch editors in which computer vision algorithms run continuously, behind the scenes, to afford users efficient access to emergent visual objects in a drawing. We employ a flexible image interpretation architecture based on token grouping in a multiscale blackboard data structure.

Examples of the content we use include color, texture, and shape of image objects and regions. Potential applications include medical (`Give me other images that contain a tumor with a texture like this one'), photo-journalism (`Give me images that have blue at the top and red at the bottom'), and many others in art, fashion, cataloging, retailing, and industry. Key issues include derivation and computation of attributes of images and objects that provide useful query functionality, retrieval methods based on similarity as opposed to exact match, query by image example or user drawn image, the user interfaces, query refinement and navigation, high dimensional database indexing, and automatic and semi-automatic database population. We currently have a prototype system written in X/Motif and C running on an RS/6000 that allows a variety of queries, and a test database of over 1000 images and 1000 objects populated from commercially available photo clip art images. In this paper we present the main algorithms for color texture, shape and sketch query that we use, show example query results, and discuss future directions."

To achieve content-based image indexing and retrieval, there are active research efforts in developing techniques to utilize visual features. On the other hand, without an effective indexing scheme, any visual content based image retrieval approach will lose its effectiveness as the number of features increases. This paper presents our initial work in developing an efficient indexing scheme using artificial neural network, which focuses on eliminating unlikely candidates rather than pin-pointing the targets directly.

In addition, an algorithm is developed for determining the number of statistically distinct regions in an image and estimating the parameters of those regions. Both algorithms use a causal Gaussian autoregressive model to describe the mean, variance, and spatial correlation of the image textures. Together, the algorithms can be used to perform unsupervised texture segmentation. The multiple resolution segmentation algorithm first segments images at coarse resolution and then progresses to finer resolutions until individual pixels are classified. This method results in accurate segmentations and requires significantly less computation than some previously known methods. The field containing the classification of each pixel in the image is modeled as a Markov random field. Segmentation at each resolution is then performed by maximizing the a posteriori probability of this field subject to the resolution constraint. At each resolution, the a posteriori probability is maximized by a deterministic greedy algorithm which iteratively chooses the classification of individual pixels or pixel blocks. The unsupervised parameter estimation algorithm determines both the number of textures and their parameters by minimizing a global criterion based on the AIC information criterion. Clusters corresponding to the individual textures are formed by alternately estimating the cluster parameters and repartitioning the data into those clusters. Concurrently, the number of distinct textures is estimated by combining clusters until a minimum of the criterion is reached. >"

                "text": "The digital representation of an image requires a very large number of bits. The goal of image coding is to reduce this number, as much as possible, and reconstruct a faithful duplicate of the original picture. Early efforts in image coding, solely guided by information theory, led to a plethora of methods. The compression ratio, starting at 1 with the first digital picture in the early 1960s, reached a saturation level around 10:1 a couple of years ago. This certainly does not mean that the upper bound given by the entropy of the source has also been reached. First, this entropy is not known and depends heavily on the model used for the source, i.e., the digital image. Second, the information theory does not take into account what the human eye sees and how it sees. Recent progress in the study of the brain mechanism of vision has opened new vistas in picture coding. Directional sensitivity of the neurones in the visual pathway combined with the separate processing of contours and textures has led to a new class of coding methods capable of achieving compression ratios as high as 70:1. Image quality, of course, remains as an important problem to be investigated. This class of methods, that we call second generation, is the subject of this paper. Two groups can be formed in this class: methods using local operators and combining their output in a suitable way and methods using contour-texture descriptions. Four methods, two in each class, are described in detail. They are applied to the same set of original pictures to allow a fair comparison of the quality in the decoded pictures. If more effort is devoted to this subject, a compression ratio of 100:1 is within reach."

We show that existing techniques in early vision such as, snake/balloon models, region growing, and Bayes/MDL are addressing different aspects of the same problem and they can be unified within a common statistical framework which combines their advantages. We analyze how to optimize the precision of the resulting boundary location by studying the statistical properties of the region competition algorithm and discuss what are good initial conditions for the algorithm. Our method is generalized to color and texture segmentation and is demonstrated on grey level images, color images and texture images.<<ETX>>"

The images are analyzed in a luminance-chrominance color space in order to reduce the influence of the scene illumination on the segmentation. The distribution of the chrominance components of the pixels belonging to each object class is modeled as a Gaussian PDF, allowing an image-adaptive setting of the object-class thresholds."

A hierarchical nonstationary-mean nonstationary-variance (NMNV) image model is proposed for the modeling of nonstationary and noisy images. This model seems to be advantageous as compared to a regular NMNV model because it statistically incorporates the correlation between pixels around the boundary of two adjacent regions. The hierarchical NMNV model leads to the development of an optimal algorithm that allows the simultaneous segmentation and model estimation of measured images. Although no theoretical result is available for the consistency of the estimated model parameters, the method seems to work sufficiently well for the examples considered. >"

The variety of homogeneous and nonhomogeneous images studied is thus nearly an order of magnitude larger than has been compared before, giving one snapshot of the state of the art in real-time texture recognition.<<ETX>>"
