The weakest link is its handling of characters which are difficult to segment. The engine is divided into four phases: segmentation, image recognition, ambiguity resolution, and document analysis. The features are zonal and reduce the image to a blurred, gray-level representation. The classifier is data-driven, trained offline, and model-free. Handcrafted features and decision trees tend to be brittle in the presence of noise. To satisfy the needs of full-text applications, the system captures the structure of the document so that, when viewed in a word processor or spreadsheet program, the formatting of the optically recognized document reflects that of the original document. To satisfy the needs of the forms market, a proofing and correction tool displays 'pop-up' images of uncertain characters. >"

Establishing the essential properties of such models, such as completeness (expressive power) and calibration (closeness of fit to actual image populations) remain open research problems. Work-in-progress towards a parameterized model of local imaging defects is described, together with a variety of motivating theoretical arguments and empirical evidence. A pseudo-random image generator implementing the model has been built. Applications of the generator are described, including a polyfont classifier for ASCII and a single-font classifier for a large alphabet (Tibetan U-Chen), both of which which were constructed with a minimum of manual effort. Image defect models and their associated generators permit a new kind of image database which is explicitly parameterized and indefinitely extensible, alleviating some drawbacks of existing databases."
