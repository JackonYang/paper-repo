In this work we propose to incorporate semantic object context as a post-processing step into any off-the-shelf object categorization model. Using a conditional random field (CRF) framework, our approach maximizes object label agreement according to contextual relevance. We compare two sources of context: one learned from training data and another queried from Google Sets. The overall performance of the proposed framework is evaluated on the PASCAL and MSRC datasets. Our findings conclude that incorporating context into object categorization greatly improves categorization accuracy."

Given a set of images and their associated text (e.g. keywords, captions, descriptions), the objective is to segment an image, in either a crude or sophisticated fashion, then to find the proper associations between words and regions. Previous models are limited by the scope of the representation. In particular, they fail to exploit spatial context in the images and words. We develop a more expressive model that takes this into account. We formulate a spatially consistent probabilistic mapping between continuous image feature vectors and the supplied word tokens. By learning both word-to-region associations and object relations, the proposed model augments scene segmentations due to smoothing implicit in spatial consistency. Context introduces cycles to the undirected graph, so we cannot rely on a straightforward implementation of the EM algorithm for estimating the model parameters and densities of the unknown alignment variables. Instead, we develop an approximate EM algorithm that uses loopy belief propagation in the inference step and iterative scaling on the pseudo-likelihood approximation in the parameter update step. The experiments indicate that our approximate inference and learning algorithm converges to good local solutions. Experiments on a diverse array of images show that spatial context considerably improves the accuracy of object recognition. Most significantly, spatial context combined with a nonlinear discrete object representation allows our models to cope well with over-segmented scenes."

Each layer is modeled as a conditional field that allows one to capture arbitrary observation-dependent label interactions. The proposed framework has two main advantages. First, it encodes both the short-range interactions (e.g., pixelwise label smoothing) as well as the long-range interactions (e.g., relative configurations of objects or regions) in a tractable manner. Second, the formulation is general enough to be applied to different domains ranging from pixelwise image labeling to contextual object detection. The parameters of the model are learned using a sequential maximum-likelihood approximation. The benefits of the proposed framework are demonstrated on four different datasets and comparison results are presented"

The context-feature is simple to implement, feed-forward, and effective across multiple object types in a street-scenes environment.Using context alone, we demonstrate robust detection of locations likely to contain bicycles, cars, and pedestrians. Furthermore, experiments are conducted so as to address several open questions regarding visual context. Specifically, it is demonstrated that context may be determined from low level visual features (simple color and texture descriptors) sampled over a wide receptive field. At least for the framework tested, high level semantic knowledge, e.g, the nature of the surrounding objects, is superfluous. Finally, it is shown that when the target object is unambiguously visible, context is only marginally useful."

We present a context-based vision system for place and object recognition. The goal is to identify familiar locations (e.g., office 610, conference room 941, main street), to categorize new environments (office, corridor, street) and to use that information to provide contextual priors for object recognition (e.g., tables are more likely in an office than a street). We present a low-dimensional global image representation that provides relevant information for place recognition and categorization, and show how such contextual information introduces strong priors that simplify object recognition. We have trained the system to recognize over 60 locations (indoors and outdoors) and to suggest the presence and locations of more than 20 different object types. The algorithm has been integrated into a mobile system that provides realtime feedback to the user."

Material detection refers to the problem of identifying key semantic material types (such as sky, grass, foliage, water, and snow in images). In this paper, we present a holistic approach to determining scene content, based on a set of individual material detection algorithms, as well as probabilistic spatial context models. A major limitation of individual material detectors is the significant number of misclassifications that occur because of the similarities in color and texture characteristics of various material types. We have developed a spatial context-aware material detection system that reduces misclassification by constraining the beliefs to conform to the probabilistic spatial context models. Experimental results show that the accuracy of materials detection is improved by 13% using the spatial context models over the individual material detectors themselves."

Objects are modeled as flexible constellations of parts. A probabilistic representation is used for all aspects of the object: shape, appearance, occlusion and relative scale. An entropy-based feature detector is used to select regions and their scale within the image. In learning the parameters of the scale-invariant object model are estimated. This is done using expectation-maximization in a maximum-likelihood setting. In recognition, this model is used in a Bayesian manner to classify images. The flexible nature of the model is demonstrated by excellent results over a range of datasets including geometrically constrained classes (e.g. faces, cars) and flexible objects (such as animals)."

This technique works by partitioning the image into increasingly fine sub-regions and computing histograms of local features found inside each sub-region. The resulting \"spatial pyramid\" is a simple and computationally efficient extension of an orderless bag-of-features image representation, and it shows significantly improved performance on challenging scene categorization tasks. Specifically, our proposed method exceeds the state of the art on the Caltech-101 database and achieves high accuracy on a large database of fifteen natural scene categories. The spatial pyramid framework also offers insights into the success of several recently proposed image descriptions, including Torralba\u2019s \"gist\" and Lowe\u2019s SIFT descriptors."

Most solutions proposed so far such as those based on color histograms and local texture statistics cannot capture a scene's global configuration, which is critical in perceptual judgments of scene similarity. We present a novel approach, \"configural recognition\", for encoding scene class structure. The approach's main feature is its use of qualitative spatial and photometric relationships within and across regions in low resolution images. The emphasis on qualitative measures leads to enhanced generalization abilities and the use of low-resolution images renders the scheme computationally efficient. We present results on a large database of natural scenes. We also describe how qualitative scene concepts may be learned from examples."

Some focus on the image-label mapping, while others focus solely on patterns within the label field. Components also differ in their scale, as some focus on fine-resolution patterns while others on coarser, more global structure. A supervised version of the contrastive divergence algorithm is applied to learn these features from labeled image data. We demonstrate performance on two real-world image databases and compare it to a classifier and a Markov random field."

But while much success has been reported in detecting several rectangular-shaped object classes (i.e. faces, cars, pedestrians), results have been much less impressive for more general types of objects. Several researchers have advocated the use of image segmentation as a way to get a better spatial support for objects. In this paper, our aim is to address this issue by studying the following two questions: 1) how important is good spatial support for recognition? 2) can segmentation provide better spatial support for objects? To answer the first, we compare recognition performance using ground-truth segmentation vs. bounding boxes. To answer the second, we use the multiple segmentation approach to evaluate how close can real segments approach the ground-truth for real objects, and at what cost. Our results demonstrate the importance of finding the right spatial support for objects, and the feasibility of doing so without excessive computational burden."

For accurate labeling it is important to capture the global context of the image as well as local information. We introduce a CRF based scene labeling model that incorporates both local features and features aggregated over the whole image or large sections of it. Secondly, traditional CRF learning requires fully labeled datasets which can be costly and troublesome to produce. We introduce a method for learning CRFs from datasets with many unlabeled nodes by marginalizing out the unknown labels so that the log-likelihood of the known ones can be maximized by gradient ascent. Loopy Belief Propagation is used to approximate the marginals needed for the gradient and log-likelihood calculations and the Bethe free-energy approximation to the log-likelihood is monitored to control the step size. Our experimental results show that effective models can be learned from fragmentary labelings and that incorporating top-down aggregate features significantly improves the segmentations. The resulting segmentations are compared to the state-of-the-art on three different image datasets."

They evolved from texton methods in texture analysis. The basic idea is to treat images as loose collections of independent patches, sampling a representative set of patches from the image, evaluating a visual descriptor vector for each patch independently, and using the resulting distribution of samples in descriptor space as a characterization of the image. The four main implementation choices are thus how to sample patches, how to describe them, how to characterize the resulting distributions and how to classify images based on the result. We concentrate on the first issue, showing experimentally that for a representative selection of commonly used test databases and for moderate to large numbers of samples, random sampling gives equal or better classifiers than the sophisticated multiscale interest operators that are in common use. Although interest operators work well for small numbers of samples, the single most important factor governing performance is the number of patches sampled from the test image and ultimately interest operators can not provide enough patches to compete. We also study the influence of other factors including codebook size and creation method, histogram normalization method and minimum scale for feature extraction."

Here, the role of individual objects in the recognition of complete figures and the influence of contextual information on the identification of ambiguous objects were investigated. Configurations of objects that were placed in either proper or improper spatial relations were used, and response times and error rates in a recognition task were measured. Two main results were obtained. First, proper spatial relations among the objects of a scene decrease response times and error rates in the recognition of individual objects. Second, the presence of objects that have a unique interpretation improves the identification of ambigous objects in the scene. Ambiguous objects were recognized faster and with fewer errors in the presence of clearly recognized objects compared with the same objects in isolation or in improper spatial relations. The implications of these findings for the organization of recognition memory are discussed."

The key idea is to use a whole ensemble of segmentations per image, computed on different random samples of image sites. Along the boundaries of those segmentations that are stable under the sampling process we extract strings of vectors that contain local image descriptors like shape, texture and intensities. Pairs of such strings are aligned, and based on the alignment scores a mixture model is trained which divides the segments in an image into fore- and background. Given such candidate foreground segments, we show that it is possible to build a state-of-the-art object recognition system that exhibits excellent performance on a standard benchmark database. This result shows that despite the inherent problems of low-level image segmentation in poor data conditions, segmentation can indeed be a valuable tool for object recognition in real-world images."

In fact, the structure of many real-world scenes is governed by strong configurational rules akin to those that apply to a single object. Here we introduce a simple framework for modeling the relationship between context and object properties based on the correlation between the statistics of low-level features across the entire scene and the objects that it contains. The resulting scheme serves as an effective procedure for object priming, context driven focus of attention and automatic scale-selection on real-world scenes."

The usefulness of recognition for segmentation has been demonstrated with various top-down segmentation algorithms, however, the impact of bottom-up image segmentation as pre-processing for object recognition is not well understood. One factor impeding the utility of segmentation for recognition is the unsatisfactory quality of image segmentation algorithms. In this work we take advantage of a recently proposed method for computing multiple stable segmentations and illustrate the application of bottom-up image segmentation as a preprocessing step for object recognition and categorization. We extend a popular bag-of-features recognition model to provide multiple class categorization and localization of objects in images. We compare our categorization results to that of a conventional bag-of-features recognition model on the Caltech and PASCAL image databases."

                "text": "When using a mobile camera to search for a target object, it is often important to maximize the efficiency of the search. We consider a method for increasing efficiency by searching only those subregions that are especially likely to contain the object. These subregions are identified via spatial relationships. Searches that use this method repeatedly find an \u201cintermediate\u201d object that commonly participates in a spatial relationship with the target object, and then look for the target in the restricted region specified by this relationship. Intuitively, such searches, calledindirect searches, seem likely to provide efficiency increases when the intermediate objects can be recognized at low resolutions and hence can be found with little extra overhead, and when they significantly restrict the area that must be searched for the target. But what is the magnitude of this increase, and upon what other factors does efficiency depend? Although the idea of exploiting spatial relationships has been used in vision systems before, few have quantitatively examined these questions.We present a mathematical model of search efficiency that identifies the factors affecting efficiency and can be used to predict their effects. The model predicts that, in typical situations, indirect search provides up to an 8-fold increase in efficiency. Besides being useful as an analysis tool, the model is also suitable for use in an online system for selecting intermediate objects."

The efficiency and quality is exhibited in a live demonstration that recognizes CD-covers from a database of 40000 images of popular music CD\u2019s. The scheme builds upon popular techniques of indexing descriptors extracted from local regions, and is robust to background clutter and occlusion. The local region descriptors are hierarchically quantized in a vocabulary tree. The vocabulary tree allows a larger and more discriminatory vocabulary to be used efficiently, which we show experimentally leads to a dramatic improvement in retrieval quality. The most significant property of the scheme is that the tree directly defines the quantization. The quantization and the indexing are therefore fully integrated, essentially being one and the same. The recognition quality is evaluated through retrieval on a database with ground truth, showing the power of the vocabulary tree approach, going as high as 1 million images."

                "text": "dents. The first six chapters, the sixth added since the first edition, cover mixing processes, density and regression estimation for discrete time processes, density and regression estimation for continuous time processes, and the local time density estimator. The final chapter, also added since the first edition and the only one not devoted to theoretical results, reviews some aspects of implementation and gives examples. The book opens with a synopsis that defines the object of the study as being the construction of time series alternatives to the usual BoxJenkins SARIMA processes. Following that, it proceeds to highlight and summarize the main ideas of the book, beginning with definitions of kernel density and regression estimators and concluding with a brief list of some advantages of nonparametric over parametric time series methods. Specific advantages listed are that they are robust, that deseasonalization is not necessary, and that parametric convergence rates can, under some circumstances, be achieved. Having provided that overview, the book then proceeds in Chapter 1 to lay the theoretical groundwork for the analysis of a wide class of time series by a review of historical results for mixing processes. Results given include Berbee\u2019s and Bradley\u2019s lemmas for coupling, some results for covariances and joint densities including Rio\u2019s, Davydov\u2019s, and Billingsley\u2019s inequalities, some inequalities for partial sums including Hoeffding\u2019s and Bernstein\u2019s, and some limit theorems (laws of large numbers and central limit theorem) for strongly mixing processes. Chapters 2 and 3 cover the analysis of discrete time processes, Chapter 2 focusing on density estimation for sequences of correlated random variables and Chapter 3 on regression estimation and prediction. Topics include some specific kernels, optimal asymptotic quadratic error, uniform almost sure convergence for some kernels, asymptotic normality, and prediction for some stationary and nonstationary processes. These chapters are mainly review; although several results are from earlier papers by the author, they are not, by and large, new. Chapters 4 and 5 consider estimation for continuous time processes and are mainly new results. Their development is a broad parallel of the \u2019 development of Chapters 2 and 3, with Chapter 4 devoted to density estimation and Chapter 5 covering regression estimation and prediction. Topics and results include optimal and superoptimal asymptotic quadratic error including a minimax bound of Kutoyants (1997) and minimaxity of intermediate rates, optimal and superoptimal uniform convergence rates, asymptotic normality, irregular and admissible sampling, and the convergence rates of continuous-time nonparametric predictors. Some conditions are given under which a nonparametric predictor reaches a parametric convergence rate. Chapter 6 explores the use of local time for unbiased density estimation given a continuous time sample and consists, apart from one result, of new results. A definition is given of local time, followed by two existence criteria for local time, the first due to Geman and Horowitz (1973, 1980) and the second proven by the author. A density estimator based on local time is then defined and shown to be unbiased and consistent. Some results on convergence rates are then given, followed by asymptotic normality, a functional law of the iterated logarithm, and parametric rates for pointwise and uniform convergence. Chapter 7 is a brief summary of some practical aspects of nonparametric time series analysis. These fall into three areas-aspects of implementation. the comparison of nonparametric with parametric methods, and applied examples. The aspects of implementation addressed are variance stabilization via BoxCox transformation, methods for eliminating trend and seasonality, methods for choosing kernel bandwidth, and choosing a suitable order for predicting a Markov process in which the true order of the process is unknown. In comparing nonparametric and parametric methods of time series analysis, the book summarizes the results of Carbon and Delecroix (1993). who considered several simulated autoregressive moving average (ARMA) processes and some real business and engineering datasets, and the results of Rosa (1993), who considered ARMA models with and without generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity effects. An appendix gives 17 tables summarizing the results of the comparisons. Finally. some examples are given of applying nonparametric methods to finance and economic data. The value of this book is primarily in its theoretical development and, as such, it would be of more interest to researchers in statistical theory and"

In contrast to most multiscale image processing, this algorithm works on multiple scales of the image in parallel, without iteration, to capture both coarse and fine level details. The algorithm is computationally efficient, allowing to segment large images. We use the normalized cut graph partitioning framework of image segmentation. We construct a graph encoding pairwise pixel affinity, and partition the graph for image segmentation. We demonstrate that large image graphs can be compressed into multiple scales capturing image structure at increasingly large neighborhood. We show that the decomposition of the image segmentation graph into different scales can be determined by ecological statistics on the image grouping cues. Our segmentation algorithm works simultaneously across the graph scales, with an inter-scale constraint to ensure communication and consistency between the segmentations at each scale. As the results show, we incorporate long-range connections with linear-time complexity, providing high-quality segmentations efficiently. Images that previously could not be processed because of their size have been accurately segmented thanks to this method."
