                "text": "Semantic parsing is the construction of a complete, formal, symbolic meaning representation of a sentence. While it is crucial to natural language understanding, the problem of semantic parsing has received relatively little attention from the machine learning community. Recent work on natural language understanding has mainly focused on shallow semantic analysis, such as word-sense disambiguation and semantic role labeling. Semantic parsing, on the other hand, involves deep semantic analysis in which word senses, semantic roles and other components are combined to produce useful meaning representations for a particular application domain (e.g. database query). Prior research in machine learning for semantic parsing is mainly based on inductive logic programming or deterministic parsing, which lack some of the robustness that characterizes statistical learning. Existing statistical approaches to semantic parsing, however, are mostly concerned with relatively simple application domains in which a meaning representation is no more than a single semantic frame. In this proposal, we present a novel statistical approach to semantic parsing, WASP, which can handle meaning representations with a nested structure. The WASP algorithm learns a semantic parser given a set of sentences annotated with their correct meaning representations. The parsing model is based on the synchronous context-free grammar, where each rule maps a natural-language substring to its meaning representation. The main innovation of the algorithm is its use of state-of-the-art statistical machine translation techniques. A statistical word alignment model is used for lexical acquisition, and the parsing model itself can be seen as an instance of a syntax-based translation model. In initial evaluation on several real-world data sets, we show that WASP performs favorably in terms of both accuracy and coverage compared to existing learning methods requiring similar amount of supervision, and shows better robustness to variations in task complexity and word order. In future work, we intend to pursue several directions in developing accurate semantic parsers for a variety of application domains. This will involve exploiting prior knowledge about the natural-language syntax and the application domain. We also plan to construct a syntax-aware word-based alignment model for lexical acquisition. Finally, we will generalize the learning algorithm to handle contextdependent sentences and accept noisy training data."

A compositional-semantics procedure is then used to map the augmented parse tree into a final meaning representation. We evaluate the system in two domains, a natural-language database interface and an interpreter for coaching instructions in robotic soccer.

We describe a learning algorithm that takes as input a training set of sentences labeled with expressions in the lambda calculus. The algorithm induces a grammar for the problem, along with a log-linear model that represents a distribution over syntactic and semantic analyses conditioned on the input sentence. We apply the method to the task of learning natural language interfaces to databases and show that the learned parsers outperform previous methods in two benchmark database domains."

The approach assumes a formal grammar for the target representation language and learns transformation rules that exploit the non-terminal symbols in this grammar. The learned transformation rules incrementally map a natural-language sentence or its syntactic parse tree into a parse-tree for the target formal language. Experimental results are presented for two corpora. one which maps English instructions into an existing formal coaching language for simulated RoboCup soccer agents, and another which maps English U.S.-geography questions into a database query language. We show that our method performs overall better and faster than previous approaches in both domains."

Experimental comparison to training from a parsebank shows a 10% gain from EM training. Also, a new class-based grammar lexicalization is presented, showing a 10% gain over unlexicalized models."

In addition to an automatic speech recognizer and a dia logue manager, such systems consist of a natural language un derstanding (NLU) component. Some of the most investigated approaches to NLU are rule-based methods as Stochastic Grammars, which are often written manually. However, the sole usage of rule-based methods can turn out to be inflexible and the problem of reusability occurs. When extending the applicat ion scenario or changing the application\u2019s domain itself, a lar ge part of the set of rules often must be rewritten. Therefore, techn iques are desirable which help to reduce the manual effort when bui lding up an NLU component for a new domain. In this paper we investigate an approach to NLU, which is derived from the field of statistical machine translation. S tarting from a conceptual annotated corpus, we describe the problem of NLU as a translation from a source sentence to a formallanguage target sentence. Doing this, we will mainly focus o n the quality of different alignment models between source an d target sentences. Even though the usage of grammars cannot b e totally avoided in NLU-systems, it is our goal to reduce thei r employment and learn the dependencies between words and their meaning automatically. Experiments were performed o n the Philips in-house TABA corpus, which is a text corpus in th e domain of a German train timetable information system."

CHILL treats parser acquisition as the learning of search-control rules within a logic program representing a shift-reduce parser and uses techniques from Inductive Logic Programming to learn relational control knowledge. Starting with a general framework for constructing a suitable logical form, CHILL is able to train on a corpus comprising sentences paired with database queries and induce parsers that map subsequent sentences directly into executable queries. Experimental results with a complete database-query application for U.S. geography show that CHILL is able to learn parsers that outperform a preexisting, hand-crafted counterpart. These results demonstrate the ability of a corpus-based system to produce more than purely syntactic representations. They also provide direct evidence of the utility of an empirical approach at the level of a complete natural language application."

We define a concept of word-by-word alignment between such pairs of sentences. For any given pair of such sentences each of our models assigns a probability to each of the possible word-by-word alignments. We give an algorithm for seeking the most probable of these alignments. Although the algorithm is suboptimal, the alignment thus obtained accounts well for the word-by-word relationships in the pair of sentences. We have a great deal of data in French and English from the proceedings of the Canadian Parliament. Accordingly, we have restricted our work to these two languages; but we feel that because our algorithms have minimal linguistic content they would work well on other pairs of languages. We also feel, again because of the minimal linguistic content of our algorithms, that it is reasonable to argue that word-by-word alignments are inherent in any sufficiently large bilingual corpus."

Probabilities (a) and (b) are computed incrementally in a single left-to-right pass over the input. Our algorithm compares favorably to standard bottom-up parsing methods for SCFGs in that it works efficiently on sparse grammars by making use of Earley's top-down control structure. It can process any context-free rule format without conversion to some normal form, and combines computations for (a) through (d) in a single algorithm. Finally, the algorithm has simple extensions for processing partially bracketed inputs, and for finding partial parses and their likelihoods on ungrammatical inputs."

We consider the five alignment models presented in Brown, Della Pietra, Della Pietra, and Mercer (1993), the hidden Markov alignment model, smoothing techniques, and refinements. These statistical models are compared with two heuristic models based on the Dice coefficient. We present different methods for combining word alignments to perform a symmetrization of directed statistical alignment models. As evaluation criterion, we use the quality of the resulting Viterbi alignment compared to a manually produced reference alignment. We evaluate the models on the German-English Verbmobil task and the French-English Hansards task. We perform a detailed analysis of various design decisions of our statistical alignment system and evaluate these on training corpora of various sizes. An important result is that refined alignment models with a first-order dependence and a fertility model yield significantly better results than simple heuristic models. In the Appendix, we present an efficient training algorithm for the alignment models presented."

                "text": "From volume 1 Preface (See Front Matter for full Preface) \n \nThis book is intended for a one or two semester course in compiling theory at the senior or graduate level. It is a theoretically oriented treatment of a practical subject. Our motivation for making it so is threefold. \n \n(1) In an area as rapidly changing as Computer Science, sound pedagogy demands that courses emphasize ideas, rather than implementation details. It is our hope that the algorithms and concepts presented in this book will survive the next generation of computers and programming languages, and that at least some of them will be applicable to fields other than compiler writing. \n \n(2) Compiler writing has progressed to the point where many portions of a compiler can be isolated and subjected to design optimization. It is important that appropriate mathematical tools be available to the person attempting this optimization. \n \n(3) Some of the most useful and most efficient compiler algorithms, e.g. LR(k) parsing, require a good deal of mathematical background for full understanding. We expect, therefore, that a good theoretical background will become essential for the compiler designer. \n \nWhile we have not omitted difficult theorems that are relevant to compiling, we have tried to make the book as readable as possible. Numerous examples are given, each based on a small grammar, rather than on the large grammars encountered in practice. It is hoped that these examples are sufficient to illustrate the basic ideas, even in cases where the theoretical developments are difficult to follow in isolation. \n \nFrom volume 2 Preface (See Front Matter for full Preface) \n \nCompiler design is one of the first major areas of systems programming for which a strong theoretical foundation is becoming available. Volume I of The Theory of Parsing, Translation, and Compiling developed the relevant parts of mathematics and language theory for this foundation and developed the principal methods of fast syntactic analysis. Volume II is a continuation of Volume I, but except for Chapters 7 and 8 it is oriented towards the nonsyntactic aspects of compiler design. \n \nThe treatment of the material in Volume II is much the same as in Volume I, although proofs have become a little more sketchy. We have tried to make the discussion as readable as possible by providing numerous examples, each illustrating one or two concepts. \n \nSince the text emphasizes concepts rather than language or machine details, a programming laboratory should accompany a course based on this book, so that a student can develop some facility in applying the concepts discussed to practical problems. The programming exercises appearing at the ends of sections can be used as recommended projects in such a laboratory. Part of the laboratory course should discuss the code to be generated for such programming language constructs as recursion, parameter passing, subroutine linkages, array references, loops, and so forth."

Some advantages and disadvantages of NLIDBS are then discussed, comparing NLIDBS to formal query languages, form-based interfaces, and graphical interfaces. An introduction to some of the linguistic problems NLIDBS have to confront follows, for the benefit of readers less familiar with computational linguistics. The discussion then moves on to NLIDB architectures, portability issues, restricted natural language input systems (including menu-based NLIDBS), and NLIDBS with reasoning capabilities. Some less explored areas of NLIDB research are then presented, namely database updates, meta-knowledge questions, temporal questions, and multi-modal NLIDBS.

A probabilistic event is represented by a feature forest, which is a packed representation of features with ambiguities. The parameters are efficiently estimated by traversing each node in a feature forest by dynamic programming. Experiments showed the algorithm worked efficiently even when ambiguities in a feature forest cause an exponential explosion of unpacked structures."

Several smoothing methods for maximum entropy models have been proposed to address this problem, but previous results do not make it clear how these smoothing methods compare with smoothing methods for other types of related models. In this work, we survey previous work in maximum entropy smoothing and compare the performance of several of these algorithms with conventional techniques for smoothing n-gram language models. Because of the mature body of research in n-gram model smoothing and the close connection between maximum entropy and conventional n-gram models, this domain is well-suited to gauge the performance of maximum entropy smoothing methods. Over a large number of data sets, we find that an ME smoothing method proposed to us by Lafferty performs as well as or better than all other algorithms under consideration. This general and efficient method involves using a Gaussian prior on the parameters of the model and selecting maximum a posteriori instead of maximum likelihood parameter values. We contrast this method with previous n-gram smoothing methods to explain its superior performance."

We give an update formula which generates matrices using information from the last m iterations, where m is any number supplied by the user. The quasi-Newton matrix is updated at every iteration by dropping the oldest information and replacing it by the newest informa- tion. It is shown that the matrices generated have some desirable properties. The resulting algorithms are tested numerically and compared with several well- known methods. 1. Introduction. For the problem of minimizing an unconstrained function / of n variables, quasi-Newton methods are widely employed (4). They construct a se- quence of matrices which in some way approximate the hessian of /(or its inverse). These matrices are symmetric; therefore, it is necessary to have n(n + l)/2 storage locations for each one. For large dimensional problems it will not be possible to re- tain the matrices in the high speed storage of a computer, and one has to resort to other kinds of algorithms. For example, one could use the methods (Toint (15), Shanno (12)) which preserve the sparsity structure of the hessian, or conjugate gradient methods (CG) which only have to store 3 or 4 vectors. Recently, some CG algorithms have been developed which use a variable amount of storage and which do not require knowledge about the sparsity structure of the problem (2), (7), (8). A disadvantage of these methods is that after a certain number of iterations the quasi-Newton matrix is discarded, and the algorithm is restarted using an initial matrix (usually a diagonal matrix). We describe an algorithm which uses a limited amount of storage and where the quasi-Newton matrix is updated continuously. At every step the oldest information contained in the matrix is discarded and replaced by new one. In this way we hope to have a more up to date model of our function. We will concentrate on the BFGS method since it is considered to be the most efficient. We believe that similar algo- rithms cannot be developed for the other members of the Broyden 0-class (1). Let / be the function to be nnnimized, g its gradient and h its hessian. We define"
