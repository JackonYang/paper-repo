The method is based on the availability of pairs of large corresponding texts that are translations of each other. In our case, the texts are in English and French.Fundamental to the technique is a complex glossary of correspondence of fixed locutions. The steps of the proposed translation process are: (1) Partition the source text into a set of fixed locutions. (2) Use the glossary plus contextual information to select the corresponding set of fixed locutions into a sequence forming the target sentence. (3) Arrange the words of the target fixed locutions into a sequence forming the target sentence.We have developed statistical techniques facilitating both the automatic creation of the glossary, and the performance of the three translation steps, all on the basis of an alignment of corresponding sentences in the two texts.While we are not yet able to provide examples of French / English translation, we present some encouraging intermediate results concerning glossary creation and the arrangement of target word sequences."

In addition to certain anchor points that are available in our data, the only information about the sentences that we use for calculating alignments is the number of tokens that they contain. Because we make no use of the lexical details of the sentence, the alignment computation is fast and therefore practical for application to very large collections of text. We have used this technique to align several million sentences in the English-French Hansard corpora and have achieved an accuracy in excess of 99% in a random selected set of 1000 sentence pairs that we checked by hand. We show that even without the benefit of anchor points the correlation between the lengths of aligned sentences is strong enough that we should expect to achieve an accuracy of between 96% and 97%. Thus, the technique may be applicable to a wider variety of texts than we have yet tried."

                "text": "Researchers in both machine translation (e.g., Brown et al. 1990) and bilingual lexicography (e.g., Klavans and Tzoukermann 1990) have recently become interested in studying bilingual corpora, bodies of text such as the Canadian Hansards (parliamentary proceedings), which are available in multiple languages (such as French and English). One useful step is to align the sentences, that is, to identify correspondences between sentences in one language and sentences in the other language.This paper will describe a method and a program (align) for aligning sentences based on a simple statistical model of character lengths. The program uses the fact that longer sentences in one language tend to be translated into longer sentences in the other language, and that shorter sentences tend to be translated into shorter sentences. A probabilistic score is assigned to each proposed correspondence of sentences, based on the scaled difference of lengths of the two sentences (in characters) and the variance of this difference. This probabilistic score is used in a dynamic programming framework to find the maximum likelihood alignment of sentences.It is remarkable that such a simple approach works as well as it does. An evaluation was performed based on a trilingual corpus of economic reports issued by the Union Bank of Switzerland (UBS) in English, French, and German. The method correctly aligned all but 4% of the sentences. Moreover, it is possible to extract a large subcorpus that has a much smaller error rate. By selecting the best-scoring 80% of the alignments, the error rate is reduced from 4% to 0.7%. There were more errors on the English-French subcorpus than on the English-German subcorpus, showing that error rates will depend on the corpus considered; however, both were small enough to hope that the method will be useful for many language pairs.To further research on bilingual corpora, a much larger sample of Canadian Hansards (approximately 90 million words, half in English and and half in French) has been aligned with the align program and will be available through the Data Collection Initiative of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL/DCI). In addition, in order to facilitate replication of the align program, an appendix is provided with detailed c-code of the more difficult core of the align program."

They were unaware of a connection to the EM algorithm, but they did realize that their method is not entirely satisfactory. For example, once it is clearly established that in (La porte est rouge I The door is red), it is red that produces rouge, one is uncomfortable using this sentence as support for red producing porte or door producing rouge. They suggest removing words once a correlation between them has been clearly established and then reprocessing the resulting impoverished translations hoping to recover less obvious correlations now revealed by the departure of their more prominent relatives. From our present perspective, we see that the proper way to proceed is simply to carry out more iterations of the EM algorithm. The likelihood for Model 1 has a unique local maximum for any set of training data. As iterations proceed, the count for porte as a translation of red will dwindle away. In a later paper, Brown et al. (1990) describe a model that is essentially the same as our Model 3. They sketch the EM algorithm and show that, once trained, their model can be used to extract word-by-word alignments for pairs of sentences. They did not realize that the logarithm of the likelihood for Model 1 is concave and, hence, has a unique local maximum. They were also unaware of the trick by which we are able to sum over all alignments when evaluating the counts for Models 1 and 2, and of the trick by which we are able to sum over all alignments when transferring parameters from Model 2 to Model 3. As a result, they were unable to handle large vocabularies and so restricted themselves to vocabularies of only 9,000 words. Nonetheless, they were able to align phrases in French with the English words that produce them as illustrated in their Figure 3. More recently, Gale and Church (1991a) describe an algorithm similar to the one described in Brown et al. (1988). Like Brown et al."

In a later paper, Brown et al. (1990) describe a model that is essentially the same as our Model 3. They sketch the EM algorithm and show that, once trained, their model can be used to extract word-by-word alignments for pairs of sentences. They did not realize that the logarithm of the likelihood for Model 1 is concave and, hence, has a unique local maximum. They were also unaware of the trick by which we are able to sum over all alignments when evaluating the counts for Models 1 and 2, and of the trick by which we are able to sum over all alignments when transferring parameters from Model 2 to Model 3. As a result, they were unable to handle large vocabularies and so restricted themselves to vocabularies of only 9,000 words. Nonetheless, they were able to align phrases in French with the English words that produce them as illustrated in their Figure 3. More recently, Gale and Church (1991a) describe an algorithm similar to the one described in Brown et al."
