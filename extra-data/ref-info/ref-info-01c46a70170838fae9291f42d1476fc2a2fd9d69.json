One of them is intelligent form analysis. This paper describes a generic system for form dropout when the filled-in characters or symbols are either touching or crossing the form frames. We propose a method to separate these characters from form frames whose locations are unknown. Since some of the character strokes are either touching or crossing the form frames, we need to address the following three issues: 1) localization of form frames; 2) separation of characters and form frames; and 3) reconstruction of broken strokes introduced during separation. The form frame is automatically located by finding long straight lines based on the block adjacency graph. Form frame separation and character reconstruction are implemented by means of this graph. The proposed system includes form structure learning and form dropout. First, a form structure-based template is automatically generated from a blank form which includes form frames, preprinted data areas and skew angle. With this form template, our system can then extract both handwritten and machine-typed filled-in data. Experimental results on three different types of forms show the performance of our system. Further, the proposed method is robust to noise and skew that is introduced during scanning."

Most previous methods employ a line oriented approach. Real documents are copied repeatedly and overlaid with printed data, resulting in characters which touch cells and lines which are broken. BDR deals with regions directly, in contrast with other previous methods. Experimental tests show that BDR reliably recognizes cells and strings in document images with touching characters and broken lines."
