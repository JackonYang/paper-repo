                "text": "We present randomized approximation algorithms for the MAX CUT and MAX 2SAT problems that always deliver solutions of expected value at least .87856 times the optimal value. These algorithms use a simple and elegant technique that randomly rounds the solution to a nonlinear programming relaxation. This relaxation can be interpreted both as a semidefinite program and as an eigenvalue minimization problem. We then show how to derandomize the algorithm to obtain approximation algorithms with the same performance guarantee of .87856. The previous best-known approximation algorithms for these problems had performance guarantees of ~ for MAX CUT and ~ for MAX 2SAT. A slight extension of our analysis leads to a .79607-approximation algorithm for the maximum directed cut problem, where a & approximation algorithm was the previous best-known algorithm. Our algorithm gives the first substantial progress in approximating MAX CUT in nearly twenty years, and, to the best of our knowledge, represents the first use of semidefinite programming in the design of approximation algorithms. *Address: Dept. of Mathematics, Room 2-372, M.

His algorithm makes nontrivial use of solutions to maximum flow problems. New, simple $\\frac{3}{4}$-approximation algorithms that apply the probabilistic method/randomized rounding to the solution to a linear programming relaxation of MAX SAT are presented. It is shown that although standard randomized rounding does not give a good approximate result, the best solution of the two given by randomized rounding and a well-known algorithm of Johnson is always within $\\frac{3}{4}$ of the optimal solution. It is further shown that an unusual twist on randomized rounding also yields $\\frac{3}{4}$-approximation algorithms. As a by-product of the analysis, a tight worst-case analysis of the relative duality gap of the linear programming relaxation is obtained."

Goemans and D. Williamson (1994). In this paper, we give techniques to derandomize the above class of randomized algorithms, thus obtaining polynomial time deterministic algorithms with the same approximation ratios for the above problems. Note that Goemans and Williamson also gave an elegant method to derandomize their Max-Cut algorithm. We show here that their technique has a fatal flaw. The techniques we subsequently develop are very different from theirs. At the heart of our technique is the use of spherical symmetry to convert a nested sequence of n integrations, which cannot be approximated sufficiently well in polynomial time, to a nested sequence of just a constant number of integrations, which can be approximated sufficiently well in polynomial time."

We show that the bound behaves in a manner similar to the max-cut for the operations of switching, vertex splitting, contraction and decomposition. It can also be adjusted for branch and bound techniques. We introduce a Gram representation of a weighted graph, in order to construct weighted graphs with pre-given eigenvalue properties. As a corollary, we prove that the decision problem as to whether the upper bound coincides with the actual value of the max-cut is NP-complete. We study the mutual relation between the max-cut and the bound on the line graphs, which allow a good approximation. We show that the ratio between the upper bound and the actual size of the max-cut is close to 9/8 for the studied classes, and for several other graphs."

In this paper, we show that two prover proof systems are also convenient starting points for establishing easiness of approximation results. Our approach combines the Feige-Lovasz (STOC92) semidefinite programming relaxation of one-round two-prover proof systems, together with rounding techniques for the solutions of semidefinite programs, as introduced by Goemans and Williamson (STOC94). As a consequence of our approach, we present improved approximation algorithms for MAX 2SAT and MAX DICUT. The algorithms are guaranteed to deliver solutions within a factor of 0.931 of the optimum for MAX 2SAT and within a factor of 0.859 for MAX DICUT, improving upon the guarantees of 0.878 and 0.796 of Goemans and Williamson (1994).<<ETX>>"

The approach is a direct extension of Ye\u2019s projective method for linear programming. It is also argued that many known interior point methods for linear programs can be transformed in a mechanical way to algorithms for SDP with proofs of convergence and polynomial time complexity carrying over in a similar fashion. Finally, the significance of these results is studied in a variety of combinatorial optimization problems including the general 0-1 integer programs, the maximum clique and maximum stable set problems in perfect graphs, the maximum k-partite subgraph problem in graph..."

We give a randomized polynomial time algorithm which colors a 3-colorable graph on n vertices with min {O(/spl Delta//sup 1/3/log/sup 4/3//spl Delta/), O(n/sup 1/4/ log n)} colors where /spl Delta/ is the maximum degree of any vertex. Besides giving the best known approximation ratio in terms of n, this marks the first non-trivial approximation result as a function of the maximum degree /spl Delta/. This result can be generalized to k-colorable graphs to obtain a coloring using min {O/spl tilde/(/spl Delta//sup 1-2/k/), O/spl tilde/(n/sup 1-3/(k+1/))} colors. Our results are inspired by the recent work of Goemans and Williamson who used an algorithm for semidefinite optimization problems, which generalize linear programs, to obtain improved approximations for the MAX CUT and MAX 2-SAT problems. An intriguing outcome of our work is a duality relationship established between the value of the optimum solution to our semidefinite program and the Lovasz /spl thetav/-function. We show lower bounds on the gap between the optimum solution of our semidefinite program and the actual chromatic number; by duality this also demonstrates interesting new facts about the /spl thetav/-function. >"

In particular we present a proof system for NP using logarithmic randomness and two amortized free bits, so that Max clique is hard within N/sup 1/3/ and chromatic number within N/sup 1/5/. We also show hardness of 38/37 for Max-3-SAT, 27/26 for vertex cover, 82/81 for Max-cut, and 94/93 for Max-2-SAT. The second part of this paper presents a \"reverse\" of the FGLSS connection by showing that an NP-hardness result for the approximation of Max clique to within a factor of N/sup 1/(g+1/) would imply a probabilistic verifier for NP with logarithmic randomness and amortized free-bit complexity g. We also show that \"existing techniques\" won't yield proof systems of less than two bits in amortized free bit complexity. Finally, we initiate a comprehensive study of PCP and FPCP parameters, proving several triviality results and providing several useful transformations."

Given any pointz\u2208\u211dn the oracle returns a \u201cYes\u201d ifz\u2208S; whereas ifz\u2209S then the oracle returns a \u201cNo\u201d together with a hyperplane that separatesz fromS. The feasibility problem is the problem of finding a point inS; the convex optimization problem is the problem of minimizing a convex function overS. We present a new algorithm for the feasibility problem. The notion of a volumetric center of a polytope and a related ellipsoid of maximum volume inscribable in the polytope are central to the algorithm. Our algorithm has a significantly better global convergence rate and time complexity than the ellipsoid algorithm. The algorithm for the feasibility problem easily adapts to the convex optimization problem."

Such a constraint is nonlinear and nonsmooth, but convex, so semidefinite programs are convex optimization problems. Semidefinite programming unifies several standard problems (e.g., linear and quadratic programming) and finds many applications in engineering and combinatorial optimization. Although semidefinite programs are much more general than linear programs, they are not much harder to solve. Most interior-point methods for linear programming have been generalized to semidefinite programs. As in linear programming, these methods have polynomial worst-case complexity and perform very well in practice. This paper gives a survey of the theory and applications of semidefinite programs and an introduction to primaldual interior-point methods for their solution."

We give an 0(V 3) algorithm which for a given graph constructs a bipartite subgraph B with at least f(m, n) edges, yielding a short proof of Edwards\u2019 result.

Furthermore, we show that a number of common optimization problems are complete under a kind of careful transformation (called L-reduction) that preserves approximability. It follows that such a complete problem has a polynomial-time approximation scheme iff the whole class does. These results may help explain the lack of progress on the approximability of a host of optimization problems."

The result has the following consequences: (1) MAXSNP-hard problems (e.g. metric TSP, MAX-SAT, MAX-CUT) do not have polynomial time approximation schemes unless P=NP; and (2) for some epsilon >0 the size of the maximal clique in a graph cannot be approximated within a factor of n/sup epsilon / unless P=NP.<<ETX>>"

In this paper we deal with a special case of the maximum cut problem. By requiring the graph to be planar, it is shown the problem can be translated into a maximum weighted matching problem for which there exists a polynomial bounded algorithm."

These experiences made me aware that seemingly simple discrete optimization problems could hold the seeds of combinatorial explosions. The work of Dantzig, Fulkerson, Hoffman, Edmonds, Lawler and other pioneers on network flows, matching and matroids acquainted me with the elegant and efficient algorithms that were sometimes possible. Jack Edmonds\u2019 papers and a few key discussions with him drew my attention to the crucial distinction between polynomial-time and superpolynomial-time solvability. I was also influenced by Jack\u2019s emphasis on min-max theorems as a tool for fast verification of optimal solutions, which foreshadowed Steve Cook\u2019s definition of the complexity class NP. Another influence was George Dantzig\u2019s suggestion that integer programming could serve as a universal format for combinatorial optimization problems."

Max characterizations for this sum are established, giving a concise characterization of the subdifferential in terms of a dual matrix. This leads to a very useful characterization of the generalized gradient of the following convex composite function: the sum of the largest eigenvalues of a smooth symmetric matrix-valued function of a set of real parameters. The dual matrix provides the information required to either verify first-order optimality conditions at a point or to generate a descent direction for the eigenvalue sum from that point, splitting a multiple eigenvalue if necessary. Connections with the classical literature on sums of eigenvalues and eigenvalue perturbation theory are discussed. Sums of the largest eigenvalues in the absolute value sense are also addressed."

Sci., 35 (1949), pp. 652\u2013655]. A simple proof of this property, which seems to have been overlooked in the vast literature on the subject and its many generalizations, is discussed. The key step is the observation, which is neither new nor well known, that the convex hull of the set of projection matrices of rank k is the set of symmetric matrices with eigenvalues between 0 and 1 and summing to k. The connection with the well-known Birkhoff theorem on doubly stochastic matrices is also discussed. This approach provides a very convenient characterization for the subdifferential of the eigenvalue sum, described in a separate paper."

The former problem comes up in solid-state physics, and the latter in very-large-scale-integrated VLSI circuit design and in printed circuit board design. Both problems can be reduced to the max-cut problem in graphs. Based on a partial characterization of the cut polytope, we design a cutting plane algorithm and report on computational experience with it. Our method has been used to solve max-cut problems on graphs with up to 1,600 nodes."

In this note, elementary techniques are used to obtain a characterization of extreme correlation matrices and a canonical form for correlation matrices.

Fuel pins forming a hexagonal array are spaced apart from each other and held-down at their lower end, securely attached at two places along their length to one of a plurality of vertically disposed parallel plates arranged in horizontally spaced rows. These plates are in turn spaced apart from each other and held together by a combination of spacing and fastening means. The arrangement of this invention provides a strong vibration free hold-down mechanism while avoiding a large pressure drop to the flow of coolant fluid. This apparatus is particularly useful in connection with liquid cooled reactors such as liquid metal cooled fast breeder reactors."

A somewhat simpler ~-approximation algorithm was given in Goemans and Williamson [1994b]. The imprcwed 2SAT algorithm leads to .7584 -approximation algorithm for the overall MAX SAT problem, fractionally better than Yannakakis\u2019 ~-approximation algorithm for MAX SAT. Finally, a slight extension of our analysis yields a ( p \u2013 ~)-approximation algorithm for the maximum directed cut problem (MAX DICUT), where 2 2r\u20133e p= min >0.79607. OSO<arccos(\u20131/3) ~ 1 + 3cos O The best previously known algorithm for MAX DICUT has a performance guarantee of ~ [Papadimitriou and Yannakakis 1991]. Our algorithm depends on a means of randomly rounding a solution to a nonlinear relaxation of the MAX CUT problem. This relaxation can either be seen as a semidejinite program or as an eigenvalue minimization problem. To our knowledge, this is the first time that semidefinite programs have been used in the design and analysis of approximation algorithms. The relaxation plays a crucial role in allowing us to obtain a better performance guarantee: previous approximation algorithms compared the value of the solution obtained to the total sum of the weights xi< j Wij. This sum can be arbitrarily close to twice the value of the maximum cut. A semidefinite program is the problem of optimizing a linear function of a symmetric matrix subject to linear equality constraints and the constraint that the matrix be positive semidefinite. Semidefinite programming is a special case of convex programming and also of the so-called linear programming over cones or cone-LP since the set of positive semidefinite matrices constitutes a convex cone. To some extent, semidefinite programming is very similar to lineiir programming; see Alizadeh [1995] for a comparison. It inherits the very elegant duality theory of cone-LP (see Wolkowicz [1981] and the exposition by Alizadeh [1995]). The simplex method can be generalized to sernidefinite programs (Pataki [1995]). Given any e >0, semidefinite programs can be solved within an additive error of \u25cf in polynomial time (c is part of the input, so the running time dependence on ~ is polynomial in log 1/~). This can be done through the ellipsoid algorithm (Grotschel et al. [1988]) and other polynomiaJtime algorithms for convex programming (Vaidya [1989]), as well as interiorpoint methods (Nesterov and Nemirovskii [1989; 1994] and Alizadeh [1995])."

Semidefinite programming has many interesting applications in a variety of areas including control theory, nonlinear programming, geomet~, and combinatorial optimization. 1 In combinatorial optimization, the importance of semidefinite programming is that it leads to tighter relaxations than the classical linear programming relaxations for many graph and combinatorial problems. A beautiful application of semidefinite programming is the work of Low%z [1979] on the Shannon capacity of a graph. In conjunction with the polynomial-time solvability of semidefinite programs, this leads to the only known polynomial-time algorithm for finding the largest stable set in a perfect graph (Grotschel et al. [1981]). More recently, there has been increased interest in semidefinite programming from a combinatorial point-of-view.z This started with the work of LOV5SZ and Schrijver [1989; 1990], who developed a machinery to define tighter and tighter relaxations of any integer program based on quadratic and semidefinite programming. Their papers demonstrated the wide applicability and the power of semidefinite programming for combinatorial optimization problems. Our use of semidefinite programming relaxations was inspired by these papers, and by the paper of Alizadeh [1995]. For MAX CUT, the semidefinite programming relaxation we consider is equivalent to an eigenvalue minimization problem proposed by Delorme and Poljak [1993a; 1993b]."
