This work is distinguished by three key contributions. The first is the introduction of a new image representation called the \"integral image\" which allows the features used by our detector to be computed very quickly. The second is a learning algorithm, based on AdaBoost, which selects a small number of critical visual features from a larger set and yields extremely efficient classifiers. The third contribution is a method for combining increasingly more complex classifiers in a \"cascade\" which allows background regions of the image to be quickly discarded while spending more computation on promising object-like regions. The cascade can be viewed as an object specific focus-of-attention mechanism which unlike previous approaches provides statistical guarantees that discarded regions are unlikely to contain the object of interest. In the domain of face detection the system yields detection rates comparable to the best previous systems. Used in real-time applications, the detector runs at 15 frames per second without resorting to image differencing or skin color detection."

The technique is demonstrated by developing a system that locates people in cluttered scenes. The system is structured with four distinct example-based detectors that are trained to separately find the four components of the human body: the head, legs, left arm, and right arm. After ensuring that these components are present in the proper geometric configuration, a second example-based classifier combines the results of the component detectors to classify a pattern as either a \"person\" or a \"nonperson.\" We call this type of hierarchical architecture, in which learning occurs at multiple stages, an adaptive combination of classifiers (ACC). We present results that show that this system performs significantly better than a similar full-body person detector. This suggests that the improvement in performance is due to the component-based approach and the ACC data classification architecture. The algorithm is also more robust than the full-body person detection method in that it is capable of locating partially occluded views of people and people whose body parts have little contrast with the background."

We focus on a particular type of model where objects are represented as flexible constellations of rigid parts (features). The variability within a class is represented by a joint probability density function (pdf) on the shape of the constellation and the output of part detectors. In a first stage, the method automatically identifies distinctive parts in the training set by applying a clustering algorithm to patterns selected by an interest operator. It then learns the statistical shape model using expectation maximization. The method achieves very good classification results on human faces and rear views of cars."

Most importantly, the success of learning an object representation is naturally tied to the ability to represent at as a function of some intermediate representations extracted from the image. We evaluate this approach an a large scale experimental study in which the SNoW learning architecture is used to learn representations for the 100 objects in the Columbia Object Image Database (COIL-100). The SNoW-based method is shown to outperform other methods in terms of recognition rates; its performance degrades gracefully when the training data contains fewer views and in the presence of occlusion noise."

The key assumption underlying this work is that objects can be recognized (or discriminated) using simple representations in terms of syntactically simple relations over the raw image. Although the potential number of these simple relations could be huge, only a few of them are actually present in each observed image, and a fairly small number of those observed are relevant to discriminating an object. We show that these properties can be exploited to yield an efficient learning approach in terms of sample and computational complexity within the PAC model. No assumptions are needed on the distribution of the observed objects, and the learning performance is quantified relative to its experience. Most important, the success of learning an object representation is naturally tied to the ability to represent it as a function of some intermediate representations extracted from the image. We evaluate this approach in a large-scale experimental study in which the SNoW learning architecture is used to learn representations for the 100 objects in the Columbia Object Image Library. Experimental results exhibit good generalization and robustness properties of the SNoW-based method relative to other approaches. SNoW's recognition rate degrades more gracefully when the training data contains fewer views, and it shows similar behavior in some preliminary experiments with partially occluded objects."

We divide detection into visual selection and final classification, concentrating on the former: drastically reducing the number of candidate regions that require further, usually more intensive, processing, but with a minimum of computation and missed detections. Bottom-up processing is based on local groupings of edge fragments constrained by loose geometrical relationships. They have no a priori semantic or geometric interpretation. The role of training is to select special groupings that are moderately likely at certain places on the object but rare in the background. We show that the statistics in both populations are stable. The candidate regions are those that contain global arrangements of several local groupings. Whereas our model was not conceived to explain brain functions, it does cohere with evidence about the functions of neurons in V1 and V2, such as responses to coarse or incomplete patterns (e.g., illusory contours) and to scale and translation invariance in IT. Finally, the algorithm is applied to face and symbol detection."

Many objects look similar and most contain no single feature that uniquely identifies them. Furthermore, objects are rarely seen under identical viewing conditions: Objects change their size, position, orientation, and relations between parts, viewers move about, and sources of illumination turn on and off or move. Successful object recognition requires generalizing across such changes. Two different approaches to these issues have been adopted. Viewpoint-invariant theories assume that there are specific invariant cues to object identity that may be recovered under almost all viewing conditions. Viewpoint-dependent theories suggest that no such general invariants exist and that object features are represented much as they appeared when originally viewed, thereby preserving shape information and surface appearance. Despite many differences, theories of object recognition include some common principles. These include the decomposition of an image into component features, the coding of the spatial relations between such features, multiple views to represent feature sets arising from different object viewpoints, generalization mechanisms to normalize over changes in viewing conditions, and the flexibility to support recognition tasks ranging from item-specific individuation to basic-level categorization. \n \n \nKeywords: \n \nframes of reference; \nimage normalization; \nimage-based models; \nstructural description models; \nviewpoint-dependent recognition; \nviewpoint-invariant recognition"

We demonstrate our technique in the context of face detection with complex background without color or motion information, which has proven to be a challenging problem. We use a family of discrete Markov processes to model the face and background patterns and estimate the probability models using the data statistics. Then, we convert the learning process into an optimization, selecting the Markov process that optimizes the information-based discrimination between the two classes. The detection process is carried out by computing the likelihood ratio using the probability model obtained from the learning procedure. We show that because of the discrete nature of these models, the detection process is at least two orders of magnitude less computationally expensive than neural network approaches. However, no improvement in terms of correct-answer/false-alarm tradeoff is achieved."

The fundamental assumption of the proposed theory, recognition-by-components (RBC), is that a modest set of generalized-cone components, called geons (N \u00a3 36), can be derived from contrasts of five readily detectable properties of edges in a two-dimensiona l image: curvature, collinearity, symmetry, parallelism, and cotermination. The detection of these properties is generally invariant over viewing position an$ image quality and consequently allows robust object perception when the image is projected from a novel viewpoint or is degraded. RBC thus provides a principled account of the heretofore undecided relation between the classic principles of perceptual organization and pattern recognition: The constraints toward regularization (Pragnanz) characterize not the complete object but the object's components. Representational power derives from an allowance of free combinations of the geons. A Principle of Componential Recovery can account for the major phenomena of object recognition: If an arrangement of two or three geons can be recovered from the input, objects can be quickly recognized even when they are occluded, novel, rotated in depth, or extensively degraded. The results from experiments on the perception of briefly presented pictures by human observers provide empirical support for the theory. Any single object can project an infinity of image configurations to the retina. The orientation of the object to the viewer can vary continuously, each giving rise to a different two-dimensional projection. The object can be occluded by other objects or texture fields, as when viewed behind foliage. The object need not be presented as a full-colored textured image but instead can be a simplified line drawing. Moreover, the object can even be missing some of its parts or be a novel exemplar of its particular category. But it is only with rare exceptions that an image fails to be rapidly and readily classified, either as an instance of a familiar object category or as an instance that cannot be so classified (itself a form of classification)."

A wide range of face images in different poses, with different expressions and under different lighting conditions are used as a training set to capture the variations of human faces. Experimental results on commonly used benchmark data sets of a wide range of face images show that the SNoW-based approach outperforms methods that use neural networks, Bayesian methods, support vector machines and others.

Each of the methods makes a priori assumptions which it employs, given the data, when searching for its hypothesis. Nevertheless, as we show, it searches a space that is as rich as the space of all linear separators. We use this to build an argument for a data driven approach which merely searches for a good linear separator in the feature space, without further assumptions on the domain or a specific problem.We present such an approach - a sparse network of linear separators, utilizing the Winnow learning algorithm - and show how to use it in a variety of ambiguity resolution problems. The learning approach presented is attribute-efficient and, therefore, appropriate for domains having very large number of attributes.In particular, we present an extensive experimental comparison of our approach with other methods on several well studied lexical disambiguation tasks such as context-sensitive spelling correction, prepositional phrase attachment and part of speech tagging. In all cases we show that our approach either outperforms other methods tried for these tasks or performs comparably to the best."

The objects are modeled as polyhedra (or polygons) having up to six degrees of freedom relative to the sensors. The approach operates by examining all hypotheses about pairings between sensed data and object surfaces and efficiently discarding inconsistent ones by using local constraints on: distances between faces, angles between face normals, and angles (relative to the surface normals) of vectors between sensed points. The method described here is an extension of a method for recognition and localization of non-overlapping parts previously described in [Grimson & Lozano--P\u00e9rez 84] and [Gaston & Lozano-P\u00e9rez 84]."

A retinally connected neural network examines small windows of an image and decides whether each window contains a face. The system arbitrates between multiple networks to improve performance over a single network. We use a bootstrap algorithm for training the networks, which adds false detections into the training set as training progresses. This eliminates the difficult task of manually selecting non-face training examples, which must be chosen to span the entire space of non-face images. Comparisons with other state-of-the-art face detection systems are presented; our system has better performance in terms of detection and false-positive rates."

Vapnik and his team (AT&T Bell Labs., 1985) that can be seen as a new method for training polynomial, neural network, or Radial Basis Functions classifiers. The decision surfaces are found by solving a linearly constrained quadratic programming problem. This optimization problem is challenging because the quadratic form is completely dense and the memory requirements grow with the square of the number of data points. We present a decomposition algorithm that guarantees global optimality, and can be used to train SVM's over very large data sets. The main idea behind the decomposition is the iterative solution of sub-problems and the evaluation of optimality conditions which are used both to generate improved iterative values, and also establish the stopping criteria for the algorithm. We present experimental results of our implementation of SVM, and demonstrate the feasibility of our approach on a face detection problem that involves a data set of 50,000 data points."

Cells responsive to the sight of the entire human body (but no to control stimuli) were tested with two subregions (head alone with the body occluded from sight and the body alone with the head occluded). Forty-two percent (22 of 53) of cells responded to the whole body and to one of the two body regions tested separately: 72% (17 of 22) responding to the head and 28% (5 of 22) to the rest of the body. Forty-two percent (22 of 53) of cells responded independently to both regions of the body when tested in isolation. The remaining cells (17%, 9 of 53) were selective for the entire body and unresponsive to component parts. The majority of cells tested (90%, 35 of 39) were selective for perspective view (e.g., some cells respond optimally to the side view of the body, others to the back view). Comparable levels of view sensitivity were found for responses to the whole body and its parts. Results indicate (1) separate neuronal analysis of body parts and (2) extensive integration of information from different parts. Contrary to influential models of object recognition (Marr and Nishihara, 1978; Biederman, 1987), the results indicate view-specific processing both for the appearance of separate object components and for integration of information across components."
