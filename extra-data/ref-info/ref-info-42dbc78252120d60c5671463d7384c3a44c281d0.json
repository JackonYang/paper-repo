Many different zoning techniques are now available but there is no robust method available to benchmark and evaluate them reliably. Our proposed strategy is a region-based approach, in which segmentation results are compared with manually generated \"ground truth files\", describing all possible correct segmentations. A segmentation ground truthing scheme has been proposed. The evaluation of segmentation quality is achieved by testing the overlap between the two sets of regions. In fact, the regions are defined as the \"black\" pixels contained in the extracted polygons. An explicit specification of segmentation errors and a numerical evaluation are derived. The algorithm is simple and fast, and provides a multi-level output for each segmentation.<<ETX>>"

The structure of the background (white space) is analyzed, assisted by an enumeration of all maximal white rectangles. For this enumeration, the most computationally expensive step, an algorithm has been developed that, aside from a sort, achieves an expected runtime linear in the number of black connected components. The crucial engineering decision is the specification of a partial order on white rectangles to express domain-specific knowledge of preferred shapes and sizes. This order determines a sequence of partial covers of the background, and thus, a sequence of nested page segmentations. In experimental trials on Manhattan layouts, good segmentations often occur early in this sequence, using a simple and uniform shape-direction rule. This is a global-to-local strategy, which for some tasks is superior to strategies currently emphasized in the literature, including bottom-up and top-down.<<ETX>>"

A unique feature is the extended section on music notation, an ideal vehicle for international sharing of basic research. Also, the collection includes important new work on line drawings, handwriting, character and symbol recognition, and basic methodological issues. The IAPR 1990 Workshop on Syntactic and Structural Pattern Recognition is summarized,including the reports of its expert working groups, whose debates provide a fascinating perspective on the field. The book is an excellent text for a first-year graduate seminar in document image analysis,and is likely to remain a standard reference in the field for years."

Because the Hough transform is computationally expensive, the amount of data within a document image is reduced through the computation of its horizontal and vertical black runlengths. Histograms of these runlengths are used to determine whether the document is in portrait or landscape orientation. A gray scale burst image is created from the black runlengths that are perpendicular to the text lines by placing the length of the run in the run's bottom-most pixel. By creating a burst image from the original document image, the processing time of the Hough transform can be reduced by a factor of as much as 7.4 for documents with gray-scale images. Because only small runlengths are input to the Hough transform and because the accumulator array is incremented by the runlength associated with a pixel rather than by a factor of 1, the negative effects of noise, black margins, and figures are avoided. Consequently, interline spacing can be determined more accurately.<<ETX>>"
