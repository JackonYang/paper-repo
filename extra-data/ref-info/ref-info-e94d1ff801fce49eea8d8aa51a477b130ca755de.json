Character candidate regions are detected by an image segmentation method based on adaptive thresholding and by evaluating gray-level difference between adjacent regions. Character pattern candidates are obtained by associating the detected regions according to their positions and gray levels and evaluating the aspect ratio of the rectangle that circumscribes the associated regions. The character recognition process selects character pattern candidates with high similarities to any categories in a dictionary (high similarity patterns). Highly promising experimental results have been obtained using the method on 100 images acquired under uncontrolled lighting. This algorithm can be applied to read characters of any size and format under various lighting conditions.<<ETX>>"

The segmentation operation is posed as a statistical classification task with two pattern classes: print and background. A number of classification strategies are available. All require some prior information about the distribution of gray levels for the two classes. Training (either supervised or unsupervised) is employed to form these initial density estimates. Automatic updating of the class-conditional densities is performed within subregions in the image to adapt these global density estimates to the local image area. After local class-conditional densities have been obtained, each pixel is classified within the window using several techniques: a noncontextual Bayes classifier, Besag's classifier, relaxation, Owen and Switzer's classifier, and Haslett's classifier. Four test images were processed. In two of these, the relaxation method performed best, and in the other two, the noncontextual method performed best. Automatic updating improved the results for both classifiers. >"

An optimal threshold is selected by the discriminant criterion, namely, so as to maximize the separability of the resultant classes in gray levels. The procedure is very simple, utilizing only the zerothand the first-order cumulative moments of the gray-level histogram. It is straightforward to extend the method to multithreshold problems. Several experimental results are also presented to support the validity of the method."
