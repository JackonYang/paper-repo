The author has analyzed the computations performed in the course of visual motion analysis. Workable schemes able to perform certain tasks performed by the visual system have been constructed and used as vehicles for investigating the problems faced by the visual system and its methods for solving them.Two major problems are treated: first, the correspondence problem, which concerns the identification of image elements that represent the same object at different times, thereby maintaining the perceptual identity of the object in motion or in change. The second problem is the three-dimensional interpretation of the changing image once a correspondence has been established.The author's computational approach to visual theory makes the work unique, and it should be of interest to psychologists working in visual perception and readers interested in cognitive studies in general, as well as computer scientists interested in machine vision, theoretical neurophysiologists, and philosophers of science."

In fact, the action of various physical devices which \u201crecognize\u201d or respond identically to certain simple objects can be treated in terms of such transformations. Thus the essential part of physical \u201crecognizing\u201d instruments is usually a filter\u2014whether it be a mechanical sieve, an optical filter, or a tuned electrical circuit \u2014which \u201cpasses\u201d only quantities of the kind it is required to identify and rejects all others. Mathematically, the situation here is that, in a perfect filter, the transformation leaves the desired quantity unaltered, but reduces all others to zero."

It presents those parts of the theory which are especially useful in calculations and stresses the representation of splines as linear combinations of B-splines. After two chapters summarizing polynomial approximation, a rigorous discussion of elementary spline theory is given involving linear, cubic and parabolic splines. The computational handling of piecewise polynomial functions (of one variable) of arbitrary order is the subject of chapters VII and VIII, while chapters IX, X, and XI are devoted to B-splines. The distances from splines with fixed and with variable knots is discussed in chapter XII. The remaining five chapters concern specific approximation methods, interpolation, smoothing and least-squares approximation, the solution of an ordinary differential equation by collocation, curve fitting, and surface fitting. The present text version differs from the original in several respects. The book is now typeset (in plain TeX), the Fortran programs now make use of Fortran 77 features. The figures have been redrawn with the aid of Matlab, various errors have been corrected, and many more formal statements have been provided with proofs. Further, all formal statements and equations have been numbered by the same numbering system, to make it easier to find any particular item. A major change has occured in Chapters IX-XI where the B-spline theory is now developed directly from the recurrence relations without recourse to divided differences. This has brought in knot insertion as a powerful tool for providing simple proofs concerning the shape-preserving properties of the B-spline series."

A continued quantitative development of this theory to account for color perceptions, equations, and discriminations under various conditions of adaptation and illumination has emphasized the need for systematic quantification of induced color effects. Experiments are reported in which a color-matching technique was used to compare the chromatic responses to focal stimuli seen first in isolation and then in the presence of surrounding stimulus arrays of specified luminances and chromaticities and of various degrees of complexity. The results are analyzed in terms of the chromatic response processes of the opponent-colors theory. Chromatic inductions are shown to decrease systematically with decreasing contiguity of focal and surround stimulus areas. For given degrees of contiguity, induced chromatic responses are shown to be opponent to but proportional in magnitude to the mean chromatic activities of the inducing field, and the constant of proportionality decreases as a function of decreasing contiguity."

It is shown how the imposition of such a limit can provide a suitable balance between the twin requirements of disambiguating power and the ability to deal with a wide range of surfaces. Next, the design of a very simple stereo algorithm called PMF is described. In conjunction with certain other constraints used in many other stereo algorithms, PMF employs a limit on allowable disparity gradients of 1, a value that coincides with that reported for human stereoscopic vision. The excellent performance of PMF is illustrated on a series of natural and artificial stereograms. Finally, the differences between the theoretical justification for the use of disparity gradients for solving the stereo correspondence problems presented in the paper and others that exist in the stereo algorithm literature are discussed."

In the previous paper we have given a quantitative description of visual control of flight orientation in the fly. This description can account for fixation, tracking and some instances of spontaneous pattern preference behaviour. The phenomenological theory outlines the basic logical organization of the visual control system of the fly. It requires the neural network between the receptors and the flight muscles to perform two main computations on the visual input. One computation extracts movement information (the term r (\u03c8)\u03c8 b of the phenomenological equation). The other provides position information (the term D (\u03c8))."

                "text": "A theory of monocular depth determination is presented. The effect of finite temporal resolution is incorporated by generalizing the Marr-Hildreth edge detected operator \u2014\u22072G(r) where \u22072 is the Laplacian and G(r) is a two dimensional Gaussian. The constraint that the edge detection operator in space-time should produce zero-crossings at the same place in different channels, i. e. at different resolutions of the Gaussian, led to the conclusion that the Marr-Hildreth operator should be replaced by -\u25a12G(r, t) where \u25a12 is the d\u2019Alembertian \u22072 -(1/u2) (\u22022/\u2202t2) and G(r, t) is a Gaussian in space-time. To ensure that the locations of the zerocrossings are independent o the channel width, G(r, t) has to be isotropic in the sense that the velocity u appearing in the defintion of the d\u2019Alembertian must also be used to relate the scales of length and time in G. However, the new operatior -\u25a12G(r, t) produces two types of zero-crossing for each isolated edge feature in the image I(r, t). One of these, termed the 'static edge\u2019, corresponds to the position of the image edge at time t as defined by \u22072I(r, t) = 0; the other, called a \u2018depth zero\u2019, depends only on the relative motion of the observer and object and is usually found only in the periphery of the field of view. When an edge feature is itself in the periphery of the visual field and these zeros coincide, there is an additional cross-over effect. It is shown how these zero-crossings may be used to infer the depth of an object when the observer and object are in relative motion. If an edge feature is near the centre of the image (i. e. near the focus of expansion), the spatial and temporal slopes of the zeros crossing at the static edge may be used to infer the depth, but, if the edge feature is in the periphery of the image, the cross-over effect enables the depth to be obtained immediately. While the former utilizes sharp spatial and temporal resolution to give detailed three-dimensional information, the cross-over effect relies on longer integration times to give a direct measure of the time-to-contact. We propose that both mechanisms could be used to extract depth information in computer vision systems and speculate on how our theory could be used to model depth perception in early visual processing in humans where there is evidence of both monocular perception of the environment in depth and of looming detection in the periphery of the field of view. In addition it is shown how a number of previous models are included in our theory, in particular the directional sensor proposed by Marr & Ullman and a method of depth determination proposed by Prazdny."

It is demonstrated, however, that the disparity gradient, rather than the disparity magnitude, dictates binocular fusion when several objects occur near one another in the visual field. The disparity gradient is defined as the difference between the disparities of neighboring objects divided by their angular separation. If this ratio exceeds a critical value (\u223c1) then fusion does not occur, even though the absolute disparities of the individual objects may be well within the classical Panum's area.

The networks can rapidly provide a collectively-computed solution (a digital output) to a problem on the basis of analog input information. The problems to be solved must be formulated in terms of desired optima, often subject to constraints. The general principles involved in constructing networks to solve specific problems are discussed. Results of computer simulations of a network designed to solve a difficult but well-defined optimization problem-the Traveling-Salesman Problem-are presented and used to illustrate the computational power of the networks. Good solutions to this problem are collectively computed within an elapsed time of only a few neural time constants. The effectiveness of the computation involves both the nonlinear analog response of the neurons and the large connectivity among them. Dedicated networks of biological or microelectronic neurons could provide the computational capabilities described for a wide class of problems having combinatorial complexity. The power and speed naturally displayed by such collective networks may contribute to the effectiveness of biological information processing."

Self-induced movements of an observer relative to rigid bodies in his environment generate charactertistic motion parallax fields. The observer may regard those fields as proprioceptive and interprete the geometrical invariants of the fields as indicators of solid shape. In this way his perceptions become object-oriented, which is the normal case as the many constancy-phenomena show. Similar arguments apply to the disparity field of binocular vision. In this paper we treat the qualitative nature of such fields. [In this case the qualitative nature is basic. Compare the case of an equation with a single unknown. Often one is interested primarily in the qualitative solution (are there roots? How many?), and only slightly in the quantitative information (the numerical value of a root).] The qualitative nature of the fields is fixed if their singularities are known. It is shown that the singularities are of two types: isolated points (so-called specular points) and line-singularities (so-called folds, cusps and T-junctions). It is shown that for most vantage points that an observer can occupy, the topological structure of the set of singularities does not change if the observer performs small exploratory movements. That is most vantage points are stable. At an unstable vantage point the set of singularities changes and the observer experiences an event. Because certain properties of the set of singularities are shown to be preserved, only a few simple types of event are possible. A complete list is presented. The occurrence of an event is shown to be simply related to the solid shape of the objects of vision. Our geometrical theory enables us to understand the structure of the observer's internal models of external bodies."

But possibly you would enjoy more solving it yourself, or seeing to what considerations you are led if you omit the hypothesis of continuity. The discontinuous solutions of (1) have been studied extensively. I have mentioned this equation because any solution of it satisfies"

There are nine labels associated with each image point, eight labels indicating line segments at various orientations and one indicating the no-line case. Attached to each label is a probability. In the relaxation process, interaction takes place among the probabilities at neighboring points. This permits line segments in compatible orientations to strengthen one another, and incompatible segments to weaken one another. Similarly, no-line labels are reinforced by neighboring no-line labels and weakened by appropriately oriented line labels. This process converges, in only a few iterations, to a condition in which points lying on long curves have achieved high line probabilities, while other points have high no-line probabilities, There is some tendency, under this process, for curves to thicken; however, a thinning procedure can be incorporated to counteract this. The process is effective even for curves of low contrast, and even when many curves lie close to one another."

Using a restricted form of quintic Hermite interpolation, it is possible to allow distinct bias and tension parameters at each joint without destroying geometric continuity. This provides a new means of obtaining local control of bias and tension in piecewise polynomial curves and surfaces."

                "text": "A theory of edge detection is presented. The analysis proceeds in two parts. (1) Intensity changes, which occur in a natural image over a wide range of scales, are detected separately at different scales. An appropriate filter for this purpose at a given scale is found to be the second derivative of a Gaussian, and it is shown that, provided some simple conditions are satisfied, these primary filters need not be orientation-dependent. Thus, intensity changes at a given scale are best detected by finding the zero values of \u22072G(x, y)* I(x, y) for image I, where G(x, y) is a two-dimensional Gaussian distribution and \u22072 is the Laplacian. The intensity changes thus discovered in each of the channels are then represented by oriented primitives called zero-crossing segments, and evidence is given that this representation is complete. (2) Intensity changes in images arise from surface discontinuities or from reflectance or illumination boundaries, and these all have the property that they are spatially localized. Because of this, the zero-crossing segments from the different channels are not independent, and rules are deduced for combining them into a description of the image. This description is called the raw primal sketch. The theory explains several basic psychophysical findings, and the operation of forming oriented zero-crossing segments from the output of centre-surround \u22072G filters acting on the image forms the basis for a physiological model of simple cells (see Marr & Ullman 1979)."

                "text": "Scale-space filtering (Witkin 83) is a recently developed technique, both powerful and general, for segmentation and analysis of signals. Asada and Brady (84) have amply demonstrated the value of scale-space for description of curved contours from digitised images . Weak continuity constraints (Blake 83a,b, Blake and Zisserman 85,87) furnish novel, powerful, non-linear filters , to use in place of gaussians, for scale-space filtering. This has some striking advantages (fig 1). First, scale-space is uniform, so that tracking across scale is a trivial task. Structure need not be preserved to indefinitely fine scale; this leads to an enrichment of the concept of scale a rounded corner, for example, can be represented as a discontinuity at coarse scale but smooth at fine scale. And finally boundary conditions at ends of curves are handled satisfactorily it is as easy to analyse open curves as closed ones. 1 Weak continuity constraints Weak continuity constraints are a principled and effective treatment of the localisation of discontinuities in discrete data. Detailed discussions are given in (Blake 83a, Blake 83b, Blake and Zisserman 85, Blake and Zisserman 87). Applications in computer vision include curve description, edge detection, reconstruction of 2~D surfaces from stereo or laser-rangefinder data, and others. This paper deals with the application of weak continuity constraints to description of plane curves. First a brief summary of weak continuity constraints is given for problems like curve description, in which the data is a 1D array. Data may be obtained from a plane curve as an array (Ji of tangent angle values at equal spacings in arc-length s . The problem is to localise discontinuities in noisy, discrete data. The notion of a discontinuity applies to functions, not to discrete arrays so the problem is ill-posed, and this is exacerbated by the presence of noise. One solution is to interpolate the data by a smooth function such as a gaussian, whose 1st derivative can then be examined. Of course this is common practice in edge detection and in spline interpolation (e.g. de Boor 78) . Such smoothing can be regarded as fitting a function u(s) which tends to seek a minimum of some elastic energy P. Energy P is traded off against a sum of squares error measure D , defined as : D = ~i(U(Si) (Ji)2 by minimising variationally the total energy (or cost) P+ D. The result is a function u(s) that is both fairly smooth and is a fair approximation to the data (}i. The simplest form of the energy P is that of a horizontal stretched string (approximately) : where the parameter A governs the stiffness of the string. If.>. is large then the tendency to smoothness overwhelms the tendency (from D) to approximate the data well. In the extremes, if'>' is very large, the fitted function is simply u = canst , the least squares regression of a constant function to the data (Ji; but if .>. ~ 0 then u interpolates the data, linking the (Ji by straight lines. Weak continuity constraints can be applied to a scheme like the one above, to incorporate discontinuities explicitly into the fitting of u above. Rather than fitting a u that is smooth everywhere and then examining the gradient u' , the function u is allowed to break (at knots, in spline jargon) it is piecewise continuous. The number and position of the discontinuities is chosen optimally, by using an augmented form of cost function E = D + P + S, where the additional term S embodies weak continuity constraints: s = n' X (number of discontinuities) a fixed penalty a is paid for each discontinuity allowed. This has the effect of discouraging discontinuities; u is continuous \"almost everywhere\". But an occasional discontinuity may be allowed if there is sufficient benefit in terms of smoothness (P) and faithfulness to data (D) in so doing . Clearly a is some kind of measure of reluctance to allow a discontinuity. In fact the two parameters a,'>' interact in a rather interesting way. Far from being \"fudge factors\" that must be empirically set, they have clear interpretations in terms of"

                "text": "Stroboscopic presentation of a moving object can be interpolated by our visual system into the perception of continuous motion. The precision of this interpolation process has been explored by measuring the vernier discrimination threshold for targets displayed stroboscopically at a sequence of stations. The vernier targets, moving at constant velocity, were presented either with a spatial offset or with a temporal offset or with both. The main results are: (1) vernier acuity for spatial offset is rather invariant over a wide range of velocities and separations between the stations (see Westheimer & McKee 1975); (2) vernier acuity for temporal offset depends on spatial separation and velocity. At each separation there is an optimal velocity such that the strobe interval is roughly constant at about 30 ms; optimal acuity decreases with increasing separation; (3) blur of the vernier pattern decreases acuity for spatial offsets, but improves acuity for temporal offsets (at high velocities and large separations); (4) a temporal offset exactly compensates the equivalent (at the given velocity) spatial offset only for a small separation and optimal velocity; otherwise the spatial offset dominates. A theoretical analysis of the interpolation problem suggests a computational scheme based on the assumption of constant velocity motion. This assumption reflects a constraint satisfied in normal vision over the short times and small distances normally relevant for the interpolation process. A reasonable implementation of this scheme only requires a set of independent, direction selective spatiotemporal channels, that is receptive fields with the different sizes and temporal properties revealed by psychophysical experiments. It is concluded that sophisticated mechanisms are not required to account for the main properties of vernier acuity with moving targets. It is furthermore suggested that the spatiotemporal channels of human vision may be the interpolation filters themselves. Possible neurophysiological implications are briefly discussed."

For many applications, it would be useful to be able to reliably derive this representation from a closely spaced set of points that approximate the desired curve, such as the input from a digitizing tablet or a scanner. This paper presents a solution to the problem of automatically generating efficient piecewise parametric cubic polynomial approximations to shapes from sampled data. We have developed an algorithm that takes a set of sample points, plus optional endpoint and tangent vector specifications, and iteratively derives a single parametric cubic polynomial that lies close to the data points as defined by an error metric based on least-squares. Combining this algorithm with dynamic programming techniques to determine the knot placement gives good results over a range of shapes and applications."

A second constraint is needed. A method for finding the optical flow pattern is presented which assumes that the apparent velocity of the brightness pattern varies smoothly almost everywhere in the image. An iterative implementation is shown which successfully computes the optical flow for a number of synthetic image sequences. The algorithm is robust in that it can handle image sequences that are quantized rather coarsely in space and time. It is also insensitive to quantization of brightness levels and additive noise. Examples are included where the assumption of smoothness is violated at singular points or along lines in the image."

We define a set of primitive parameterized curvature discontinuities, and derive expressions for their convolutions with the first and second derivatives of a Gaussian. We describe an implemented algorithm that computes the Curvature Primal Sketch by matching the multiscale convolutions of a shape, and illustrate its performance on a set of tool shapes.

                "text": "Staining for the mitochondrial enzyme cytochrome oxidase reveals an array of dense regions (blobs) in the primate primary visual cortex. They are most obvious in the upper layers, 2 and 3, but can also be seen in layers 4B, 5, and 6, in register with the blobs in layers 2 and 3. We compared cells inside and outside blobs in macaque and squirrel monkeys, looking at their physiological responses and anatomical connections. Cells within blobs did not show orientation selectivity, whereas cells between blobs were highly orientation selective. Receptive fields of blob cells had circular symmetry and were of three main types, Broad-Band Center-Surround, Red-Green Double-Opponent, and Yellow-Blue Double-Opponent. Double-Opponent cells responded poorly or not at all to white light in any form, or to diffuse light at any wavelength. In contrast to blob cells, none of the cells recorded in layer 4C beta were Double-Opponent: like the majority of cells in the parvocellular geniculate layers, they were either Broad-Band or Color- Opponent Center-Surround, e.g., red-on-center green-off-surround. To our surprise cells in layer 4C alpha were orientation selective. In tangential penetrations throughout layers 2 and 3, optium orientation, when plotted against electrode position, formed long, regular, usually linear sequences, which were interrupted but not perturbed by the blobs. Staining area 18 for cytochrome oxidase reveals a series of alternating wide and narrow dense stripes, separated by paler interstripes. After small injections of horseradish peroxidase into area 18, we saw a precise set of connections from the blobs in area 17 to thin stripes in area 18, and from the interblob regions in area 17 to interstripes in area 18. Specific reciprocal connections also ran from thin stripes to blobs and from interstripes to interblobs. We have not yet determined the area 17 connections to thick stripes in area 18. In addition, within area 18 there are stripe-to-stripe and interstripe- to-interstripe intrinsic connections. These results suggest that a system involved in the processing of color information, especially color-spatial interactions, runs parallel to and separate from the orientation-specific system. Color, encoded in three coordinates by the major blob cell types, red-green, yellow-blue, and black-white, can be transformed into the three coordinates, red, green, and blue, of the Retinex algorithm of Land."
