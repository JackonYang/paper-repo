Several critical functions have been investigated and the technical approaches are discussed. The first is the segmentation and classification of digitized printed documents into regions of text and images. A nonlinear, run-length smoothing algorithm has been used for this purpose. By using the regular features of text lines, a linear adaptive classification scheme discriminates text regions from others. The second technique studied is an adaptive approach to the recognition of the hundreds of font styles and sizes that can occur on printed documents. A preclassifier is constructed during the input process and used to speed up a well-known pattern-matching method for clustering characters from an arbitrary print source into a small sample of prototypes. Experimental results are included."

With this growing degree of office automation the paper-computer interface becomes increasingly important. To be useful, this interface must be able to handle documents containing text as well as graphics, and convert them into an electronic representation that not only captures content (like in current OCR readers), but also the layout and logic structure. We describe a system for the analysis of business letters which is able to extract the key elements of a letter like its sender, the date, etc. The letter can thus for instance be stored in electronic archival systems, edited by structure editors, or forwarded via electronic mail services. This system was implemented on a Symbolics Lisp machine for the high level part of the analysis and on a VAX for the low and medium level processing stages. Some practical results are presented and discussed. Apart from this application our system is a useful testbed to implement and test sophisticated control structures and model representations for image understanding."

This unit, designed for interactive character recognition applications, is equipped with a hand-scanner for input and a personal computer for word and/or image processing. The heart of this unit is a bit-serial Single Instruction Multiple Data stream (SIMD) array processor constructed with four identical cellular array LSIs (AAP2). The processor is fully programmable and the complex pro-cess of Japanese character recognition can be carried out with a single program package. Its architecture permits flexible and high-speed SIMD operations to process bitline data such as local fields of scanned documents. The processor components were integrated into one board and confirmed to be more than ten times faster than present image processors of the same size through various image processing tests. High character recognition performance is obtained at a reading speed of 8 Japanese characters per second which is sufficient for hand-scanning data input operations. The recognition rate is higher than 98% for about 3,300 Japanese characters."
