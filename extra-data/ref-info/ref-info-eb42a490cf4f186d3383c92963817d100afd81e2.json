The results from our best model (96.45% on an unused test sample from the Brown corpus with 181 distinct tags) is on the upper edge of reported results. We also hope these results clear up some confusion in the literature about the best equations to use. However, the major purpose of this paper is to show how the equations for a variety of models may be derived and thus encourage future authors to give the equations for their model and the derivations thereof."

In models whose parameters are very specific like lexicalized ones, sparse-data problem is very serious and also conditional probabilities tend to be estimated unreliably. To overcome data-sparseness, a simplified version of the well-known back-off smoothing method is used. To mitigate unreliable estimation problem, our models assume joint independence instead of conditional independence because joint probabilities have the same degree of estimation reliability. In experiments for the Brown corpus, models with rich contexts achieve relatively high accuracy and some models assuming joint independence show better results than the corresponding HMMs."

These methods share the similarity by finding hyperplanes that approximately separate a class of document vectors from its complement. However, support vector machines are so far considered special in that they have been demonstrated to achieve the state of the art performance. It is therefore worthwhile to understand whether such good performance is unique to the SVM design, or if it can also be achieved by other linear classification methods. In this paper, we compare a number of known linear classification methods as well as some variants in the framework of regularized linear systems. We will discuss the statistical and numerical properties of these algorithms, with a focus on text categorization. We will also provide some numerical experiments to illustrate these algorithms on a number of datasets."

Building on original research by the authors over a number of years, this book gives a thorough and rigorous mathematical treatment of the underlying ideas, structures, and algorithms, emphasizing those cases in which exact answers are obtainable. The book will be of interest to researchers and graduate students in artificial intelligence who desire an understanding of the mathematical and statistical basis of probabilistic expert systems, and to students and research workers in statistics wanting an introduction to this fascinating and rapidly developing field. The careful attention to detail will also make this work an important reference source for all those involved in the theory and applications of probabilistic expert systems."

There are two possible explanations of this phenomenon. First, there might be an assumption that any tool which can only produce linear classification boundaries is likely to be trumped by more modern nonlinear tools. Second, there is a legitimate fear that logistic regression cannot practically scale up to the massive dataset sizes to which modern data mining tools are applied. This paper consists of an empirical examination of the first assumption, and surveys, implements and compares techniques by which logistic regression can be scaled to data with millions of attributes and records. Our results, on a large life sciences dataset, indicate that logistic regression can perform surprisingly well, both statistically and computationally, when compared with an array of more recent classification algorithms."
