The model we study can be interpreted as a broad, abstract extension of the well-studied on-line prediction model to a general decision-theoretic setting. We show that the multiplicative weight-update Littlestone?Warmuth rule can be adapted to this model, yielding bounds that are slightly weaker in some cases, but applicable to a considerably more general class of learning problems. We show how the resulting learning algorithm can be applied to a variety of problems, including gambling, multiple-outcome prediction, repeated games, and prediction of points in Rn. In the second part of the paper we apply the multiplicative weight-update technique to derive a new boosting algorithm. This boosting algorithm does not require any prior knowledge about the performance of the weak learning algorithm. We also study generalizations of the new boosting algorithm to the problem of learning functions whose range, rather than being binary, is an arbitrary finite set or a bounded segment of the real line."

The ensemble algorithms are two versions of boosting and committees of neural networks trained independently. For each of the four algorithms, we experimentally determine the test and training error curves in an optical character recognition (OCR) problem as both a function of training set size and computational cost using three architectures. We show that a single machine is best for small training set size while for large training set size some version of boosting is best. However, for a given computational cost, boosting is always best. Furthermore, we show a surprising result for the original boosting algorithm: namely, that as the training set size increases, the training error decreases until it asymptotes to the test error rate. This has potential implications in the search for better training algorithms."

The improvement is achieved by combining a large number of hypotheses, each of which is generated by training the given learning algorithm on a different set of examples. Our algorithm is based on ideas presented by Schapire and represents an improvement over his results, The analysis of our algorithm provides general upper bounds on the resources required for learning in Valiant\u2032s polynomial PAC learning framework, which are the best general upper bounds known today. We show that the number of hypotheses that are combined by our algorithm is the smallest number possible. Other outcomes of our analysis are results regarding the representational power of threshold circuits, the relation between learnability and compression, and a method for parallelizing PAC learning algorithms. We provide extensions of our algorithms to cases in which the concepts are not binary and to the case where the accuracy of the learning algorithm depends on the distribution of the instances."

The effect of boosting is reported on four handwritten image databases consisting of 12000 digits from segmented ZIP Codes from the United States Postal Service and the following from the National Institute of Standards and Technology: 220000 digits, 45000 upper case letters, and 45000 lower case letters. We use two performance measures: the raw error rate (no rejects) and the reject rate required to achieve a 1% error rate on the patterns not rejected.
