They enable the application of kernel methods, such as support vector machines, to the analysis and classification of graphs, for example, chemical compounds. These graph kernels are obtained by marginalizing a kernel between paths with respect to a random walk model on the graph vertices along the edges. We propose two extensions of these graph kernels, with the double goal to reduce their computation time and increase their relevance as measure of similarity between graphs. First, we propose to modify the label of each vertex by automatically adding information about its environment with the use of the Morgan algorithm. Second, we suggest a modification of the random walk model to prevent the walk from coming back to a vertex that was just visited. These extensions are then tested on benchmark experiments of chemical compounds classification, with promising results."

For graph data, a whole toolbox of data mining algorithms becomes available by defining a kernel function on instances of graphs. Graph kernels based on walks, subtrees and cycles in graphs have been proposed so far. As a general problem, these kernels are either computationally expensive or limited in their expressiveness. We try to overcome this problem by defining expressive graph kernels which are based on paths. As the computation of all paths and longest paths in a graph is NP-hard, we propose graph kernels based on shortest paths. These kernels are computable in polynomial time, retain expressivity and are still positive definite. In experiments on classification of graph models of proteins, our shortest-path kernels show significantly higher classification accuracy than walk-based kernels."

We propose new kernels with a parameter to control the complexity of the subtrees used as features to represent the graphs. This parameter allows to smoothly interpolate between classical graph kernels based on the count of common walks, on the one hand, and kernels that emphasize the detection of large common subtrees, on the other hand. We also propose two modular extensions to this formulation. The first extension increases the number of subtrees that define the feature space, and the second one removes noisy features from the graph representations. We validate experimentally these new kernels on problems of toxicity and anti-cancer activity prediction for small molecules with support vector machines."

Through reduction to a Sylvester equation we improve the time complexity of kernel computation between unlabeled graphs with n vertices from O(n6) to O(n3). We find a spectral decomposition approach even more efficient when computing entire kernel matrices. For labeled graphs we develop conjugate gradient and fixed-point methods that take O(dn3) time per iteration, where d is the size of the label set. By extending the necessary linear algebra to Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHS) we obtain the same result for d-dimensional edge kernels, and O(n4) in the infinite-dimensional case; on sparse graphs these algorithms only take O(n2) time per iteration in all cases. Experiments on graphs from bioinformatics and other application domains show that these techniques can speed up computation of the kernel by an order of magnitude or more. We also show that certain rational kernels (Cortes et al., 2002, 2003, 2004) when specialized to graphs reduce to our random walk graph kernel. Finally, we relate our framework to R-convolution kernels (Haussler, 1999) and provide a kernel that is close to the optimal assignment kernel of kernel of Frohlich et al. (2006) yet provably positive semi-definite."

Our kernel has a linear time complexity with respect to the number of nodes times the average number of neighboring nodes in the given graphs.

One of the major research directions in this field is concerned with predictive data mining in graph databases where each instance is represented by a graph. Some of the proposed approaches for this task rely on the excellent classification performance of support vector machines. To control the computational cost of these approaches, the underlying kernel functions are based on frequent patterns. In contrast to these approaches, we propose a kernel function based on a natural set of cyclic and tree patterns independent of their frequency, and discuss its computational aspects. To practically demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we use the popular NCI-HIV molecule dataset. Our experimental results show that cyclic pattern kernels can be computed quickly and offer predictive performance superior to recent graph kernels based on frequent patterns."

As most \u2018real-world\u2019 data is structured, research in kernel methods has begun investigating kernels for various kinds of structured data. One of the most widely used tools for modeling structured data are graphs. In this paper we study the trade-off between expressivity and efficiency of graph kernels. First, we motivate the need for this discussion by showing that fully general graph kernels can not even be approximated efficiently. We also discuss generalizations of graph kernels defined in literature and show that they are either not positive definite or not very useful. Finally, we propose a new graph kernel based on subtree patterns. We argue that while a little more computationally expensive, this kernel is more expressive than kernels based on walks."

As a byproduct this leads to a new class of kernel functions. We demonstrate how the necessary computations can be carried out efficiently. Compared to marginalized graph kernels our method in some cases leads to a significant reduction of the prediction error. Further improvement can be gained, if expert knowledge is combined with our method. We also investigate a reduced graph representation of molecules by collapsing certain structural elements, like e.g. rings, into a single node of the molecular graph."

The kernels are based on soft matching of subtree-patterns of the respective graphs, leveraging the natural structure of images while remaining robust to the associated segmentation process uncertainty. Indeed, output from morphological segmentation is often represented by a labelled graph, each vertex corresponding to a segmented region, with edges joining neighboring regions. However, such image representations have mostly remained underused for learning tasks, partly because of the observed instability of the segmentation process and the inherent hardness of inexact graph matching with uncertain graphs. Our kernels count common virtual substructures amongst images, which enables to perform efficient supervised classification of natural images with a support vector machine. Moreover, the kernel machinery allows us to take advantage of recent advances in kernel-based learning: (i) semi-supervised learning reduces the required number of labelled images, while (ii) multiple kernel learning algorithms efficiently select the most relevant similarity measures between images within our family."

The skew spectrum is based on mapping the adjacency matrix of any (weigted, directed, unlabeled) graph to a function on the symmetric group and computing bispectral invariants. The reduced form of the skew spectrum is computable in O(n3) time, and experiments show that on several benchmark datasets it can outperform state of the art graph kernels."

In the present paper, we address the issue of learning graph edit distance cost functions for numerically labeled graphs from a corpus of sample graphs. We propose a system of self-organizing maps (SOMs) that represent the distance measuring spaces of node and edge labels. Our learning process is based on the concept of self-organization. It adapts the edit costs in such a way that the similarity of graphs from the same class is increased, whereas the similarity of graphs from different classes decreases. The learning procedure is demonstrated on two different applications involving line drawing graphs and graphs representing diatoms, respectively."

We present a new approach that combines sequential, structural and chemical information into one graph model of proteins. We predict functional class membership of enzymes and non-enzymes using graph kernels and support vector machine classification on these protein graphs.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOur graph model, derivable from protein sequence and structure only, is competitive with vector models that require additional protein information, such as the size of surface pockets. If we include this extra information into our graph model, our classifier yields significantly higher accuracy levels than the vector models. Hyperkernels allow us to select and to optimally combine the most relevant node attributes in our protein graphs. We have laid the foundation for a protein function prediction system that integrates protein information from various sources efficiently and effectively.\n\n\nAVAILABILITY\nMore information available via www.dbs.ifi.lmu.de/Mitarbeiter/borgwardt.html."

The method can be applied iteratively to build a kernel on a innnite set from kernels involving generators of the set. The family of kernels generated generalizes the family of radial basis kernels. It can also be used to deene kernels in the form of joint Gibbs probability distributions. Kernels can be built from hidden Markov random elds, generalized regular expressions, pair-HMMs, or ANOVA de-compositions. Uses of the method lead to open problems involving the theory of innnitely divisible positive deenite functions. Fundamentals of this theory and the theory of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces are reviewed and applied in establishing the validity of the method."

Previously it was an open question whether or not 4 variables suffice. Our lower bound remains true over a set of graphs of color class size 4. This contrasts sharply with the fact that 3 variables suffice to identify all graphs of color class size 3, and 2 variables suffice to identify almost all graphs. Our lower bound is optimal up to multiplication by a constant becausen variables obviously suffice to identify graphs onn vertices."

Many of the best-performing techniques for these tasks utilize a descriptor-based representation of the compound that captures various aspects of the underlying molecular graph\u2019s topology. In this paper we compare five different set of descriptors that are currently used for chemical compound classification. We also introduce four different descriptors derived from all connected fragments present in the molecular graphs primarily for the purpose of comparing them to the currently used descriptor spaces and analyzing what properties of descriptor spaces are helpful in providing effective representation for molecular graphs. In addition, we introduce an extension to existing vector-based kernel functions to take into account the length of the fragments present in the descriptors. We experimentally evaluate the performance of the previously introduced and the new descriptors in the context of SVM-based classification and ranked-retrieval on 28 classification and retrieval problems derived from 18 datasets. Our experiments show that for both of these tasks, two of the four descriptors introduced in this paper along with the extended connectivity fingerprint based descriptors consistently and statistically outperform previously developed schemes based on the widely used fingerprint- and Maccs keys-based descriptors, as well as recently introduced descriptors obtained by mining and analyzing the structure of the molecular graphs."

In this paper, we present extensions of graph kernels for point clouds, which allow one to use kernel methods for such objects as shapes, line drawings, or any three-dimensional point clouds. In order to design rich and numerically efficient kernels with as few free parameters as possible, we use kernels between covariance matrices and their factorizations on probabilistic graphical models. We derive polynomial time dynamic programming recursions and present applications to recognition of handwritten digits and Chinese characters from few training examples."

BRENDA includes biochemical and molecular information on classification and nomenclature, reaction and specificity, functional parameters, occurrence, enzyme structure, application, engineering, stability, disease, isolation and preparation, links and literature references. The data are extracted and evaluated from approximately 46,000 references, which are linked to PubMed as long as the reference is cited in PubMed. In the past year BRENDA has undergone major changes including a large increase in updating speed with >50% of all data updated in 2002 or in the first half of 2003, the development of a new EC-tree browser, a taxonomy-tree browser, a chemical substructure search engine for ligand structure, the development of controlled vocabulary, an ontology for some information fields and a thesaurus for ligand names.

In this paper we investigate the problem of optimal compression of propositional Horn production rule knowledge bases. The standard approach to this problem, consisting in the removal of redundant rules from a knowledge base, leads to an \"irredundant\" but not necessarily optimal knowledge base. We prove here that the number of rules in any irredundant Horn knowledge base involving n propositional variables is at most n 0 1 times the minimum possible number of rules. In order to formalize the optimal compression problem, we define a Boolean function of a knowledge base as being the function whose set of true points is the set of models of the knowledge base. In this way the optimal compression of production rule knowledge bases becomes a problem of Boolean function minimization. In this paper we prove that the minimization of Horn functions (i.e. Boolean functions associated to Horn knowledge bases) is..."

Images are segmented thanks to the NCut method applied on a single image, and the disparity is computed from a pair of images. This segmentation enables us to keep only shapes of potential obstacles, by eliminating the background. The comparison between two graphs is accomplished with an inner product for graph, and then the recognition stage is performed learning is done among several pedestrian and non-pedestrian graphs with SVM method. The results that are depicted are preliminary results but they show that this approach is very promising since it clearly demonstrates that our graph representation is able to deal with the variability of pedestrian pose."

From the data, a quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) has been derived for 188 congeners. The main determinants of mutagenicity are the hydrophobicity (modeled by octanol/water partition coefficients) and the energies of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals calculated using the AM1 method. It is also shown that chemicals possessing three or more fused rings possess much greater mutagenic potency than compounds with one or two fused rings. Since the QSAR is based on a very wide range in structural variation, aromatic rings from benzene to coronene are included as well as many different types of heterocycles, it is a significant step toward a predictive toxicology of value in the design of less mutagenic bioactive compounds."
