The algorithm induces a grammar for the problem, along with a log-linear model that represents a distribution over syntactic and semantic analyses conditioned on the input sentence. We apply the method to the task of learning natural language interfaces to databases and show that the learned parsers outperform previous methods in two benchmark database domains."

More recently, the availability of large quantities of text on the Web has led to the development of machine learning approaches. However, to date these have mainly extracted ground facts, as opposed to general knowledge. Other learning approaches can extract logical forms, but require supervision and do not scale. In this paper we present an unsupervised approach to extracting semantic networks from large volumes of text. We use the TextRunner system [1] to extract tuples from text, and then induce general concepts and relations from them by jointly clustering the objects and relational strings in the tuples. Our approach is defined in Markov logic using four simple rules. Experiments on a dataset of two million tuples show that it outperforms three other relational clustering approaches, and extracts meaningful semantic networks."

This paper investigates synonym resolution in the context of unsupervised information extraction, where neither hand-tagged training examples nor domain knowledge is available. The paper presents a scalable, fully-implemented system that runs in O(KN log N) time in the number of extractions, N, and the maximum number of synonyms per word, K. The system, called RESOLVER, introduces a probabilistic relational model for predicting whether two strings are co-referential based on the similarity of the assertions containing them. On a set of two million assertions extracted from the Web, RESOLVER resolves objects with 78% precision and 68% recall, and resolves relations with 90% precision and 35% recall. Several variations of RESOLVER's probabilistic model are explored, and experiments demonstrate that under appropriate conditions these variations can improve F1 by 5%. An extension to the basic RESOLVER system allows it to handle polysemous names with 97% precision and 95% recall on a data set from the TREC corpus."

Some unsupervised approaches have been proposed (e.g., Haghighi and Klein (2007)), but they are less accurate. In this paper, we present the first unsupervised approach that is competitive with supervised ones. This is made possible by performing joint inference across mentions, in contrast to the pairwise classification typically used in supervised methods, and by using Markov logic as a representation language, which enables us to easily express relations like apposition and predicate nominals. On MUC and ACE datasets, our model outperforms Haghigi and Klein's one using only a fraction of the training data, and often matches or exceeds the accuracy of state-of-the-art supervised models."

A Markov logic network (MLN) is a first-order knowledge base with a weight attached to each formula (or clause). Together with a set of constants representing objects in the domain, it specifies a ground Markov network containing one feature for each possible grounding of a first-order formula in the KB, with the corresponding weight. Inference in MLNs is performed by MCMC over the minimal subset of the ground network required for answering the query. Weights are efficiently learned from relational databases by iteratively optimizing a pseudo-likelihood measure. Optionally, additional clauses are learned using inductive logic programming techniques. Experiments with a real-world database and knowledge base in a university domain illustrate the promise of this approach."

The lack of an extensively annotated corpus of this literature, however, causes a major bottleneck for applying NLP techniques. GENIA corpus is being developed to provide reference materials to let NLP techniques work for bio-textmining.\n\n\nRESULTS\nGENIA corpus version 3.0 consisting of 2000 MEDLINE abstracts has been released with more than 400,000 words and almost 100,000 annotations for biological terms."

Shifting to a new domain requires the user to name the target relations and to manually create new extraction rules or hand-tag new training examples. This manual labor scales linearly with the number of target relations. This paper introduces Open IE (OIE), a new extraction paradigm where the system makes a single data-driven pass over its corpus and extracts a large set of relational tuples without requiring any human input. The paper also introduces TEXTRUNNER, a fully implemented, highly scalable OIE system where the tuples are assigned a probability and indexed to support efficient extraction and exploration via user queries. We report on experiments over a 9,000,000 Web page corpus that compare TEXTRUNNER with KNOWITALL, a state-of-the-art Web IE system. TEXTRUNNER achieves an error reduction of 33% on a comparable set of extractions. Furthermore, in the amount of time it takes KNOWITALL to perform extraction for a handful of pre-specified relations, TEXTRUNNER extracts a far broader set of facts reflecting orders of magnitude more relations, discovered on the fly. We report statistics on TEXTRUNNER\u2019s 11,000,000 highest probability tuples, and show that they contain over 1,000,000 concrete facts and over 6,500,000more abstract assertions."

Manually-created lexicons have limited coverage and do not include most semantically contrasting word pairs. We present a new automatic and empirical measure of antonymy that combines corpus statistics with the structure of a published thesaurus. The approach is evaluated on a set of closest-opposite questions, obtaining a precision of over 80%. Along the way, we discuss what humans consider antonymous and how antonymy manifests itself in utterances."

                "text": "Reasoning with both probabilistic and deterministic dependencies is important for many real-world problems, and in particular for the emerging field of statistical relational learning. However, probabilistic inference methods like MCMC or belief propagation tend to give poor results when deterministic or near-deterministic dependencies are present, and logical ones like satisfiability testing are inapplicable to probabilistic ones. In this paper we propose MC-SAT, an inference algorithm that combines ideas from MCMC and satisfiability. MC-SAT is based on Markov logic, which defines Markov networks using weighted clauses in first-order logic. From the point of view of MCMC, MC-SAT is a slice sampler with an auxiliary variable per clause, and with a satisfiability-based method for sampling the original variables given the auxiliary ones. From the point of view of satisfiability, MCSAT wraps a procedure around the SampleSAT uniform sampler that enables it to sample from highly non-uniform distributions over satisfying assignments. Experiments on entity resolution and collective classification problems show that MC-SAT greatly outperforms Gibbs sampling and simulated tempering over a broad range of problem sizes and degrees of determinism."

The venturi scrubber has an adjustable throat characterized by the provision of structure to adjust the cross-sectional dimension of the gas passage at or adjacent to the throat section. The structure includes at least one movable baffle at the periphery of the gas passage, and a container. The container is disposed external to and contiguous with the baffle, and a controlled amount of a fluid is passed into the container so that the internal fluid pressure within the container, and resultant volumetric dimension of the container, and thereby also the resultant displacement of the baffle relative to the periphery of the throat section, are adjustable in proportion to a change in the flow rate of the inlet gas stream."
