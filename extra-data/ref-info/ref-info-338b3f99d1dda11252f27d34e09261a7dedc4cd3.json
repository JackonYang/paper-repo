Such a spatial relationship graph is often complemented by a more abstract graph, which provides information about the syntax (and the semantics) of the visual sentence in a more succinct form. As both representations are graphs, graph grammars are a natural means for defining the concrete and the abstract syntax of VLs. They can be used to generate syntax directed VL editors, which support \"free editing' and parsing of their underlying graph structures. Unfortunately, all efficiently working graph grammar parsing algorithms deal with restricted classes of context-free graph grammars only, while more general classes of graph grammars are necessary for defining many VLs. This motivated us to develop the notion of layeredcontext-sensitive graph grammars, together with a bottom-up/top-down parsing algorithm."

The parsing algorithm optimizes the posterior probability and outputs a scene representation as a \u201cparsing graph\u201d, in a spirit similar to parsing sentences in speech and natural language. The algorithm constructs the parsing graph and re-configures it dynamically using a set of moves, which are mostly reversible Markov chain jumps. This computational framework integrates two popular inference approaches\u2014generative (top-down) methods and discriminative (bottom-up) methods. The former formulates the posterior probability in terms of generative models for images defined by likelihood functions and priors. The latter computes discriminative probabilities based on a sequence (cascade) of bottom-up tests/filters. In our Markov chain algorithm design, the posterior probability, defined by the generative models, is the invariant (target) probability for the Markov chain, and the discriminative probabilities are used to construct proposal probabilities to drive the Markov chain. Intuitively, the bottom-up discriminative probabilities activate top-down generative models. In this paper, we focus on two types of visual patterns\u2014generic visual patterns, such as texture and shading, and object patterns including human faces and text. These types of patterns compete and cooperate to explain the image and so image parsing unifies image segmentation, object detection, and recognition (if we use generic visual patterns only then image parsing will correspond to image segmentation (Tu and Zhu, 2002. IEEE Trans. PAMI, 24(5):657\u2013673). We illustrate our algorithm on natural images of complex city scenes and show examples where image segmentation can be improved by allowing object specific knowledge to disambiguate low-level segmentation cues, and conversely where object detection can be improved by using generic visual patterns to explain away shadows and occlusions."

Firstly, it realizes traditional \"hypothesis-and-test\" methods through well-balanced Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) dynamics, thus it achieves robust and globally optimal solutions. Secondly, it utilizes data-driven (bottom-up) methods in computer vision, such as Hough transform and data clustering, to design effective transition probabilities for Markov chain dynamics. This drastically improves the effectiveness of traditional MCMC algorithms in terms of two standard metrics: \"burn-in\" period and \"mixing\" rate. The article proceeds in three steps. Firstly, we analyze the structures of the solution space /spl Omega/ for object recognition. /spl Omega/ is decomposed into a large number of subspaces of varying dimensions in a hierarchy. Secondly, we use data-driven techniques to compute importance proposal probabilities in these spaces, each expressed in a non-parametric form using weighted samples or particles. Thirdly, Markov chains are designed to travel in such heterogeneous structured solution space, with both jump and diffusion dynamics. We use possibly the simplest objects-the \"/spl Psi/-world\" as an example to illustrate the concepts, and we briefly present results on an application of traffic sign detection."

Two algorithms are implemented to perform the primitive extraction and syntax analysis at the same step by using both semantic and syntactic information, namely, the attributes and production rules.

We first conduct a theoretical study of the descriptive Markov random field model and the generative wavelet/sparse coding model from the perspective of entropy and complexity. The competition between the two types of models defines the concept of \"sketchability\", which divides image into texture and geometry. We then propose a primal sketch model that integrates the two models and, in addition, a Gestalt field model for spatial organization. We also propose a sketching pursuit process that coordinates the competition between two pursuit algorithms: the matching pursuit (Mallat and Zhang, 1993) and the filter pursuit (Zhu, et al., 1997), that seek to explain the image by bases and filters respectively. The model can be used to learn a dictionary of image primitives, or textons in Julesz's language, for natural images. The primal sketch model is not only parsimonious for image representation, but produces meaningful sketches over a large number of generic images."

These waveforms are chosen in order to best match the signal structures. Matching pursuits are general procedures to compute adaptive signal representations. With a dictionary of Gabor functions a matching pursuit defines an adaptive time-frequency transform. They derive a signal energy distribution in the time-frequency plane, which does not include interference terms, unlike Wigner and Cohen class distributions. A matching pursuit isolates the signal structures that are coherent with respect to a given dictionary. An application to pattern extraction from noisy signals is described. They compare a matching pursuit decomposition with a signal expansion over an optimized wavepacket orthonormal basis, selected with the algorithm of Coifman and Wickerhauser see (IEEE Trans.
