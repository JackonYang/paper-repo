This year a major innovation was introduced, as the traditional Main Task was replaced by a new task, similar to the RTE-5 Search Pilot, in which Textual Entailment is performed on a real corpus in the Update Summarization scenario. A subtask was also proposed, aimed at detecting novel information. To continue the effort of testing RTE in NLP applications, a KBP Validation Pilot Task was set up, in which RTE systems had to validate the output of systems participating in the KBP Slot Filling Task. Eighteen teams participated in the Main Task (48 submitted runs) and 9 in the Novelty Detection Subtask (22 submitted runs). As for the Pilot, 10 runs were submitted by 3 participants. Finally, the exploratory effort started in RTE-5 to perform resource evaluation through ablation tests was not only reiterated in RTE-6, but also extended to tools."

Another important innovation introduced in this campaign was a three-judgment task, which required the systems to make a further distinction between pairs where the entailment does not hold because the content of H is contradicted by the content of T, and pairs where the entailment cannot be determined because the truth of H cannot be verified on the basis of the content of T. A classic twoway task was also offered. RTE-4 attracted 26 teams, more than half of whom submitted runs for the new 3-way task. This paper describes the preparation of the dataset, and gives an overview of the results achieved by the participating systems."

A pilot task was also set up, aimed at differentiating unknown entailments from identified contradictions and providing justifications for overall system decisions. 26 participants submitted 44 runs, using different approaches and generally presenting new entailment models and achieving higher scores than in the previous challenges."

                "text": "Question answering (QA) is a task that deserves more collaboration between natural language processing (NLP) and knowledge representation (KR) communities, not only to introduce reasoning when looking for answers or making use of answer type taxonomies and encyclopaedic knowledge, but also, as discussed here, for answer validation (AV), that is to say, to decide whether the responses of a QA system are correct or not. This was one of the motivations for the first Answer Validation Exercise at CLEF 2006 (AVE 2006). The starting point for the AVE 2006 was the reformulation of the answer validation as a recognizing textual entailment (RTE) problem, under the assumption that a hypothesis can be automatically generated instantiating a hypothesis pattern with a QA system answer. The test collections that we developed in seven different languages at AVE 2006 are specially oriented to the development and evaluation of answer validation systems. We show in this article the methodology followed for developing these collections taking advantage of the human assessments already made in the evaluation of QA systems. We also propose an evaluation framework for AV linked to a QA evaluation track. We quantify and discuss the source of errors introduced by the reformulation of the answer validation problem in terms of textual entailment (around 2%, in the range of inter-annotator disagreement). We also show the evaluation results of the first answer validation exercise at CLEF 2006 where 11 groups have participated with 38 runs in seven different languages. The most extensively used techniques were Machine Learning and overlapping measures, but systems with broader knowledge resources and richer representation formalisms obtained the best results."

The main goal of KBP is to promote research in discovering facts about entities and expanding a structured knowledge base with this information. A large source collection of newswire and web documents is provided for systems to discover information. Attributes (a.k.a. \u201cslots\u201d) derived from Wikipedia infoboxes are used to create the reference knowledge base (KB). KBP2010 includes the following four tasks: (1) Regular Entity Linking, where names must be aligned to entities in the KB; (2) Optional Entity linking, without using Wikipedia texts; (3) Regular Slot Filling, which requires a system to automatically discover the attributes of specified entities from the source document collection and use them to expand the KB; (4) Surprise Slot Filling, which requires a system to return answers regarding new slot types within a short time period. KBP2010 has attracted many participants (over 45 teams registered for KBP 2010 (not including the RTEKBP Validation Pilot task), among which 23 teams submitted results). In this paper we provide an overview of the task definition and annotation challenges associated with KBP2010. Then we summarize the evaluation results and discuss the lessons that we have learned based on detailed analysis."
