In addition to the audio-visual content, text appearing in videos can serve as a powerful tool for semantic indexing and retrieval of videos. This paper proposes a method based on edge-features for horizontally aligned artificial Urdu text detection from video images. The system exploits edge based segmentation to extract textual content from videos. We first find the vertical gradients in the input video image and average the gradient magnitude in a fixed neighborhood of each pixel. The resulting image is binarized and the horizontal run length smoothing algorithm (RLSA) is applied to merge possible text regions. An edge density filter is then applied to eliminate noisy non-text regions. Finally, the candidate regions satisfying certain geometrical constraints are accepted as text regions. The proposed approach evaluated on a data set of 150 video images exhibited promising results."

This problem is challenging due to the complex background, the non-uniform illumination, the variations of text font, size and line orientation. In this paper, we present a hybrid approach to robustly detect and localize texts in natural scene images. A text region detector is designed to estimate the text existing confidence and scale information in image pyramid, which help segment candidate text components by local binarization. To efficiently filter out the non-text components, a conditional random field (CRF) model considering unary component properties and binary contextual component relationships with supervised parameter learning is proposed. Finally, text components are grouped into text lines/words with a learning-based energy minimization method. Since all the three stages are learning-based, there are very few parameters requiring manual tuning. Experimental results evaluated on the ICDAR 2005 competition dataset show that our approach yields higher precision and recall performance compared with state-of-the-art methods. We also evaluated our approach on a multilingual image dataset with promising results."

Unlike many other approaches which assume that text is horizontally-oriented, our method is able to handle text of arbitrary orientation. The input image is first filtered with Fourier-Laplacian. K-means clustering is then used to identify candidate text regions based on the maximum difference. The skeleton of each connected component helps to separate the different text strings from each other. Finally, text string straightness and edge density are used for false positive elimination. Experimental results show that the proposed method is able to handle graphics text and scene text of both horizontal and nonhorizontal orientation."

For the OCR of such documents we need to extract individual text lines from the documents. Extraction of individual text lines from multi-oriented and/or curved text document is a difficult problem. In this paper, we propose a novel method to extract individual text lines from such document pages and the method is based on the foreground and background information of the characters of the text. To take care of background information, water reservoir concept is used here. In the proposed scheme at first, individual components are detected and grouped into 3-character clusters using their inter-component distance, size and positional information. Applying concept of graph, initial 3-character clusters are merged to have larger cluster group. Using inter-character background information, orientations of the extreme characters of a larger cluster are decided and based on these orientation, two candidate regions are formed from the cluster. Finally, with the help of these candidate regions, individual lines are extracted. From the experiment, we obtained encouraging result."

However, there is still a lack of performance evaluation protocols for video text detection. In this paper, we propose an objective and comprehensive performance evaluation protocol for video text detection algorithms. The protocol includes a positive set and a negative set of indices at the textbox level, which evaluate the detection quality in terms of both location accuracy and fragmentation of the detected textboxes. In the protocol, we assign a detection difficulty (DD) level to each ground truth textbox. The performance indices can then be normalized with respect to the textbox DD level and are therefore tolerant to different ground-truth difficulties to a certain degree. We also assign a detectability index (DI) value to each ground-truth textbox. The overall detection rate is the DI-weighted average of the detection qualities of all ground-truth textboxes, which makes the detection rate more accurate to reveal the real performance. The automatic performance evaluation scheme has been applied to performance evaluation of a text detection approach to determine the best thresholds that can yield the best detection results. The protocol has also been employed to compare the performances of several text detection systems. Hence, we believe that the proposed protocol can be used to compare the performance of different video/image text detection algorithms/systems and can even help improve, select, and design new text detection methods."

Then a multiple stage verification scheme is adopted to discard false alarms and boost the precision rate. Secondly, a text polarity estimation algorithm is provided. Based on it, multiple frame enhancement is conducted to strengthen the contrast between text and its background. Finally, a connected component filtering method is proposed to generate clear segmentation results and improve recognition performance. Experimental results confirm that the proposed system is robust and efficient."

No external texture feature extraction module is used, but rather the intensities of the raw pixels that make up the textural pattern are fed directly to the SVM, which works well even in high-dimensional spaces. Next, text regions are identified by applying a continuously adaptive mean shift algorithm (CAMSHIFT) to the results of the texture analysis. The combination of CAMSHIFT and SVMs produces both robust and efficient text detection, as time-consuming texture analyses for less relevant pixels are restricted, leaving only a small part of the input image to be texture-analyzed."

A text string is modelled by a ridge at a coarse scale representing its center line and numerous short ridges at a smaller scale representing the skeletons of characters. Skeleton ridges have to satisfy geometrical and spatial constraints such as the perpendicularity or non-parallelism to the central ridge. In this way, we obtain a hierarchical description of text strings, which can provide direct input to an OCR or a text analysis system. The proposed method does not depend on a particular alphabet, it works with a wide variety in size of characters and does not depend on orientation of text string. The experimental results show a good detection."

The suggested operator is local and data dependent, which makes it fast and robust enough to eliminate the need for multi-scale computation or scanning windows. Extensive testing shows that the suggested scheme outperforms the latest published algorithms. Its simplicity allows the algorithm to detect texts in many fonts and languages."

We represent the pixels in a document image as random variables in an MRF, and introduce a new energy (or cost) function on these variables. Each variable takes a foreground or background label, and the quality of the binarization (or labelling) is determined by the value of the energy function. We minimize the energy function, i.e. find the optimal binarization, using an iterative graph cut scheme. Our model is robust to variations in foreground and background colours as we use a Gaussian Mixture Model in the energy function. In addition, our algorithm is efficient to compute, and adapts to a variety of document images. We show results on word images from the challenging ICDAR 2003 dataset, and compare our performance with previously reported methods. Our approach shows significant improvement in pixel level accuracy as well as OCR accuracy."

The main result is that the leading 2005 entry has improved significantly on the leading 2003 entry, with an increase in average f-score from 0.5 to 0.62, where the f-score is the same adapted information retrieval measure used for the 2003 competition. The paper also discusses the Web-based deployment and evaluation of text locating systems, and one of the leading entries has now been deployed in this way. This mode of usage could lead to more complete and more immediate knowledge of the strengths and weaknesses of each newly developed system."
