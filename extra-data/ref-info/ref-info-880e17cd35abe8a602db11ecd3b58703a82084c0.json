Running computer programs implement the methods and many examples illustrate their behavior. The input is a two-dimensional line-drawing of the scene, assumed to contain three-dimensional bodies possessing flat faces (polyhedra); some of them may be partially occluded. Suggestions are made for extending the work to curved objects. Some comparisons are made with human visual perception. The main conclusion is that it is possible to separate a picture or scene into the constituent objects exclusively on the basis of monocular geometric properties (on the basis of pure form); in fact, successful methods are shown."

The aim of this study is to determine valid constraints that are sufficient to allow surface orientation and distance (up to a multiplicative constant) to be computed from the image of surface texture and of surface contours. The report is in three parts. Part I consists of a review of major theories of surface perception, a discussion of vision as computation and of the nature in which three-dimensional information is manifest in the image, and a study of the representation of local surface orientation. Part II reconisiders the familiar 'texture gradient'. Part III examines our preception of surface contours. It is shown that surface contours are strong sources of information about local surface shape."

It is then argued that these computer programs for scene analysis offer the hope of providing a more adequate account of human competence in interpreting line drawings as polyhedra than do the current psychological theories. This thesis has several aspects. The one emphasized here is that those programs have explored a variety of methods of incorporating a priori knowledge of objects through the use of models. After outlining the range of models used, presenting a set of criteria for evaluating the use of model information, and sketching some psychological theories, the various proposals are contrasted. This discussion leads to two new proposals for exploiting model information that involve elaborations of an existing program, POLY."
