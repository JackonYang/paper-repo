An automatic way of processing a form should be preferred over the traditional methods due to high volume and numerous kinds of form documents. A system that minimizes operator error, cost and user interaction has to be developed. This paper proposes a system for automatically parsing form documents that have textual and nontextual components. The parser involves two parts. In the rst part, the form document goes through scan and preprocessing steps; then line extraction , vertex identiication and cell representation are carried out for geometric layout extraction. In the next part, content labelling among textual components, preprinted and user lled-in, is performed based on an unsupervised clustering. The presented system is shown to be robust by the performed experiments."

Based on the definition of form signature, we have proposed a similarity measure that is insensitive to translation, scaling, moderate skew (<5/spl deg/) and variations in the geometrical proportions of the form layout. This similarity measure also has a good tolerance to line detection errors. We have developed a prototype form retrieval system which has been tested on a database containing 100 different kinds of forms."

However, these approaches are applicable to only the same kind of documents because they are based on the paradigm that specifies the structure definition information in advance so as to be able to analyze a particular class of documents intelligently. In this paper, the authors propose a method to recognize the layout structures of multi-kinds of table-form document images. For this purpose, the authors introduce a classification tree to manage the relationships among different classes of layout structures. The authors' recognition system has two modes: layout knowledge acquisition and layout structure recognition. In the layout knowledge acquisition mode, table-form document images are distinguished according to this. Classification tree and then the structure description trees which specify the logical structures of table-form documents are generated automatically. While, in the layout structure recognition mode, individual item fields in the table-form document images are extracted and classified successfully by searching the classification tree and interpreting the structure description tree. >"

The outline of this method is described as follows. First, ruled lines are extracted from the input image of a form. After that, several lines are grouped as one to be recognised as data corresponding to a sub-form. These lines and sub-forms are both used for understanding the form, taking into account their feature attributes and the relationships between them. Each feature in the input image of a form is expected to correspond to a feature in one of the model forms, which are described as structured features. This correspondence is represented by a node in an association graph, where an arc represents compatible correspondences established on the basis of feature relationships. The best match is found as the largest maximal clique in the association graph. Experimental results show the method is robust and effective for document images of poor quality, and also for various styles of forms."

The proposed method represents the cell structure by the location of the center points of each cell. This representation allows the form identification to be realized by a process of matching the points in an input image to the points in registered forms. We have implemented the point matching process using the two-dimensional hash table. This implementation enables the system to robustly identify an input form even if it is skewed or deformed by a scanning process, and to reduce the time for the identification. Moreover, the similarity between two forms defined by the implementation can be used to evaluate the identification ability when a set of registered forms is specified. Experimental results show the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed technique."

Domain-specific as well as generic knowledge about document layout is used in order to classify, logically group, and determine the read-order of the individual blocks in the image, i.e., translate the physical structure of the document into a layout-independent logical structure. We have developed a computational model for the derivation of the logical structure of documents. Our model uses a rule-based control structure, as well as a hierarchical multi-level knowledge representation scheme in which knowledge about various types of documents is encoded into a document knowledge base and is used by reasoning processes to make inferences about the document. An important issue addressed in our research is the kind of domain knowledge that is required for such analysis. A document logical structure derivation system (DeLoS) has been developed based on the above model, and has achieved good results in deriving the logical structure of complex multi- articled documents such as newspaper pages. Applications of this approach include its use in information retrieval from digital libraries, as well as in comprehensive document understanding systems."

We describe an approach to the extraction of text, both typed and handwritten, from scanned and digitized images of filled-out forms. In decomposing a filled-out form into three basic components of boxes, line segments and the remainder (handwritten and typed characters, words, and logos), the method does not use a priori knowledge of form structure. The input binary image is first segmented into small and large connected components. Complex boxes are decomposed into elementary regions using an approach based on key-point analysis. Handwritten and machine-printed text that touches or overlaps guide lines and boxes are separated by removing lines. Characters broken by line removal are rejoined using a character patching method. Experimental results with filled-out forms, from several different domains (insurance, banking, tax, retail and postal) are given."

Most previous methods employ a line oriented approach. Real documents are copied repeatedly and overlaid with printed data, resulting in characters which touch cells and lines which are broken. BDR deals with regions directly, in contrast with other previous methods. Experimental tests show that BDR reliably recognizes cells and strings in document images with touching characters and broken lines."

The form modeling module builds explicit representations of scanned form templates to facilitate form recognition and dropout. It can also assist a user to define various fields on a form. The automatic form recognition eliminates the need for manually sorting input forms. The form dropout module effectively removes pre-printed form content to achieve a high data compression rate and to provide clean data for OCR. Our model-driven form dropout scheme has two major advantages over image-based subtraction methods in both dropout efficiency and quality preservation of filled-in data."

The method has the following characteristics: 1) a line-shared-adjacent (LSA) cell relation and a LSA format are proposed, and a topological format can be defined with the LSA format; 2) concepts of hierarchical class can be applied to the format, where a format unification operator is defined to create the hierarchy and can be used to generate a superclass format, and it also allows users to generate formats from scanned images; and 3) an LSA format can be converted into an equivalent line-oriented format that can be used for processing actual forms. Since the format consists of line connection information, the method is robust with respect to flaws of line segments extracted from the images. The method was applied to images of sample forms that have various flaws, and satisfying results were obtained."

Since some of the character strokes are either touching or crossing the form frames, we need to address the following three issues: (i) localization of form frames; (ii) separation between characters and form frames, and (ii) reconstruction of broken strokes introduced during separation. The form frame is automatically located by finding long straight lines based on a data structure, called block adjacency graph. Form frame removal and character reconstruction are implemented in this graph. When the same process is applied to a blank form, followed by the procedure of connected component extraction and clustering, a form structure-based template is automatically generated which includes form model, skew angle and preprinted data areas. Given the form template, our system can extract both handwritten and machine-typed filled-in data. Experimental results on three different types of forms demonstrate the performance of our system."

The paper describes an integrated real time system to read names and addresses on tax forms of the Internal Revenue Service of the United States. The Name and Address Block Reader (NABR) system accepts both machine printed and hand printed address block images as input. The application software has two major steps: document analysis (connected component analysis, address block extraction, label detection, hand print/machine print discrimination); and document recognition. Document recognition has two non identical streams for machine print and hand print; key steps are: address parsing, character recognition, word recognition and postal database lookup (ZIP+4 and City-State-ZIP files). Real time throughput (8,500 forms per hour) is achieved by employing a loosely coupled multiprocessing architecture. The functional architecture, software design, system architecture and hardware implementation are described. Performance evaluation on machine printed and handwritten addresses are presented."

One view of the distance between two trees T 1 and T 2 is that of a mapping. A mapping M from T 1 to T 2 is a partial one-to-one map from the nodes of T 1 to the nodes of T 2 that preserves the ancestor relations and the left-to-right ordering of the nodes. In 18] an algorithm is given that computes the distance between two ordered trees T 1 and T 2 in time O(jT 1 j jT 2 j min(depth(T 1); leaves(T 1)) min(depth(T 2); leaves(T 2))) and in space O(jT 1 j jT 2 j). In this paper we deene a new measure of the distance between two ordered trees T 1 and T 2 that is based on a restricted kind of mapping which we call structure respecting. In a structure respecting mapping M from T 1 to T 2 for all (v 1 ; w 1), (v 2 ; w 2), (v 3 ; w 3) 2 M the additional condition lca(v 1 ; v 2) = lca(v 1 ; v 3) () lca(w 1 ; w 2) = lca(w 1 ; w 3) holds, so that a structure respecting mapping preserves more of the structure of the trees involved than a general mapping. We then present a simple dynamic programming algorithm that computes a minimum cost structure respecting mapping between two ordered trees T 1 and T 2 in time O(degree(T 1)degree(T 2)jT 1 jjT 2 j) and in space O(degree(T 1)depth(T 1)jT 2 j)."

Binarization of scanned gray scale images is the first step in most document image analysis systems. Selection of an appropriate binarization method for an input image domain is a difficult problem. Typically, a human expert evaluates the binarized images according to his/her visual criteria. However, to conduct an objective evaluation, one needs to investigate how well the subsequent image analysis steps will perform on the binarized image. We call this approach goal-directed evaluation, and it can be used to evaluate other low-level image processing methods as well. Our evaluation of binarization methods is in the context of digit recognition, so we define the performance of the character recognition module as the objective measure. Eleven different locally adaptive binarization methods were evaluated, and Niblack's method gave the best performance."
