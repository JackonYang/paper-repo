In Bayesian image analysis, this requires fusing together local predictions for the class labels with a prior model of label images. Following the work of Bouman and Shapiro (1994), we consider the use of tree-structured belief networks (TSBNs) as prior models. The parameters in the TSBN are trained using a maximum-likelihood objective function with the EM algorithm and the resulting model is evaluated by calculating how efficiently it codes label images. A number of authors have used Gaussian mixture models to connect the label field to the image data. We compare this approach to the scaled-likelihood method of Smyth (1994) and Morgan and Bourlard (1995), where local predictions of pixel classification from neural networks are fused with the TSBN prior. Our results show a higher performance is obtained with the neural networks. We evaluate the classification results obtained and emphasize not only the maximum a posteriori segmentation, but also the uncertainty, as evidenced e.g., by the pixelwise posterior marginal entropies. We also investigate the use of conditional maximum-likelihood training for the TSBN and find that this gives rise to improved classification performance over the ML-trained TSBN."

The discriminative random fields offer several advantages over the conventional Markov random field (MRF) framework. First, the DRFs allow to relax the strong assumption of conditional independence of the observed data generally used in the MRF framework for tractability. This assumption is too restrictive for a large number of applications in vision. Second, the DRFs derive their classification power by exploiting the probabilistic discriminative models instead of the generative models used in the MRF framework. Finally, all the parameters in the DRF model are estimated simultaneously from the training data unlike the MRF framework where likelihood parameters are usually learned separately from the field parameters. We illustrate the advantages of the DRFs over the MRF framework in an application of man-made structure detection in natural images taken from the Corel database."

We generate a synthetic world of scenes and their corresponding rendered images, modeling their relationships with a Markov network.

We call this approach VISTA\u2014Vision by Image/Scene TrAining.We apply VISTA to the \u201csuper-resolution\u201d problem (estimating high frequency details from a low-resolution image), showing good results. To illustrate the potential breadth of the technique, we also apply it in two other problem domains, both simplified. We learn to distinguish shading from reflectance variations in a single image under particular lighting conditions. For the motion estimation problem in a \u201cblobs world\u201d, we show figure/ground discrimination, solution of the aperture problem, and filling-in arising from application of the same probabilistic machinery."

The first is the Sowerby dataset, which contains one hundred colour photographs of country roads in England that have been interactively segmented and classified into six classes-edge, vegetation, air, road, building, and other. The second domain is a set of thirty five-images, taken in San Francisco, which have been interactively segmented into similar classes. In each domain we learn the joint probability distributions of filter responses, based on colour and texture, for each class. These distributions are then used for classification. We restrict ourselves to a limited number of filters in order to ensure that the learnt filter responses do not overfit the training data (our region classes are chosen so as to ensure that there is enough data to avoid over fitting). We do performance analysis on the two datasets by evaluating the false positive and false negative error rates for the classification. This shows that the learnt models achieve high accuracy in classifying individual pixels into those classes for which the filter responses are approximately spatially homogeneous (i.e. road, vegetation, and air but not edge and building). A more sensitive performance measure, the Chernoff information, is calculated in order to quantify how well the cues for edge and building are doing. This demonstrates that statistical knowledge of the domain is a powerful tool for segmentation."

Conditional random fields also avoid a fundamental limitation of maximum entropy Markov models (MEMMs) and other discriminative Markov models based on directed graphical models, which can be biased towards states with few successor states. We present iterative parameter estimation algorithms for conditional random fields and compare the performance of the resulting models to HMMs and MEMMs on synthetic and natural-language data."

Although this approach performs well, it has a number of disadvantages. In particular, exact MAP estimates cannot be computed, approximate MAP estimates are computationally expensive to compute, and unsupervised parameter estimation of the MRF is difficult. The authors propose a new approach to Bayesian image segmentation that directly addresses these problems. The new method replaces the MRF model with a novel multiscale random field (MSRF) and replaces the MAP estimator with a sequential MAP (SMAP) estimator derived from a novel estimation criteria. Together, the proposed estimator and model result in a segmentation algorithm that is not iterative and can be computed in time proportional to MN where M is the number of classes and N is the number of pixels. The also develop a computationally efficient method for unsupervised estimation of model parameters. Simulations on synthetic images indicate that the new algorithm performs better and requires much less computation than MAP estimation using simulated annealing. The algorithm is also found to improve classification accuracy when applied to the segmentation of multispectral remotely sensed images with ground truth data."

The PEDT is a probabilistic model for images that improves on the dynamic tree by allowing the positions of objects to play a part in the model. This increases the flexibility of the model over the dynamic tree and allows the positions of objects to be located and manipulated. This paper motivates and defines this form of probabilistic model using the belief network formalism. A structured variational approach for inference and learning in the PEDT is developed, and the resulting variational updates are obtained, along with additional implementation considerations that ensure the computational cost scales linearly in the number of nodes of the belief network. The PEDT model is demonstrated and compared with the dynamic tree and fixed tree. The structured variational learning method is compared with mean field approaches."

Pixel gray levels and the presence and orientation of edges are viewed as states of atoms or molecules in a lattice-like physical system. The assignment of an energy function in the physical system determines its Gibbs distribution. Because of the Gibbs distribution, Markov random field (MRF) equivalence, this assignment also determines an MRF image model. The energy function is a more convenient and natural mechanism for embodying picture attributes than are the local characteristics of the MRF. For a range of degradation mechanisms, including blurring, nonlinear deformations, and multiplicative or additive noise, the posterior distribution is an MRF with a structure akin to the image model. By the analogy, the posterior distribution defines another (imaginary) physical system. Gradual temperature reduction in the physical system isolates low energy states (``annealing''), or what is the same thing, the most probable states under the Gibbs distribution. The analogous operation under the posterior distribution yields the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the image given the degraded observations. The result is a highly parallel ``relaxation'' algorithm for MAP estimation. We establish convergence properties of the algorithm and we experiment with some simple pictures, for which good restorations are obtained at low signal-to-noise ratios."

We present a context-based vision system for place and object recognition. The goal is to identify familiar locations (e.g., office 610, conference room 941, main street), to categorize new environments (office, corridor, street) and to use that information to provide contextual priors for object recognition (e.g., tables are more likely in an office than a street). We present a low-dimensional global image representation that provides relevant information for place recognition and categorization, and show how such contextual information introduces strong priors that simplify object recognition. We have trained the system to recognize over 60 locations (indoors and outdoors) and to suggest the presence and locations of more than 20 different object types. The algorithm has been integrated into a mobile system that provides realtime feedback to the user."

This way of combining individual expert models makes it hard to generate samples from the combined model but easy to infer the values of the latent variables of each expert, because the combination rule ensures that the latent variables of different experts are conditionally independent when given the data. A product of experts (PoE) is therefore an interesting candidate for a perceptual system in which rapid inference is vital and generation is unnecessary. Training a PoE by maximizing the likelihood of the data is difficult because it is hard even to approximate the derivatives of the renormalization term in the combination rule. Fortunately, a PoE can be trained using a different objective function called contrastive divergence whose derivatives with regard to the parameters can be approximated accurately and efficiently. Examples are presented of contrastive divergence learning using several types of expert on several types of data."

                "text": "We present a distribution model for binary vectors, called the influence combination model and show how this model can be used as the basis for unsupervised learning algorithms for feature selection. The model can be represented by a particular type of Boltzmann machine with a bipartite graph structure that we call the combination machine. This machine is closely related to the Harmonium model defined by Smolensky. In the first part of the paper we analyze properties of this distribution representation scheme. We show that arbitrary distributions of binary vectors can be approximated by the combination model. We show how the weight vectors in the model can be interpreted as high order correlation patterns among the input bits, and how the combination machine can be used as a mechanism for detecting these patterns. We compare the combination model with the mixture model and with principle component analysis. In the second part of the paper we present two algorithms for learning the combination model from examples. The first learning algorithm is the standard gradient ascent heuristic for computing maximum likelihood estimates for the parameters of the model. Here we give a closed form for this gradient that is significantly easier to compute than the corresponding gradient for the general Boltzmann machine. The second learning algorithm is a greedy method that creates the hidden units and computes their weights one at a time. This method is a variant of projection pursuit density estimation. In the third part of the paper we give experimental results for these learning methods on synthetic data and on natural data of handwritten digit images."
