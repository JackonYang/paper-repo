The max-product algorithm, also known as the max-plus or min-sum algorithm, is an iterative method for (approximately) solving such a problem on graphs with cycles. We provide a novel perspective on the algorithm, which is based on the idea of reparameterizing the distribution in terms of so-called pseudo-max-marginals on nodes and edges of the graph. This viewpoint provides conceptual insight into the max-product algorithm in application to graphs with cycles. First, we prove the existence of max-product fixed points for positive distributions on arbitrary graphs. Next, we show that the approximate max-marginals computed by max-product are guaranteed to be consistent, in a suitable sense to be defined, over every tree of the graph. We then turn to characterizing the nature of the approximation to the MAP assignment computed by max-product. We generalize previous work by showing that for any graph, the max-product assignment satisfies a particular optimality condition with respect to any subgraph containing at most one cycle per connected component. We use this optimality condition to derive upper bounds on the difference between the log probability of the true MAP assignment, and the log probability of a max-product assignment. Finally, we consider extensions of the max-product algorithm that operate over higher-order cliques, and show how our reparameterization analysis extends in a natural manner."

In particular, MAP inference in MRF is equivalent to the weighted (maxsum) CSP. A well-known tool to tackle CSPs are arc consistency algorithms, a.k.a. relaxation labeling. A promising approach to MAP inference in MRFs is linear programming relaxation solved by sequential treereweighted message passing (TRW-S). There is a not widely known algorithm equivalent to TRW-S, max-sum diffusion, which is slower but very simple. We give two theoretical results. First, we show that arc consistency algorithms and max-sum diffusion become the same thing if formulated in an abstractalgebraic way. Thus, we argue that max-sum arc consistency algorithm or max-sum relaxation labeling is a more suitable name for max-sum diffusion. Second, we give a criterion that strictly decreases during these algorithms. It turns out that every class of equivalent problems contains a unique problem that is minimal w.r.t. this criterion."

This combination leads to a log-determinant maximization problem that can be solved by efficient interior point methods [8]. As with the Bethe approximation and its generalizations [12], the optimizing arguments of this problem can be taken as approximations to the exact marginals. In contrast to Bethe/Kikuchi approaches, our variational problem is strictly convex and so has a unique global optimum. An additional desirable feature is that the value of the optimal solution is guaranteed to provide an upper bound on the log partition function. In experimental trials, the performance of the log-determinant relaxation is comparable to or better than the sum-product algorithm, and by a substantial margin for certain problem classes. Finally, the zero-temperature limit of our log-determinant relaxation recovers a class of well-known semidefinite relaxations for integer programming [e.g., 3]."

We describe a novel connection between this problem and the supermodular function maximization problem (which is dual to the submodular function minimization problem). Using this connection, we are able to identify large classes of efficiently solvable subproblems of Max CSP arising from certain restrictions on the constraint types. Until now, the only known polynomial-time solvable cases for this form of optimization problem were restricted to constraints over a 2-valued (Boolean) domain. Here we obtain the first examples of general families of efficiently solvable cases of Max CSP for arbitrary finite domains, by considering supermodular functions on finite lattices. Finally, we show that the equality constraint over a non-Boolean domain is non-supermodular, and, when combined with some simple unary constraints, gives rise to cases of Max CSP which are hard even to approximate."

                "text": "We consider approximation algorithms for the metric labeling problem. This problem was introduced in a recent paper by Kleinberg and Tardos [20], and captures many classification problems that arise in computer vision and related fields. They gave an &Ogr;(log k log log k) approximation for the general case where k is the number of labels and a 2-approximation for the uniform metric case. More recently, Gupta and Tardos [15] gave a 4-approximation for the truncated linear metric, a natural non-uniform metric motivated by practical applications to image restoration and visual correspondence. In this paper we introduce a natural integer programming formulation and show that the integrality gap of its linear relaxation either matches or improves the ratios known for several cases of the metric labeling problem studied until now, providing a unified approach to solving them. In particular, we show that the integrality gap of our LP is bounded by &Ogr;(log k log log k) for general metric and 2 for the uniform metric thus matching the ratios in [20]. We also develop an algorithm based on our LP that achieves a ratio of 2 + \u221a2 \u2243 3.414 for the truncated linear metric improving the ratio given in [15]. Our algorithm uses the fact that the integrality gap of our LP is 1 on a linear metric. We believe that our formulation has the potential to provide improved approximation algorithms for the general case and other useful special cases. Finally, our formulation admits general non-metric distance functions. This leads to a non-trivial approximation guarantee for a non-metric case that arises in practice [21], namely the truncated quadratic distance function. We note here that there are non-metric distance functions for which no bounded approximation ratio is achievable."

By decomposing the original distribution into a convex combination of tree-structured distributions, we obtain an upper bound on the optimal value of the original problem (i.e., the log probability of the MAP assignment) in terms of the combined optimal values of the tree problems. We prove that this upper bound is tight if and only if all the tree distributions share an optimal configuration in common. An important implication is that any such shared configuration must also be a MAP configuration for the original distribution. Next we develop two approaches to attempting to obtain tight upper bounds: a) a tree-relaxed linear program (LP), which is derived from the Lagrangian dual of the upper bounds; and b) a tree-reweighted max-product message-passing algorithm that is related to but distinct from the max-product algorithm. In this way, we establish a connection between a certain LP relaxation of the mode-finding problem and a reweighted form of the max-product (min-sum) message-passing algorithm."

This quantity plays an important role in various contexts, including approximating marginal distributions, parameter estimation, combinatorial enumeration, statistical decision theory, and large-deviations bounds. Our derivation is based on concepts from convex duality and information geometry: in particular, it exploits mixtures of distributions in the exponential domain, and the Legendre mapping between exponential and mean parameters. In the special case of convex combinations of tree-structured distributions, we obtain a family of variational problems, similar to the Bethe variational problem, but distinguished by the following desirable properties: i) they are convex, and have a unique global optimum; and ii) the optimum gives an upper bound on the log partition function. This optimum is defined by stationary conditions very similar to those defining fixed points of the sum-product algorithm, or more generally, any local optimum of the Bethe variational problem. As with sum-product fixed points, the elements of the optimizing argument can be used as approximations to the marginals of the original model. The analysis extends naturally to convex combinations of hypertree-structured distributions, thereby establishing links to Kikuchi approximations and variants."

By decomposing the original distribution into a convex combination of tree-structured distributions, we obtain an upper bound on the optimal value of the original problem (i.e., the log probability of the MAP assignment) in terms of the combined optimal values of the tree problems. We prove that this upper bound is tight if and only if all the tree distributions share an optimal configuration in common. An important implication is that any such shared configuration must also be a MAP configuration for the original distribution. Next we develop two approaches to attempting to obtain tight upper bounds: (a) a {\\em tree-relaxed linear program} (LP), which is derived from the Lagrangian dual of the upper bounds; and (b) a {\\em tree-reweighted max-product message-passing algorithm} that is related to but distinct from the max-product algorithm. In this way, we establish a connection between a certain LP relaxation of the mode-finding problem, and a reweighted form of the max-product (min-sum) message-passing algorithm."

A soft constraint is a function defined on a collection of variables which associates some measure of desirability with each possible combination of values for those variables. However, the crucial question of the computational complexity of finding the optimal solution to a collection of soft constraints has so far received very little attention. In this paper we identify a class of soft binary constraints for which the problem of finding the optimal solution is tractable. In other words, we show that for any given set of such constraints, there exists a polynomial time algorithm to determine the assignment having the best overall combined measure of desirability. This tractable class includes many commonly-occurring soft constraints, such as 'as near as possible' or 'as soon as possible after', as well as crisp constraints such as 'greater than'. Finally, we show that this tractable class is maximal, in the sense that adding any other form of soft binary constraint which is not in the class gives rise to a class of problems which is NP-hard."

For a TRW fixed point satisfying the strong tree agreement condition, the algorithm outputs a configuration that is provably optimal. In this paper, we focus on the case of binary variables with pairwise couplings, and establish stronger properties of TRW fixed points that satisfy only the milder condition of weak tree agreement (WTA). First, we demonstrate how it is possible to identify part of the optimal solution\u2014i.e., a provably optimal solution for a subset of nodes\u2014 without knowing a complete solution. Second, we show that for submodular functions, a WTA fixed point always yields a globally optimal solution. We establish that for binary variables, any WTA fixed point always achieves the global maximum of the linear programming relaxation underlying the TRW method."

In a general graphical model this problem is NP hard, but various approximate algorithms have been developed. Linear programming (LP) relaxations are a standard method in computer science for approximating combinatorial problems and have been used for finding the most probable assignment in small graphical models. However, applying this powerful method to real-world problems is extremely challenging due to the large numbers of variables and constraints in the linear program. Tree-Reweighted Belief Propagation is a promising recent algorithm for solving LP relaxations, but little is known about its running time on large problems. \n \nIn this paper we compare tree-reweighted belief propagation (TRBP) and powerful general-purpose LP solvers (CPLEX) on relaxations of real-world graphical models from the fields of computer vision and computational biology. We find that TRBP almost always finds the solution significantly faster than all the solvers in CPLEX and more importantly, TRBP can be applied to large scale problems for which the solvers in CPLEX cannot be applied. Using TRBP we can find the MAP configurations in a matter of minutes for a large range of real world problems."

Though in general solving MRFs is NP-hard, we propose a second order cone programming relaxation scheme which solves a closely related (convex) approximation. In terms of computational efficiency, our method significantly outperforms the semidefinite relaxations previously used whilst providing equally (or even more) accurate results. Unlike popular inference schemes such as Belief Propagation and Graph Cuts, convergence is guaranteed within a small number of iterations. Furthermore, we also present a method for greatly reducing the runtime and increasing the accuracy of our approach for a large and useful class of MRFs. We compare our approach with the state-of-the-art methods for subgraph matching and object recognition and demonstrate significant improvements."

In computer vision and pattern recognition, the crisp CSP is more known as the consistent labeling problem and certain soft CSPs as certain inference problems in Markov Random Fields. Many soft CSPs can be seen as special cases of the semiring-based CSP (SCSP), using two abstract operations that form a semiring. A fundamental concept to tackle the CSP, as well as the SCSPs with idempotent semiring multiplication, are arc consistency algorithms, also known as relaxation labeling. Attempts have been made to generalize arc consistency for soft CSPs with non-idempotent semiring multiplication. We achieve such generalization by generalizing max-sum diffusion of Kovalevsky and Koval, used to decrease Schlesinger\u2019s upper bound on the max-sum CSP. We formulate the proposed generalized arc consistency in the semiring framework. Newly, we introduce sum-product arc consistency and give its relation to max-sum arc consistency and optimal max-sum arc consistency."

We show that Latin square puzzles, finding N-ary relations, graph or auto-mata homomorphisms, graph colorings, as well as determining satisfiability of propositional logic statements and solving scene and edge labeling problems, are all special cases of the general consistent labeling problem. We then discuss the various approaches that researchers have used to speed up the tree search required to find consistent labelings. Each of these approaches uses a particular look-ahead operator to help eliminate backtracking in the tree search. Finally, we define the \u00bfKP two-parameter class of look-ahead operators which includes, as special cases, the operators other researchers have used."

Four equivalent problems are discussed\u2014the primal, the \u2018complementation\u2019, the \u2018discrete Rhys LP\u2019 and the \u2018weighted stability problem of a SAM graph\u2019. Each of them has a relaxation\u2014the \u2018roof dual\u2019, the \u2018quadratic complementation,\u2019 the \u2018continuous Rhys LP\u2019 and the \u2018fractional weighted stability problem of a SAM graph\u2019. The main result is that the four gaps associated with the four relaxations are equal. Furthermore, a solution to any of these problems leads at once to solutions of the other three equivalent ones. The four relaxations can be solved in polynomial time by transforming them to a bipartite maximum flow problem. The optimal solutions of the \u2018roof-dual\u2019 define \u2018best\u2019 linear majorantsp(x) off, having the following persistency property: if theith coefficient inp is positive (negative) thenxi=1 (0) in every optimum of the primal problem. Several characterizations are given for the case where these persistency results cannot be used to fix any variable of the primal. On the other hand, a class of gap-free functions (properly including the supermodular ones) is exhibited."

A solution is an assignment of a value to each variable from its domain such that all the constraints are satis ed. Typical constraint satisfaction problems are to determine whether a solution exists, to nd one or all solutions and to nd an optimal solution relative to a given cost function. An example of a constraint satisfaction problem is the well known k-colorability. The problem is to color, if possible, a given graph with k colors only, such that any two adjacent nodes have di erent colors. A constraint satisfaction formulation of this problem associates the nodes of the graph with variables, the possible colors are their domains and the inequality constraints between adjacent nodes are the constraints of the problem. Each constraint of a csp may be expressed as a relation, de ned on some subset of variables, denoting their legal combinations of values. As well, constraints"

Although this problems are NP-complete in general it is well known that they are easy solvable if the underlying graph is a tree or even a partial m-tree (i.e its treewidth is m). On the other hand the underlying graphs arising in image analysis are often lattices or even fully connected. In this paper we study a special class of consistent labeling problems where the label set is ordered and the predicates preserve some structure derived from this ordering. We show that consistent labeling can be solved in polynomial time in this case even for fully connected graphs. Then we generalize this result to the \"MaxMin\" problem on labeled graphs and show how to solve it if the similarity functions preserve the same structure."

This paper shows that NP-complete problems can be summarized by at least one \"order parameter\", and that the hard problems occur at a critical value of such a parameter. This critical value separates two regions of characteristically different properties. For example, for K-colorability, the critical value separates overconstrained from underconstrained random graphs, and it marks the value at which the probability of a solution changes abruptly from near 0 to near 1. It is the high density of well-separated almost solutions (local minima) at this boundary that cause search algorithms to \"thrash\". This boundary is a type of phase transition and we show that it is preserved under mappings between problems. We show that for some P problems either there is no phase transition or it occurs for bounded N (and so bounds the cost). These results suggest a way of deciding if a problem is in P or NP and why they are different."

This class of problems is known to be NP-complete in general, but certain restrictions on the form of the constraints can ensure tractability. Here we show that any set of relations used to specify the allowed forms of constraints can be associated with a finite universal algebra and we explore how the computational complexity of the corresponding constraint satisfaction problem is connected to the properties of this algebra. Hence, we completely translate the problem of classifying the complexity of restricted constraint satisfaction problems into the language of universal algebra. \nWe introduce a notion of \"tractable algebra,\" and investigate how the tractability of an algebra relates to the tractability of the smaller algebras which may be derived from it, including its subalgebras and homomorphic images. This allows us to reduce significantly the types of algebras which need to be classified. Using our results we also show that if the decision problem associated with a given collection of constraint types can be solved efficiently, then so can the corresponding search problem. We then classify all finite strictly simple surjective algebras with respect to tractability, obtaining a dichotomy theorem which generalizes Schaefer's dichotomy for the generalized satisfiability problem. Finally, we suggest a possible general algebraic criterion for distinguishing the tractable and intractable cases of the constraint satisfaction problem."

Working within the framework of exponential families, we describe an alternative view, in which the optimization takes place over the (typically) much lowerdimensional space of mean parameters. The associated constraint set consists of all mean parameters that are globally realizable; for discrete random variables, we refer to this set as a marginal polytope. As opposed to the classical formulation, the representation given here clarifies that there are two distinct components to variational inference algorithms: (a) an approximation to the entropy function; and (b) an approximation to the marginal polytope. This viewpoint clarifies the essential ingredients of known variational methods, and also suggests novel relaxations. Taking the \u201czero-temperature limit\u201d recovers a variational representation for MAP computation as a linear program (LP) over the marginal polytope. For trees, the max-product updates are a dual method for solving this LP, which provides a variational viewpoint that unifies the sum-product and max-product algorithms."

We also consider the uses of our bounds for the problem of maximum likelihood (ML) parameter estimation. For a completely observed model, our analysis gives rise to a concave lower bound on the log likelihood of the data. Maximizing this lower bound yields an approximate ML estimate which, in analogy to the moment-matching of exact ML estimation, can be interpreted in terms of pseudo-moment-matching. We present preliminary results illustrating the behavior of this approximate ML estimator."

This class includes the belief propagation (BP) or sum-product algorithm as well as variations and extensions of BP. Algorithms in this class can be formulated as a sequence of reparameterization updates, each of which entails refactorizing a portion of the distribution corresponding to an acyclic subgraph (i.e., a tree, or more generally, a hypertree). The ultimate goal is to obtain an alternative but equivalent factorization using functions that represent (exact or approximate) marginal distributions on cliques of the graph. Our framework highlights an important property of the sum-product algorithm and the larger class of reparameterization algorithms: the original distribution on the graph with cycles is not changed. The perspective of tree-based updates gives rise to a simple and intuitive characterization of the fixed points in terms of tree consistency. We develop interpretations of these results in terms of information geometry. The invariance of the distribution, in conjunction with the fixed-point characterization, enables us to derive an exact expression for the difference between the true marginals on an arbitrary graph with cycles, and the approximations provided by belief propagation. More broadly, our analysis applies to any algorithm that minimizes the Bethe free energy. We also develop bounds on the approximation error, which illuminate the conditions that govern their accuracy. Finally, we show how the reparameterization perspective extends naturally to generalizations of BP (e.g., Kikuchi (1951) approximations and variants) via the notion of hypertree reparameterization."

The algorithm employs a scaling scheme that uses a flow in the complete directed graph on the underlying set with each arc capacity equal to the scaled parameter. The resulting algorithm runs in time bounded by a polynomial in the size of the underlying set and the length of the largest absolute function value. The paper also presents a strongly polynomial version in which the number of steps is bounded by a polynomial in the size of the underlying set, independent of the function values."

Each of these techniques constructs a graph such that the minimum cut on the graph also minimizes the energy. Yet, because these graph constructions are complex and highly specific to a particular energy function, graph cuts have seen limited application to date. In this paper, we give a characterization of the energy functions that can be minimized by graph cuts. Our results are restricted to functions of binary variables. However, our work generalizes many previous constructions and is easily applicable to vision problems that involve large numbers of labels, such as stereo, motion, image restoration, and scene reconstruction. We give a precise characterization of what energy functions can be minimized using graph cuts, among the energy functions that can be written as a sum of terms containing three or fewer binary variables. We also provide a general-purpose construction to minimize such an energy function. Finally, we give a necessary condition for any energy function of binary variables to be minimized by graph cuts. Researchers who are considering the use of graph cuts to optimize a particular energy function can use our results to determine if this is possible and then follow our construction to create the appropriate graph. A software implementation is freely available."

An additional convex relaxation of the quadratic approximation is shown to have additive approximation guarantees that apply even when the graph weights have mixed sign or do not come from a metric. The approximations are extended in a manner that allows tight variational relaxations of the MAP problem, although they generally involve non-convex optimization. Experiments carried out on synthetic data show that the quadratic approximations can be more accurate and computationally efficient than the linear programming and propagation based alternatives."

Graphical models have become a focus of research in many statistical, computational and mathematical fields, including bioinformatics, communication theory, statistical physics, combinatorial optimization, signal and image processing, information retrieval and statistical machine learning. Many problems that arise in specific instances \u2014 including the key problems of computing marginals and modes of probability distributions \u2014 are best studied in the general setting. Working with exponential family representations, and exploiting the conjugate duality between the cumulant function and the entropy for exponential families, we develop general variational representations of the problems of computing likelihoods, marginal probabilities and most probable configurations. We describe how a wide variety of algorithms \u2014 among them sum-product, cluster variational methods, expectation-propagation, mean field methods, max-product and linear programming relaxation, as well as conic programming relaxations \u2014 can all be understood in terms of exact or approximate forms of these variational representations. The variational approach provides a complementary alternative to Markov chain Monte Carlo as a general source of approximation methods for inference in large-scale statistical models."

The major restriction is that the energy function's smoothness term must only involve pairs of pixels. We propose two algorithms that use graph cuts to compute a local minimum even when very large moves are allowed. The first move we consider is an /spl alpha/-/spl beta/-swap: for a pair of labels /spl alpha/,/spl beta/, this move exchanges the labels between an arbitrary set of pixels labeled a and another arbitrary set labeled /spl beta/. Our first algorithm generates a labeling such that there is no swap move that decreases the energy. The second move we consider is an /spl alpha/-expansion: for a label a, this move assigns an arbitrary set of pixels the label /spl alpha/. Our second algorithm, which requires the smoothness term to be a metric, generates a labeling such that there is no expansion move that decreases the energy. Moreover, this solution is within a known factor of the global minimum. We experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on image restoration, stereo and motion."

We found that the quality of the LP-relaxation is a direct function of the underlying constrainedness of the combinatorial problem. More specifically, we identify a novel phase transition phenomenon in the solution integrality of the relaxation. The solution quality of approximation schemes degrades substantially near phase transition boundaries. Our findings are consistent over a range of LP-based approximation schemes. We also provide results on the extent to which LP relaxations can provide a global perspective of the search space and therefore be used as a heuristic to guide a complete solver."

The consistent la- belling problem and its appropriate fuzzy and probabilistic modifications became a proper formalism for a unified for- mulation of such problems regardless of their specific applied contents. On the other hand there is no formal construction for a unified solution of these problems because they proved to be not polynomially solvable. Despite of the complexity of the whole class of labelling problems there are rather wide subclasses of applied interest which are polynomially solvable. In this paper we describe several examples of such subclasses of labelling problems. All these subclasses have a common property: It is possible to introduce several mechanisms of equivalent transforma- tions of the problems. The algorithm solving a problem has then the form of succesive equivalent transformations of the initial problem until it turns into a problem with a quite evi- dent solution."

The framework is based on a semiring structure, where the set of the semiring specifies the values to be associated with each tuple of values of the variable domain, and the two semiring operations (+ and X) model constraint projection and combination respectively. Local consistency algorithms, as usually used for classical CSPs, can be exploited in this general framework as well, provided that certain conditions on the semiring operations are satisfied. We then show how this framework can be used to model both old and new constraint solving and optimization schemes, thus allowing one to both formally justify many informally taken choices in existing schemes, and to prove that local consistency techniques can be used also in newly defined schemes."

Known techniques include graph cuts, belief propagation (BP) and recently introduced tree-reweighted message passing (TRW). So far, the standard benchmark for their comparison has been a 4-connected grid-graph arising in pixel-labelling stereo. This minimization problem, however, has been largely solved: recent work shows that for many scenes TRW finds the global optimum. Furthermore, it is known that a 4-connected grid-graph is a poor stereo model since it does not take occlusions into account. \n \nWe propose the problem of stereo with occlusions as a new test bed for minimization algorithms. This is a more challenging graph since it has much larger connectivity, and it also serves as a better stereo model. An attractive feature of this problem is that increased connectivity does not result in increased complexity of message passing algorithms. Indeed, one contribution of this paper is to show that sophisticated implementations of BP and TRW have the same time and memory complexity as that of 4-connected grid-graph stereo. \n \nThe main conclusion of our experimental study is that for our problem graph cut outperforms both TRW and BP considerably. TRW achieves consistently a lower energy than BP. However, as connectivity increases the speed of convergence of TRW becomes slower. Unlike 4-connected grids, the difference between the energy of the best optimization method and the lower bound of TRW appears significant. This shows the hardness of the problem and motivates future research."

The belief propagation (BP) algorithm is an efficient way to solve these problems that is exact when the factor graph is a tree, but only approximate when the factor graph has cycles. We show that BP fixed points correspond to the stationary points of the Bethe approximation of the free energy for a factor graph. We explain how to obtain region-based free energy approximations that improve the Bethe approximation, and corresponding generalized belief propagation (GBP) algorithms. We emphasize the conditions a free energy approximation must satisfy in order to be a \"valid\" or \"maxent-normal\" approximation. We describe the relationship between four different methods that can be used to generate valid approximations: the \"Bethe method\", the \"junction graph method\", the \"cluster variation method\", and the \"region graph method\". Finally, we explain how to tell whether a region-based approximation, and its corresponding GBP algorithm, is likely to be accurate, and describe empirical results showing that GBP can significantly outperform BP."

                "text": "One of the most exciting advances in early vision has been the development of efficient energy minimization algorithms. Many early vision tasks require labeling each pixel with some quantity such as depth or texture. While many such problems can be elegantly expressed in the language of Markov Random Fields (MRF's), the resulting energy minimization problems were widely viewed as intractable. Recently, algorithms such as graph cuts and loopy belief propagation (LBP) have proven to be very powerful: for example, such methods form the basis for almost all the top-performing stereo methods. Unfortunately, most papers define their own energy function, which is minimized with a specific algorithm of their choice. As a result, the tradeoffs among different energy minimization algorithms are not well understood. In this paper we describe a set of energy minimization benchmarks, which we use to compare the solution quality and running time of several common energy minimization algorithms. We investigate three promising recent methods\u2014graph cuts, LBP, and tree-reweighted message passing\u2014as well as the well-known older iterated conditional modes (ICM) algorithm. Our benchmark problems are drawn from published energy functions used for stereo, image stitching and interactive segmentation. We also provide a general-purpose software interface that allows vision researchers to easily switch between optimization methods with minimal overhead. We expect that the availability of our benchmarks and interface will make it significantly easier for vision researchers to adopt the best method for their specific problems. Benchmarks, code, results and images are available at http://vision.middlebury.edu/MRF."

(Nov. 2005)- tree-reweighted max-product message passing (TRW). It was inspired by the problem of maximizing a lower bound on the energy. However, the algorithm is not guaranteed to increase this bound - it may actually go down. In addition, TRW does not always converge. We develop a modification of this algorithm which we call sequential tree-reweighted message passing. Its main property is that the bound is guaranteed not to decrease. We also give a weak tree agreement condition which characterizes local maxima of the bound with respect to TRW algorithms. We prove that our algorithm has a limit point that achieves weak tree agreement. Finally, we show that, our algorithm requires half as much memory as traditional message passing approaches. Experimental results demonstrate that on certain synthetic and real problems, our algorithm outperforms both the ordinary belief propagation and tree-reweighted algorithm in (M. J. Wainwright, et al., Nov. 2005). In addition, on stereo problems with Potts interactions, we obtain a lower energy than graph cuts"

In a common formulation of the problem, the backbone is fixed, side-chain conformations come from a rotamer library, and a pairwise energy function is optimized. It is NP-complete to find even a reasonable approximate solution to this problem. We seek to put this hardness result into practical context.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWe present an integer linear programming (ILP) formulation of side-chain positioning that allows us to tackle large problem sizes. We relax the integrality constraint to give a polynomial-time linear programming (LP) heuristic. We apply LP to position side chains on native and homologous backbones and to choose side chains for protein design. Surprisingly, when positioning side chains on native and homologous backbones, optimal solutions using a simple, biologically relevant energy function can usually be found using LP. On the other hand, the design problem often cannot be solved using LP directly; however, optimal solutions for large instances can still be found using the computationally more expensive ILP procedure. While different energy functions also affect the difficulty of the problem, the LP/ILP approach is able to find optimal solutions. Our analysis is the first large-scale demonstration that LP-based approaches are highly effective in finding optimal (and successive near-optimal) solutions for the side-chain positioning problem."

Perhaps the most successful example is stereo vision. For the stereo problem, it has been shown that finding the global optimum is NP hard but good results have been obtained using a number of approximate optimization algorithms. In this paper, we show that for standard benchmark stereo pairs, the global optimum can be found in about 30 minutes using a variant of the belief propagation (BP) algorithm. We extend previous theoretical results on reweighted belief propagation to account for possible ties in the beliefs and using these results we obtain easily checkable conditions that guarantee that the BP disparities are the global optima. We verify experimentally that these conditions are typically met for the standard benchmark stereo pairs and discuss the implications of our results for further progress in stereo."

Which level of local consistency should be used when searching for solutions in a constraint network is a basic question. Arc consistency and partial forms of arc consistency have been widely studied, and have been known for sometime through the forward checking or the MAC search algorithms. Until recently, stronger forms of local consistency remained limited to those that change the structure of the constraint graph, and thus, could not be used in practice, especially on large networks. This paper focuses on the local consistencies that are stronger than arc consistency, without changing the structure of the network, i.e., only removing inconsistent values from the domains. In the last five years, several such local consistencies have been proposed by us or by others. We make an overview of all of them, and highlight some relations between them. We compare them both theoretically and experimentally, considering their pruning efficiency and the time required to enforce them."

The backward-forward model is devoted to the simultaneous solution of a collection of interrelated sequential problems based on the independent computation of a cost-to-arrive function and a cost-to-go function. Several extremization and nonextremization problems illustrate the applicability of the proposed models."

By segmentation, we mean a map from the set of pixels to a small set of levels such that each connected component of the set of pixels with the same level forms a relatively large and \"meaningful\" region. The method finds a set of levels with associated gray values by first finding junctions in the image and then seeking a minimum set of threshold values that preserves the junctions. Then it finds a segmentation map that maps each pixel to the level with the closest gray value to the pixel data, within a smoothness constraint. For a convex smoothing penalty, we show the global optimal solution for an energy function that fits the data can be obtained in a polynomial time, by a novel use of the maximum-flow algorithm. Our approach is in contrast to a view in computer vision where segmentation is driven by intensity, gradient, usually not yielding closed boundaries."

The author provides a coherent explication of probability as a language for reasoning with partial belief and offers a unifying perspective on other AI approaches to uncertainty, such as the Dempster-Shafer formalism, truth maintenance systems, and nonmonotonic logic. The author distinguishes syntactic and semantic approaches to uncertainty\u0097and offers techniques, based on belief networks, that provide a mechanism for making semantics-based systems operational. Specifically, network-propagation techniques serve as a mechanism for combining the theoretical coherence of probability theory with modern demands of reasoning-systems technology: modular declarative inputs, conceptually meaningful inferences, and parallel distributed computation. Application areas include diagnosis, forecasting, image interpretation, multi-sensor fusion, decision support systems, plan recognition, planning, speech recognition\u0097in short, almost every task requiring that conclusions be drawn from uncertain clues and incomplete information. \nProbabilistic Reasoning in Intelligent Systems will be of special interest to scholars and researchers in AI, decision theory, statistics, logic, philosophy, cognitive psychology, and the management sciences. Professionals in the areas of knowledge-based systems, operations research, engineering, and statistics will find theoretical and computational tools of immediate practical use. The book can also be used as an excellent text for graduate-level courses in AI, operations research, or applied probability."

Nowadays, due to the variety of different services, only a restricted part of the radio spectrum is available. The set of available frequencies for a provider of a wireless communication service is limited even further by concurrent providers and local frequency blockings. To overcome this shortage, frequencies are used simultaneously by many connections. However, if multiple signals are transmitted at the same or close by frequencies, these signals may interfer the dedicated signal a receiver is listening to, resulting in a loss of quality at the recieving end of the connection. Therefore, the allocation of frequencies to wireless connections is a task that has to be carried out very carefully, in order to avoid, or second best, to minimize interference in the network. This task is known as \u201cfrequency assignment\u201d or \u201cchannel assignment\u201d."

Hence, identifying polynomial-time solvable classes of constraint satisfaction problems has received a lot of attention. In this article, we are interested in structural properties that can make the problem tractable. So far, the largest structural class that is known to be polynomial-time solvable is the class of bounded hypertree width instances introduced by Gottlob et al. [2002]. Here we identify a new class of polynomial-time solvable instances: those having bounded fractional edge cover number. Combining hypertree width and fractional edge cover number, we then introduce the notion of fractional hypertree width. We prove that constraint satisfaction problems with bounded fractional hypertree width can be solved in polynomial time (provided that the tree decomposition is given in the input). Together with a recent approximation algorithm for finding such decompositions [Marx 2010], it follows that bounded fractional hypertree width is now the most generally known structural property that guarantees polynomial-time solvability."
