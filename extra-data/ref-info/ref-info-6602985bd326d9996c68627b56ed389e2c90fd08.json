This deterministic system has collective properties in very close correspondence with the earlier stochastic model based on McCulloch - Pitts neurons. The content- addressable memory and other emergent collective properties of the original model also are present in the graded response model. The idea that such collective properties are used in biological systems is given added credence by the continued presence of such properties for more nearly biological \"neurons.\" Collective analog electrical circuits of the kind described will certainly function. The collective states of the two models have a simple correspondence. The original model will continue to be useful for simulations, because its connection to graded response systems is established. Equations that include the effect of action potentials in the graded response system are also developed."

By extracting two statistical parameters, the macroscopic state equations are derived in terms of these parameters under some hypotheses on the stochastics of microscopic states. It is shown that a random net of statistically symmetric structure is monostable or bistable, and the stability criteria are explicitly given. Random nets consisting of many different classes of elements are also analyzed. Special attention is paid to nets of randomly connected excitatory and inhibitory elements. It is shown that a stable oscillation exists in such a net?in contrast with the fact that no stable oscillations exist in a net of statistically symmetric structure even if negative as well as positive synaptic weights are permitted at a time. The results are checked by computer-simulated experiments."
