In the spectra of single pixels, the algorithm was able to find basis functions that had a broadband spectrum similar to natural daylight, as well as basis functions that coincided with the human cone sensitivity response functions. When applied to small image patches, the algorithm found homogeneous basis functions, achromatic basis functions, and basis functions with overall chromatic variation along lines in color space. Our findings suggest that ICAm ay be used to reveal the structure of color information in natural images."

This leads to the emergence of oriented linear filters that have simultaneous localization in space and in frequency, thus resembling Gabor functions and simple cell receptive fields. In this article, we show that the same principle of independence maximization can explain the emergence of phase- and shift-invariant features, similar to those found in complex cells. This new kind of emergence is obtained by maximizing the independence between norms of projections on linear subspaces (instead of the independence of simple linear filter outputs). The norms of the projections on such independent feature subspaces then indicate the values of invariant features."

Histograms of spatial frequency bandwidth, orientation tuning bandwidth, aspect ratio and length of the receptive fields match well. This indicates that simple cells are well tuned to the expected statistics of natural stimuli. There is no match, however, in calculated and measured distributions for the peak of the spatial frequency response: the filters produced by ICA do not vary their spatial scale as much as simple cells do, but are fixed to scales close to the finest ones allowed by the sampling lattice. Possible ways to resolve this discrepancy are discussed."

One approach to understanding such response properties of visual neurons has been to consider their relationship to the statistical structure of natural images in terms of efficient coding7\u201312. Along these lines, a number of studies have attempted to train unsupervised learning algorithms on natural images in the hope of developing receptive fields with similar properties13\u201318, but none has succeeded in producing a full set that spans the image space and contains all three of the above properties. Here we investigate the proposal8,12 that a coding strategy that maximizes sparseness is sufficient to account for these properties. We show that a learning algorithm that attempts to find sparse linear codes for natural scenes will develop a complete family of localized, oriented, bandpass receptive fields, similar to those found in the primary visual cortex. The resulting sparse image code provides a more efficient representation for later stages of processing because it possesses a higher degree of statistical independence among its outputs."

The average spectral power spectrum Sc(fc) is well described by Sc(fc = exp ( \u2014\u1d5dfc), with fc the spectral frequency (cycles \u03bcm-1), and \u03b2 = 0.419 \u00b1 0.097 pm. Average spectral contrast {Cc = [ \u01a9fc \u2260 0 Sc(fc)/Sc(0)]1/2} was 0.224 \u00b1 0.127. Optimal filters for colour pre-processing were derived using a recently developed theory of early vision (van Hateren (J. comp. Physiol. A 171, 157 (1992))). The theory assumes that the surrounding world is first sampled spatially, temporally and spectrally by an array of pre-filters, and subsequently filtered by an array of neural filters that maximize the information delivered to an array of noisy information channels. These optimal filters show lateral inhibition and spectral opponency for high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) and low temporal frequencies (ft). Decreasing SNR or increasing ft eventually produce filters that are spatially and spectrally low-pass, resulting in a visual system lacking lateral inhibition and spectral opponency. The optimal filters for high SNR lead to responses in the spectral channels approximately independent of the spectrum of the illumination, which is a first step towards colour constancy. Finally, the optimal spectral pre-filter has a half-width of about 100 nm; this is close to that of the common rhodopsins."

It would be astonishing if such a structure did not profoundly modify the response patterns of fibres coming into it. In the cat's visual cortex, the receptive field arrangements of single cells suggest that there is indeed a degree of complexity far exceeding anything yet seen at lower levels in the visual system. In a previous paper we described receptive fields of single cortical cells, observing responses to spots of light shone on one or both retinas (Hubel & Wiesel, 1959). In the present work this method is used to examine receptive fields of a more complex type (Part I) and to make additional observations on binocular interaction (Part II). This approach is necessary in order to understand the behaviour of individual cells, but it fails to deal with the problem of the relationship of one cell to its neighbours. In the past, the technique of recording evoked slow waves has been used with great success in studies of functional anatomy. It was employed by Talbot & Marshall (1941) and by Thompson, Woolsey & Talbot (1950) for mapping out the visual cortex in the rabbit, cat, and monkey. Daniel & Whitteiidge (1959) have recently extended this work in the primate. Most of our present knowledge of retinotopic projections, binocular overlap, and the second visual area is based on these investigations. Yet the method of evoked potentials is valuable mainly for detecting behaviour common to large populations of neighbouring cells; it cannot differentiate functionally between areas of cortex smaller than about 1 mm2. To overcome this difficulty a method has in recent years been developed for studying cells separately or in small groups during long micro-electrode penetrations through nervous tissue. Responses are correlated with cell location by reconstructing the electrode tracks from histological material. These techniques have been applied to"

They are most obvious in the upper layers, 2 and 3, but can also be seen in layers 4B, 5, and 6, in register with the blobs in layers 2 and 3. We compared cells inside and outside blobs in macaque and squirrel monkeys, looking at their physiological responses and anatomical connections. Cells within blobs did not show orientation selectivity, whereas cells between blobs were highly orientation selective. Receptive fields of blob cells had circular symmetry and were of three main types, Broad-Band Center-Surround, Red-Green Double-Opponent, and Yellow-Blue Double-Opponent. Double-Opponent cells responded poorly or not at all to white light in any form, or to diffuse light at any wavelength. In contrast to blob cells, none of the cells recorded in layer 4C beta were Double-Opponent: like the majority of cells in the parvocellular geniculate layers, they were either Broad-Band or Color- Opponent Center-Surround, e.g., red-on-center green-off-surround. To our surprise cells in layer 4C alpha were orientation selective. In tangential penetrations throughout layers 2 and 3, optium orientation, when plotted against electrode position, formed long, regular, usually linear sequences, which were interrupted but not perturbed by the blobs. Staining area 18 for cytochrome oxidase reveals a series of alternating wide and narrow dense stripes, separated by paler interstripes. After small injections of horseradish peroxidase into area 18, we saw a precise set of connections from the blobs in area 17 to thin stripes in area 18, and from the interblob regions in area 17 to interstripes in area 18. Specific reciprocal connections also ran from thin stripes to blobs and from interstripes to interblobs. We have not yet determined the area 17 connections to thick stripes in area 18. In addition, within area 18 there are stripe-to-stripe and interstripe- to-interstripe intrinsic connections. These results suggest that a system involved in the processing of color information, especially color-spatial interactions, runs parallel to and separate from the orientation-specific system. Color, encoded in three coordinates by the major blob cell types, red-green, yellow-blue, and black-white, can be transformed into the three coordinates, red, green, and blue, of the Retinex algorithm of Land."

Such a representation isclosely related to independent component analysis (ICA) and has some neurophysiological plausibility. In this chapter, we show how sparse coding can be used for image denoising. We model the noise-free image data by independent component analysis and denoise a noisy image by maximum likelihood estimation of the noisy version of the ICA model. This leads to the application of a soft-thresholding (shrinkage) operator on the components of sparse coding. Our method is closely related to the method of wavelet shrinkage and coring methods, but it has the important benefit that the representation is determined solely by the statistical properties of the data. In fact, our method can be seen as a simple rederivation of the wavelet shrinkage method for image data, using just the basic principle of maximum likelihood estimation. On the other hand, it allows the method to adapt to different kinds of data sets."

We studied the functional organization of color opponency in the blob regions of the parafoveal representation of the visual cortex. We also examined the patterns of connectivity among blob and nonblob cells by multiple electrode penetrations and cross-correlation analysis. Some of the color- selective cells in the blobs exhibited receptive fields that were similar to those found in the parvocellular layers of the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN): one type exhibited center-surround spatial and chromatic opponency corresponding to the Type I cell found in the LGN; another had center-only chromatic opponency, corresponding to the Type II cell of the LGN. A blob color-selective cell with no LGN counterpart had center color opponency with a nonchromatically opponent surround antagonism. We termed this cell the \u201cmodified Type II\u201d cell. Contrary to previous reports, few true double color-opponent cells were found. Some blob cells previously characterized as double opponent probably belong to our modified Type II category and, unlike true double opponent cells, do not respond well to isoluminant color boundaries. Occasional color-selective oriented cells were either intermixed or in close proximity to blob cells. Neighboring electrode penetrations within the same blob yielded cells of the same color opponency, either red versus green or blue versus yellow, suggesting that individual blobs are dedicated to processing one color opponency. Blobs dedicated to red/green color opponency were 3 times more numerous than blue/yellow blobs. Furthermore, the cells in layer 4C lying beneath blobs of a given color opponency had identical color opponency to the overlying cells in blobs. Cross-correlation analysis of pairs of nonblob, oriented cells in the superficial layers showed interactions between cells with matched orientation and eye preference, at varying horizontal separations. Such interactions are consistent with anatomically demonstrated clustered horizontal connections. Positive cross-correlograms were found between blob cells in the same and in adjacent blobs when the cells' receptive field type, color opponency, and ocular dominance matched. Correlograms also indicated monosynaptic connections from Type II to modified Type II cells of the same color opponency, suggesting that Type II cells may contribute to the construction of the modified Type II fields in the cortex.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

A linear model of these cells has the advantage of simplicity and captures a number of basic aspects of cell function. It, however, fails to account for important response nonlinearities, such as the decrease in response gain and latency observed at high contrasts and the effects of masking by stimuli that fail to elicit responses when presented alone. To account for these nonlinearities we have proposed a normalization model, which extends the linear model to include mutual shunting inhibition among a large number of cortical cells. Shunting inhibition is divisive, and its effect in the model is to normalize the linear responses by a measure of stimulus energy. To test this model we performed extracellular recordings of simple cells in the primary visual cortex of anesthetized macaques. We presented large stimulus sets consisting of (1) drifting gratings of various orientations and spatiotemporal frequencies; (2) plaids composed of two drifting gratings; and (3) gratings masked by full-screen spatiotemporal white noise. We derived expressions for the model predictions and fitted them to the physiological data. Our results support the normalization model, which accounts for both the linear and the nonlinear properties of the cells. An alternative model, in which the linear responses are subject to a compressive nonlinearity, did not perform nearly as well."

                "text": "Disparity tuning of visual cells in the brain depends on the structure of their binocular receptive fields (RFs). Freeman and coworkers have found that binocular RFs of a typical simple cell can be quantitatively described by two Gabor functions with the same gaussian envelope but different phase parameters in the sinusoidal modulations (Freeman and Ohzawa 1990). This phase-parameter-based RF description has recently been questioned by Wagner and Frost (1993) based on their identification of a so-called characteristic disparity (CD) in some cells' disparity tuning curves. They concluded that their data favor the traditional binocular RF model, which assumes an overall positional shift between a cell's left and right RFs. Here we set to resolve this issue by studying the dependence of cells' disparity tuning on their underlying RF structures through mathematical analyses and computer simulations. We model the disparity tuning curves in Wagner and Frost's experiments and demonstrate that the mere existence of approximate CDs in real cells cannot be used to distinguish the phase-parameter-based RF description from the traditional position-shift-based RF description. Specifically, we found that model simple cells with either type of RF description do not have a CD. Model complex cells with the position-shift-based RF description have a precise CD, and those with the phase-parameter-based RF description have an approximate CD. We also suggest methods for correctly distinguishing the two types of RF descriptions. A hybrid of the two RF models may be required to fit the behavior of some real cells, and we show how to determine the relative contributions of the two RF models."

In this paper, we use a combination of two different approaches for linear ICA: Comon's information-theoretic approach and the projection pursuit approach. Using maximum entropy approximations of differential entropy, we introduce a family of new contrast (objective) functions for ICA. These contrast functions enable both the estimation of the whole decomposition by minimizing mutual information, and estimation of individual independent components as projection pursuit directions. The statistical properties of the estimators based on such contrast functions are analyzed under the assumption of the linear mixture model, and it is shown how to choose contrast functions that are robust and/or of minimum variance. Finally, we introduce simple fixed-point algorithms for practical optimization of the contrast functions. These algorithms optimize the contrast functions very fast and reliably."

                "text": "A number of recent attempts have been made to describe early sensory coding in terms of a general information processing strategy. In this paper, two strategies are contrasted. Both strategies take advantage of the redundancy in the environment to produce more effective representations. The first is described as a compact coding scheme. A compact code performs a transform that allows the input to be represented with a reduced number of vectors (cells) with minimal RMS error. This approach has recently become popular in the neural network literature and is related to a process called Principal Components Analysis (PCA). A number of recent papers have suggested that the optimal compact code for representing natural scenes will have units with receptive field profiles much like those found in the retina and primary visual cortex. However, in this paper, it is proposed that compact coding schemes are insufficient to account for the receptive field properties of cells in the mammalian visual pathway. In contrast, it is proposed that the visual system is near to optimal in representing natural scenes only if optimality is defined in terms of sparse distributed coding. In a sparse distributed code, all cells in the code have an equal response probability across the class of images but have a low response probability for any single image. In such a code, the dimensionality is not reduced. Rather, the redundancy of the input is transformed into the redundancy of the firing pattern of cells. It is proposed that the signature for a sparse code is found in the fourth moment of the response distribution (i.e., the kurtosis). In measurements with 55 calibrated natural scenes, the kurtosis was found to peak when the bandwidths of the visual code matched those of cells in the mammalian visual cortex. Codes resembling wavelet transforms are proposed to be effective because the response histograms of such codes are sparse (i.e., show high kurtosis) when presented with natural scenes. It is proposed that the structure of the image that allows sparse coding is found in the phase spectrum of the image. It is suggested that natural scenes, to a first approximation, can be considered as a sum of self-similar local functions (the inverse of a wavelet). Possible reasons for why sensory systems would evolve toward sparse coding are presented."

Since the measure of pixel-entropy has only a global minimum the algorithm is guaranteed to converge to the minimum entropy map. Such optimal maps have recently been shown to possess cognitively desirable properties and are likely to be used by the nervous system to organize sensory information. The algorithm derived here turns out to be one proposed by Goodall for pairwise decorrelation. It is biologically plausible since in a neural network implementation it requires only data available locally to a neuron. In training over ensembles of two-dimensional input signals with the same spatial power spectrum as natural scenes, networks develop output neurons with center-surround receptive fields similar to those of ganglion cells in the retina. Some technical issues pertinent to developmental algorithms of this sort, such as symmetry fixing, are also discussed."

                "text": "A recent computational theory suggests that visual processing in the retina and the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) serves to recode information into an efficient form (Atick and Redlich, 1990). Information theoretic analysis showed that the representation of visual information at the level of the photoreceptors is inefficient, primarily attributable to a high degree of spatial and temporal correlation in natural scenes. It was predicted, therefore, that the retina and the LGN should recode this signal into a decorrelated form or, equivalently, into a signal with a \u201cwhite\u201d spatial and temporal power spectrum. In the present study, we tested directly the prediction that visual processing at the level of the LGN temporally whitens the natural visual input. We recorded the responses of individual neurons in the LGN of the cat to natural, time-varying images (movies) and, as a control, to white-noise stimuli. Although there is substantial temporal correlation in natural inputs (Dong and Atick, 1995b), we found that the power spectra of LGN responses were essentially white. Between 3 and 15 Hz, the power of the responses had an average variation of only \u00b110.3%. Thus, the signals that the LGN relays to visual cortex are temporarily decorrelated. Furthermore, the responses of X-cells to natural inputs can be well predicted from their responses to white-noise inputs. We therefore conclude that whitening of natural inputs can be explained largely by the linear filtering properties (Enroth-Cugell and Robson, 1966). Our results suggest that the early visual pathway is well adapted for efficient coding of information in the natural visual environment, in agreement with the prediction of the computational theory."

Because the striate cortex is the first site along the central visual pathways at which signals from the left and right eyes converge onto a single neuron, encoding of binocular disparity is thought to begin in this region. There are two possible mechanisms for encoding binocular disparity through simple cells in the striate cortex: a difference in receptive field (RF) position between the two eyes (RF position disparity) and a difference in RF profiles between the two eyes (RF phase disparity). Although there is evidence that supports each of these schemes, both mechanisms have not been examined in a single study to determine their relative roles. In this study, we have measured RF position and phase disparities of individual simple cells in the cat's striate cortex to address this issue. Using a sophisticated RF mapping technique that employs binary m-sequences, we have obtained left and right eye RF profiles of two or more cells recorded simultaneously. A version of the reference-cell method was used to estimate RF position disparity. We find that RF position disparities generally are limited to values that are not sufficient to encode large binocular disparities. In contrast, RF phase disparities cover a wide range of binocular disparities and exhibit dependencies on RF orientation and spatial frequency in a manner expected for a mechanism that encodes binocular disparity. These results suggest that binocular disparity is encoded mainly through RF phase disparity. However, RF position disparity may play a significant role for cells with high spatial frequency selectivity that are constrained to have only small RF phase disparities."

The ICA model is utilized mainly in blind separation of unknown source signals from their linear mixtures. In this application only the source signals which correspond to the coefficients of the ICA expansion are of interest. In this paper, we propose neural structures related to multilayer feedforward networks for performing complete ICA. The basic ICA network consists of whitening, separation, and basis vector estimation layers. It can be used for both blind source separation and estimation of the basis vectors of ICA. We consider learning algorithms for each layer, and modify our previous nonlinear PCA type algorithms so that their separation capabilities are greatly improved. The proposed class of networks yields good results in test examples with both artificial and real-world data."

                "text": "The orientation selectivity, ocular dominance, and binocular disparity tuning of 272 cells in areas 17 and 18 of barbiturate-anesthetized, paralyzed cats were studied with automated, quantitative techniques. Disparity was varied along the axis orthogonal to each cell's best orientation. Binocular correspondence was established by means of a reference electrode positioned at the boundary of lamina A and A1 in the area centralis representation of the lateral geniculate nucleus. Measures were derived that expressed each cell's disparity sensitivity and best disparity and the shape and slope of its tuning curve. Cells were found that corresponded to categories described by previous authors (\"disparity-insensitive,\" \"tuned excitatory,\" \"near,\" and \"far\" cells), but many others had intermediate response patterns, or patterns that were difficult to categorize. Quantitative analysis suggested that the various types belong to a continuum. No relationship could be established between a cell's best orientation and its ocular dominance or any aspect of its disparity tuning. There was no relationship between a cell's ocular dominance and its sensitivity to disparity. Ocular dominance and best disparity were related. As reported by others, cells with best disparities close to zero (the fixation plane) tended to have balanced ocularity, while cells with best disparities in the near or far range had a broad distribution of ocular dominance. Among cells with receptive fields near the vertical meridian, those preferring far disparities tended to be dominated by the contralateral eye, and those preferring near disparities by the ipsilateral eye. It is suggested that this relationship follows from the geometry of near and far images and the pattern of decussation in the visual pathway. There was a significant grouping of cells with similar best disparities along tangential electrode tracks. We believe that this grouping is due to the columnar organization for ocular dominance and the relationship between ocular dominance and best disparity. No evidence was found for a columnar segregation of disparity-sensitive and disparity-insensitive cells."

We argue that the retinal goal is to transform the visual input as much as possible into a statistically independent basis as the first step in creating a redundancy reduced representation in the cortex, as suggested by Barlow. The extent of this whitening of the input is limited, however, by the need to suppress input noise. Our explicit theoretical solutions for the retinal filters also show a simple dependence on mean stimulus luminance: they predict an approximate Weber law at low spatial frequencies and a De Vries-Rose law at high frequencies. Assuming that the dominant source of noise is quantum, we generate a family of contrast sensitivity curves as a function of mean luminance. This family is compared to psychophysical data."

It is a long-standing question whether these attributes are represented in a spatially organized way in cat primary visual cortex1\u20134. Using optical imaging of intrinsic signals5\u201310, we show here that grating stimuli of different spatial frequencies drifting at various speeds produce distinct activity patterns. Rather than observing a map of continuously changing spatial frequency preference across the cortical surface, we found only two distinct sets of domains, one preferring low spatial frequency and high speed, and the other high spatial frequency and low speed. We compared the arrangement of these spatio\u2013temporal frequency domains with the cytochrome oxidase staining pattern, which, based on work in primate striate cortex, is thought to reflect the partition of the visual cortex into different processing streams. We found that the cytochrome oxidase blobs in cat striate cortex coincide with domains engaged in the processing of low spatial and high temporal frequency contents of the visual scene. Together with other recent results11, our data suggest that spatio\u2013temporal frequency domains are a manifestation of parallel streams in cat visual cortex, with distinct patterns of thalamic inputs and extrastriate projections."

A quantitative criterion is adopted to choose the intensity match of the two colours in the stimulus: this is the intensity ratio at which contrast sensitivity for the chromatic grating differs most from the contrast sensitivity for a monochromatic luminance grating. Results show that this intensity match varies with spatial frequency and does not necessarily correspond to a luminance match between the colours. Contrast sensitivities to the chromatic gratings at the criterion intensity match are measured as a function of spatial frequency, using field sizes ranging from 2 to 23 deg. Both blue\u2010yellow and red\u2010green contrast sensitivity functions have similar low\u2010pass characteristics, with no low\u2010frequency attenuation even at low frequencies below 0.1 cycles/deg. These functions indicate that the limiting acuities based on red\u2010green and blue\u2010yellow colour discriminations are similar at 11 or 12 cycles/deg. Comparisons between contrast sensitivity functions for the chromatic and monochromatic gratings are made at the same mean luminances. Results show that, at low spatial frequencies below 0.5 cycles/deg, contrast sensitivity is greater to the chromatic gratings, consisting of two monochromatic gratings added in antiphase, than to either monochromatic grating alone. Above 0.5 cycles/deg, contrast sensitivity is greater to monochromatic than to chromatic gratings."

                "text": "1. We have tested the hypothesis that simple cells in the cat's visual cortex perform a linear spatiotemporal filtering of the visual image. To conduct this study we note that a visual neuron behaves linearly if the responses to small, brief flashes of light are mathematically related, via the Fourier transform, to the responses elicited by sinusoidal grating stimuli. 2. We have evaluated the linearity of temporal and spatial summation for 118 simple cells recorded from the striate cortex (area 17) of adult cats and kittens at ages 4 and 8 wk postnatal. These neurons represent a subset of the population of cells for which we have described the postnatal development of spatiotemporal receptive-field structure in the preceding paper. Spatiotemporal receptive-field profiles are constructed, with the use of a reverse correlation technique, from the responses to random sequences of small bar stimuli that are brighter or darker than the background. Fourier analysis of spatiotemporal receptive-field profiles yields linear predictions of the cells' spatial and temporal frequency tuning. These predicted responses are compared with spatial and temporal frequency tuning curves measured by the use of drifting, sinusoidal-luminance grating stimuli. 3. For most simple cells, there is good agreement between spatial and temporal frequency tuning curves predicted from the receptive-field profile and those measured by the use of sinusoidal gratings. These results suggest that both spatial and temporal summation within simple cells are approximately linear. There is a tendency for predicted tuning curves to be slightly broader than measured tuning curves, a finding that is consistent with the effects of a threshold nonlinearity at the output of these neurons. In some cases, however, predicted tuning curves deviate from measured responses only at low spatial and temporal frequencies. This cannot be explained by a simple threshold nonlinearity. 4. If linearity is assumed, it should be possible to predict the direction selectivity of simple cells from the structure of their spatiotemporal receptive-field profiles. For virtually all cells, linear predictions correctly determine the preferred direction of motion of a visual stimulus. However, the strength of the directional bias is typically underestimated by a factor of about two on the basis of linear predictions. Consideration of the expansive exponential nonlinearity revealed in the contrast-response function permits a reconciliation of the discrepancy between measured and predicted direction selectivity indexes. 5. Overall, these findings show that spatiotemporal receptive-field profiles obtained with the use of reverse correlation may be used to predict a variety of response properties for simple cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

Impulse activity was recorded from neurons in fovea1 striate (A17) and prestriate (Al@ cortex of monkeys trained to fixate monocularly and binocularly by rewarding them for detecting an abrupt change in the intensity of a small luminous spot. During periods of fixation, single bright or dark narrow bars moving across a frontoparallel plane were presented at a series of different depths. 2. Nearly all cortical neurons studied received input from both eyes. Binocular neurons were classifiedLint two categories on the basis of their monocular responses: those that gave similar responses to stimulation of right and left eye (ocular balance) and those that gave different responses (ocular unbalance). Different kinds of binocular interactions were observed. 3. Most neurons (84%) were sensitive to location of the stimulus in depth. Four types of depth-sensitive cells were recognized: a) tuned excitatory neurons, the most common type, that gave excitatory responses over a narrow range of depth about the fixation distance often with inhibitory flanks nearer and farther, and that typically received a balanced binocular input; b) tuned inhibitory neurons whose responses were largely suppressed by stimuli at or close to the plane of fixation; c) near neurons, which responded well to stimuli in front of the fixation plane and were suppressed by those behind it; d) far neurons, the opposite of near neurons. The last three types of depth cells were usually ocularly unbalanced. Peaks and steps of depthsensitivity profiles occurred at or close to the fixation distance (within t 0.4O of disparity), whereas the total range of binocular interaction, even for a single cell, could extend to more than t lo of disparity. 4. The results suggest that there are cells in fovea1 striate and prestriate which may be part of"

The properties of the operator which approximates a signal at a given resolution were studied. It is shown that the difference of information between the approximation of a signal at the resolutions 2/sup j+1/ and 2/sup j/ (where j is an integer) can be extracted by decomposing this signal on a wavelet orthonormal basis of L/sup 2/(R/sup n/), the vector space of measurable, square-integrable n-dimensional functions. In L/sup 2/(R), a wavelet orthonormal basis is a family of functions which is built by dilating and translating a unique function psi (x). This decomposition defines an orthogonal multiresolution representation called a wavelet representation. It is computed with a pyramidal algorithm based on convolutions with quadrature mirror filters. Wavelet representation lies between the spatial and Fourier domains. For images, the wavelet representation differentiates several spatial orientations. The application of this representation to data compression in image coding, texture discrimination and fractal analysis is discussed. >"

We show how a neural network learning rule can be transformed into a fixedpoint iteration, which provides an algorithm that is very simple, does not depend on any user-defined parameters, and is fast to converge to the most accurate solution allowed by the data. The algorithm finds, one at a time, all nongaussian independent components, regardless of their probability distributions. The computations can be performed in either batch mode or a semiadaptive manner. The convergence of the algorithm is rigorously proved, and the convergence speed is shown to be cubic. Some comparisons to gradient-based algorithms are made, showing that the new algorithm is usually 10 to 100 times faster, sometimes giving the solution in just a few iterations."

                "text": "The origin of orientation selectivity in visual cortical responses is a central problem for understanding cerebral cortical circuitry. In cats, many experiments suggest that orientation selectivity arises from the arrangement of lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) afferents to layer 4 simple cells. However, this explanation is not sufficient to account for the contrast invariance of orientation tuning. To understand contrast invariance, we first characterize the input to cat simple cells generated by the oriented arrangement of LGN afferents. We demonstrate that it has two components: a spatial-phase-specific component (i.e., one that depends on receptive field spatial phase), which is tuned for orientation, and a phase-nonspecific component, which is untuned. Both components grow with contrast. Second, we show that a correlation-based intracortical circuit, in which connectivity between cell pairs is determined by the correlation of their LGN inputs, is sufficient to achieve well tuned, contrast-invariant orientation tuning. This circuit generates both spatially opponent, \u201cantiphase\u201d inhibition (\u201cpush\u2013pull\u201d), and spatially matched, \u201csame-phase\u201d excitation. The inhibition, if sufficiently strong, suppresses the untuned input component and sharpens responses to the tuned component at all contrasts. The excitation amplifies tuned responses. This circuit agrees with experimental evidence showing spatial opponency between, and similar orientation tuning of, the excitatory and inhibitory inputs received by a simple cell. Orientation tuning is primarily input driven, accounting for the observed invariance of tuning width after removal of intracortical synaptic input, as well as for the dependence of orientation tuning on stimulus spatial frequency. The model differs from previous push\u2013pull models in requiring dominant rather than balanced inhibition and in predicting that a population of layer 4 inhibitory neurons should respond in a contrast-dependent manner to stimuli of all orientations, although their tuning width may be similar to that of excitatory neurons. The model demonstrates that fundamental response properties of cortical layer 4 can be explained by circuitry expected to develop under correlation-based rules of synaptic plasticity, and shows how such circuitry allows the cortex to distinguish stimulus intensity from stimulus form."

                "text": "1. Most studies of cortical neurons have focused on the spatial structure of receptive fields. For a more complete functional description of these neurons, it is necessary to consider receptive-field structure in the joint domain of space and time. We have studied the spatiotemporal receptive-field structure of 233 simple cells recorded from the striate cortex of adult cats and kittens at 4 and 8 wk postnatal. The dual goal of this study is to provide a detailed quantitative description of spatiotemporal receptive-field structure and to compare the developmental time courses of spatial and temporal response properties. 2. Spatiotemporal receptive-field profiles have been measured with the use of a reverse correlation method, in which we compute the cross-correlation between a neuron's response and a random sequence of small, briefly presented bright and dark stimuli. The receptive-field profiles of some simple cells are space-time separable, meaning that spatial and temporal response characteristics can be dissociated. Other cells have receptive-field profiles that are space-time inseparable. In these cases, a particular spatial location cannot be designated, unambiguously, as belonging to either an on or off subregion. However, separate on and off subregions may be clearly distinguished in the joint space-time domain. These subregions are generally tilted along an oblique axis. 3. Our observations show that spatial and temporal aspects of receptive-field structure mature with clearly different time courses. By 4 wk postnatal, the spatial symmetry and periodicity of simple-cell receptive fields have reached maturity. The spatial extent (or size) of these receptive fields is adult-like by 8 wk postnatal. In contrast, the response latency and time duration of spatiotemporal receptive fields do not mature until well beyond 8 wk postnatal. 4. By applying Fourier analysis to spatiotemporal receptive-field profiles, we have examined the postnatal development of spatial and temporal selectivity in the frequency domain. By 8 wk postnatal, spatial frequency tuning has clearly reached maturity. On the contrary, temporal frequency selectivity remains markedly immature at 8 wk. We have also examined the joint distribution of optimal spatial and temporal frequencies. From 4 wk postnatal until 8 wk postnatal, the range of optimal spatial frequencies increases substantially, whereas the range of optimal temporal frequencies remains largely unchanged. From 8 wk postnatal until adulthood, there is a large increase in optimal temporal frequencies for cells tuned to low spatial frequencies. For cells tuned to high spatial frequencies, the distribution of optimal temporal frequencies does not change much beyond 8 wk postnatal.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

                "text": "We extend previous models for separate development of ocular dominance and orientation selectivity in cortical layer 4 by exploring conditions permitting combined organization of both properties. These conditions are expressed in terms of functions describing the degree of correlation in the firing of two inputs from the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), as a function of their retinotopic separation and their \u201ctype\u201d (ON center or OFF center and left eye or right eye). The development of ocular dominance requires that the correlations of an input with other inputs of the same eye be stronger than or equal to its correlations with inputs of the opposite eye and strictly stronger at small retinotopic separations. This must be true after summing correlations with inputs of both center types. The development of orientation-selective simple cells requires that (1) an input\u2019s correlations with other inputs of the same center type be stronger than its correlations with inputs of the opposite center type at small retinotopic separation; and (2) this relationship reverse at larger retinotopic separations within an arbor radius (the radius over which LGN cells can project to a common cortical point). This must be true after summing correlations with inputs serving both eyes. For orientations to become matched in the two eyes, correlated activity within the receptive fields must be maximized by specific between-eye alignments of ON and OFF subregions. Thus the correlations between the eyes must differ depending on center type, and this difference must vary with retinotopic separation within an arbor radius. These principles are satisfied by a wide class of correlation functions. Combined development of ocularly matched orientation maps and ocular dominance maps can be achieved either simultaneously or sequentially. In the latter case, the model can produce a correlation between the locations of orientation map singularities and local ocular dominance peaks similar to that observed physiologically. The model\u2019s main prediction is that the above correlations should exist among inputs to cortical layer 4 simple cells before vision. In addition, mature simple cells are predicted to have certain relationships between the locations of the ON and OFF subregions of the left and right eyes\u2019 receptive fields."

We present a simulation of a highly simplified model of visual processing along the parvocellular pathway, that combines precortical color processing, excitatory and inhibitory cortical interactions, and Hebbian learning. The model self-organizes in response to natural color images and develops islands of unoriented, color-selective cells within a sea of contrast-sensitive, orientation-selective cells. By way of understanding this topography, a principal component analysis of the color inputs presented to the network reveals that the optimal linear coding of these inputs keeps color information and contrast information separate."

Cortical feature preferences are deened through patterns of synaptic connectivity to LGN cells which develop due to ring correlations of those LGN cells. Model parameters include spatial correlation patterns between ON-and OFF-center cells in separate eye layers of the LGN. A linear transformation yields correlation functions which predict whether orientation preferences, ocular dominance, or both, will develop. The model thus predicts the correlations between LGN cells which would be necessary to explain formation of visual maps by a linear process."

A synaptic evolution scheme of a new kind is proposed in which incoming patterns rather than converging afferents compete. The change in the efficacy of a given synapse depends not only on instantaneous pre- and postsynaptic activities but also on a slowly varying time-averaged value of the postsynaptic activity. Assuming an appropriate nonlinear form for this dependence, development of selectivity is obtained under quite general conditions on the sensory environment. One does not require nonlinearity of the neuron's integrative power nor does one need to assume any particular form for intracortical circuitry. This is first illustrated in simple cases, e.g., when the environment consists of only two different stimuli presented alternately in a random manner. The following formal statement then holds: the state of the system converges with probability 1 to points of maximum selectivity in the state space. We next consider the problem of early development of orientation selectivity and binocular interaction in primary visual cortex. Giving the environment an appropriate form, we obtain orientation tuning curves and ocular dominance comparable to what is observed in normally reared adult cats or monkeys. Simulations with binocular input and various types of normal or altered environments show good agreement with the relevant experimental data. Experiments are suggested that could test our theory further."

In the central half of V1, the cortical magnification was found to be greater along the vertical than along the horizontal meridian, and overall magnification factors appeared to be scaled proportionate to brain size across different species. The cortical magnification factor (CMF) was found to reach a maximum of about 15 mm/deg at the representation of the fovea, at a point of acute curvature in the V1-V2 border. We find neither a duplication nor an overrepresentation of the vertical meridian. The magnification factor did not appear to be doubled in a direction perpendicular to the ocular dominance strips; it may not be increased at all. The DG borders in parvorecipient layer 4Cb were found to be as sharp as 140 micron (half-amplitude, half width), corresponding to a visual angle of less than 2\u2032 of arc at the eccentricity measured. In other layers (including magnorecipient layer 4Ca), the retinotopic borders are broader. The retinotopic spread of activity is greater when produced by a low-spatial-frequency grating than when produced by a high-spatial-frequency grating. Orientation- specific stimuli produced a pattern of activation that spread further than 1 mm across cortex in some layers. Some DG evidence suggests that the spread of functional activity is greater near the foveal representation than near 5 degrees eccentricity."

                "text": "When macaque monkeys view achromatic, sinusoidal gratings of a single spatial frequency, the pattern of 14C-2-deoxy-d-glucose (DG) uptake produced by the gratings is shown to depend on the spatial frequency chosen. When a relatively high (5\u20137 cycles/deg) spatial frequency is shown binocularly at systematically varied orientations, uptake in parafoveal striate cortex is highest between the cytochrome oxidase blobs (that is, in the interblobs) in layers 1, 2, and 3. In layers 4B, 5, and 6, where the cytochrome oxidase blobs are faint or absent, DG uptake is highest in a periodic pattern that lies in register with the interblobs of layers 2 + 3. When the grating is, instead, of relatively low (1\u20131.5 cycles/deg) spatial frequency, DG uptake is highest in the blobs, in the blob-aligned portions of layers 1\u20134B, and in the lower- layer blobs as well. These variations in DG topography are confirmed in stimulus comparisons within a single hemisphere. Presumably, this shift in functional topography within the extra-granular layer is the primate homolog of \u201cspatial frequency columns\u201d shown earlier in the cat (Tootell et al., 1981; Silverman, 1984). In the well-differentiated architecture of primate striate cortex, laminar differences produced by high- versus low-spatial-frequency gratings are visible as well. Gratings of very high spatial frequency produce much higher uptake in 4Cb (which receives input from the parvocellular LGN layers) than in 4Ca (which gets its input from the magnocellular LGN layers). Gratings of low spatial frequency produce the converse result. Presumably, cells in the magnocellular LGN layers and/or in the magnocellular-dominated layer 4Ca have lower average spatial frequency tuning (larger receptive fields) than their counterparts in the parvocellular LGN and/or in striate layer 4Cb. The DG patterns produced by various spatial frequencies also vary with eccentricity, in a manner consistent with known, eccentricity-dependent variations of receptive-field size and spatial frequency tuning. Thus, gratings of a \u201cmiddle\u201d-spatial- frequency range (4\u20135 cycles/deg) produce high uptake in the blobs near the foveal representation and high uptake in the interblobs at more peripheral eccentricities, including 5 degrees. This shift in DG topography also includes the transition zone near 3 degrees, where the level of stimulus-driven uptake is as high in the blob regions as it is in interblob regions. Variations in uptake between layers 4Ca and 4Cb, as a function of eccentricity, shift in parallel with the changes in the upper-layer topography."

It is shown that even a single developing cell of a layered network exhibits a remarkable set of optimization properties that are closely related to issues in statistics, theoretical physics, adaptive signal processing, the formation of knowledge representation in artificial intelligence, and information theory. The network studied is based on the visual system. These results are used to infer an information-theoretic principle that can be applied to the network as a whole, rather than a single cell. The organizing principle proposed is that the network connections develop in such a way as to maximize the amount of information that is preserved when signals are transformed at each processing stage, subject to certain constraints. The operation of this principle is illustrated for some simple cases.<<ETX>>"

The theory is formulated in the language of information theory and hypothesizes that the goal of this processing is to recode in order to reduce a generalized redundancy subject to a constraint that specifies the amount of average information preserved. In the limit of no noise, this theory becomes equivalent to Barlow's redundancy reduction hypothesis, but it leads to very different computational strategies when noise is present. A tractable approach for finding the optimal encoding is to solve the problem in successive stages where at each stage the optimization is performed within a restricted class of transfer functions. We explicitly find the solution for the class of encodings to which the parvocellular retinal processing belongs, namely linear and nondivergent transformations. The solution shows agreement with the experimentally observed transfer functions at all levels of signal to noise."

The algorithm does not assume any knowledge of the input distributions, and is defined here for the zero-noise limit. Under these conditions, information maximization has extra properties not found in the linear case (Linsker 1989). The nonlinearities in the transfer function are able to pick up higher-order moments of the input distributions and perform something akin to true redundancy reduction between units in the output representation. This enables the network to separate statistically independent components in the inputs: a higher-order generalization of principal components analysis. We apply the network to the source separation (or cocktail party) problem, successfully separating unknown mixtures of up to 10 speakers. We also show that a variant on the network architecture is able to perform blind deconvolution (cancellation of unknown echoes and reverberation in a speech signal). Finally, we derive dependencies of information transfer on time delays. We suggest that information maximization provides a unifying framework for problems in \"blind\" signal processing."

                "text": "From the Publisher: \n\"IEEE Press is proud to present the first selected reprint volume devoted to the new field of intelligent signal processing (ISP). ISP differs fundamentally from the classical approach to statistical signal processing in that the input-output behavior of a complex system is modeled by using \"intelligent\" or \"model-free\" techniques, rather than relying on the shortcomings of a mathematical model. Information is extracted from incoming signal and noise data, making few assumptions about the statistical structure of signals and their environment. \nIntelligent Signal Processing explores how ISP tools address the problems of practical neural systems, new signal data, and blind fuzzy approximators. The editors have compiled 20 articles written by prominent researchers covering 15 diverse, practical applications of this nascent topic, exposing the reader to the signal processing power of learning and adaptive systems. \nThis essential reference is intended for researchers, professional engineers, and scientists working in statistical signal processing and its applications in various fields such as humanistic intelligence, stochastic resonance, financial markets, optimization, pattern recognition, signal detection, speech processing, and sensor fusion. Intelligent Signal Processing is also invaluable for graduate students and academics with a background in computer science, computer engineering, or electrical engineering. \nAbout the Editors \nSimon Haykin is the founding director of the Communications Research Laboratory at McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, where he serves as university professor. His research interests include nonlinear dynamics, neural networks andadaptive filters and their applications in radar and communications systems. Dr. Haykin is the editor for a series of books on \"Adaptive and Learning Systems for Signal Processing, Communications and Control\" (Publisher) and is both an IEEE Fellow and Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada. \nBart Kosko is a past director of the University of Southern California's (USC) Signal and Image Processing Institute. He has authored several books, including Neural Networks and Fuzzy Systems, Neural Networks for Signal Processing (Publisher, copyright date) and Fuzzy Thinking (Publisher, copyright date), as well as the novel Nanotime (Publisher, copyright date). Dr. Kosko is an elected governor of the International Neural Network Society and has chaired many neural and fuzzy system conferences. Currently, he is associate professor of electrical engineering at USC.\""

In this paper, a modified version of the linear/energy model is presented in which striate cells mutually inhibit one another, effectively normalizing their responses with respect to stimulus contrast.

This paper introduces a class of adaptive algorithms for source separation that implements an adaptive version of equivariant estimation and is henceforth called equivariant adaptive separation via independence (EASI). The EASI algorithms are based on the idea of serial updating. This specific form of matrix updates systematically yields algorithms with a simple structure for both real and complex mixtures. Most importantly, the performance of an EASI algorithm does not depend on the mixing matrix. In particular, convergence rates, stability conditions, and interference rejection levels depend only on the (normalized) distributions of the source signals. Closed-form expressions of these quantities are given via an asymptotic performance analysis. The theme of equivariance is stressed throughout the paper. The source separation problem has an underlying multiplicative structure. The parameter space forms a (matrix) multiplicative group. We explore the (favorable) consequences of this fact on implementation, performance, and optimization of EASI algorithms."

Typically we will be in a situation where we have n observations of these random variables, and the parameters of their distribution, such as means, variances and covari-ances are estimated from the values of the observations, but for the moment we think about the distribution of the underlying random variables rather than the particular observations. The basic idea of principal components is to try to describe p dimensional data in as small a number of dimensions (less than p) as possible, while preserving as much as possible of the structures involved. In doing this, we concentrate on variances. The rst step is to look for a linear function z 1 = 1 T x or z 1 = 1 T (x ?) of the elements of x which has maximum variance, where 1 is a vector of p components 11 , 21 , : : : , p1 (beware that some other authors write the suuces the other way round). Note we often subtract the mean. Then 1 T x = 11 x 1 + 21 x 2 + + p1 x p = p X j=1 j1 x j : Next, we look for a linear function z 2 = 2 T x uncorrelated with 1 T x which has maximum variance subject to this condition, and so on, so that at the kth stage a linear function z k = k x is found which has maximum variance subject to being uncorrelated with 1 T x, 2 T x, : : : , k?1 T x. We refer to the kth derived variable k T x as the kth principal component. We stop after the mth stage when, in some sense, the majority of the variation has been accounted for. Before proceeding further, let us recall some results on means and variances of linear functions. Suppose x is any p-dimensional random variable, and that is any constant p-dimensional vector. Then the mean of T x is"

Two methods are then discussed, whereby such messages can be converted to a \u201creduced\u201d form in which the successive samples are more nearly independent and for which the simple amplitude distribution is more peaked than in the original message. This reduced signal can then be encoded into binary digits with good efficiency using a Shannon-Fano code on a symbol-by-symbol (or pair-by-pair) basis. The usual inefficiency which results from ignoring the correlation between message segments is lessened because this correlation is less in the reduced message."
