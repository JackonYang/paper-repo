The proposed method is novel, as it (i) departs from a strict feed-forward pipeline and replaces it by a hypothesesverification framework simultaneously processing multiple text line hypotheses, (ii) uses synthetic fonts to train the algorithm eliminating the need for time-consuming acquisition and labeling of real-world training data and (iii) exploits Maximally Stable Extremal Regions (MSERs) which provides robustness to geometric and illumination conditions. \n \nThe performance of the method is evaluated on two standard datasets. On the Char74k dataset, a recognition rate of 72% is achieved, 18% higher than the state-of-the-art. The paper is first to report both text detection and recognition results on the standard and rather challenging ICDAR 2003 dataset. The text localization works for number of alphabets and the method is easily adapted to recognition of other scripts, e.g. cyrillics."

A text region detector is designed to generate a text confidence map, based on which text components can be segmented by local binarization approach. A Conditional Random Field (CRF) model, considering the unary component property as well as binary neighboring component relationship, is then presented to label components as \"text\" or \"non-text\". Last, text components are grouped into text lines with an energy minimization approach. Experimental results show that the proposed method gives promising performance comparing with the existing methods on ICDAR 2003 competition dataset."

If these text occurrences could be detected, segmented, and recognized automatically, they would be a valuable source of high-level semantics for indexing and retrieval. We propose a novel method for localizing and segmenting text in complex images and videos. Text lines are identified by using a complex-valued multilayer feed-forward network trained to detect text at a fixed scale and position. The network's output at all scales and positions is integrated into a single text-saliency map, serving as a starting point for candidate text lines. In the case of video, these candidate text lines are refined by exploiting the temporal redundancy of text in video. Localized text lines are then scaled to a fixed height of 100 pixels and segmented into a binary image with black characters on white background. For videos, temporal redundancy is exploited to improve segmentation performance. Input images and videos can be of any size due to a true multiresolution approach. Moreover, the system is not only able to locate and segment text occurrences into large binary images, but is also able to track each text line with sub-pixel accuracy over the entire occurrence in a video, so that one text bitmap is created for all instances of that text line. Therefore, our text segmentation results can also be used for object-based video encoding such as that enabled by MPEG-4."

In this paper, by investigating the properties of single characters and text objects, we propose a new text extraction approach for scene images. First, character energy is computed based on the similarity of stroke edges to detect candidate character regions, then link energy is calculated based on the spatial relationship and similarity between neighboring candidate character regions to group characters and eliminate false positives. We applied the approach on ICDAR dataset 2003. The experimental results demonstrate the validity of our method."

With the rapid growth in research over thelast few years on recognizing text in natural scenes, thereis an urgent need to establish some common benchmarkdatasets, and gain a clear understanding of the current stateof the art. We use the term robust reading to refer to text imagesthat are beyond the capabilities of current commercialOCR packages. We chose to break down the robust readingproblem into three sub-problems, and run competitionsfor each stage, and also a competition for the best overallsystem. The sub-problems we chose were text locating,character recognition and word recognition.By breaking down the problem in this way, we hope togain a better understanding of the state of the art in eachof the sub-problems. Furthermore, our methodology involvesstoring detailed results of applying each algorithm toeach image in the data sets, allowing researchers to study indepth the strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm. Thetext locating contest was the only one to have any entries.We report the results of this contest, and show cases wherethe leading algorithms succeed and fail."

We first describe a simple but efficient text detection and recognition method based on analysis of maximally stable extremal regions (MSERs) and simple template matching which allows to provide initial character recognition results. The main emphasis of the paper is on introducing a novel method for exploiting contextual information to improve the obtained recognition results. We propose to analyze the results of Web search engine queries on two levels of detail, which both allow to significantly improve the overall text recognition performance. The experimental evaluations on reference data sets prove that even based on a low quality single character recognition method the proposed Web search engine extension enables reasonable text recognition results."

A classifier (e.g. neural network or adaboost trained classifier) within the detector selects a relevant subset of extremal regions, i.e. regions that are connected components of a thresholded image. Properties of extremal regions render the detector very robust to illumination change. Robustness to viewpoint change is achieved by using invariant descriptors and/or by modeling shape variations by the classifier. \n \nThe approach is brought to bear on three problems: text detection, face segmentation and leopard skin detection. High detection rates were obtained for unconstrained (i.e. brightness, affine and font invariant) text detection (92%) with a reasonable false positive rate. \n \nThe time-complexity of the detection is approximately linear in the number of pixels and a non-optimized implementation runs at about 1 frame per second for a 640\u00d7 480 image on a high-end PC."

Experimental results show that the combination system is both much more accurate and more reliable when compared with individual engines, thus it can fully satisfy the need of digital content re-mastering applications."
