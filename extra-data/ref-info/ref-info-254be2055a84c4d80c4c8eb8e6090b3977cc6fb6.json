It allows us to focus attention on relevant data, saving eeort and reducing false positives. In particular, the information content of a man-made scene is typically conned to a small set of scales. We devise a scale space based measure of image information. Kullback contrasts between successive resolution lengths gives the diierential information gain. Experiments show that this measure gives a clear indication of characteristic lengths in a variety of real world images and is superior to power spectrum based measurements. Decomposing the expected information gain into spatial coordinates gives us a saliency map for use by an attention selector. Last we combine the scale and spatial decompositions into a single information measure, giving both the spatial extent and scale range of interest. The information measure has an eecient implementation , and thus can be used routinely in early vision processing."

To achieve this aim, new kinds of vision algorithms need to be developed which run in real time and subserve the robot's goals. Two fundamental goals are determining the location of a known object. Color can be successfully used for both tasks.This article demonstrates that color histograms of multicolored objects provide a robust, efficient cue for indexing into a large database of models. It shows that color histograms are stable object representations in the presence of occlusion and over change in view, and that they can differentiate among a large number of objects. For solving the identification problem, it introduces a technique calledHistogram Intersection, which matches model and image histograms and a fast incremental version of Histogram Intersection, which allows real-time indexing into a large database of stored models. For solving the location problem it introduces an algorithm calledHistogram Backprojection, which performs this task efficiently in crowded scenes."

For example, we desire to obtain an understanding of natural scenes, containing roads, buildings, trees, bushes, etc., as typified by the two frames from a sequence illustrated in Figure 1. The solution to this problem that we are pursuing is to use a computer vision system based upon motion analysis of a monocular image sequence from a mobile camera. By extraction and tracking of image features, representations of the 3D analogues of these features can be constructed."

A front-end vision system is designed to establish a convenient format of some sampled scalar field, which is suited for postprocessing by various dedicated routines. The emphasis is on the motivations and implications of symmetries of the environment; they pose natural, a priori constraints on the design of a front-end.The focus is on static images, defined on a multidimensional spatial domain, for which it is assumed that there are no a priori preferred points, directions, or scales. In addition, the front-end is required to be linear. These requirements are independent of any particular image geometry and express the front-end's pure syntactical, \u201cbottom up\u201d nature.It is shown that these symmetries suffice to establish the functionality properties of a front-end. For each location in the visual field and each inner scale it comprises a hierarchical family of tensorial apertures, known as the Gaussian family, the lowest order of which is the normalised Gaussian. The family can be truncated at any given order in a consistent way. The resulting set constitutes a basis for alocal jet bundle.\nNote that scale-space theory shows up here without any call upon the \u201cprohibition of spurious detail\u201d, which, in some way or another, usually forms the basic starting point for \u201cdiffusion-like\u201d scale-space theories."

The key is to propose some efficient models associated to each of these features directly from the image by searching the parameters of the model that best approximate the observed grey level image intensities. Due to the large amount of time required by a first approach that assumes the blur of the imaging acquisition system to be describable by a 2-D Gaussian filter, different solutions that drastically reduce this computational time are considered and developed. The problem of the initialization phase in the minimization process is considered, and an original and efficient solution is proposed. A large number of experiments involving real images are conducted in order to test and compare the reliability, the robustness, and the efficiency of the proposed approaches.<<ETX>>"

On the premise that changes in resolution act as a smoothing equivalent to changes in scale, a scale-space representation of the high-resolution image is produced. Hence the one-to-one classical image matching paradigm becomes one-to-many because the low-resolution image is compared with all the scale-space representations of the high-resolution one. Key to the success of such a process is the proper representation of the features to be matched in scale-space. We show how to extract interest points at variable scales and we devise a method allowing the comparison of two images at two different resolutions. The method comprises the use of photometric- and rotation-invariant descriptors, a geometric model mapping the high-resolution image onto a low-resolution image region, and an image matching strategy based on the robust estimation of this geometric model. Extensive experiments show that our matching method can be used for scale changes up to a factor 6."

We show that a descriptive language limited to a low-order polynomial description of the intensity variation within each region and a chain-code-like description of the region boundaries yields intuitively satisfying partitions for a wide class of images.The advantage of this formulation is that it can be extended to deal with subsequent steps of the image understanding problem (or to deal with other attributes, such as texture) in a natural way by augmenting the descriptive language. Experiments performed on a variety of both real and synthetic images demonstrate the superior performance of this approach over partitioning techniques based on clustering vectors of local image attributes and standard edge-detection techniques."

Here, we deal with the development of a computational approach to these important features. We consider first a corner model and study analytically its behavior once it has been smoothed using the well-known Gaussian filter. This allows us to clarify the behavior of some well-knowncornerness measure based approaches used to detect these points of interest. Most of these classical approaches appear to detect points that do not correspond to the exact position of the corner. A new scale-space based approach that combines useful properties from the Laplacian and Beaudet's measure (Beaudet 1978) is then proposed in order to correct and detect exactly the corner position. An extension of this approach is then developed to solve the problem of trihedral vertex characterization and detection. In particular, it is shown that a trihedral vertex has two elliptic maxima on extremal contrast surfaces if the contrast is sufficient, and this allows us to classify trihedral vertexes in 2 classes: \u201cvertex,\u201d and \u201cvertex as corner.\u201d The corner-detection approach developed is applied to accurately detect trihedral vertexes using an additional test in order to make a distinction between trihedral vertexes and corners. Many experiments have been carried out using noisy synthetic data and real images containing corners and vertexes. Most of the promising results obtained are used to illustrate the experimental section of this paper."

(1) Intensity changes, which occur in a natural image over a wide range of scales, are detected separately at different scales. An appropriate filter for this purpose at a given scale is found to be the second derivative of a Gaussian, and it is shown that, provided some simple conditions are satisfied, these primary filters need not be orientation-dependent. Thus, intensity changes at a given scale are best detected by finding the zero values of \u22072G(x, y)* I(x, y) for image I, where G(x, y) is a two-dimensional Gaussian distribution and \u22072 is the Laplacian. The intensity changes thus discovered in each of the channels are then represented by oriented primitives called zero-crossing segments, and evidence is given that this representation is complete. (2) Intensity changes in images arise from surface discontinuities or from reflectance or illumination boundaries, and these all have the property that they are spatially localized. Because of this, the zero-crossing segments from the different channels are not independent, and rules are deduced for combining them into a description of the image. This description is called the raw primal sketch. The theory explains several basic psychophysical findings, and the operation of forming oriented zero-crossing segments from the output of centre-surround \u22072G filters acting on the image forms the basis for a physiological model of simple cells (see Marr & Ullman 1979)."

This article shows how a general heuristic principle for scale selection can be applied to the problem of detecting and localizing junctions. In a first uncommitted processing step initial hypotheses about interesting scale levels (and regions of interest) are generated from scales where normalized differential invariants assume maxima over scales (and space). Then, based on this scale (and region) information, a more refined processing stage is invoked tuned to the task at hand. The resulting method is the first junction detector with automatic scale selection. Whereas this article deals with the specific problem of junction detection, the underlying ideas apply also to other types of differential feature detectors, such as blob detectors, edge detectors, and ridge defectors.<<ETX>>"

This algorithm is derived by minimizing a generalized Bayes/minimum description length (MDL) criterion using the variational principle. The algorithm is guaranteed to converge to a local minimum and combines aspects of snakes/balloons and region growing. The classic snakes/balloons and region growing algorithms can be directly derived from our approach. We provide theoretical analysis of region competition including accuracy of boundary location, criteria for initial conditions, and the relationship to edge detection using filters. It is straightforward to generalize the algorithm to multiband segmentation and we demonstrate it on gray level images, color images and texture images. The novel color model allows us to eliminate intensity gradients and shadows, thereby obtaining segmentation based on the albedos of objects. It also helps detect highlight regions."

                "text": "In practice the relevant details of images exist only over a restricted range of scale. Hence it is important to study the dependence of image structure on the level of resolution. It seems clear enough that visual perception treats images on several levels of resolution simultaneously and that this fact must be important for the study of perception. However, no applicable mathematically formulated theory to deal with such problems appers to exist. In this paper it is shown that any image can be embedded in a one-parameter family of derived images (with resolution as the parameter) in essentially only one unique way if the constraint that no spurious detail should be generated when the resolution is diminished, is applied. The structure of this family is governed by the well known diffusion equation (a parabolic, linear, partial differential equation of the second order). As such the structure fits into existing theories that treat the front end of the visual system as a continuous tack of homogeneous layer, characterized by iterated local processing schemes. When resolution is decreased the images becomes less articulated because the extrem (\u201clight and dark blobs\u201d) disappear one after the other. This erosion of structure is a simple process that is similar in every case. As a result any image can be described as a juxtaposed and nested set of light and dark blobs, wherein each blod has a limited range of resolution in which it manifests itself. The structure of the family of derived images permits a derivation of the sampling density required to sample the image at multiple scales of resolution. The natural scale along the resolution axis (leading to an informationally uniform sampling density) is logarithmic, thus the structure is apt for the description of size invariances."

Orientation invariance is obtained by the determination of the dominant local orientation and by steering the receptive fields to this orientation. \n \nData is represented structurally in a feature space that is designed for the recognition of static object configurations. In this space an image is modeled by the vectorial representation of the receptive field responses at each pixel, forming a surface in the feature space. Recognition is achieved by measuring the distance between the vector of normalized receptive fields responses of an observed neighborhood and the surface point of the image model. \n \nThe power of a scale equivariant feature space is validated by experimental results for point correspondences in images of different scales and the recognition of objects under different view points."

In this paper we describe the mathematical foundations of the technique and present the results of experiments which compare robustness and recognition rates for different local neighborhood operators and histogram similarity measurements."

Salient features are those which have a low probability of being mis-classified with any other feature, and are therefore more easily found in a similar image containing an example of the object. The local image structure can be described by vectors extracted using a standard \u2018feature extractor\u2019 at a range of scales. We train statistical models for each feature, using vectors taken from a number of training examples. The feature models can then be used to find the probability of misclassifying a feature with all other features. Low probabilities indicate a salient feature.

The representation differs from established techniques in that the code elements are localized in spatial frequency as well as in space. Pixel-to-pixel correlations are first removed by subtracting a lowpass filtered copy of the image from the image itself. The result is a net data compression since the difference, or error, image has low variance and entropy, and the low-pass filtered image may represented at reduced sample density. Further data compression is achieved by quantizing the difference image. These steps are then repeated to compress the low-pass image. Iteration of the process at appropriately expanded scales generates a pyramid data structure. The encoding process is equivalent to sampling the image with Laplacian operators of many scales. Thus, the code tends to enhance salient image features. A further advantage of the present code is that it is well suited for many image analysis tasks as well as for image compression. Fast algorithms are described for coding and decoding."

Salient points are those which have a low probability of being mistaken with other points in the face, and therefore are more likely to be correctly located in a second face. The local image structure at each image point is described by vectors of Cartesian differential invariants computed at a range of scales. Salient points lie in low density regions of the distribution of all vectors of invariants found in an image. The vectors of invariants of salient points are used to locate similar features in a second image. Results are presented, showing that salient facial features can be relocated more reliably than arbitrary facial features."

The first step is to extract edges from the original image using a Canny detector (1986). The corner points of an image are defined as points where image edges have their maxima of absolute curvature. The corner points are detected at a high scale of the CSS and tracked through multiple lower scales to improve localization. This method is very robust to noise, and we believe that it performs better than the existing corner detectors An improvement to Canny edge detector's response to 45/spl deg/ and 135/spl deg/ edges is also proposed. Furthermore, the CSS detector can provide additional point features (curvature zero-crossings of image edge contours) in addition to the traditional corners."

It is shown how such a representation can function as the substrate for \u201cpoint processors\u201d computing geometrical features such as edge curvature. We obtain a clear dichotomy between local and multilocal visual routines. The terms of the truncated Taylor series representing the jets are partial derivatives whose corresponding RF profiles closely mimic the well known units in the primary visual cortex. Hence this description provides a novel means to understand and classify these units.Taking the receptive field outputs as the basic input data one may devise visual routines that compute geometric features on the basis of standard differential geometry exploiting the equivalence with the local jets (partial derivatives with respect to the space coordinates)."

We show that these properties taken together constrain the structure of receptive fields to a very large degree. Only those field structures that arise as solutions of a certain linear partial differential equation of the second order prove to satisfy these general constraints. The equation admits of complete, orthonormal families of solutions. These families have to be regarded as the possible receptive field families subject to certain symmetry conditions. They can be transformed into each other via unitary transformations. Thus a single representation suffices to construct all the others. This theory permits us to classify the possible linear receptive field structures exhaustively, and to define their internal and external interrelations. This induces a principled taxonomy of linear receptive fields."

It compares consecutive band-pass images of a Gaussian multiscale decomposition to extract the objects that appear between given scales. The comparison is performed using original distributed entropy measures. The application to building detection in aerial images shows that scale is a robust and precise criterion for the detection of man-made objects. They also show that distributed entropic tools are relevant for the comparison of band-pass images. From a more theoretical point of view, this method stands between the scale-space and wavelet approaches. It tries to infer the geometrical concept of scale found in the scale-space theory into the algebraic scale of the wavelet theory."

It permits efficient compression of a variety of signals, such as sound and images. The predefined libraries of modulated waveforms include orthogonal wavelet-packets and localized trigonometric functions, and have reasonably well-controlled time-frequency localization properties. The idea is to build out of the library functions an orthonormal basis relative to which the given signal or collection of signals has the lowest information cost. The method relies heavily on the remarkable orthogonality properties of the new libraries: all expansions in a given library conserve energy and are thus comparable. Several cost functionals are useful; one of the most attractive is Shannon entropy, which has a geometric interpretation in this context. >"

The MFNN employs features computed in both the spatial and spectral domain and uses spectral entropy as a decision parameter. Backpropagation with Kalman filtering (KF) is employed to allow more efficient network training as required for evaluation of different features, input images, and related error analysis. A previously reported, wavelet-based image-enhancement method is also employed to enhance microcalcification clusters for improved detection. The relative performance of the MFNN for both the raw and enhanced images is evaluated using a common image database of 30 digitized mammograms, with 20 images containing 21 biopsy proven MCCs and ten normal cases. The computed sensitivity (true positive (TP) detection rate) was 90.1% with an average low false positive (FP) detection of 0.71 MCCs/image for the enhanced images using a modified k-fold validation error estimation technique. The corresponding computed sensitivity for the raw images was reduced to 81.4% and with 0.59 FP's MCCs/image. A relative comparison to an earlier neural network (NN) design, using only spatially related features, suggests the importance of the addition of spectral domain features when the raw image data is analyzed."

The method is applicable to any linear optical element with variable focusing strength along the reference orbit. Results for the vertical and horizontal focal lengths agree with previous calculations for a zero gradient magnet and an added correction to the dispersion is found for this case. A correction to the fringe field gradient peculiar to a combined-function magnet with strong edge focusing is also found. The influence of edge focusing on the tunes and chromaticities of the NSLS rings is described. The improved chromaticity calculation for the booster was of particular interest since this ring has bending magnets with poletips shaped to achieve small positive chromaticities."
