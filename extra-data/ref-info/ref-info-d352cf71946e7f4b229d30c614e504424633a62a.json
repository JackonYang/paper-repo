The members may have complex zeros, but it is necessary that h should have no zeros in common with its Hilbert transform h other than real simple zeros. It is then sufficient that the band be less than an octave in width. The subclass is shown to include full-carrier upper-sideband signals (of less than an octave bandwidth). Also it is shown that full-carrier lower-sideband signals have only real simple zeros (for any ratio of upper and tower frequencies) and, hence, are readily identified by their zero crossings. However, under the most general conditions for uniqueness, the problem of actually recovering h from its sign changes appears to be very difficult and impractical."

A fundamental problem in computing such descriptions is scale: a derivative must be taken over some neighborhood, but there is seldom a principled basis for choosing its size. Scale-space filtering is a method that describes signals qualitatively, managing the ambiguity of scale in an organized and natural way. The signal is first expanded by convolution with gaussian masks over a continuum of sizes.

(1) Intensity changes, which occur in a natural image over a wide range of scales, are detected separately at different scales. An appropriate filter for this purpose at a given scale is found to be the second derivative of a Gaussian, and it is shown that, provided some simple conditions are satisfied, these primary filters need not be orientation-dependent. Thus, intensity changes at a given scale are best detected by finding the zero values of \u22072G(x, y)* I(x, y) for image I, where G(x, y) is a two-dimensional Gaussian distribution and \u22072 is the Laplacian. The intensity changes thus discovered in each of the channels are then represented by oriented primitives called zero-crossing segments, and evidence is given that this representation is complete. (2) Intensity changes in images arise from surface discontinuities or from reflectance or illumination boundaries, and these all have the property that they are spatially localized. Because of this, the zero-crossing segments from the different channels are not independent, and rules are deduced for combining them into a description of the image. This description is called the raw primal sketch. The theory explains several basic psychophysical findings, and the operation of forming oriented zero-crossing segments from the output of centre-surround \u22072G filters acting on the image forms the basis for a physiological model of simple cells (see Marr & Ullman 1979)."

Edge detection operators are typically designed to optimally estimate first or second derivative over some (usually small) support. Other criteria such as output signal to noise ratio or bandwidth have also been argued for. This paper describes an attempt to formulate a set of edge detection criteria that capture as directly as possible the desirable properties of the detector. Variational techniques are used to find a solution over the space of all possible functions. The first criterion is that the detector have low probability of error i.e. failing to mark edges or falsely marking non-edges. The second is that the marked points should be as close as possible to the centre of the true edge. The third criterion is that there should be low probability of more than one response to a single edge. The third criterion is claimed to be new, and it became necessary when an operator designed using the first two criteria was found to have excessive multiple responses. The edge model that will be considered here is a one-dimensional step edge in white Gaussian noise although the same technique has been applied to an extended impulse or ridge profile. The result is a one dimensional operator that approximates the first derivative of a Gaussian. Its extension to two dimensions is also discussed."

                "text": "An introduction is given to a theory of early visual information processing. The theory has been implemented, and examples are given of images at various stages of analysis. It is argued that the first step of consequence is to compute a primitive but rich description of the grey-level changes present in an image. The description is expressed in a vocabulary of kinds of intensity change (EDGE, SHADING-EDGE, EXTENDED-EDGE, LINE, BLOB etc.). Modifying parameters are bound to the elements in the description, specifying their POSITION, ORIENTATION, TERMINATION points, CONTRAST, SIZE and FUZZINESS. This description is obtained from the intensity array by fixed techniques, and it is called the primal sketch. For most images, the primal sketch is large and unwieldy. The second important step in visual information processing is to group its contents in a way that is appropriate for later recognition. From our ability to interpret drawings with little semantic content, one may infer the presence in our perceptual equipment of symbolic processes that can define \"place-tokens\" in an image in various ways, and can group them according to certain rules. Homomorphic techniques fail to account for many of these grouping phenomena, whose explanations require mechanisms of construction rather than mechanisms of detection. The necessary grouping of elements in the primal sketch may be achieved by a mechanism that has available the processes inferred from above, together with the ability to select items by first order discriminations acting on the elements' parameters. Only occasionally do these mechanisms use downward-flowing information about the contents of the particular image being processed. It is argued that \"non-attentive\" vision is in practice implemented by these grouping operations and first order discriminations acting on the primal sketch. The class of computations so obtained differs slightly from the class of second order operations on the intensity array. The extraction of a form from the primal sketch using these techniques amounts to the separation of figure from ground. It is concluded that most of the separation can be carried out by using techniques that do not depend upon the particular image in question. Therefore, figure-ground separation can normally precede the description of the shape of the extracted form. Up to this point, higher-level knowledge and purpose are brought to bear on only a few of the decisions taken during the processing. This relegates the widespread use of downward-flowing information to a later stage than is found in current machine-vision programs, and implies that such knowledge should influence the control of, rather than interfering with, the actual data-processing that is taking place lower down."

A few minor errors are corrected, and references are given to the writings of certain other authors that have appeared in the interval. Though these are strongly critical of Prof. Bridgman's doctrines, he sees no reason to change his opinions; he prefers, therefore, not to enter into controversy, but to leave his readers to judge between him and his critics. This procedure is entirely creditable to Prof. Bridgman, and certainly preferable to an attempt to expound views with which he has no sympathy. But the whole position is not creditable to science. The differences that divide Prof. Bridgman from his critics are not matters of opinion; they concern the validity of certain quite simple logical arguments; one side in the dispute must be definitely right and the other definitely wrong. Let us hope that the appearance of this reprint will encourage impartial examination of the controversy and lead to the final establishment of the truth.Dimensional Analysis.Prof.P. W.BridgmanBy.

Since expert analysts must deal with very large, yet incomplete, data bases of unreliable facts about a complex world, the project would stringently test the applicability of Artificial Intelligence techniques. After a significant effort however, I am forced to the conclusion that an intelligent, real-world system of the kind envisioned is currently out of reach. Some of the difficulties were due to the size and complexity of the domain. As its true scale became evident, the available resources progressively appeared less adequate. The representation and reasoning problems that arose were persistently difficult and fundamental work is needed before the tools will be sufficient to engineer truly intelligent assistants. Despite these difficulties perhaps even because of them, much can be learned from the project. To assist further applications projects, I explain in this report some of the reasons for the negative result, and also describe some positive ideas that were gained along the way. In doing so, I hope to convey the respect I have developed for the complexity of real-world domains, and the difficulty of describing the ways experts deal them. (Author)"
