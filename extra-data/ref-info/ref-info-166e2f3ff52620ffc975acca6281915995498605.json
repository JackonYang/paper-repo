Documents often contain tables in order to communicate densely packed, multi-dimensional information. Tables do this by employing layout patterns to efficiently indicate fields and records in two-dimensional form.Their rich combination of formatting and content present difficulties for traditional language modeling techniques, however. This paper presents the use of conditional random fields (CRFs) for table extraction, and compares them with hidden Markov models (HMMs). Unlike HMMs, CRFs support the use of many rich and overlapping layout and language features, and as a result, they perform significantly better. We show experimental results on plain-text government statistical reports in which tables are located with 92% F1, and their constituent lines are classified into 12 table-related categories with 94% accuracy. We also discuss future work on undirected graphical models for segmenting columns, finding cells, and classifying them as data cells or label cells."

In this paper, we consider the problem of table detection in web documents. Its potential applications include web mining, knowledge management, and web content summarization and delivery to narrow-bandwidth devices. We describe a machine learning based approach to classify each given table entity as either genuine or non-genuine. Various features reflecting the layout as well as content characteristics of tables are studied.In order to facilitate the training and evaluation of our table classifier, we designed a novel web document table ground truthing protocol and used it to build a large table ground truth database. The database consists of 1,393 HTML files collected from hundreds of different web sites and contains 11,477 leaf TABLE elements, out of which 1,740 are genuine tables. Experiments were conducted using the cross validation method and an F-measure of 95.89% was achieved."

Additionally, the learning system is modular, and can be easily adapted to new domains and tasks. The learning system described is part of an \"industrial-strength\" wrapper management system that is in active use at WhizBang Labs. Controlled experiments show that the learner has broader coverage and a faster learning rate than earlier wrapper-learning systems."

How is a table different from a list? How is a list different from a Table of Content (TOC)? Does geometric alignment of content guarantee a robust structure? Or how much semantic relationship needs to be included within the content to qualify a region as such? What is the role of cross-disciplinary techniques used by Information Retrieval (IR) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) communities in understanding tables and forms? These also can be recursive, e.g. a table can contain images, lists and even tables. These are only some of the questions that need answering. At the Third International Workshop on Document Layout Interpretation and its Applications (DLIA 2003)1 the participants discovered the common interest in tables, so that the discussion group topics were changed to cover tables. This special issue is a result of that observed interest. In many document image-processing tasks, detection and understanding of tables and forms pose a huge challenge. Detection of tables and forms in electronic documents can be one small part of a series of tasks required for document processing, but often the accuracy of physical and logical layout extraction from these documents depends to a great extent on the accuracy of this solution available to the system. Because errors at this stage tend to get magnified as the subsequent processes are applied in sequence. Beside"

We start by defining table. Then we describe the steps involved in extracting information from tables and analyse table-related research to place the contribution of different authors, find the paths research is following, and identify issues that are still unsolved. We then analyse current approaches to evaluating table processing algorithms and propose two new metrics for the task of segmenting cells/columns/rows. We proceed to design our own end-to-end method, where there is a higher interaction between different steps; we indicate how back loops in the usual order of the steps can reduce the possibility of errors and contribute to solving previously unsolved problems. Finally, we explore how the actual interpretation of the table not only allows inferring the accuracy of the overall extraction process but also contributes to actually improving its quality. In order to do so, we believe interpretation has to consider context-specific knowledge; we explore how the addition of this knowledge can be made in a plug-in/out manner, such that the overall method will maintain its operability in different contexts."

Chapter 3 focuses on selection of two-level factorial designs and discusses complementary design theory and related topics in the selection of designs. Chapter 4 covers the selection of three level designs followed by the general case of s-levels. Chapter 5 discusses estimation capacity, presenting the connections with complementary designs followed by the estimation capacity for two-level and s-level designs. Chapter 6 discusses and presents results for the construction of mixed-level designs. Giving many examples of the use of mixed two and four-level designs. The final unit of the book discusses designs where there are two-different groups of factors. Chapters 7 and 8 discuss factorial designs with restricted randomization. Focusing first on blocked designs for full factorials as well as blocked fractional factorial designs. Chapter 8 focuses on split-plot designs. The booked is concluded with a chapter on robust parameter designs. This book covers a broad range of topics for regular factorial designs and presents all of the material in very mathematical fashion. However, the authors do a wonderful job of keeping the statistical methodology at the forefront of the book and the mathematical detail is presented as the necessary tool to study these designs. The book will serve as a great text for an advanced graduate level course in design theory for students with the necessary mathematical background. The book will surely become an invaluable resource for researchers and graduate students doing research in the design of factorial experiments. In addition, practitioners will also find the book useful for the comprehensive collection of optimal designs presented at the end of many chapters. Overall, this is a very well written book and a necessary addition to the existing literature on the design of factorial experiments."
