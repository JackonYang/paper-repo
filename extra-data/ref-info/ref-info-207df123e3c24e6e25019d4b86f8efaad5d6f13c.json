                "text": "This thesis describes a novel statistical named-entity (i.e. \u201cproper name\u201d) recognition system known as \u201cMENE\u201d (Maximum Entropy Named Entity). Named entity (N.E.) recognition is a form of information extraction in which we seek to classify every word in a document as being a person-name, organization, location, date, time, monetary value, percentage, or \u201cnone of the above\u201d. The task has particular significance for Internet search engines, machine translation, the automatic indexing of documents, and as a foundation for work on more complex information extraction tasks. \nTwo of the most significant problems facing the constructor of a named entity system are the questions of portability and system performance. A practical N.E. system will need to be ported frequently to new bodies of text and even to new languages. The challenge is to build a system which can be ported with minimal expense (in particular minimal programming by a computational linguist) while maintaining a high degree of accuracy in the new domains or languages. \nMENE attempts to address these issues through the use of maximum entropy probabilistic modeling. It utilizes a very flexible object-based architecture which allows it to make use of a broad range of knowledge sources in making its tagging decisions. In the DARPA-sponsored MUC-7 named entity evaluation, the system displayed an accuracy rate which was well-above the median, demonstrating that it can achieve the performance goal. In addition, we demonstrate that the system can be used as a post-processing tool to enhance the output of a hand-coded named entity recognizer through experiments in which MENE improved on the performance of N.E. systems from three different sites. Furthermore, when all three external recognizers are combined under MENE, we are able to achieve very strong results which, in some cases, appear to be competitive with human performance. \nFinally, we demonstrate the trans-lingual portability of the system. We ported the system to two Japanese-language named entity tasks, one of which involved a new named entity category, \u201cartifact\u201d. Our results on these tasks were competitive with the best systems built by native Japanese speakers despite the fact that the author speaks no Japanese."

We have evaluated the model in English (based on data from the Sixth and Seventh Message Understanding Conferences [MUC-6, MUC-7] and broadcast news) and in Spanish (based on data distributed through the First Multilingual Entity Task [MET-1]), and on speech input (based on broadcast news). We report results here on standard materials only to quantify performance on data available to the community, namely, MUC-6 and MET-1. Results have been consistently better than reported by any other learning algorithm. IdentiFinder's performance is competitive with approaches based on handcrafted rules on mixed case text and superior on text where case information is not available. We also present a controlled experiment showing the effect of training set size on performance, demonstrating that as little as 100,000 words of training data is adequate to get performance around 90% on newswire. Although we present our understanding of why this algorithm performs so well on this class of problems, we believe that significant improvement in performance may still be possible."

Its machine learning technology, based on the maximum entropy framework, is highly reusable and not specific to the parsing problem, while the linguistic hints that it uses to learn can be specified concisely. It therefore requires a minimal amount of human effort and linguistic knowledge for its construction. In practice, the running time of the parser on a test sentence is linear with respect to the sentence length. We also demonstrate that the parser can train from other domains without modification to the modeling framework or the linguistic hints it uses to learn. Furthermore, this paper shows that research into rescoring the top 20 parses returned by the parser might yield accuracies dramatically higher than the state-of-the-art."

We propose a general statistical model for text chunking which we then convert into a classification problem. We argue that the Winnow family of algorithms is particularly suitable for solving classification problems arising from NLP applications, due to their robustness to irrelevant features. However in theory, Winnow may not converge for linearly non-separable data. To remedy this problem, we employ a generalization of the original Winnow method. An additional advantage of the new algorithm is that it provides reliable confidence estimates for its classification predictions. This property is required in our statistical modeling approach. We show that our system achieves state of the art performance in text chunking with less computational cost then previous systems."
