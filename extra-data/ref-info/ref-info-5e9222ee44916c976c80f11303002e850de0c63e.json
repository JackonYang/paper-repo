The generality of the approach makes it possible to deal with all kinds of solutions: orthogonal, oblique and various mixtures of these. By choosing the fixed parameters appropriately, factors can be defined to have desired properties and make subsequent rotation unnecessary. The goodness of fit of the maximum likelihood solution under the hypothesis represented by the fixed parameters is tested by a large samplex2 test based on the likelihood ratio technique. A by-product of the procedure is an estimate of the variance-covariance matrix of the estimated parameters. From this, approximate confidence intervals for the parameters can be obtained. Several examples illustrating the usefulness of the procedure are given."

Clustering ofteachers into distinct teaching styles is carried out using a latent class model, and comparison of these latent classes for differences in pupil achievement is examined using unbalanced variance component (\"mixed\") models. Differences among the classes are altered by the prob abilistic clustering of the latent class model compared to the original findings of the Teaching Styles project, and the statistical significance of the differences is substantially reduced when allowance is made for the correlation among children taught by the same teacher."
