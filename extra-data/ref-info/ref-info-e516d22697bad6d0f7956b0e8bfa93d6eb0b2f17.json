However, generating an accurate and complete description requires identifying all entities, their mutual interactions and the context of the image. In this work, we show that an intermediate image-to-attributes layer can dramatically improve captioning results over the current approach which directly connects an RNN to a CNN. We propose a two-stage procedure for training such an attribute-based approach: in the first stage, we mine a number of keywords from the training sentences which we use as semantic attributes for images, and learn the mapping from images to those attributes with a CNN; in the second stage, we learn the mapping from detected attribute occurrence likelihoods to sentence description using LSTM. We then demonstrate the effectiveness of our two-stage model with captioning experiments on three benchmark datasets, which are Flickr8k, Flickr30K and MS COCO."

Using linguistic context and visual features, our method is able to efficiently hypothesize the semantic meaning of new words and add them to its word dictionary so that they can be used to describe images which contain these novel concepts. Our method has an image captioning module based on with several improvements. In particular, we propose a transposed weight sharing scheme, which not only improves performance on image captioning, but also makes the model more suitable for the novel concept learning task. We propose methods to prevent overfitting the new concepts. In addition, three novel concept datasets are constructed for this new task, and are publicly available on the project page. In the experiments, we show that our method effectively learns novel visual concepts from a few examples without disturbing the previously learned concepts.

We use multiple instance learning to train visual detectors for words that commonly occur in captions, including many different parts of speech such as nouns, verbs, and adjectives. The word detector outputs serve as conditional inputs to a maximum-entropy language model. The language model learns from a set of over 400,000 image descriptions to capture the statistics of word usage. We capture global semantics by re-ranking caption candidates using sentence-level features and a deep multimodal similarity model. Our system is state-of-the-art on the official Microsoft COCO benchmark, producing a BLEU-4 score of 29.1%. When human judges compare the system captions to ones written by other people on our held-out test set, the system captions have equal or better quality 34% of the time."

The recent advances in image captioning as well as the release of large-scale movie description datasets such as MPII-MD [28] and M-VAD [31] allow to study this task in more depth. Many of the proposed methods for image captioning rely on pre-trained object classifier CNNs and Long Short-Term Memory recurrent networks (LSTMs) for generating descriptions. While image description focuses on objects, we argue that it is important to distinguish verbs, objects, and places in the setting of movie description. In this work we show how to learn robust visual classifiers from the weak annotations of the sentence descriptions. Based on these classifiers we generate a description using an LSTM. We explore different design choices to build and train the LSTM and achieve the best performance to date on the challenging MPII-MD and M-VAD datasets. We compare and analyze our approach and prior work along various dimensions to better understand the key challenges of the movie description task."

Our approach leverages datasets of images and their sentence descriptions to learn about the inter-modal correspondences between language and visual data. Our alignment model is based on a novel combination of Convolutional Neural Networks over image regions, bidirectional Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) over sentences, and a structured objective that aligns the two modalities through a multimodal embedding. We then describe a Multimodal Recurrent Neural Network architecture that uses the inferred alignments to learn to generate novel descriptions of image regions. We demonstrate that our alignment model produces state of the art results in retrieval experiments on Flickr8K, Flickr30K and MSCOCO datasets. We then show that the generated descriptions outperform retrieval baselines on both full images and on a new dataset of region-level annotations. Finally, we conduct large-scale analysis of our RNN language model on the Visual Genome dataset of 4.1 million captions and highlight the differences between image and region-level caption statistics."

The first uses a pipelined process where a set of candidate words is generated by a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on images, and then a maximum entropy (ME) language model is used to arrange these words into a coherent sentence. The second uses the penultimate activation layer of the CNN as input to a recurrent neural network (RNN) that then generates the caption sequence. In this paper, we compare the merits of these different language modeling approaches for the first time by using the same state-ofthe-art CNN as input. We examine issues in the different approaches, including linguistic irregularities, caption repetition, and data set overlap. By combining key aspects of the ME and RNN methods, we achieve a new record performance over previously published results on the benchmark COCO dataset. However, the gains we see in BLEU do not translate to human judgments."

Our pipeline effectively unifies joint image-text embedding models with multimodal neural language models. We introduce the structure-content neural language model that disentangles the structure of a sentence to its content, conditioned on representations produced by the encoder. The encoder allows one to rank images and sentences while the decoder can generate novel descriptions from scratch. Using LSTM to encode sentences, we match the state-of-the-art performance on Flickr8K and Flickr30K without using object detections. We also set new best results when using the 19-layer Oxford convolutional network. Furthermore we show that with linear encoders, the learned embedding space captures multimodal regularities in terms of vector space arithmetic e.g. *image of a blue car* - \"blue\" + \"red\" is near images of red cars. Sample captions generated for 800 images are made available for comparison."

This limitation is in part due to the increasing difficulty of acquiring sufficient training data in the form of labeled images as the number of object categories grows. One remedy is to leverage data from other sources - such as text data - both to train visual models and to constrain their predictions. In this paper we present a new deep visual-semantic embedding model trained to identify visual objects using both labeled image data as well as semantic information gleaned from unannotated text. We demonstrate that this model matches state-of-the-art performance on the 1000-class ImageNet object recognition challenge while making more semantically reasonable errors, and also show that the semantic information can be exploited to make predictions about tens of thousands of image labels not observed during training. Semantic knowledge improves such zero-shot predictions achieving hit rates of up to 18% across thousands of novel labels never seen by the visual model."

In this paper, we present a generative model based on a deep recurrent architecture that combines recent advances in computer vision and machine translation and that can be used to generate natural sentences describing an image. The model is trained to maximize the likelihood of the target description sentence given the training image. Experiments on several datasets show the accuracy of the model and the fluency of the language it learns solely from image descriptions. Our model is often quite accurate, which we verify both qualitatively and quantitatively. For instance, while the current state-of-the-art BLEU-1 score (the higher the better) on the Pascal dataset is 25, our approach yields 59, to be compared to human performance around 69. We also show BLEU-1 score improvements on Flickr30k, from 56 to 66, and on SBU, from 19 to 28. Lastly, on the newly released COCO dataset, we achieve a BLEU-4 of 27.7, which is the current state-of-the-art."

This approach does not explicitly represent high-level semantic concepts, but rather seeks to progress directly from image features to text. In this paper we investigate whether this direct approach succeeds due to, or despite, the fact that it avoids the explicit representation of high-level information. We propose a method of incorporating high-level concepts into the successful CNN-RNN approach, and show that it achieves a significant improvement on the state-of-the-art in both image captioning and visual question answering. We also show that the same mechanism can be used to introduce external semantic information and that doing so further improves performance. We achieve the best reported results on both image captioning and VQA on several benchmark datasets, and provide an analysis of the value of explicit high-level concepts in V2L problems."

Described video datasets are scarce, and most existing methods have been applied to toy domains with a small vocabulary of possible words. By transferring knowledge from 1.2M+ images with category labels and 100,000+ images with captions, our method is able to create sentence descriptions of open-domain videos with large vocabularies. We compare our approach with recent work using language generation metrics, subject, verb, and object prediction accuracy, and a human evaluation."

The only necessary knowledge about unseen visual categories comes from unsupervised text corpora. Unlike previous zero-shot learning models, which can only differentiate between unseen classes, our model can operate on a mixture of seen and unseen classes, simultaneously obtaining state of the art performance on classes with thousands of training images and reasonable performance on unseen classes. This is achieved by seeing the distributions of words in texts as a semantic space for understanding what objects look like. Our deep learning model does not require any manually defined semantic or visual features for either words or images. Images are mapped to be close to semantic word vectors corresponding to their classes, and the resulting image embeddings can be used to distinguish whether an image is of a seen or unseen class. We then use novelty detection methods to differentiate unseen classes from seen classes. We demonstrate two novelty detection strategies; the first gives high accuracy on unseen classes, while the second is conservative in its prediction of novelty and keeps the seen classes' accuracy high."

In this paper, we tackle the challenge of recognizing and describing activities ``in-the-wild''. We present a solution that takes a short video clip and outputs a brief sentence that sums up the main activity in the video, such as the actor, the action and its object. Unlike previous work, our approach works on out-of-domain actions: it does not require training videos of the exact activity. If it cannot find an accurate prediction for a pre-trained model, it finds a less specific answer that is also plausible from a pragmatic standpoint. We use semantic hierarchies learned from the data to help to choose an appropriate level of generalization, and priors learned from Web-scale natural language corpora to penalize unlikely combinations of actors/actions/objects, we also use a Web-scale language model to ``fill in'' novel verbs, i.e. when the verb does not appear in the training set. We evaluate our method on a large YouTube corpus and demonstrate it is able to generate short sentence descriptions of video clips better than baseline approaches."

However, existing techniques restrict these properties to categorical labels (for example, a person is \u2018smiling\u2019 or not, a scene is \u2018dry\u2019 or not), and thus fail to capture more general semantic relationships. We propose to model relative attributes. Given training data stating how object/scene categories relate according to different attributes, we learn a ranking function per attribute. The learned ranking functions predict the relative strength of each property in novel images. We then build a generative model over the joint space of attribute ranking outputs, and propose a novel form of zero-shot learning in which the supervisor relates the unseen object category to previously seen objects via attributes (for example, \u2018bears are furrier than giraffes\u2019). We further show how the proposed relative attributes enable richer textual descriptions for new images, which in practice are more precise for human interpretation. We demonstrate the approach on datasets of faces and natural scenes, and show its clear advantages over traditional binary attribute prediction for these new tasks."

We propose a strategy for generating textual descriptions of videos by using a factor graph to combine visual detections with language statistics. We use state-of-the-art visual recognition systems to obtain confidences on entities, activities, and scenes present in the video. Our factor graph model combines these detection confidences with probabilistic knowledge mined from text corpora to estimate the most likely subject, verb, object, and place. Results on YouTube videos show that our approach improves both the joint detection of these latent, diverse sentence components and the detection of some individual components when compared to using the vision system alone, as well as over a previous n-gram language-modeling approach. The joint detection allows us to automatically generate more accurate, richer sentential descriptions of videos with a wide array of possible content."

We develop a novel recurrent convolutional architecture suitable for large-scale visual learning which is end-to-end trainable, and demonstrate the value of these models on benchmark video recognition tasks, image description and retrieval problems, and video narration challenges. In contrast to current models which assume a fixed spatio-temporal receptive field or simple temporal averaging for sequential processing, recurrent convolutional models are \u201cdoubly deep\u201d in that they can be compositional in spatial and temporal \u201clayers\u201d. Such models may have advantages when target concepts are complex and/or training data are limited. Learning long-term dependencies is possible when nonlinearities are incorporated into the network state updates. Long-term RNN models are appealing in that they directly can map variable-length inputs (e.g., video frames) to variable length outputs (e.g., natural language text) and can model complex temporal dynamics; yet they can be optimized with backpropagation. Our recurrent long-term models are directly connected to modern visual convnet models and can be jointly trained to simultaneously learn temporal dynamics and convolutional perceptual representations. Our results show such models have distinct advantages over state-of-the-art models for recognition or generation which are separately defined and/or optimized."

Unlike previous methods, our approach can annotate arbitrary videos without requiring the expensive collection and annotation of a similar training video corpus.

This is achieved by gathering images of complex everyday scenes containing common objects in their natural context. Objects are labeled using per-instance segmentations to aid in precise object localization. Our dataset contains photos of 91 objects types that would be easily recognizable by a 4 year old. With a total of 2.5 million labeled instances in 328k images, the creation of our dataset drew upon extensive crowd worker involvement via novel user interfaces for category detection, instance spotting and instance segmentation. We present a detailed statistical analysis of the dataset in comparison to PASCAL, ImageNet, and SUN. Finally, we provide baseline performance analysis for bounding box and segmentation detection results using a Deformable Parts Model."

Recently, deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have emerged as clear winners on object classification benchmarks, in part due to training with 1.2M+ labeled classification images. Unfortunately, only a small fraction of those labels are available for the detection task. It is much cheaper and easier to collect large quantities of image-level labels from search engines than it is to collect detection data and label it with precise bounding boxes. In this paper, we propose Large Scale Detection through Adaptation (LSDA), an algorithm which learns the difference between the two tasks and transfers this knowledge to classifiers for categories without bounding box annotated data, turning them into detectors. Our method has the potential to enable detection for the tens of thousands of categories that lack bounding box annotations, yet have plenty of classification data. Evaluation on the ImageNet LSVRC-2013 detection challenge demonstrates the efficacy of our approach. This algorithm enables us to produce a >7.6K detector by using available classification data from leaf nodes in the ImageNet tree. We additionally demonstrate how to modify our architecture to produce a fast detector (running at 2fps for the 7.6K detector). Models and software are available at lsda.berkeleyvision.org."

However, MTurk offers only limited control over who is allowed to particpate in a particular task. This is particularly problematic for tasks requiring free-form text entry. Unlike multiple-choice tasks there is no correct answer, and therefore control items for which the correct answer is known cannot be used. Furthermore, MTurk has no effective built-in mechanism to guarantee workers are proficient English writers. We describe our experience in creating corpora of images annotated with multiple one-sentence descriptions on MTurk and explore the effectiveness of different quality control strategies for collecting linguistic data using Mechanical MTurk. We find that the use of a qualification test provides the highest improvement of quality, whereas refining the annotations through follow-up tasks works rather poorly. Using our best setup, we construct two image corpora, totaling more than 40,000 descriptive captions for 9000 images."

The first part, content planning, smooths the output of computer vision-based detection and recognition algorithms with statistics mined from large pools of visually descriptive text to determine the best content words to use to describe an image. The second step, surface realization, chooses words to construct natural language sentences based on the predicted content and general statistics from natural language. We present multiple approaches for the surface realization step and evaluate each using automatic measures of similarity to human generated reference descriptions. We also collect forced choice human evaluations between descriptions from the proposed generation system and descriptions from competing approaches. The proposed system is very effective at producing relevant sentences for images. It also generates descriptions that are notably more true to the specific image content than previous work."

To approach this problem we propose a novel end-to-end sequence-to-sequence model to generate captions for videos. For this we exploit recurrent neural networks, specifically LSTMs, which have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in image caption generation. Our LSTM model is trained on video-sentence pairs and learns to associate a sequence of video frames to a sequence of words in order to generate a description of the event in the video clip. Our model naturally is able to learn the temporal structure of the sequence of frames as well as the sequence model of the generated sentences, i.e. a language model. We evaluate several variants of our model that exploit different visual features on a standard set of YouTube videos and two movie description datasets (M-VAD and MPII-MD)."

Scalability to large numbers of classes however remains an important challenge for today's recognition methods. Several authors have promoted knowledge transfer between classes as a key ingredient to address this challenge. However, in previous work the decision which knowledge to transfer has required either manual supervision or at least a few training examples limiting the scalability of these approaches. In this work we explicitly address the question of how to automatically decide which information to transfer between classes without the need of any human intervention. For this we tap into linguistic knowledge bases to provide the semantic link between sources (what) and targets (where) of knowledge transfer. We provide a rigorous experimental evaluation of different knowledge bases and state-of-the-art techniques from Natural Language Processing which goes far beyond the limited use of language in related work. We also give insights into the applicability (why) of different knowledge sources and similarity measures for knowledge transfer."

This situation has hardly been studied in computer vision research, even though it occurs frequently; the world contains tens of thousands of different object classes, and image collections have been formed and suitably annotated for only a few of them. To tackle the problem, we introduce attribute-based classification: Objects are identified based on a high-level description that is phrased in terms of semantic attributes, such as the object's color or shape. Because the identification of each such property transcends the specific learning task at hand, the attribute classifiers can be prelearned independently, for example, from existing image data sets unrelated to the current task. Afterward, new classes can be detected based on their attribute representation, without the need for a new training phase. In this paper, we also introduce a new data set, Animals with Attributes, of over 30,000 images of 50 animal classes, annotated with 85 semantic attributes. Extensive experiments on this and two more data sets show that attribute-based classification indeed is able to categorize images without access to any training images of the target classes."

Our main contribution is a thorough evaluation of networks of increasing depth using an architecture with very small (3x3) convolution filters, which shows that a significant improvement on the prior-art configurations can be achieved by pushing the depth to 16-19 weight layers. These findings were the basis of our ImageNet Challenge 2014 submission, where our team secured the first and the second places in the localisation and classification tracks respectively. We also show that our representations generalise well to other datasets, where they achieve state-of-the-art results. We have made our two best-performing ConvNet models publicly available to facilitate further research on the use of deep visual representations in computer vision."

The challenge has been run annually from 2010 to present, attracting participation from more than fifty institutions. This paper describes the creation of this benchmark dataset and the advances in object recognition that have been possible as a result. We discuss the challenges of collecting large-scale ground truth annotation, highlight key breakthroughs in categorical object recognition, provide a detailed analysis of the current state of the field of large-scale image classification and object detection, and compare the state-of-the-art computer vision accuracy with human accuracy. We conclude with lessons learned in the 5\u00a0years of the challenge, and propose future directions and improvements."

We address both problems by presenting a novel data collection framework that produces highly parallel text data relatively inexpensively and on a large scale. The highly parallel nature of this data allows us to use simple n-gram comparisons to measure both the semantic adequacy and lexical dissimilarity of paraphrase candidates. In addition to being simple and efficient to compute, experiments show that these metrics correlate highly with human judgments."

On the test data, we achieved top-1 and top-5 error rates of 37.5% and 17.0%, respectively, which is considerably better than the previous state-of-the-art. The neural network, which has 60 million parameters and 650,000 neurons, consists of five convolutional layers, some of which are followed by max-pooling layers, and three fully connected layers with a final 1000-way softmax. To make training faster, we used non-saturating neurons and a very efficient GPU implementation of the convolution operation. To reduce overfitting in the fully connected layers we employed a recently developed regularization method called \"dropout\" that proved to be very effective. We also entered a variant of this model in the ILSVRC-2012 competition and achieved a winning top-5 test error rate of 15.3%, compared to 26.2% achieved by the second-best entry."

The storyline of a video describes causal relationships between actions. Beyond recognition of individual actions, discovering causal relationships helps to better understand the semantic meaning of the activities. We present an approach to learn a visually grounded storyline model of videos directly from weakly labeled data. The storyline model is represented as an AND-OR graph, a structure that can compactly encode storyline variation across videos. The edges in the AND-OR graph correspond to causal relationships which are represented in terms of spatio-temporal constraints. We formulate an Integer Programming framework for action recognition and storyline extraction using the storyline model and visual groundings learned from training data."

In particular, humans can recognize tens of thousands of object classes and scenes. No computer vision algorithm today has been tested at this scale. This paper presents a study of large scale categorization including a series of challenging experiments on classification with more than 10, 000 image classes. We find that a) computational issues become crucial in algorithm design; b) conventional wisdom from a couple of hundred image categories on relative performance of different classifiers does not necessarily hold when the number of categories increases; c) there is a surprisingly strong relationship between the structure of WordNet (developed for studying language) and the difficulty of visual categorization; d) classification can be improved by exploiting the semantic hierarchy. Toward the future goal of developing automatic vision algorithms to recognize tens of thousands or even millions of image categories, we make a series of observations and arguments about dataset scale, category density, and image hierarchy."

Unigrams can be matched based on their surface forms, stemmed forms, and meanings; furthermore, METEOR can be easily extended to include more advanced matching strategies. Once all generalized unigram matches between the two strings have been found, METEOR computes a score for this matching using a combination of unigram-precision, unigram-recall, and a measure of fragmentation that is designed to directly capture how well-ordered the matched words in the machine translation are in relation to the reference. We evaluate METEOR by measuring the correlation between the metric scores and human judgments of translation quality. We compute the Pearson R correlation value between its scores and human quality assessments of the LDC TIDES 2003 Arabic-to-English and Chinese-to-English datasets. We perform segment-bysegment correlation, and show that METEOR gets an R correlation value of 0.347 on the Arabic data and 0.331 on the Chinese data. This is shown to be an improvement on using simply unigramprecision, unigram-recall and their harmonic F1 combination. We also perform experiments to show the relative contributions of the various mapping modules."

We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O. 1. Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms."
