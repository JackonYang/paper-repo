We manually annotated a sample from the RTE dataset according to each model, compared the outcome for the two models, and explored how well they approximate the notion of entailment. We show that the lexical-syntactic model outperforms the lexical model, mainly due to a much lower rate of false-positives, but both models fail to achieve high recall. Our analysis also shows that paraphrases stand out as a dominant contributor to the entailment task. We suggest that our models and annotation methods can serve as an evaluation scheme for entailment at these levels."

Accordingly, many NLP applications would benefit from high coverage knowledge bases of paraphrases. However, the scalability of state-of-the-art paraphrase acquisition approaches is still limited. We present a fully unsupervised learning algorithm for Web-based extraction of entailment relations, an extended model of paraphrases. We focus on increased scalability and generality with respect to prior work, eventually aiming at a full scale knowledge base. Our current implementation of the algorithm takes as its input a verb lexicon and for each verb searches the Web for related syntactic entailment templates. Experiments show promising results with respect to the ultimate goal, achieving much better scalability than prior Web-based methods."

While this is an important and welcome development, it has some inherent limitations. First, generating first-order logic representations of natural language documents is hampered by the lack of efficient and sufficiently robust NLP tools. Second, the computational costs of deploying first-order logic theorem proving tools in realworld situations may be prohibitive. And third, the strict yes/no decisions delivered by such tools are not always appropriate. In this paper we report on an approach to inference in semantics that works on very minimal representations which can easily be generated for arbitrary domains. Moreover, our approach is computationally efficient, and provides graded outcomes instead of strict yes/no decisions. Our approach is fully implemented, and a preliminary evaluation of the approach is discussed in the paper."

We first investigate the performance of human annotators on the task of manually aligning dependency analyses of the respective sentences and of assigning one of five semantic relations to the aligned phrases (equals, generalizes, specifies, restates and intersects). Results indicate that humans can perform this task well, with an F-score of .98 on alignment and an F-score of .95 on semantic relations (after correction). We then describe and evaluate a combined alignment and classification algorithm, which achieves an F-score on alignment of .85 (using EuroWordNet) and an F-score of .80 on semantic relation classification."

The project's key features are (a) a commitment to corpus evidence for semantic and syntactic generalizations, and (b) the representation of the valences of its target words (mostly nouns, adjectives, and verbs) in which the semantic portion makes use of frame semantics. The resulting database will contain (a) descriptions of the semantic frames underlying the meanings of the words described, and (b) the valence representation (semantic and syntactic) of several thousand words and phrases, each accompanied by (c) a representative collection of annotated corpus attestations, which jointly exemplify the observed linkings between \"frame elements\" and their syntactic realizations (e.g. grammatical function, phrase type, and other syntactic traits).

We discuss the method used in creating pyramid models and performing peer annotation. Analysis of score averages for the peers indicates that the best systems score half as well as humans, and that systems can be grouped into better and worse performers. There were few significant differences among systems. High score correlations between sets from different annotators, and good interannotator agreement, indicate that participants can perform annotation reliably. We found that a modified pyramid score gave good results and would simplify peer annotation in the future."

The authors introduce the systematic study of linguistic meaning through a sequence of formal tools and their linguistic applications. Starting with propositional connectives and truth conditions, the book moves to quantification and binding, intensionality and tense, and so on. To set their approach in a broader perspective, the authors also explore the interaction of meaning with context and use (the semantics-pragmatics interface) and address some of the foundational questions, especially in connection with cognition in general. They also introduce a few of the most accessible and interesting ideas from recent research to give the reader a bit of the flavor of current work in semantics. The organization of this new edition is modular; after the introductory chapters, the remaining material can be covered in flexible order. The book presupposes no background in formal logic (an appendix introduces the basic notions of set theory) and only a minimal acquaintance with linguistics. This edition includes a substantial amount of completely new material and has been not only updated but redesigned throughout to enhance its user-friendliness."

                "text": "This thesis presents a logical formalism for representing and reasoning with probabilistic knowledge. The formalism differs from previous efforts in this area in a number of ways. Most previous work has investigated ways of assigning probabilities to the sentences of a logical language. Such an assignment fails to capture an important class of probabilistic assertions, empirical generalizations. Such generalizations are particularly important for AI, since they can be accumulated through experience with the world. Thus, they offer the possibility of reasoning in very general domains, domains where no experts are available to gather subjective probabilities from. \nA logic is developed which can represent these empirical generalizations. Reasoning can be performed through a proof theory which is shown to be sound and complete. Furthermore, the logic can represent and reason with a very general set of assertions, including many non-numeric assertions. This also is important for AI as numbers are usually not available. \nThe logic makes it clear that there is an essential difference between empirical, or statistical, probabilities and probabilities assigned to sentences, e.g., subjective probabilities. The second part of the formalism is an inductive mechanism for assigning degrees of belief to sentences based on the empirical generalizations expressed in the logic. these degrees of belief have a strong advantage over subjective probabilities: they are founded on objective statistical knowledge about the world. Furthermore, the mechanism of assigning degrees of belief gives a natural answer to the question \"Where do the probabilities come from:\" they come from our experience with the world. \nThe two parts of the formalism offer combined, interacting, but still clearly separated, plausible inductive inference and sound deductive inference."

This book explores logical formalisms for representing and reasoning with probabilistic information that will be of particular value to researchers in nonmonotonic reasoning, applications of probabilities, and knowledge representation. It demonstrates that probabilities are not limited to particular applications, like expert systems; they have an important role to play in the formal design and specification of intelligent systems in general.Fahiem Bacchus focuses on two distinct notions of probabilities: one propositional, involving degrees of belief, the other proportional, involving statistics. He constructs distinct logics with different semantics for each type of probability that are a significant advance in the formal tools available for representing and reasoning with probabilities. These logics can represent an extensive variety of qualitative assertions, eliminating requirements for exact point-valued probabilities, and they can represent first-order logical information. The logics also have proof theories which give a formal specification for a class of reasoning that subsumes and integrates most of the probabilistic reasoning schemes so far developed in AI.Using the new logical tools to connect statistical with propositional probability, Bacchus also proposes a system of direct inference in which degrees of belief can be inferred from statistical knowledge and demonstrates how this mechanism can be applied to yield a powerful and intuitively satisfying system of defeasible or default reasoning.Contents: Introduction.

Tests for interobserver bias are presented in terms of first-order marginal homogeneity and measures of interobserver agreement are developed as generalized kappa-type statistics. These procedures are illustrated with a clinical diagnosis example from the epidemiological literature."
