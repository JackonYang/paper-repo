However, there are serious problems that prevent high recognition accuracy of unconstrained handwriting. First, the thousands of ideographic Japanese characters of Chinese origin (called Kanji) can be written with wide variations in the number and order of strokes and significant shape distortions. Also, writing box-free recognition of characters is required to create a better man-machine interface. Intense research performed over the past 15 years to answer the most pressing recognition problems is described. Prototype systems are also described.

Statistical methods, such as hidden Markov models (HMMs) have been used successfully for speech recognition and they have been applied to the problem of handwriting recognition as well. We discuss a general recognition system for large vocabulary, writer independent, unconstrained handwritten text. \"Unconstrained\" implies that the user may write in any style e.g. printed, cursive or in any combination of styles. This is more representative of typical handwritten text where one seldom encounters purely printed or purely cursive forms. Furthermore, a key characteristic of the system is that it performs recognition in real-time on 486 class PC platforms without the large amounts of memory required for traditional HMM based systems. We focus mainly on the writer independent task. Some initial writer dependent results are also reported. An error rate of 18.9% is achieved for a writer-independent 21,000 word vocabulary task in the absence of any language models."

In recent years considerable progress has been made, and to date HHP can be viewed much more as an automatic Handwriting Reading (HR) task for the machine. In this paper we propose the use of handwriting invariants, a physical model for a first segmentation, a logical model for segmentation and recognition, a fundamental equation of handwriting, and to integrate several sources of perception and of knowledge in order to design Handwriting Reading Systems (HRS), which would be more universal systems than is currently the case.\nAt the dawn of the 3rd millennium, we guess that HHP will be considered more as a perceptual and interpretation task requiring knowledge gained from studies on human language. This paper gives some guidelines and presents examples to design systems able to perceive and interpret, i.e., read, handwriting automatically."

Preprocessing techniques are often applied to on-line data before representing the script as basic primitives, resulting in the propagation of errors introduced during pre-processing. This paper therefore combines pre-processing of the data (i.e. tangential smoothing) and encoding into primitives (Partial Strokes) in a single step. Finding the correct character at the correct place (i.e. letter spotting) is the main problem in non-holistic recognition approaches. Many cursive letters are composed of common shapes of varying complexity that can in turn consist of other subshapes. In this paper, we present a production rule system using Hierarchical Fuzzy Inference in order to exploit this hierarchical property of cursive script. Shapes of increasing complexity are found on a page of handwriting until letters are finally spotted. Zoning is then applied to verify their vertical position. The performance of letter spotting is compared with an alternative method."

With these previous studies in mind, we propose, in the second part of this paper, an image-understanding system based on the extraction of a novel representation of handwritten signature images. This approach is text insensitive. A structural match between a reference primitive set Pr and a test primitive set Pt takes into account the geometric shape and spatial relations between primitives. Finally, the local comparison of gray levels between pairs of primitives next to each node of the static solution path N results in a pseudodynamic similarity measure \u03d1 d (Pr, Pt). This scheme allows the elimination, with a certain degree of success, of skilled forgeries such as tracings and photocopies, showing marked gray-level dissimilarity along the signature line."

The first section focuses on different aspects of computer recognition of handwriting such as signature analysis and verification, and on-line and off-line recognition of handwritten characters and cursive script. In sections two and three handwriting is examined from a number of perspectives including basic modelling, the neural and motor aspects of handwriting, as well as the educational implications of handwriting research. This volume hopes to help researchers involved in handwriting research achieve better understanding of the handwriting process, shed new light on motor control and learning, and solve recognition problems."

Emphasis is placed on the recognition of unconstrained handwriting, a general combination of cursively written word fragments and discretely written characters. Existing recognition algorithms, such as elastic matching, are severely challenged by the variability inherent in unconstrained handwriting. This motivates the development of a probabilistic framework suitable for the derivation of a fast statistical mixture algorithm. This algorithm exhibits about the same degree of complexity as elastic matching, while being more flexible and potentially more robust. The approach relies on a novel front-end processor that, unlike conventional character or stroke-based processing, articulates around a small elementary unit of handwriting called a frame. The algorithm is based on (1) producing feature vectors representing each frame in one (or several) feature spaces, (2) Gaussian K-means clustering in these spaces, and (3) mixture modeling, taking into account the contributions of all relevant clusters in each space. The approach is illustrated by a simple task involving an 81-character alphabet. Both writer-dependent and writer-independent recognition results are found to be competitive with their elastic matching counterparts. >"

Researchers working in the area of on-line recognition have had greater success, but the possibility of extracting on-line information from static images has not been fully explored. The experience of forensic document examiners assures us that in many cases, such information can be successfully recovered.We outline the design of a system for the recovery of temporal information from static handwritten images. We provide a taxonomy of local, regional and global temporal clues which are often found in hand-written samples, and describe methods for recovering these clues from the image.We show how this system can benefit from obtaining a comprehensive understanding of the handwriting signal and a detailed analysis of stroke and sub-stroke properties. We suggest that the recovery task requires that we break away from traditional thresholding and thinning techniques, and we provide a framework for such analysis. We demonstrate how isolated temporal clues can reliably be extracted from this framework and propose a control structure for integrating the partial information.We show how many seemingly ambiguous situations can be resolved by the derived clues and our knowledge of the writing process, and provide several examples to illustrate our approach."

Key ideas employed in each functional module, which have been developed for dealing with the diversity of handwriting in its various aspects with a goal of system reliability and robustness, are described in this paper. Preliminary experiments show promising results in terms of speed and accuracy."

This recognizer needs no training for a particular writer and can recognize any common writing style (cursive, hand-printed, or a mixture of both). The neural network architecture, which was originally proposed for continuous speech recognition tasks, and the preprocessing techniques of NPen/sup ++/ are designed to make heavy use of the dynamic writing information, i.e. the temporal sequence of data points recorded on an LCD tablet or digitizer. We present results for the writer independent recognition of isolated words. Tested on different dictionary sizes from 1,000 up to 100,000 words, recognition rates range from 98.0% for the 1,000 word dictionary to 91.4% on a 20,000 word dictionary and 82.9% for the 100,000 word dictionary. No language models are used to achieve these results."

The system first uses a filtering module, based on simple letter features, to quickly reduce a large reference dictionary (lexicon) to a more manageable size; the reduced lexicon is subsequently fed to a recognition module. The recognition module uses a temporal representation of the input, instead of a static two-dimensional image, thereby preserving the sequential nature of the data and enabling the use of a Time-Delay Neural Network (TDNN); such networks have been previously successful in the continuous speech recognition domain. Explicit segmentation of the input words into characters is avoided by sequentially presenting the input word representation to the neural network-based recognizer. The outputs of the recognition module are collected and converted into a string of characters that is matched against the reduced lexicon using an extended Damerau-Levenshtein function. Trained on 2,443 unconstrained word images (11 k characters) from 55 writers and using a 21 k lexicon we reached a 97.9% and 82.4% top-5 word recognition rate on a writer-dependent and writer-independent test, respectively."

We have taken advantage of developments in the speech processing field to build a more sophisticated handwriting recognition system. The pattern elements of the handwriting model are subcharacter stroke types modeled by HMMs. These HMMs are concatenated to form letter models, which are further embedded in a stochastic language model. In addition to better language modeling, we introduce new handwriting recognition features of various kinds. Some of these features have invariance properties, and some are segmental, covering a larger region of the input pattern. We have achieved a writer independent recognition rate of 94.5% on 3,823 unconstrained handwritten word samples from 18 writers covering a 32 word vocabulary."

The usefulness of 'regular' versus 'singular' classes of features is stressed. These notions are applied to obtain a graph, G, representing a line image, and also to find an 'axis' as the regular part of G. The complements to G of the axis are the 'tarsi', singular parts of G, which correspond to informative features of a cursive word. A segmentation of the graph is obtained, giving a symbolic description chain (SDC). Using one or more as robust anchors, possible words in a list of words are selected. Candidate words are examined to see if the other letters fit the rest of the SDC. Good results are obtained for clean images of words written by several persons. >"

The architecture integrates syntactic and contextual post-processing with character recognition to optimise postcode recognition performance, and verifies the postcode against simple features extracted from the remainder of the address to ensure a low error rate. An enhanced version of the characteristic loci character recognition algorithm was chosen for the system to make it tolerant of variations in writing style. Feature selection for the classifier is performed automatically using the B/W algorithm. Syntactic and contextual information for hand-printed British postcodes have been integrated into the system by combining low-level postcode syntax information with a dictionary trie structure. A full implementation of the postcode dictionary trie is described. Features which define the town name effectively, and can easily be extracted from a handwritten or hand-printed town name are used for postcode verification. A database totalling 3473 postcode/address image has used to evaluate the performance of the complete postcode recognition process. The basic character recognition rate for the full unconstrained alphanumeric character set is 63.1%, compared with an expected maximum attainable 75\u201380%. The addition of the syntactic and contextual knowledge stages produces an overall postcode recognition rate which is equivalent to an alphanumeric character recognition rate of 86\u201390%. Separate verification experiments on a subset of 820 address images show that, with the first-order features chosen, an overall correct address feature code extraction rate of around 35% is achieved."

The proposed system can automatically identify useful and common features which consistently exist within different signatures of the same person and, based on these features, verify whether a signature is a forgery or not. The system starts with a closed-contour tracing algorithm. The curvature data of the traced closed contours are decomposed into multiresolutional signals using wavelet transforms. Then the zero-crossings corresponding to the curvature data are extracted as features for matching. Moreover, a statistical measurement is devised to decide systematically which closed contours and their associated frequency data of a writer are most stable and discriminating. Based on these data, the optimal threshold value which controls the accuracy of the feature extraction process is calculated. The proposed approach can be applied to both on-line and off-line signature verification systems. Experimental results show that the average success rates for English signatures and Chinese signatures are 92.57% and 93.68%, respectively."

The reasons underlying this market failure are explored. Problems of pen-user interface design are then described and existing and new applications are summarised. The handwriting process and product are discussed and, finally, automatic recognition methodologies are considered. Four basic factors determining handwriting variation and variability are identified. A handwriting recognition approach using segmentation into velocity-based strokes is considered in somewhat more detail."

Their performance rate is to give an upper bound on recognition rates of computer programs designed to recognize handwritten letters in mixed-script writing. Many recognition algorithms are being developed in the research community, and there is a need for establishing ways to compare them. As some effort is on its way to give large test sets with standard formats, we propose an algorithm to determine a test set of reduced size that is appropriate for the task to achieve (the type of texts or words to be recognized). Also, with respect to a particular task, we propose a method for finding an upper limit to the letter recognition rate to aim for."

For the handwritten word analysis, we present a constructive segmentation approach to overcome the word segmentation problem. The main idea is to locate \"anchorage structures\" in the word drawing based on the most robust strokes of the letters. This new approach of handwriting analysis has been implemented in a writer-independent online handwriting recognition system.

FISH is a system for automatic recognition of handwriting originally developed by the BKA in Germany. Some of the most important classification algorithms that are used compute a feature vector from a digital binary image that shows handwriting without background patterns. This image is currently obtained in three steps: scanning the document (200 dpi, 64 bits), binary segmentation using a interactively selected threshold value, and interactive removal of background patterns. However, the resulting image sometimes shows black structures or white spaces that are not visible in the original document. In this study we investigated the use of color transformation for obtaining better binary images from digital 3 by 8 bit RGB color images. In each distinctive area of the image, the ink lines, background, and background patterns, a number of pixels are selected interactively and their RGB-values are sorted. Analysis of their distributions showed that separation of ink line and background using R, G and B threshold values can often be improved by performing, prior to the segmentation, a 3D rotation of the RGB-values of all pixels. Methods and results are presented."

Dynamic matching between characters of a lexicon entry and segment(s) of the input word image is used to rank the lexicon entries in order of best match. Variable duration for each character is defined and used during the matching. Experimental results prove that our approach using the variable duration outperforms the method using fixed duration in terms of both accuracy and speed. Speed of the entire recognition process is about 200 msec on a single SPARC-10 platform and the recognition accuracy is 96.8 percent are achieved for lexicon size of 10, on a database of postal words captured at 212 dpi."

We discuss a combination and improvement of classical methods to produce robust recognition of hand-printed English text for a recognizer shipping in new models of Apple Computer's NEWTON MESSAGEPAD and EMATE. Combining an artificial neural network (ANN) as a character classifier with a context-driven search over segmentation and word-recognition hypotheses provides an effective recognition system. Long-standing issues relative to training, generalization, segmentation, models of context, probabilistic formalisms, and so on, need to be resolved, however, to achieve excellent performance. We present a number of recent innovations in the application of ANNs as character classifiers for word recognition, including integrated multiple representations, normalized output error, negative training, stroke warping, frequency balancing, error emphasis, and quantized weights. User adaptation and extension to cursive recognition pose continuing challenges."

A method is proposed to uncover more detailed information about geometrical features which human readers use in the reading of Western script. The results of an earlier experiment on the use of ascender/descender features were used for a second experiment aimed at more detailed features within words. A convenient experimental setup was developed, based on image enhancement by local mouse clicks under time pressure. The readers had to develop a cost-effective strategy to identify the letters in the word. Results revealed a left-to-right strategy in time, however, with extra attention to the initial, leftmost parts and the final, rightmost parts of words in a range of word lengths. The results confirm high hit rates on ascenders, descenders, crossings, and points of high curvature in the handwriting pattern."

More difficult problems require an interaction of letter segmentation and recognition. These problems include overlapping discretely written characters, pure cursive writing, and mixed cursive and discrete writing. To these problems concerning the letter segmentation, the word segmentation problems is added. Since a script can contain numbers, capital letters as well as lowercase letters, it is necessary to have a system able to recognize them. This paper describes an on-line system for identifying and recognizing numeral characters and capital letters in handwriting sentences. This system provides two segmentation modules: the first one is to isolate the word drawings within a sentence, and the other one is to separate numeral characters and capital letters from a mixed writing prior to their recognition."

Recently HMM has also been used with some success in recognizing handwritten words with presegmented letters. In this paper, a complete scheme for totally unconstrained handwritten word recognition based on a single contextual hidden Markov model type stochastic network is presented. Our scheme includes a morphology and heuristics based segmentation algorithm, a training algorithm that can adapt itself with the changing dictionary, and a modified Viterbi algorithm which searches for the (l+1)th globally best path based on the previous l best paths. Detailed experiments are carried out and successful recognition results are reported. >"

The approach does not exploit any thinning or skeletonization procedure, but rather a different type of information is manipulated concerning the curvature function of the word contour. In this way, it is possible to detect the parts of the image where the original odometric information is lost or ambiguous (such as, for example, at an intersection of the handwritten lines) and interpret them to finally recover a part of the original temporal information. The algorithm scans the word, following the natural course of the line, and attempts to reproduce the same movement as executed by the writer during the generation of the word. It segments the cursive trace where the contour shows the slow-down of the original movement (corresponding to the maximum curvature points of the curve). At the end of the scanning process, a temporal sequence of motor strokes is obtained which plausibly composed the original intended movement."

A database, ETL8 (881 Kanji, 71 hirakana, and 160 variations for each category), is explained, on which many experiments were performed. Recognition rates reported using this database can be compared, and so somewhat qualitative evaluation of these methods is described.

Such a procedure is very useful since the complete manual labeling of handwriting takes a lot of time from the user, in the order of one hour per 100 written words. Even without making use of detailed shape information the proposed algorithm already yields a usable segmentation which aids the manual labeling process."

First is presented the method we have developed for the computation of the fractal dimension and the secondary dimension of writing. We describe how these parameters allow us to define a pertinent representation space. We also show how this approach has permitted to extract classes related to writing and signature styles. Lastly, this method has allowed us to give evidence of the independence between the behaviors of the writer when he signs and when he writes. Such an independence will be a source of very enriching information within the context of signature authentication."

The purpose of the project is to propose and implement solutions to the growing need of handwriting samples for online handwriting recognizers used by pen-based computers. Researchers from several companies and universities have agreed on a data format, a platform of data exchange and a protocol for recognizer benchmarks. The online handwriting data of concern may include handprint and cursive from various alphabets (including Latin and Chinese), signatures and pen gestures. These data will be compiled and distributed by the Linguistic Data Consortium. The benchmarks will be arbitrated the US National Institute of Standards and Technologies. We give a brief introduction to the UNIPEN format. We explain the protocol of data exchange and benchmarks."

New definitions such as crucial parts, efficiency ratios, degree of confusion, similar character pairs, etc. have also been given to facilitate pattern analysis and character recognition. Using these definitions, computer algorithms have been developed to recognize the characters by parts, including halves, quarters, and sixths. The recognition rates have been analyzed and compared with those obtained from subjective experiments. Based on the results of both computer and human experiments, a detailed analysis of the crucial parts and the Canadian standard alphanumeric character set has been made revealing some interesting fundamental characteristics of these handprint models. The results should be useful for pattern analysis and recognition, character understanding, handwriting education, and human-computer communication.<<ETX>>"

Methods based on threshold techniques often necessitate meticulous postprocessing in order to correctly capture the handwritten information. In this study, we tackle the problem of extracting handwritten information by means of an intuitive approach that is close to human visual perception, defining a topological criterion specific to handwritten lines which we call filiformity. This approach was inspired by the existence in the human eye of cells whose specialized task is the extraction of lines. First, we define two topological measures of filiformity for binary objects. Next, we extend these measures to include gray-level images. One of these measures, which is particularly interesting, differentiates the contour lines of objects from the handwritten lines we are trying to isolate. The local value provided by this measure is then processed by global thresholding, taking into account information about the whole image. This processing step ends with a simple fast algorithm. Evaluation of the extraction algorithm carried out on 540 checks with 16 different background patterns demonstrates the robustness of the algorithm, particularly when the background depicts a scene."

The model accounts for handwriting generation in terms of response patterns that result from the activation by the central nervous system of curvilinear and angular velocity generators, characterized by log-normal impulse responses. In this context, a handwritten trace can be segmented into a hierarchy of well-defined elements: components, strings and curvilinear and angular strokes. One striking conclusion from this approach is that strokes have to be superimposed to generate a smooth handwritten trace and are thus hidden in the trajectory signal. The segmentation algorithm avoids this problem by using an analysis-by-synthesis technique to segment a specific curve.<<ETX>>"

We use a novel type of digitizer tablet and pay special attention to the use of pen-tilt. We investigate the verification reliability based on different forgery types. We compare the discriminative value of the different features based on a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and show that pen-tilt is important. On the basis of home-improved, over-the-shoulder and professional forgeries, we show that the amount of dynamic information available to an imposter is important and that forgeries based on paper copies are easier to detect. The results obtained with a database of almost 5000 signatures of 51 persons with highly skilled forgeries include equal-error rates between 1% and 1.9%."

The main difficulty lies in the local variability of the writing trace of the signature which is closely related to the identity of human beings. In this paper, we propose a new formalism for signature representation based on visual perception. A signature image consists of 512/spl times/128 pixels and is centered on a grid of rectangular retinas which are excited by local portions of the signature. Granulometric size distributions are used for the definition of local shape descriptors in an attempt to characterize the amount of signal activity exciting each retina on the focus of the attention grid. Experimental evaluation of this scheme is made using a signature database of 800 genuine signatures from 20 individuals. Two types of classifiers, a nearest neighbor and a threshold classifier, show a total error rate below 0.02 percent and 1.0 percent, respectively, in the context of random forgeries."

The DTW-algorithm originates from the field of speech recognition, and has been applied successfully in the signature verification area more than once. However, until now, few adaptations have been made in order to take the specific characteristics of signature verification into account. According to us, one of the most important differences is the availability of a rather large number of reference patterns, making it possible to determine which parts of a reference signature are important and which are not. By disconnecting the DTW-stage and the feature extraction process we are able to deal efficiently with this extra amount of information. We demonstrate the benefits of our approach by building and evaluating a complete system."

In offline applications, valuable information which can be used to discriminate between genuine and forged signatures is embedded at the stroke level. We present an approach to segmenting strokes into stylistically meaningful segments and establish a local correspondence between a questioned signature and a reference signature to enable the analysis and comparison of stroke features. Questioned signatures which do not conform to the reference signature are identified as random forgeries. Most simple forgeries can also be identified, as they do not conform to the reference signature's invariant properties such as connections between letters. Since we have access to both local and global information, our approach also shows promise for extension to the identification of skilled forgeries."

This method concentrates on the morphological aspect of cursive script recognition. It uses fuzzy-shape grammars to define the morphological characteristics of conventional allographs which can be viewed as basic knowledge for developing a writer independent recognition system. The system uses no linguistic knowledge to output character sequences that possibly correspond to an unknown cursive word input. The recognition method is tested using multi-writer cursive random letter sequences. For a test dataset containing a handwritten cursive text 600 characters in length written by ten different writers, average character recognition rates of 84.4% to 91.6% are obtained, depending on whether only the best character sequence output of the system is considered or if the best of the top 10 is accepted. These results are achieved without any writer-dependent tuning. The same dataset is used to evaluate the performance of human readers. An average recognition rate of 96.0% was reached, using ten different readers, presented with randomized samples of each writer. The worst reader-writer performance was 78.3%. Moreover, results show that system performances are highly correlated with human performances. >"

The semantic representation in this case is a digit string (ZIP Code).

Based on a set of handwritten words, three features are determined: a cursivity index , which indicates the tendency of a writer to write cursive, and two distance measures and . The distance measures represents the distance between the stroke feature vectors in the input handwriting and the strokes contained in two style-specific Kohonen Self-Organizing Maps (SOM). One SOM is tuned for the writing style handprint, and the other for cursive. The first method uses some linear decision criteria based on the feature vector , for the classification of one of the three writing styles. The second method uses nonlinear decision boundaries found via agglomerative hierarchical clustering of the three-dimensional feature vectors. Using the second method, several more distinctive writing style classifications are proposed."

Though shape features and high-pressure features had an error rate of 6.5% and 20.0% respectively, the collective use of these two sets reduced the error rate of simple forgery verification to 2.5%.

Several component processes of a recognition system for isolated offline cursive script words are described. A word image is transformed through a hierarchy of representation levels: points, contours, features, letters, and words. A unique feature representation is generated bottom-up from the image using statistical dependences between letters and features. Ratings for partially formed words are computed using a stack algorithm and a lexicon represented as a trie. Several novel techniques for low- and intermediate-level processing for cursive script are described, including heuristics for reference line finding, letter segmentation based on detecting local minima along the lower contour and areas with low vertical profiles, simultaneous encoding of contours and their topological relationships, extracting features, and finding shape-oriented events. Experiments demonstrating the performance of the system are also described. >"

In order to compensate for this behaviour, several choices of the HWR must be initially considered. In the case of handwritten sentence/phrase recognition, linguistic constraints may be applied in order to improve the results of the HWR. This paper discusses two statistical methods of applying syntactic constraints to the output of an HWR on input consisting of sentences/phrases. Both methods are based on syntactic categories (tags) associated with words. The rst is a purely statistical method, the second is a hybrid method which combines higher-level syntactic information (hypertags) with statistical information regarding transitions between hypertags."

Using Laplace's transform theory, a model can be represented in what is called the neural firing-rate domain. Consistent terminology is proposed to facilitate model evaluation and comparison. An overview of previously published models suggests that they could be described using this method, with second- and third-order linear model representation. Fourteen simplified theoretical models are simulated in an experiment designed to study the parameter domain in which handwriting is controlled by the nervous system in order to gain insight into which type of model provides the best reconstruction of natural handwriting. Results show that velocity-controlled models produce the best outputs, with no significant difference between second- and third-order systems. In handwriting, fine motor behavior is thus velocity-controlled. These findings agree with other recent automatic signature verification results and are of interest for a number of applications, from pattern recognition to handwriting education. >"

In this model, the velocity of handwriting trajectory is modeled as the impulse response of a time varying second order system. For mathematical tractability, the entire trajectory is segmented into several non-overlapping frames, while the natural frequency and the damping factor of the system are assumed to vary linearly with time in each frame and are continuous along the entire trajectory. In other words, handwriting is regarded as an oscillation modulated by a continuous and piecewise linear signal. The parameters of this model are estimated by Powell's optimization algorithm which does not require the computation of the first order derivative. The number and lengths of the frames are decided by a modified binary search algorithm along with the estimation of parameters.

This art is both well studied and well documented as it applies to the verification by humans of signatures whose only records are visual-that is, as it applies to signatures during whose production no measurement is made of the pen trajectory or pen dynamics. Let us call such signatures, for which we have only a static visual record, off-line, and let us call signatures during whose production the pen trajectory or pen dynamics is captured, on-line. Whereas attempts to automate the verification of off-line signatures have fallen well short of human performance to this point, I demonstrate that automatic on-line signature verification is feasible."

We extracted a 42-parameter feature set at first, and advanced to a set of 49 normalized features that tolerate inconsistencies in genuine signatures while retaining the power to discriminate against forgeries. We studied algorithms for selecting and perhaps orthogonalizing features in accordance with the availability of training data and the level of system complexity. For decision making we studied several classifiers types. A modified version of our majority classifier yielded 2.5% equal error rate and, more importantly, an asymptotic performance of 7% false acceptance rate at zero false rejection rate, was robust to the speed of genuine signatures, and used only 15 parameter features."

The higher recognition rates for isolated characters vs. those obtained for words and connected character strings well illustrate this fact. A good part of recent progress in reading unconstrained printed and written text may be ascribed to more insightful handling of segmentation. This paper provides a review of these advances. The aim is to provide an appreciation for the range of techniques that have been developed, rather than to simply list sources. Segmentation methods are listed under four main headings. What may be termed the \"classical\" approach consists of methods that partition the input image into subimages, which are then classified. The operation of attempting to decompose the image into classifiable units is called \"dissection.\" The second class of methods avoids dissection, and segments the image either explicitly, by classification of prespecified windows, or implicitly by classification of subsets of spatial features collected from the image as a whole. The third strategy is a hybrid of the first two, employing dissection together with recombination rules to define potential segments, but using classification to select from the range of admissible segmentation possibilities offered by these subimages. Finally, holistic approaches that avoid segmentation by recognizing entire character strings as units are described."

                "text": "Dynamic signature verification (DSV) makes use of parameters such as pen velocity, acceleration, jerk and pressure as described by R. Plamondon and G. Lorette (1989) and is an attractive biometric for identity verification since signature checking is already accepted by the public as noted by R. Carter (1990). The slow uptake of DSV by electronic fund transfer point of sale (EFTPOS) equipment manufacturers is partly due to the cost of the acquisition and processing hardware. The paper describes an artificial neural network (ANN) based system and a low cost digitising tablet for use with any non unique, non tethered pen. The tablet employs simple digital electronics and may be readily integrated into existing EFTPOS equipment. A low unit cost can be achieved using an ASIC mounted on a PCB with a screen printed polyester overlay film bonded using anisotropic conductive adhesive. It discriminates between pen and palm pressure and eliminates switching artefact. An ANN is used to fuse a number of broad features during the verification process. Preprocessing reduces the dimensionality of the data vectors used during enrolment and verification. The algorithms, which have produced excellent results with a small sample of users, leave the ANN to identify the salient information during training. These are simple enough to be implemented on the EFTPOS equipment's own microcontroller."

A central sub-problem in word separation is the estimation of gaps between adjacent components in a line. We present a new technique to estimate inter-component distances that is based on the gap between their convex hulls. The technique evolved through a study of the drawbacks in previous approaches to gap estimation, and is shown to be better in terms of performance and robustness."

For face information processing morphological filtering is used to enhance the intrinsic features of a face, reduce the influence of rotation in depth, changes in facial expression, hair style, glasses and lighting conditions. The filtered images are then a subject for learning by a modified high order neural network. In signature analysis the model first traces the signature to extract the dynamical information that is usually lost in an off-line mode. After this step a neural network (neocognitron with switching attention) is used to recognize and finally verify the signature. These two parts can work independently and finally their outputs can be used to form a complex person verifier."

We give an overview of our recognition system and discuss some of the pattern recognition techniques used. We also describe an installation which processes of the order of 70,000 checks per day. Results on a data base of about 170,000 checks show a recognition rate of about 75% for an error rate of the order of 1/10,000 checks."

It uses a combination of 2 segmentation free word recognition schemes. The first scheme uses a set of global features associated to a modified K nearest neighbour classifier; while the second one uses a set of directional contour features as input to an HMM. The system has been designed to be modular and independent of specific languages as in Canada one has to deal with at least 2 languages, namely English and French. It can be easily adapted to read other European languages based on the Roman alphabet. The system is continuously tested on data from the local phone company, and we report here the results on a database of approximately 4,500 cheques."

Dynamic data such as pressure is treated as a function of positional data and therefore evaluated locally. Verification is based on strokes as the structural units of the signature. This global knowledge is fed into the verification procedure. The application of a 3D non-linear correlation of the signature signals uses the stroke index as the third DP index. In conjunction with the definition of a finite state automaton on the set of reference strokes the system can handle different stroke numbers, missing or additional strokes correctly. The correct alignment of matching strokes is determined simultaneously to the signature verification process; an additional alignment stage before the actual nonlinear correlation is obsolete."

Some of the challenges posed by the task are (i) segmentation of the legal amount into words, (ii) location of boundaries between dollars and cents amounts, and (iii) high accuracy in terms of recognition performance. Word segmentation in the legal amount is a serious issue because of the nature of the data and patrons' writing habits which tend to clump words together. We have developed a word segmentation algorithm based on the character segmentation results to address this issue. The list of possible amounts generated by the word segmentation hypotheses is used as lexicon for the courtesy amount recognition. The order of magnitude of the amount is estimated during legal amount recognition. We treat the courtesy amount as a numeral string and apply the same word recognition scheme as used for the legal amount. Our approach to check recognition differs from traditional methods in two significant aspects: First, our emphasis on both the legal and the courtesy amounts is balanced. We use an accurate word recognizer which performs equally well on alpha words and digit strings. Second, our combination strategy is serial rather than the commonly used parallel method. Experimental results show that 43.8% of check images are correctly read with an error rate of 0%."

The approach is derived from a simpli ed version of the morphological subtraction and its interpretation, using the 2DHistogram. From an empty bankcheck, a mask is computed, which can be added to every lled-in bankcheck of the same kind, ltering the user entered information parts within the bankcheck image. This approach works well for many types of bankchecks, but it fails for EC bankchecks. By considering the 2DHistogram of empty and lled-in EC bankcheck images, a means is given for improving the result for EC checks, using the so-called 2D-Lookup algorithm. Moreover, this algorithm allows for the use of the lled-in image only, if there is a way to specify two lter operations, which process the lled-in image in order to get a separable 2D-Histogram. An evolutionary algorithm, the genetic programming (GP), is used for performing this adaptation task. The evolutionary generated lters shows very good performance for EC bankcheck background removal. A detailed study gives the importance of a family of image processing operations, the OWA operations, for this removal."

Various methods for this task are described in the literature including global and adaptive binarization. This paper evaluates three adaptive binarization techniques viz., a contrast measure approach, a weighted running average approach and a second derivative approach, and compares them to global binarization methods. Experiments with noisy document (postal letter mail) images lead to the following conclusions. Image contrast binarization often yields nearly the same results as the edge operator, with considerably less computation and is less sensitive to parameter settings. In addition, the edge operator is more sensitive to image resolution than the contrast operator. The weighted running-average approach is highly sensitive to the parameters involved in the calculation of the average but produces a quick binarization."

Some results of research on human Chinese character recognition have been discussed and unified into a compound mechanism with an adaptive and self-developing nature. A machine imitation model has been proposed for Chinese character recognition with different routines. By some simplification but with the crucial feature of the model being retained, an experimental system for handprinted Chinese character recognition based on the novel concept has been built. Experimental results have shown that the associated routines continuously improve their performance during their work even after supervised training is halted. The routine of the global pattern approach eventually learns most of the classes and the recognition process gradually shifts from the subpattern approach to the global pattern approach."

QNN combines the advantages of neural modelling and fuzzy theoretic principles. Novel experiments have been designed for in-depth studies of applying the QNN to both real data and confusing images synthesized by morphing. Tests on synthesized data examine QNN's fuzzy decision boundary with the intention to illustrate its mechanism and characteristics, while studies on real data prove its great potential as a handwritten numeral classifier and the special role it plays in multi-expert systems. An effective decision-fusion system is proposed and a high reliability of 99.10% has been achieved."

This paper presents a handwriting generation model that takes advantage of the asymptotic impulse response of neuromuscular networks to produce and control complex two-dimensional synergistic movements. A parametric definition of a ballistic stroke in the context of the kinematic theory of rapid human movements is given. Two types of parameters are used: command and system parameters. The first group provides a representation of the action plan while the second takes into account the temporal properties of the neuromuscular systems executing that plan. Handwriting is described as the time superimposition of basic discontinuous strokes that results in a continuous summation of delta-lognormal velocity vectors. The model leads to trajectory reconstruction, both in the spatial and in the kinematic domain. According to this new paradigm, the angular velocity does not have to be controlled independently and continuously; it naturally emerges from the vectorial summation process. Several psychophysical phenomena related to two-dimensional movements are explained and analyzed in the context of the model: the speed/accuracy trade-offs, spatial scaling, the isochrony principle, the two-thirds power law, effector independence, etc. The overall approach also shows how basic handwriting characteristics (dimension, slant, baseline, shape, etc.) are affected and controlled using an action plan made up of virtual targets fed into a neuromuscular synergy that is governed by a delta-lognormal law.\n"

We developed a texture feature based thresholding algorithm to address this problem. Our algorithm consists of three steps: 1) candidate thresholds are produced through iterative use of Otsu's algorithm (1978); 2) texture features associated with each candidate threshold are extracted from the run-length histogram of the accordingly binarized image; 3) the optimal threshold is selected so that desirable document texture features are preserved. Experiments with 9,000 machine printed address blocks from an unconstrained US mail stream demonstrated that over 99.6 percent of the images were successfully binarized by the new thresholding method, appreciably better than those obtained by typical existing thresholding techniques. Also, a system run with 500 troublesome mail address blocks showed that an 8.1 percent higher character recognition rate was achieved with our algorithm as compared with Otsu's algorithm."

The main problem addressed by the model is how people can produce essentially the same written output with different effectors (e.g., the preferred or nonpreferred hand, the foot, or even the mouth). The model is based on the assumption that writers strive for invariant graphic outputs when they write with different effectors, when they write on surfaces with different orientations, or when they write large or small script; such output invariance is an essential requirement for later recognition of the written result. Given this assumption, the question is how the motor system enables the relevant effectors to generate the necessary pen strokes. The adapted model provides one possible answer to this question. It is the first fully working model of multijoint activity underlying writing and related graphic tasks. We describe how the model differs from other models developed in the past, and we review the model's strengths and weaknesses."

Each child completed the Motor Accuracy Test; the Developmental Test of Visual-Motor Integration (VMI); two tests of in-hand manipulation, including a rotation and a translation task; and the Minnesota Handwriting Test (MHT).\n\n\nRESULTS\nAll test scores for the subjects with good handwriting were significantly higher than those of the subjects with poor handwriting. Each performance component test was significantly correlated to MHT scores. Translation, VMI, and rotation scores were significant predictors of MHT scores, accounting for almost 73% of variance. A discriminant analysis using the performance components correctly classified 98% of the students as good or poor handwriters.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nIn-hand manipulation has significant association to handwriting skill."

In response to the second problem, a variety of general and application-specific spelling correction techniques have been developed. Some of them were based on detailed studies of spelling error patterns. In response to the third problem, a few experiments using natural-language-processing tools or statistical-language models have been carried out.

After introducing a few basic notions and general definitions, we present a new digital envelope transfer protocol-based system, named TRANZIX, used in the context of generic \"transport and transfer of value\". We present the general concept of the innovative application that allows commercial exchange of electronic documents through digital transactions using customized electronic money. The system provides very strong protection based on public-key cryptography complemented with biometric protection based on handwritten signatures. Finally, a few targeted applications are overviewed, including the customized exchanges of documents through \"mixed transfers of value\"."

The best model reported in the literature (Brown et al., 1992) achieves 1.75 bits per character on the Brown corpus. On that same corpus, our model, trained on 10 times less data, reaches 2.19 bits per character and is 200 times smaller (/spl sime/160,000 parameters).

It was concluded that styles with regular entry stroke patterns give the steadiest rate of convergence to the model and styles with short ascenders and descenders and strokes with not too high curvatures give the highest handwriting speed."

The scope of this study is limited to offline recognition of isolated cursive words. First, this paper describes McClelland and Rumelhart's reading model, which formed the basis of the system. The method's behavior is presented, followed by the main original contributions of our model which are: the development of a new technique for baseline extraction, an architecture based on the chosen reading model (hierarchical, parallel, with local representation and interactive activation mechanism), the use of significant perceptual features in word recognition such as ascenders and descenders, the creation of a fuzzy position concept dealing with the uncertainty of the location of features and letters, and the adaptability of the model to words of different lengths and languages. After a description of our model, new results are presented."

Namely, for an optimal verification, each person requires a different subset of all the possible features. Finding an optimal subset for an individual needs too much combinatorial efforts. Instead, we propose an approach using all the same features for every person by assigning a different weight to each feature according to the nature of the person's signature."

The second algorithm is based on a structure-based procedure, the third algorithm uses a highly-adaptive neural network. The three algorithms are combined in the multi-expert system by a voting strategy."

One is based on thinning methods and the other is based on contour curve fitting. For both cases an input image is binarized. For the former, Hilditch's method is used, then crossing points are sought, around which a domain is constructed. Outside the domain, a set of line segments are identified. These lines are connected and approximated by cubic B-spline curves. Smoothly connected lines are selected as segmented curves. This method works well for a limited class of crossing lines, which are shown experimentally. In the latter, a contour line is approximated by cubic B-spline curve, along which curvature is measured. According to the extreme points of the curvature graph, the contour line is segmented, based on which the line segment is obtained. Experimental results are shown for some difficult cases."

The combination can be implemented using a variety of strategies, among which majority vote is by far the simplest, and yet it has been found to be just as effective as more complicated schemes in improving the recognition results. This paper examines the mode of operation of the majority vote method in order to gain a deeper understanding of how and why it works, so that a more solid basis can be provided for its future applications to different data and/or domains. In the course of our research, we have analyzed this method from its foundations and obtained many new and original results regarding its behavior. Particular attention has been directed toward the changes in the correct and error rates when classifiers are added, and conditions are derived under which their addition/elimination would be valid for the specific objectives of the application. At the same time, our theoretical findings are compared against experimental results, and these results do reflect the trends predicted by the theoretical considerations."

Children between 4 and 6 years were drawing with a wireless pen on a pressure-sensitive graphic tablet Jinked to a computer. Hand pressure, velocity of hand movements, drawing time, and penlifts were measured by a CS handwriting analyses software package. Planned comparisons were carried out between developmentally earlier emerging graphic forms and patterns that are mastered later in development. It was shown that for 6-yr.-olds pressure was increased which might indicate a generally higher tension when drawing. Specifically, angular forms were copied with more pressure, but needed less drawing time than round forms. Moreover, children needed more time for penlifts to adjust for a starting point that changed from left to right when drawing vertical lines than horizontal ones. Reduced speed of drawing was more important when copying open forms than closed shapes. In denotation of spatial position no differences were found. It is concluded that the analysis of psychophysical measures of drawing gives important clues about the specific problems produced by relatively basic graphic patterns."

A fundamental part of such an approach is the creation of a lexical database containing the relevant information. However, to create a semantic lexicon by hand for a large vocabulary is a considerable task, which is a major reason why so many semantic theories fail to scale up from the small, artificial domains in which they were developed. An alternative approach is to use existing sources of semantic information, such as machine-readable dictionaries (which contain definitions and domain information) and text corpora (from which collocations and domain information may be derived). The development of techniques for acquiring semantic knowledge from such resources and applying it to large vocabulary cursive script recognition is described.<<ETX>>"

The first method involves a series of experiments with human subjects. The second makes use of neural networks and the third is based on dissimilarities and distance measures that is computer generated. Several statistical tests have been performed to analyze the preference structures exhibited by the data. This study highlights human coherence in comparing skeletons and the novelty of using reference skeletons to facilitate the evaluation of thinning algorithms. None of the automatic approaches provides a useful insight although a measure of information content manifests some consistency. The overall study suggests a systematic protocol involving human coherence to evaluate preprocessing algorithms."

No improvement in mean quality was found for a group of 38 children using a method based on copying exercises. A substantial improvement in mean quality, corresponding to about 1.4 SD, was found for 23 children using a method based on reintroduction of the letter forms explaining each form visually and verbally. It was concluded that the bottleneck in the development of handwriting quality in primary school is a mismatch between the instructional methods used and the perceptual ability of the children."

Most existing statistical language models exploit only the immediate history of a text. To extract information from further back in the document's history, we propose and usetrigger pairsas the basic information bearing elements. This allows the model to adapt its expectations to the topic of discourse. Next, statistical evidence from multiple sources must be combined. Traditionally, linear interpolation and its variants have been used, but these are shown here to be seriously deficient. Instead, we apply the principle of Maximum Entropy (ME). Each information source gives rise to a set of constraints, to be imposed on the combined estimate. The intersection of these constraints is the set of probability functions which are consistent with all the information sources. The function with the highest entropy within that set is the ME solution. Given consistent statistical evidence, a unique ME solution is guaranteed to exist, and an iterative algorithm exists which is guaranteed to converge to it. The ME framework is extremely general: any phenomenon that can be described in terms of statistics of the text can be readily incorporated. An adaptive language model based on the ME approach was trained on theWall Street Journalcorpus, and showed a 32\u201339% perplexity reduction over the baseline. When interfaced to SPHINX-II, Carnegie Mellon's speech recognizer, it reduced its error rate by 10\u201314%. This thus illustrates the feasibility of incorporating many diverse knowledge sources in a single, unified statistical framework."

In Study 1, variability in grip patterns and pen positioning relative to a flat surface were examined in 3- and 5-year-olds and adults. The results indicated that between 3 and 5 years of age there is a reduction in the number of grips that individual children routinely use and a reduction in variability associated with pen-surface positioning. In Study 2, the 3-year-old children who participated in Study 1 were tested 6 months later. In comparison to young 3-year-old children, older 3-year-olds use an adult grip pattern more often and are less variable in pen-surface positioning, although the use of multiple grip patterns is still common. The findings from both studies are considered in relation to prior research that emphasized modal patterns of motor development and newer work that uses developmental changes in variability to understand the acquisition of motor skill."

The rankings can be combined by methods that either reduce or rerank a given set of classes. An intersection method and union method are proposed for class set reduction. Three methods based on the highest rank, the Borda count, and logistic regression are proposed for class set reranking. These methods have been tested in applications of degraded machine-printed characters and works from large lexicons, resulting in substantial improvement in overall correctness. >"

If appropriate care is taken, we find that it is possible to make useful estimates of contextual probabilities that improve performance in a spelling correction application. In contrast, less careful estimates are found to be useless. Specifically, we will show that the Good-Turing method makes the use of contextual information practical for a spelling corrector, while attempts to use the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) or expected likelihood estimator (ELE) fail. Spelling correction was selected as an application domain because it is analogous to many important recognition applications based on a noisy channel model (such as speech recognition), though somewhat simpler and therefore possibly more amenable to detailed statistical analysis."

A mathematical model is formulated which is shown to predict both the qualitative features and the quantitative details observed experimentally in planar, multijoint arm movements. Coordination is modeled mathematically by defining an objective function, a measure of performance for any possible movement. The unique trajectory which yields the best performance is determined using dynamic optimization theory. In the work presented here, the objective function is the square of the magnitude of jerk (rate of change of acceleration) of the hand integrated over the entire movement. This is equivalent to assuming that a major goal of motor coordination is the production of the smoothest possible movement of the hand. Experimental observations of human subjects performing voluntary unconstrained movements in a horizontal plane are presented. They confirm the following predictions of the mathematical model: unconstrained point-to-point motions are approximately straight with bell-shaped tangential velocity profiles; curved motions (through an intermediate point or around an obstacle) have portions of low curvature joined by portions of high curvature; at points of high curvature, the tangential velocity is reduced; the durations of the low-curvature portions are approximately equal. The theoretical analysis is based solely on the kinematics of movement independent of the dynamics of the musculoskeletal system and is successful only when formulated in terms of the motion of the hand in extracorporal space. The implications with respect to movement organization are discussed."

It describes a synergy in terms of the agonist and antagonist neuromuscular systems involved in the production of these movements. It is shown that these systems have a log-normal impulse response that results from the limiting behavior of a large number of interdependent neuromuscular networks, as predicted by the central limit theorem. The delta log-normal law that follows from this model is very general and can reproduce almost perfectly the complete velocity patterns of an end-effector. The theory accounts for the invariance and rescalability of these patterns, as well as for the various observations that have been reported concerning the change in maximum and mean velocities, time to maximum velocity, etc., under different experimental conditions. Movement time, load effects, and control strategies are discussed in a companion paper."

                "text": "In supernova (SN) spectroscopy relatively little attention has been given to the properties of optically thick spectral lines in epochs following the photosphere\u2019s recession. Most treatments and analyses of post-photospheric optical spectra of SNe assume that forbidden-line emission comprises most if not all spectral features. However, evidence exists that suggests that some spectra exhibit line profiles formed via optically thick resonance-scattering even months or years after the SN explosion. To explore this possibility, we present a geometrical approach to SN spectrum formation based on the \u201cElementary Supernova\u201d model, wherein we investigate the characteristics of resonance-scattering in optically thick lines while replacing the photosphere with a transparent central core emitting non-blackbody continuum radiation, akin to the optical continuum provided by decaying 56Co formed during the explosion. We develop the mathematical framework necessary for solving the radiative transfer equation under these conditions and calculate spectra for both isolated and blended lines. Our comparisons with analogous results from the Elementary Supernova code SYNOW reveal several marked differences in line formation. Most notably, resonance lines in these conditions form P Cygni-like profiles, but the emission peaks and absorption troughs shift redward and blueward, respectively, from the line\u2019s rest wavelength by a significant amount, despite the spherically symmetric distribution of the line optical depth in the ejecta. These properties and others that we find in this work could lead to misidentification of lines or misattribution of properties of line-forming material at post-photospheric times in SN optical spectra."

Three motor control processes may be tuned to specific tasks, thereby improving performance: selecting spatial targets for movement, sequencing these targets, and transforming them into muscle commands. These processes operate outside of awareness. A 4th, conscious process can improve performance in either of 2 ways: by selecting more effective goals of what should be changed in the environment or by selecting and sequencing spatial targets. The theory accounts for patterns of impairment of motor skill learning in patient populations and for learning-related changes in activity in functional imaging studies. It also makes a number of predictions about the purely cognitive, including accounts of mental practice, the representation of motor skill, and the interaction of conscious and unconscious processes in motor skill learning."

An experimental comparison of various classifier combination schemes demonstrates that the combination rule developed under the most restrictive assumptions-the sum rule-and its derivatives consistently outperform other classifier combinations schemes. A sensitivity analysis of the various schemes to estimation errors is carried out to show that this finding can be justified theoretically."

Furthermore, Clark (2011) expanded on Pol and Gasparini (2009) matrix with four additional characters (258\u2013262). This study further expands on this matrix with the addition of 1 character (char. 263) describing the position of the choana relative to the suborbital fenestra, and the connection between choana and palatal fenestra. Also, characters 258 and 200 were amended to include more specific information concerning the palatines contact with other elements, size and sculpturing.

Apres differents pretraitements specifiques, on opere une segmentation dynamique des lettres en primitives locales representatives de la trajectoire de la pointe du stylet (aspect gestuel), associees a des primitives de nature plus globale representatives de la geometrie du trace (aspect visuel). Une phase d'apprentissage est ensuite realisee sur chaque modele associe a chaque type de lettre. Lors de la reconnaissance, le systeme va estimer les probabilites de generation de la lettre a reconnaitre pour chaque modele. On effectue ainsi une classification basee sur un critere de ressemblance."

The method employs as a dissimilarity measure the \"degree of morphing\" between an input curve and a template curve. A physics-based approach substantiates the \"degree of morphing\" as a deformation energy and casts the problem as an energy minimization problem. The method operates upon key segmentation points that are provided by an appropriate segmentation algorithm. The segmentation objective is not to locate letters, but instead to locate corners and some key low curvature points (an easier task). This is part of the method's strategy to see the word as a generic on-line curve. Due to this strategy, the proposed method can handle collectively both cursive words and hand-drawn line figures, the two key ingredients of handwritten notes. Most importantly, the proposed system achieves high recognition rates without ever resorting to statistical models."
