Pixel gray levels and the presence and orientation of edges are viewed as states of atoms or molecules in a lattice-like physical system. The assignment of an energy function in the physical system determines its Gibbs distribution. Because of the Gibbs distribution, Markov random field (MRF) equivalence, this assignment also determines an MRF image model. The energy function is a more convenient and natural mechanism for embodying picture attributes than are the local characteristics of the MRF. For a range of degradation mechanisms, including blurring, nonlinear deformations, and multiplicative or additive noise, the posterior distribution is an MRF with a structure akin to the image model. By the analogy, the posterior distribution defines another (imaginary) physical system. Gradual temperature reduction in the physical system isolates low energy states (``annealing''), or what is the same thing, the most probable states under the Gibbs distribution. The analogous operation under the posterior distribution yields the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the image given the degraded observations. The result is a highly parallel ``relaxation'' algorithm for MAP estimation. We establish convergence properties of the algorithm and we experiment with some simple pictures, for which good restorations are obtained at low signal-to-noise ratios."

Acccordingly, we have tried to strike a balance between simplicity in exposition and sophistication in analytical reasoning. Some of the more mathematically rigorous analysis has been just sketched or intuitively explained in the text, so that complex proofs do not stand in the way of an otherwise simple exposition. At the same time, some of this analysis and the necessary mathematical results are developed (at the level of advanced calculus) in theoretical problems, which are included at the end of the corresponding chapter. The theoretical problems (marked by *) constitute an important component of the text, and ensure that the mathematically oriented reader will find here a smooth development without major gaps."

This procedure is repeated a number of times. The following argument should convince the reader that about n log n shuffles suffice to mix up n cards. The argument depends on following the bottom card of the deck. This card stays at the bottom until the first time (TI) a card is inserted below it. Standard calculations, reviewed below, imply this takes about n shuffles. As the shuffles continue, eventually a second card is inserted below the original bottom card (this takes about n/2 further shuffles). Consider the instant (T,) that a second card is inserted below the original bottom card. The two cards under the original bottom card are equally likely to be in relative order low-high or high-low. Similarly, the first time a h r d card is inserted below the original bottom card, each of the 6 possible orders of the 3 bottom cards is equally likely. Now consider the first time T,-, that the original bottom card comes up to the top. By an inductive argument, all (n l ) ! arrangements of the lower cards are equally likely. When the original bottom card is inserted at random, at time T = q,-, + 1, then all n! possible arrangements of the deck are equally likely."
