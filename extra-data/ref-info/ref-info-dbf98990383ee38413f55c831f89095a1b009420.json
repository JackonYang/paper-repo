These models provide a way of relating different spatial priors that have been used for recognizing generic classes of objects, including joint Gaussian models and tree-structured models. By providing explicit control over the degree of spatial structure, our models make it possible to study the extent to which additional spatial constraints among parts are actually helpful in detection and localization, and to consider the tradeoff in representational power and computational cost. We consider these questions for object classes that have substantial geometric structure, such as airplanes, faces and motorbikes, using datasets employed by other researchers to facilitate evaluation. We find that for these classes of objects, a relatively small amount of spatial structure in the model can provide statistically indistinguishable recognition performance from more powerful models, and at a substantially lower computational cost."

The first step of our method consists of clustering local scale-invariant descriptors to characterize object class appearance. Next, we train on the groups, and perform feature selection to determine the most discriminative parts. We use local regions to realize robust and sparse part and texture selection invariant to changes in scale, orientation and affine deformation and, as a result, we avoid image normalization in both training and prediction phases. We train our object models without requiring image parts to be labeled or objects to be separated from the background. Moreover, our method continues to work well when images have cluttered background and occluded objects. We evaluate our method on seven recently proposed datasets, and quantitatively compare the effect of different types of local regions and feature selection criteria on object recognition. Our experiments show that local invariant descriptors are an appropriate representation for many different object classes. Our results also confirm the importance of appearance-based discriminative feature selection."

                "text": "In this paper we describe the first stage of a new learning system for object detection and recognition. For our system we propose Boosting (5) as the underlying learning technique. This allows the use of very diverse sets of visual features in the learning process within a com- mon framework: Boosting \u2014 together with a weak hypotheses finder \u2014 may choose very inhomogeneous features as most relevant for combina- tion into a final hypothesis. As another advantage the weak hypotheses finder may search the weak hypotheses space without explicit calculation of all available hypotheses, reducing computation time. This contrasts the related work of Agarwal and Roth (1) where Winnow was used as learning algorithm and all weak hypotheses were calculated explicitly. In our first empirical evaluation we use four types of local descriptors: two basic ones consisting of a set of grayvalues and intensity moments and two high level descriptors: moment invariants (8) and SIFTs (12). The descriptors are calculated from local patches detected by an inter- est point operator. The weak hypotheses finder selects one of the local patches and one type of local descriptor and efficiently searches for the most discriminative similarity threshold. This differs from other work on Boosting for object recognition where simple rectangular hypotheses (22) or complex classifiers (20) have been used. In relatively simple images, where the objects are prominent, our approach yields results comparable to the state-of-the-art (3). But we also obtain very good results on more complex images, where the objects are located in arbitrary positions, poses, and scales in the images. These results indicate that our flexible approach, which also allows the inclusion of features from segmented re- gions and even spatial relationships, leads us a significant step towards generic object recognition."

Each element of this set is a complex feature obtained by combining position- and scale-tolerant edge-detectors over neighboring positions and multiple orientations. Our system motivated by a quantitative model of visual cortex outperforms state-of-the-art systems on a variety of object image datasets from different groups. We also show that our system is able to learn from very few examples with no prior category knowledge. The success of the approach is also a suggestive plausibility proof for a class of feed-forward models of object recognition in cortex. Finally, we conjecture the existence of a universal overcomplete dictionary of features that could handle the recognition of all object categories."

The optimal choice of feature types (whose repertoire includes interest points, curves and regions) is made automatically. In recognition, the model may be applied efficiently in an exhaustive manner, bypassing the need for feature detectors, to give the globally optimal match within a query image.

Compact and yet discriminative appearance-based object class models are automatically learned from a set of training images. The method is simple and extremely fast, making it suitable for many applications such as semantic image retrieval, Web search, and interactive image editing. It classifies a region according to the proportions of different visual words (clusters in feature space). The specific visual words and the typical proportions in each object are learned from a segmented training set. The main contribution of this paper is twofold: i) an optimally compact visual dictionary is learned by pair-wise merging of visual words from an initially large dictionary. The final visual words are described by GMMs. ii) A novel statistical measure of discrimination is proposed which is optimized by each merge operation. High classification accuracy is demonstrated for nine object classes on photographs of real objects viewed under general lighting conditions, poses and viewpoints. The set of test images used for validation comprise: i) photographs acquired by us, ii) images from the Web and iii) images from the recently released Pascal dataset. The proposed algorithm performs well on both texture-rich objects (e.g. grass, sky, trees) and structure-rich ones (e.g. cars, bikes, planes)"

Objects are modeled as flexible constellations of parts. A probabilistic representation is used for all aspects of the object: shape, appearance, occlusion and relative scale. An entropy-based feature detector is used to select regions and their scale within the image. In learning the parameters of the scale-invariant object model are estimated. This is done using expectation-maximization in a maximum-likelihood setting. In recognition, this model is used in a Bayesian manner to classify images. The flexible nature of the model is demonstrated by excellent results over a range of datasets including geometrically constrained classes (e.g. faces, cars) and flexible objects (such as animals)."

The first layer selects PCA-SIFT and shape context features and combines the two feature types to form a strong classifier. Although previous approaches have used either feature type to train an AdaBoost model, our approach is the first to combine these complementary sources of information into a single feature pool and to use Adaboost to select those features most important for class recognition. The second layer adds to these local and global descriptions information about the spatial relationships between features. Through comparisons to the training sample, we first find the most prominent local features in Layer I, then capture the spatial relationships between these features in Layer 2. Rather than discarding this spatial information, we therefore use it to improve the strength of our classifier. We compared our method to (R. Fergus et al., 2003, A. Opelt et al., 2004, J. Thureson et al., 2004) and in all cases our approach outperformed these previous methods using a popular benchmark for object class recognition (R. Fergus et al., 2003). ROC equal error rates approached 99%. We also tested our method using a dataset of images that better equates the complexity between object and non-object images, and again found that our approach outperforms previous methods."

                "text": "The task of visual classification is thce recognition of an object in the image as belonging to a general class of similar objects, such as a face, a car, a dog, and the like. This is a fundamental and natural task for biological visual systems, but it has proven difficult to perform visual classification by artificial computer vision systems. The main reason for this difficulty is the variability of shape within a class: different objects vary widely in appearance, and it is difficult to capture the essential shape features that characterize the members of one category and distinguish them from another, such as dogs from cats. \n \nIn this paper we describe an approach to classification using a fragment-based representation. In this approach, objects within a class are represented in terms of common image fragments that are used as building blocks for representing a large variety of different objects that belong to a common class. The fragments are selected from a training set of images based on a criterion of maximizing the mutual information of the fragments and the class they represent. For the purpose of classification the fragments are also organized into types, where each type is a collection of alternative fragments, such as different hairline or eye regions for face classification. During classification, the algorithm detects fragments of the different types, and then combines the evidence for the detected fragments to reach a final decision. Experiments indicate that it is possible to trade off the complexity of fragments with the complexity of the combination and decision stage, and this tradeoff is discussed. \n \nThe method is different from previous part-based methods in using class-specific object fragments of varying complexity, the method of selecting fragments, and the organization into fragment types. Experimental results of detecting face and car views show that the fragment-based approach can generalize well to a variety of novel image views within a class while maintaining low mis-classification error rates. We briefly discuss relationships between the proposed method and properties of parts of the primate visual system involved in object perception"

A primary contribution of this paper is the definition of the instantiation of an object in terms of shifts of a moderate number local submodels\u2014parts\u2014which are subsequently recombined using a patchwork operation, to define a coherent statistical model of the data. Object classes are modeled as mixtures of patchwork of parts POP models that are discovered sequentially as more class data is observed. We define the notion of the support associated to an instantiation, and use this to formulate statistical models for multi-object configurations including possible occlusions. All decisions on the labeling of the objects in the image are based on comparing likelihoods. The combination of a deformable model with an efficient estimation procedure yields competitive results in a variety of applications with very small training sets, without need to train decision boundaries\u2014only data from the class being trained is used.

We show how to find people by finding candidate body segments, and then constructing assemblies of segments that are consistent with the constraints on the appearance of a person that result from kinematic properties. Since a reasonable model of a person requires at least nine segments, it is not possible to inspect every group, due to the huge combinatorial complexity.We propose two approaches to this problem. In one, the search can be pruned by using projected versions of a classifier that accepts groups corresponding to people. We describe an efficient projection algorithm for one popular classifier, and demonstrate that our approach can be used to determine whether images of real scenes contain people.The second approach employs a probabilistic framework, so that we can draw samples of assemblies, with probabilities proportional to their likelihood, which allows to draw human-like assemblies more often than the non-person ones. The main performance problem is in segmentation of images, but the overall results of both approaches on real images of people are encouraging."

We propose and compare two alternative implementations using different classifiers: Naive Bayes and SVM. The main advantages of the method are that it is simple, computationally efficient and intrinsically invariant. We present results for simultaneously classifying seven semantic visual categories. These results clearly demonstrate that the method is robust to background clutter and produces good categorization accuracy even without exploiting geometric information."

Each part is represented using a simple appearance model and the deformable configuration is represented by spring-like connections between pairs of parts. While pictorial structures were introduced a number of years ago, they have not been broadly applied to matching and recognition problems. This has been due in part to the computational difficulty of matching pictorial structures to images. In this paper we present an efficient algorithm for finding the best global match of a pictorial stucture to an image. With this improved algorithm, pictorial structures provide a practical and powerful framework for quantitative descriptions of objects and scenes, and are suitable for many generic image recognition problems. We illustrate the approach using simple models of a person and a car."
