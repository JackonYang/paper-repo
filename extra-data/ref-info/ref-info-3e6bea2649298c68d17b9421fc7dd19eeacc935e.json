Suppose that some data source provides samples consisting of n-dimensional feature-vectors, but that this data all happens to lie on an m-dimensional surface embedded in the n-dimensional feature space. Then occurrences of data can be more concisely described by specifying an m-dimensional location on the embedded surface than by reciting all n components of the feature vector. The recoding of data in such a way is a form of abstraction. This paper describes a method for performing this type of abstraction in connectionist networks of simple computing elements. We present a scheme for representing the values of continuous (scalar) variables in subsets of units. The backpropagation weight updating method for training connectionist networks is extended by the use of auxiliary pressure in order to coax hidden units into the prescribed representation for scalar-valued variables."

This paper describes further research on the learning procedure. We start by describing the units, the way they are connected, the learning procedure, and the extension to iterative nets. We then give an example in which a network learns a set of filters that enable it to discriminate formant-like patterns in the presence of noise. The speed of learning is strongly dependent on the shape of the surface formed by the error measure in weight space . We give examples of the shape of the error surface for a typical task and illustrate how an acceleration method speeds up descent in weight space. The main drawback of the learning procedure is the way it scales as the size of the task and the network increases. We give some preliminary results on scaling and show how the magnitude of the optimal weight changes depends on the fan-in of the units. Additional results illustrate the effects on learning speed of the amount of interaction between the weights. A variation of the learning procedure that back-propagates desired state information rather than error gradients is developed and compared with the standard procedure. Finally, we discuss the relationship between our iterative networks and the analog networks described by Hopefield and Tank (Hopfield 85). The learning procedure can discover appropriate weights in their kind of network, as well as determine an optimal schedule for varying the nonlinearity of the units during a search."

In my estimate, the most fundamental contribution so far of artificial intelligence and computer science to the joint enterprise of cognitive science has been the notion of a physical symbol system, i.e., the concept of a broad class of systems capable of having and manipulating symbols, yet realizable in the physical universe. The notion of symbol so defined is internal to this concept, so it becomes a hypothesis that this notion of symbols includes the symbols that we humans use every day of our lives. In this paper we attempt systematically, but plainly, to lay out the nature of physical symbol systems. Such a review is in ways familiar, but not thereby useless. Restatement of fundamentals is an important exercise.The views and conclusions contained in this document are those of the author and should not be interpreted as representing the official policies, either expressed or implied, of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or the U.S. Government.Herb Simon would be a co-author of this paper, except that he is giving his own paper at this conference.
