                "text": "There is much current interest in kernel methods for classi cation re gression PCA and other linear methods of data analysis Kernel methods may be particularly valuable for problems in which the input data is not readily described by explicit feature vectors One such problem is where input data consists of symbol sequences of di erent lengths and the re lationships between sequences are best captured by dynamic alignment scores This paper shows that the scores produced by certain dynamic align ment algorithms for sequences are in fact valid kernel functions This is proved by expressing the alignment scores explicitly as dot products Alignment kernels are potentially applicable to biological sequence data speech data and time series data The kernel construction may be extended from pair HMMs to pair probabilistic context free grammars Introduction Linear Methods using Kernel Functions Introduction Linear Methods using Kernel Functions In many types of machine learning the learner is given a training set of cases or examples a al A A denotes the set of all possible cases cases may be vectors pieces of text biological sequences sentences etc For supervised learning the cases are accompanied by a set of corresponding labels or values y yl The cases are mapped to feature vectors x xl X where the X is a real vector space termed the feature space The mapping from A to X is denoted by so that xi ai Sometimes the cases are given as feature vectors to start with in which case may be the identity mapping otherwise denotes the method of assigning numeric feature values to a case Once a feature vector xi has been de ned for each case ai it becomes pos sible to apply a wide range of linear methods such as support vector machines linear regression principal components analysis PCA and k means cluster analysis As shown in Vap for SV machines in for example Wah for linear re gression and in SSM for PCA and k means cluster analysis the calculations for all of these linear methods may be carried out using a dual rather than a primal formulation of the problem For example in linear least squares regression the primal formulation is to nd a coe cient vector that minimises kX yk whereX is the design matrix an l by d matrix in which the ith row is xi and each xi has d elements If l is larger than d the usual method of nding is to solve the normal equations XX Xy This requires the solution of a set of linear equations with coe cients given by the d d matrix XX The dual formulation is to nd a coe cient vector that minimises kXX yk so that one coe cient i is found for each case vector xi This requires the solution of a set of linear equations with coe cients given by the l l matrix XX Both methods lead to the same predicted value y for a new case x If there are more cases than features that is if l d the primal method is more economical because the d d matrix XX is smaller than the l l matrix XX For example if there are cases each described by a vector of measurements then the primal method requires solving a by system of linear equations while the dual method requires solving a by system which will have rank at most For such a problem the dual method has no advantage The potential advantage of the dual method for regression is that it can be applied to very large feature vectors The coe cient matrix XX contains the dot products of pairs of feature vectors the ijth element of XX is xi xj In the dual calculation it is only dot products of feature vectors that are used feature vectors never appear on their own As the feature vectors xi ai appear only in dot products it is often possible to avoid computing the feature vectors and to compute dot products directly in some economical fashion from the case descriptions ai instead A kernel is a function k that computes a dot product of feature vectors from the corresponding cases Applying Linear Methods to Structured Objects De nition A kernel is a function k such that for all a b A"

A subsequence is any ordered sequence of k characters occurring in the text though not necessarily contiguously. The subsequences are weighted by an exponentially decaying factor of their full length in the text, hence emphasising those occurrences which are close to contiguous. A direct computation of this feature vector would involve a prohibitive amount of computation even for modest values of k, since the dimension of the feature space grows exponentially with k. The paper describes how despite this fact the inner product can be efficiently evaluated by a dynamic programming technique. A preliminary experimental comparison of the performance of the kernel compared with a standard word feature space kernel [6] is made showing encouraging results."

Only recently, however, have computers become powerful enough to permit the widescale application of this concept to real world problems in statistical estimation and pattern recognition. In this paper, we describe a method for statistical modeling based on maximum entropy. We present a maximum-likelihood approach for automatically constructing maximum entropy models and describe how to implement this approach efficiently, using as examples several problems in natural language processing."

The approach combines high performance and efficiency with theoretical understanding and improved robustness. In particular, it is highly effective without greedy heuristic components. The SVM approach is computationally efficient in training and classification, and it comes with a learning theory that can guide real-world applications. Learning To Classify Text Using Support Vector Machines gives a complete and detailed description of the SVM approach to learning text classifiers, including training algorithms, transductive text classification, efficient performance estimation, and a statistical learning model of text classification. In addition, it includes an overview of the field of text classification, making it self-contained even for newcomers to the field. This book gives a concise introduction to SVMs for pattern recognition, and it includes a detailed description of how to formulate text-classification tasks for machine learning."

The method can be applied iteratively to build a kernel on a innnite set from kernels involving generators of the set. The family of kernels generated generalizes the family of radial basis kernels. It can also be used to deene kernels in the form of joint Gibbs probability distributions. Kernels can be built from hidden Markov random elds, generalized regular expressions, pair-HMMs, or ANOVA de-compositions. Uses of the method lead to open problems involving the theory of innnitely divisible positive deenite functions. Fundamentals of this theory and the theory of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces are reviewed and applied in establishing the validity of the method."

A remaining problem, however, is the selection of state-transition structure for the model. This paper demonstrates that extraction accuracy strongly depends on the selection of structure, and presents an algorithm for automatically finding good structures by stochastic optimization. Our algorithm begins with a simple model and then performs hill-climbing in the space of possible structures by splitting states and gauging performance on a validation set. Experimental results show that this technique finds HMM models that almost always out-perform a fixed model, and have superior average performance across tasks."

We have evaluated the model in English (based on data from the Sixth and Seventh Message Understanding Conferences [MUC-6, MUC-7] and broadcast news) and in Spanish (based on data distributed through the First Multilingual Entity Task [MET-1]), and on speech input (based on broadcast news). We report results here on standard materials only to quantify performance on data available to the community, namely, MUC-6 and MET-1. Results have been consistently better than reported by any other learning algorithm. IdentiFinder's performance is competitive with approaches based on handcrafted rules on mixed case text and superior on text where case information is not available. We also present a controlled experiment showing the effect of training set size on performance, demonstrating that as little as 100,000 words of training data is adequate to get performance around 90% on newswire. Although we present our understanding of why this algorithm performs so well on this class of problems, we believe that significant improvement in performance may still be possible."

This representation does not refer to an explicit feature representation of the data items and is thus more general than the standard approach of using Euclidean feature vectors, from which pairwise proximities can always be calculated. Our first approach is based on a combined linear embedding and classification procedure resulting in an extension of the Optimal Hyperplane algorithm to pseudo-Euclidean data. As an alternative we present another approach based on a linear threshold model in the proximity values themselves, which is optimized using Structural Risk Minimization. We show that prior knowledge about the problem can be incorporated by the choice of distance measures and examine different metrics W.r.t. their generalization. Finally, the algorithms are successfully applied to protein structure data and to data from the cat's cerebral cortex. They show better performance than K-nearest-neighbor classification."

Such trained systems have some significant advantages: 1. They can be easily ported to new domains by simply annotating data with semantic answers. 2. The complex interactions that make rule-based systems difficult to develop and maintain can here be learned automatically from the training data. We believe that the results in this evaluation are evidence that such trained systems, even at their current level of development, can perform roughly on a par with rules hand-tailored by experts. Since MUC-3, BBN has been steadily increasing the proportion of the information extraction process that is statistically trained. Already in MET-1, our name-finding results were the output of a fully statistical, HMM-based model, and that statistical Identifinder(trademark) model was also used for the NE task in MUC-7. For the MUC-7 TE and TR tasks, BBN developed SIFT, a new model that represents a significant further step along this path, replacing PLUM, a system requiring handwritten patterns, with SIFT, a single integrated trained model."

For many problems the assumptions made by the generative models are evidently wrong, leaving open the question of why these approaches work. \n \nThis paper presents a learning theory account of the major statistical approaches to learning in natural language. A class of Linear Statistical Queries (LSQ) hypotheses is defined and learning with it is shown to exhibit some robustness properties. Many statistical learners used in natural language, including naive Bayes, Markov Models and Maximum Entropy models are shown to be LSQ hypotheses, explaining the robustness of these predictors even when the underlying probabilistic assumptions do not hold. This coherent view of when and why learning approaches work in this context may help to develop better learning methods and an understanding of the role of learning in natural language inferences."

SVMs deliver state-of-the-art performance in real-world applications such as text categorisation, hand-written character recognition, image classification, biosequences analysis, etc., and are now established as one of the standard tools for machine learning and data mining. Students will find the book both stimulating and accessible, while practitioners will be guided smoothly through the material required for a good grasp of the theory and its applications. The concepts are introduced gradually in accessible and self-contained stages, while the presentation is rigorous and thorough. Pointers to relevant literature and web sites containing software ensure that it forms an ideal starting point for further study. Equally, the book and its associated web site will guide practitioners to updated literature, new applications, and on-line software."

Conditional random fields offer several advantages over hidden Markov models and stochastic grammars for such tasks, including the ability to relax strong independence assumptions made in those models. Conditional random fields also avoid a fundamental limitation of maximum entropy Markov models (MEMMs) and other discriminative Markov models based on directed graphical models, which can be biased towards states with few successor states. We present iterative parameter estimation algorithms for conditional random fields and compare the performance of the resulting models to HMMs and MEMMs on synthetic and natural-language data."

We consider a setting in which the learner responds to each example according to a current hypothesis. Then the learner updates the hypothesis, if necessary, based on the correct classification of the example. One natural measure of the quality of learning in this setting is the number of mistakes the learner makes. For suitable classes of functions, learning algorithms are available that make a bounded number of mistakes, with the bound independent of the number of examples seen by the learner. We present one such algorithm that learns disjunctive Boolean functions, along with variants for learning other classes of Boolean functions. The basic method can be expressed as a linear-threshold algorithm. A primary advantage of this algorithm is that the number of mistakes grows only logarithmically with the number of irrelevant attributes in the examples. At the same time, the algorithm is computationally efficient in both time and space."

If such distances separate the classes well, the nearest neighbor method offers a good solution. However, dissimilarities used in practice are usually far from ideal and the performance of the nearest neighbor rule suffers from its sensitivity to noisy examples. We show that other, more global classification techniques are preferable to the nearest neighbor rule, in such cases.For classification purposes, two different ways of using generalized dissimilarity kernels are considered. In the first one, distances are isometrically embedded in a pseudo-Euclidean space and the classification task is performed there. In the second approach, classifiers are built directly on distance kernels. Both approaches are described theoretically and then compared using experiments with different dissimilarity measures and datasets including degraded data simulating the problem of missing values."

In these cases, the observations are usually modeled as multinomial distributions over a discrete vocabulary, and the HMM parameters are set to maximize the likelihood of the observations. This paper presents a new Markovian sequence model, closely related to HMMs, that allows observations to be represented as arbitrary overlapping features (such as word, capitalization, formatting, part-of-speech), and defines the conditional probability of state sequences given observation sequences. It does this by using the maximum entropy framework to fit a set of exponential models that represent the probability of a state given an observation and the previous state. We present positive experimental results on the segmentation of FAQ\u2019s."

Like Vapnik's maximal-margin classifier, our algorithm takes advantage of data that are linearly separable with large margins. Compared to Vapnik's algorithm, however, ours is much simpler to implement, and much more efficient in terms of computation time. We also show that our algorithm can be efficiently used in very high dimensional spaces using kernel functions. We performed some experiments using our algorithm, and some variants of it, for classifying images of handwritten digits. The performance of our algorithm is close to, but not as good as, the performance of maximal-margin classifiers on the same problem, while saving significantly on computation time and programming effort."

We have developed a new method to analyse this kind of data using support vector machines (SVMs). This analysis consists of both classification of the tissue samples, and an exploration of the data for mis-labeled or questionable tissue results.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWe demonstrate the method in detail on samples consisting of ovarian cancer tissues, normal ovarian tissues, and other normal tissues. The dataset consists of expression experiment results for 97,802 cDNAs for each tissue. As a result of computational analysis, a tissue sample is discovered and confirmed to be wrongly labeled. Upon correction of this mistake and the removal of an outlier, perfect classification of tissues is achieved, but not with high confidence. We identify and analyse a subset of genes from the ovarian dataset whose expression is highly differentiated between the types of tissues. To show robustness of the SVM method, two previously published datasets from other types of tissues or cells are analysed. The results are comparable to those previously obtained. We show that other machine learning methods also perform comparably to the SVM on many of those datasets.\n\n\nAVAILABILITY\nThe SVM software is available at http://www.cs. columbia.edu/ approximately bgrundy/svm."

For example, the previous sentence breaks up something like this: \n \n(1) \n \n[I begin] [with an intuition]: [when I read] [a sentence], [I read it] [a chunk] [at a time] \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThese chunks correspond in some way to prosodic patterns. It appears, for instance, that the strongest stresses in the sentence fall one to a chunk, and pauses are most likely to fall between chunks. Chunks also represent a grammatical watershed of sorts. The typical chunk consists of a single content word surrounded by a constellation of function words, matching a fixed template. A simple context-free grammar is quite adequate to describe the structure of chunks. By contrast, the relationships between chunks are mediated more by lexical selection than by rigid templates. Co-occurrence of chunks is determined not just by their syntactic categories, but is sensitive to the precise words that head them; and the order in which chunks occur is much more flexible than the order of words within chunks."

In Chapter 2, a brief review of the main alternative approaches to the development of brain models is presented. Chapter 3 considers the physiological and psychological criteria for a suitable model, and attempts to evaluate the empirical evidence which is available on several important issues. Chapter 4 contains basic definitions and some of the notation to be used in later sections are presented. Parts II and III are devoted to a summary of the established theoretical results obtained to date. Part II (Chapters 5 through 14) deals with the theory of three-layer series-coupled perceptrons, on which most work has been done to date. Part III (Chapters 15 through 20) deals with the theory of multi-layer and cross-coupled perceptrons. Part IV is concerned with more speculative models and problems for future analysis. Of necessity, the final chapters become increasingly heuristic in character, as the theory of perceptrons is not yet complete, and new possibilities are continually coming to light."
