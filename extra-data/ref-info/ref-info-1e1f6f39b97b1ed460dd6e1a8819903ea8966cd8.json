After a horizontal grating is viewed for 1 sec or longer, the resolution threshold for horizontal contours is greater than the threshold for the identification of vertical and obliquely oriented contours. Conversely, prolonged viewing of vertical contours raises the threshold for the identification of vertical lines above those for other orientations. Similar results are found following adapting exposures to left-and right-oblique contours. The differential masking effects are systematic functions of the duration of exposure to the light-and-dark adapting pattern."

The line spread function of the human visual system was computed. The test pattern in which the luminance varied sinusoidally in the horizontal direction was generated on the face of an oscilloscope by modulating the intensity of the beam.The behavior of the system changes with the mean retinal illuminance. At the highest mean retinal illuminance (1000 td) the MTF shows two peaks which gradually disappear at lower mean retinal illuminances. The line spread function of the entire visual system also exhibits a change in shape dependent on the mean retinal illuminance. In particular, what are deemed inhibitory influences become less prominent at lower mean retinal illuminance. From the line spread function of the optical part up to the retina, the line spread function of the physiological part of the visual system is also evaluated.A common asymptote appears at high frequencies when the characteristics are plotted in terms of absolute deviation from the mean versus spatial frequency for threshold perception. The asymptote provides an upper bound for the behavior of visual acuity at any retinal illuminance."

It would be astonishing if such a structure did not profoundly modify the response patterns of fibres coming into it. In the cat's visual cortex, the receptive field arrangements of single cells suggest that there is indeed a degree of complexity far exceeding anything yet seen at lower levels in the visual system. In a previous paper we described receptive fields of single cortical cells, observing responses to spots of light shone on one or both retinas (Hubel & Wiesel, 1959). In the present work this method is used to examine receptive fields of a more complex type (Part I) and to make additional observations on binocular interaction (Part II). This approach is necessary in order to understand the behaviour of individual cells, but it fails to deal with the problem of the relationship of one cell to its neighbours. In the past, the technique of recording evoked slow waves has been used with great success in studies of functional anatomy. It was employed by Talbot & Marshall (1941) and by Thompson, Woolsey & Talbot (1950) for mapping out the visual cortex in the rabbit, cat, and monkey. Daniel & Whitteiidge (1959) have recently extended this work in the primate. Most of our present knowledge of retinotopic projections, binocular overlap, and the second visual area is based on these investigations. Yet the method of evoked potentials is valuable mainly for detecting behaviour common to large populations of neighbouring cells; it cannot differentiate functionally between areas of cortex smaller than about 1 mm2. To overcome this difficulty a method has in recent years been developed for studying cells separately or in small groups during long micro-electrode penetrations through nervous tissue. Responses are correlated with cell location by reconstructing the electrode tracks from histological material. These techniques have been applied to"

In the past there have been many theoretical studies of the potential resolving power of the optics based on consideration of diffraction and the chromatic and spherical aberrations of the eye. It is only recently that objective measurements of the quality of the optics of man in vivo have been obtained (Flamant, 1955; Westheimer & Campbell, 1962; Krauskopf 1962; R6hler, 1962). As will be demonstrated, it is not possible to use these findings to determine the relative weighting that should be given to the optics and the retina in determining a given threshold. This paper reports the results of experiments using an improved version of the well-known interference fringe technique (Le Grand, 1937; Byram 1944; Westheimer, 1960; Arnulf & Dupuy, 1960) which theoretically allows a sinusoidal pattern of very high contrast to be formed directly on the retina. The practical difficulty in using this technique is to obtain a light source of high intrinsic brightness and coherence with which to form high-luminance interference fringes on the retina; this has been solved by using a neon-helium gas laser. By decreasing the contrast (Fig. 1) of the interference fringes with another source of light it was possible to determine the contrasts on the retina at which the fringes are just detected. Thus a measure of the resolving power of the retina-brain is obtained without prior modification by the optics of the eye. Measurements have also been made of the visual resolution of external gratings whose intensity varied sinusoidally with distance across the gratings and which were imaged on to the retina by the optical components of the eye. By comparing the threshold contrasts of these external sinusoidal gratings with thresholds for sinusoidal fringes of the same spatial frequency formed through interference, the quality of the"

These cells give brief responses at \u2018on\u2019 and \u2018off\u2019 to lights falling in their receptive fields and they give vigorous responses to moving spots, but only when these are moved in certain directions through their fields. Motion in the \u2018preferred\u2019 direction gives the maximum discharge, while motion in the opposite, \u2018null\u2019, direction, causes no response. The \u2018preferred\u2019 direction differs in different units: thus which of a set of cells are active conveys information as to the direction of motion of objects in the visual field. The frequency of the discharge depends greatly on speed and direction of motion, but is only slightly influenced by the intensity of the moving stimulus spot. Furthermore, the discharge occurs for the same direction of motion with a black spot as with a white spot. This behaviour is what one might expect in units of which the function is to abstract direction of motion from the pattern of light falling on the retina."

The outlines of a theory meeting these conditions are put forward. The model has three parts : (1) A processor that extracts local features from the input picture preserving information about the spatial relationships between the features. (2) A mechanism that induces an abstract description of the output from the processor. (3) A store in which such descriptions are held. Some suggestions are made about the language in which descriptions are framed : it must contain hierarchical elements to allow for the possibility of segmenting a picture in different ways. It is shown how the properties of such a language could account for the facts listed above. In recognizing a picture the output from the store is matched to a stored descriptive rule. What we see is the descriptive rule selected to describe an input picture\u2014we cannot respond to details of the picture not represented in the rule. Since, however, many different rules describe the same input picture, animals and man respond to different aspects of the same picture on different occasions of presentation."

In its earliest form it consisted of simple applications of the laws of reflection and refraction to geometrically simple systems. The analytical theory of the aberrations of axially symmetrical syste, s, on the other hand, has been in existance for a little more than a century. If one reflects that for the most part this comprises only the consequences of the application of Snell's law and elementary coordinate geometry to the very simple geometrical configuration of spherical surfaces with their centres in a straight line, it is remarkable that even here important work both continues and remains to be done."
