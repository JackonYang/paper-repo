The method avoids image correspondence problems by working in a discretized scene space whose voxels are traversed in a fixed visibility ordering. This strategy takes full account of occlusions and allows the input cameras to be far apart and widely distributed about the environment. The algorithm identifies a special set of invariant voxels which together form a spatial and photometric reconstruction of the scene, fully consistent with the input images. The approach is evaluated with images from both inward-facing and outward-facing cameras."

This transformation effectively removes explicit use of epipolar geometry, thus allowing direct use of multiple cameras with arbitrary geometries. The maximum-flow, solved both efficiently and globally, yields a minimum-cut that corresponds to a disparity surface for the whole image at once. This global and efficient approach to stereo analysis allows the reconstruction to proceed in an arbitrary volume of space and provides a more accurate and coherent depth map than the traditional stereo algorithms. In particular, smoothness is applied uniformly instead of only along epipolar lines, while the global optimality of the depth surface is guaranteed. Results show improved depth estimation as well as better handling of depth discontinuities. While the worst case running time is O(n1.5 d1.5 log(nd)), the observed average running time is O(n1.2 d1.3) for an image size of n pixels and depth resolution d."

Once solved, the minimum-cut associated to the maximum-flow yields a disparity surface for the whole image at once. This global approach to stereo analysis provides a more accurate and coherent depth map than the traditional line-by-line stereo. Moreover, the optimality of the depth surface is guaranteed and can be shown to be a generalization of the dynamic programming approach that is widely used in standard stereo. Results show improved depth estimation as well as better handling of depth discontinuities. While the worst case running time is O(n/sup 2/d/sup 2/log(nd)), the observed average running time is O(n/sup 1.2/ d/sup 1.3/) for an image size of n pixels and depth resolution d."

Unfortunately, as more images are added, the prevalence of semi-occluded regions (pixels visible in some but not all images) also increases. We propose some novel techniques to deal with this problem. Our first idea is to use a combination of shiftable windows and a dynamically selected subset of the neighboring images to do the matches. Our second idea is to explicitly label occluded pixels within a global energy minimization framework, and to reason about visibility within this framework so that only truly visible pixels are matched. Experimental results show a dramatic improvement using the first idea over conventional multibaseline stereo, especially when used in conjunction with a global energy minimization technique. These results also show that explicit occlusion labeling and visibility reasoning do help, but not significantly, if the spatial and temporal selection is applied first."

In voxel occupancy, the task is to produce a binary labeling of a set of voxels, that determines which voxels are filled and which are empty. In this paper, we give an energy minimization formulation of the voxel occupancy problem. The global minimum of this energy can be rapidly computed with a single graph cut, using a result due to D. Greig et al. (1989). The energy function we minimize contains a data term and a smoothness term. The data term is a sum over the individual voxels, where the penalty for a voxel is based on the observed intensities of the pixels that intersect it. The smoothness term is the number of empty voxels adjacent to filled ones. Our formulation can be viewed as a generalization of silhouette intersection, with two advantages: we do not compute silhouettes, which are a major source of errors; and we can naturally incorporate spatial smoothness. We give experimental results showing reconstructions from both real and synthetic imagery. Reconstruction using this smoothed energy function is not much more time consuming than simple silhouette intersection; it takes about 10 seconds to reconstruct a one million voxel volume."

The Euler-Lagrange equations which are deduced from the variational principle provide a set of PDE's which are used to deform an initial set of surfaces which then move towards the objects to be detected. The level set implementation of these PDE's potentially provides an efficient and robust way of achieving the surface evolution and to deal automatically with changes in the surface topology during the deformation, i.e. to deal with multiple objects. Results of an implementation of our theory also dealing with occlusion and vibility are presented on synthetic and real images."

This problem arises in newer applications of stereo reconstruction, such as view interpolation and the layering of real imagery with synthetic graphics for special effects and virtual studio applications. While this problem is intrinsically more difficult than traditional stereo correspondence, where only the disparities are being recovered, it provides a principled way of dealing with commonly occurring problems such as occlusions and the handling of mixed (foreground/background) pixels near depth discontinuities. It also provides a novel means for separating foreground and background objects (matting), without the use of a special blue screen. We formulate the problem as the recovery of colors and opacities in a generalized 3D (x, y, d) disparity space, and solve the problem using a combination of initial evidence aggregation followed by iterative energy minimization."

We then give a provably-correct algorithm, called Space Carving, for computing this shape and present experimental results on complex real-world scenes. The approach is designed to (1) capture photorealistic shapes that accurately model scene appearance from a wide range of viewpoints, and (2) account for the complex interactions between occlusion, parallax, shading, and their view-dependent effects on scene-appearance."

Each of these techniques constructs a graph such that the minimum cut on the graph also minimizes the energy. Yet, because these graph constructions are complex and highly specific to a particular energy function, graph cuts have seen limited application to date. In this paper, we give a characterization of the energy functions that can be minimized by graph cuts. Our results are restricted to functions of binary variables. However, our work generalizes many previous constructions and is easily applicable to vision problems that involve large numbers of labels, such as stereo, motion, image restoration, and scene reconstruction. We give a precise characterization of what energy functions can be minimized using graph cuts, among the energy functions that can be written as a sum of terms containing three or fewer binary variables. We also provide a general-purpose construction to minimize such an energy function. Finally, we give a necessary condition for any energy function of binary variables to be minimized by graph cuts. Researchers who are considering the use of graph cuts to optimize a particular energy function can use our results to determine if this is possible and then follow our construction to create the appropriate graph. A software implementation is freely available."

The major restriction is that the energy function's smoothness term must only involve pairs of pixels. We propose two algorithms that use graph cuts to compute a local minimum even when very large moves are allowed. The first move we consider is an /spl alpha/-/spl beta/-swap: for a pair of labels /spl alpha/,/spl beta/, this move exchanges the labels between an arbitrary set of pixels labeled a and another arbitrary set labeled /spl beta/. Our first algorithm generates a labeling such that there is no swap move that decreases the energy. The second move we consider is an /spl alpha/-expansion: for a label a, this move assigns an arbitrary set of pixels the label /spl alpha/. Our second algorithm, which requires the smoothness term to be a metric, generates a labeling such that there is no expansion move that decreases the energy. Moreover, this solution is within a known factor of the global minimum. We experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on image restoration, stereo and motion."

One of the simplest ways to do this is to use the silhouettes of the object (the binary classification of images into object and background) to construct a bounding volume for the object. To efficiently represent this volume, we use an octree, which represents the object as a tree of recursively subdivided cubes. We develop a new algorithm for computing the octree bounding volume from multiple silhouettes and apply it to an object rotating on a turntable in front of a stationary camera. The algorithm performs a limited amount of processing for each viewpoint and incrementally builds the volumetric model. The resulting algorithm requires less total computation than previous algorithms, runs in close to real-time, and builds a model whose resolution improves over time."

In general, identifying a nonconvex object using a silhouette-based approach implies neglecting some features of its surface as identification clues. The same features cannot be reconstructed by volume intersection techniques using multiple silhouettes of the object. This paper addresses the problem of finding which parts of a nonconvex object are relevant for silhouette-based image understanding. For this purpose, the geometric concept of visual hull of a 3-D object is introduced. This is the closest approximation of object S that can be obtained with the volume intersection approach; it is the maximal object silhouette-equivalent to S, i.e., which can be substituted for S without affecting any silhouette. Only the parts of the surface of S that also lie on the surface of the visual hull can be reconstructed or identified using silhouette-based algorithms. The visual hull depends not only on the object but also on the region allowed to the viewpoint. Two main viewing regions result in the external and internal visual hull. In the former case the viewing region is related to the convex hull of S, in the latter it is bounded by S. The internal visual hull also admits an interpretation not related to silhouettes. Algorithms for computing visual hulls are presented and their complexity analyzed. In general, the visual hull of a 3-D planar face object turns out to be bounded by planar and curved patches. >"

In this paper we propose an algorithm to compute correspondence between stereo images or between frames of a motion sequence by minimizing an energy functional that accounts for slanted surfaces. The energy is minimized in a greedy strategy that alternates between segmenting the image into a number of non-overlapping regions (using the multiway-cut algorithm of Boykov, Veksler, and Zabih) and finding the affine parameters describing the displacement function of each region. A follow-up step enables the algorithm to escape local minima due to oversegmentation. Experiments on real images show the algorithm's ability to find an accurate segmentation and displacement map, as well as discontinuities and creases, from a wide variety of stereo and motion imagery."

Unlike conventional correlation matching and feature matching, the method provides a dense array of disparities, eliminating the need for interpolation. First, the stereo-matching problem is defined in terms of finding a disparity map that satisfies two competing constraints: (1) matched points should have similar image intensity, and (2) the disparity map should vary as slowly as possible. These constraints are interpreted as specifying the potential energy of a system of oscillators. Ground states are approximated by a new variant of simulated annealing, which has two important features. First, the microcanonical ensemble is simulated using a new algorithm that is more efficient and more easily implemented than the familiar Metropolis algorithm (which simulates the canonical ensemble). Secondly, it uses a hierarchical, coarse-to-fine control structure employing Gaussian or Laplacian pyramids of the stereo images. In this way, quickly computed results at low resolutions are used to initialize the system at higher resolutions."

The combinatorial optimization literature provides many min-cut/max-flow algorithms with different polynomial time complexity. Their practical efficiency, however, has to date been studied mainly outside the scope of computer vision. The goal of this paper is to provide an experimental comparison of the efficiency of min-cut/max flow algorithms for applications in vision. We compare the running times of several standard algorithms, as well as a new algorithm that we have recently developed. The algorithms we study include both Goldberg-Tarjan style \"push -relabel\" methods and algorithms based on Ford-Fulkerson style \"augmenting paths.\" We benchmark these algorithms on a number of typical graphs in the contexts of image restoration, stereo, and segmentation. In many cases, our new algorithm works several times faster than any of the other methods, making near real-time performance possible. An implementation of our max-flow/min-cut algorithm is available upon request for research purposes."

Analysis of the image motion of a silhouette or apparent contour enables computation of local surface curvature along the corresponding contour generator on the surface, assuming viewer motion is known. To perform the analysis, a spatiotemporal parameterization of image-curve motion is needed, but is underconstrained (a manifestation of the well-known aperture problem). It is shown that an epipolar parameterization is most naturally matched to the recovery of surface curvature.One immediate facility afforded by the analysis is that surface patches can be reconstructed in the vicinity of contour generators. Once surface curvature is known, it is possible to discriminate extremal contours from other fixed curves in space. Furthermore, the known robustness of parallax as a cue to depth extends to the case of surface curvature. Its derivative\u2014rate of parallax\u2014is shown theoretically to be a curvature cue that is robust to uncertainties in the known viewer motion. This robustness has been confirmed in experiments.Finally, the power of the new analysis for robotics applications is demonstrated. Illustrations are given of an Adept robot, equipped with a CCD camera, circumnavigating curved obstacles. When further equipped with a suction gripper the robot manipulator can pick up an object by its curved surface, under visual guidance."

Pixel gray levels and the presence and orientation of edges are viewed as states of atoms or molecules in a lattice-like physical system. The assignment of an energy function in the physical system determines its Gibbs distribution. Because of the Gibbs distribution, Markov random field (MRF) equivalence, this assignment also determines an MRF image model. The energy function is a more convenient and natural mechanism for embodying picture attributes than are the local characteristics of the MRF. For a range of degradation mechanisms, including blurring, nonlinear deformations, and multiplicative or additive noise, the posterior distribution is an MRF with a structure akin to the image model. By the analogy, the posterior distribution defines another (imaginary) physical system. Gradual temperature reduction in the physical system isolates low energy states (``annealing''), or what is the same thing, the most probable states under the Gibbs distribution. The analogous operation under the posterior distribution yields the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the image given the degraded observations. The result is a highly parallel ``relaxation'' algorithm for MAP estimation. We establish convergence properties of the algorithm and we experiment with some simple pictures, for which good restorations are obtained at low signal-to-noise ratios."
