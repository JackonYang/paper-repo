Results are presented showing that learning long-term dependencies in such recurrent networks using gradient descent is a very difficult task. It is shown how this difficulty arises when robustly latching bits of information with certain attractors. The derivatives of the output at time t with respect to the unit activations at time zero tend rapidly to zero as t increases for most input values. In such a situation, simple gradient descent techniques appear inappropriate. The consideration of alternative optimization methods and architectures is suggested.<<ETX>>"

This a priori knowledge can be interpreted as hints about the problem to be learned and these hints are encoded as rules which are then inserted into the neural network. The authors demonstrate the approach by training recurrent neural networks with inserted rules to learn to recognize regular languages from grammatical string examples. Because the recurrent networks have second-order connections, rule-insertion is a straightforward mapping of rules into weights and neurons. Simulations show that training recurrent networks with different amounts of partial knowledge to recognize simple grammers improves the training times by orders of magnitude, even when only a small fraction of all transitions are inserted as rules. In addition, there appears to be no loss in generalization performance.<<ETX>>"

                "text": "Time is at the heart of many pattern recognition tasks (e.g., speech recognition). However, connectionist learning algorithms to date are not well-suited for dealing with time-varying input patterns. This chapter introduces a specialized connectionist architecture and corresponding specialization of the back-propagation learning algorithm that operates efficiently, both in computational time and space requirements, on temporal sequences. The key feature of the architecture is a layer of selfconnected hidden units that integrate their current value with the new input at each time step to construct a static representation of the temporal input sequence. This architecture avoids two deficiencies found in the back-propagation unfolding-intime procedure (Rumelhart, Hinton, & Williams, 1986) for handing sequence recognition tasks: first, it reduces the difficulty of temporal credit assignment by focusing the back-propagated error signal; second, it eliminates the need for a buffer to hold the input sequence and/or intermediate activity levels. The latter property is due to the fact that during the forward (activation) phase, incremental activity traces can be locally computed that hold all information necessary for back propagation in time. It is argued that this architecture should scale better than conventional recurrent architectures with respect to sequence length. The architecture has been used to implement a temporal version of Rumelhart and McClelland's (1986) verb past-tense model. The hidden units learn to behave something like Rumelhart and McClelland's \"Wickelphones,\" a rich and flexible representation of temporal information."

                "text": "Learning structure in temporally-extended sequences is a difficult computational problem because only a fraction of the relevant information is available at any instant. Although variants of back propagation can in principle be used to find structure in sequences, in practice they are not sufficiently powerful to discover arbitrary contingencies, especially those spanning long temporal intervals or involving high order statistics. For example, in designing a connectionist network for music composition, we have encountered the problem that the net is able to learn musical structure that occurs locally in time--e.g., relations among notes within a musical phrase--but not structure that occurs over longer time periods--e.g., relations among phrases. To address this problem, we require a means of constructing a reduced description of the sequence that makes global aspects more explicit or more readily detectable. I propose to achieve this using hidden units that operate with different time constants. Simulation experiments indicate that slower time-scale hidden units are able to pick up global structure, structure that simply can not be learned by standard back propagation."

The conventional backpropagation algorithm cannot be applied in this case because the required derivatives are not available. However, if the network weights are random variables with smooth distribution functions, the probability of a hard-limiting unit taking one of its two possible values is a continuously differentiable function. In the paper, this is used to develop an algorithm similar to backpropagation, but for the hard-limiting case. It is shown that the computational framework of this algorithm is similar to standard backpropagation, but there is an additional computational expense involved in the estimation of gradients. Upper bounds on this estimation penalty are given. Two examples which indicate that, when this algorithm is used to train networks of hard-limiting units, its performance is similar to that of conventional backpropagation applied to networks of units with sigmoidal characteristics are presented."

There exist numerous learning rules for finding a set of weights to achieve a particular correspondence between input-output pairs. But early works in the field have shown that the number of threshold functions (or linearly separable functions) in N binary variables is small compared to the number of all possible boolean mappings in N variables, especially if N is large. This problem is one of the main limitations of most neural networks models where the state is fully specified by the environment during learning: they can only learn linearly separable functions of their inputs. Moreover, a learning procedure which requires the outside world to specify the state of every neuron during the learning session can hardly be considered as a general learning rule because in real-world conditions, only a partial information on the \u201cideal\u201d network state for each task is available from the environment. It is possible to use a set of so-called \u201chidden units\u201d [Hinton,Sejnowski,Ackley. 84], without direct interaction with the environment, which can compute intermediate predicates. Unfortunately, the global response depends on the output of a particular hidden unit in a highly non-linear way, moreover the nature of this dependence is influenced by the states of the other cells."

It permits uphill moves under the control of a probabilistic criterion, thus tending to avoid the first local minima encountered.\nThe algorithm has been tested against the Nelder and Mead simplex method and against a version of Adaptive Random Search. The test functions were Rosenbrock valleys and multiminima functions in 2,4, and 10 dimensions.\nThe new method proved to be more reliable than the others, being always able to find the optimum, or at least a point very close to it. It is quite costly in term of function evaluations, but its cost can be predicted in advance, depending only slightly on the starting point."
