The idea of photometric stereo is to vary the direction of the incident illumination between successive views while holding the viewing direction constant. This provides enough information to determine surface orientation at each picture element. Traditional stereo techniques determine range by relating two images of an object viewed from different directions. If the correspondence between picture elements is known, then distance to the object can be calculated by triangulation. Unfortunately, it is difficult to determine this correspondence. In photometric stereo, the imaging geometry does not change. Therefore, the correspondence between picture elements is known a priori. This stereo technique is photometric because it uses the intensity values recorded at a single picture element, in successive views, rather than the relative positions of features."

Automatic navigation using visible light or radar images requires exact alignment of such images with digital terrain models. In addition, automatic classification of terrain, using satellite imagery, requires such alignment to deal correctly with the effects of varying sun angle and surface slope. Even inspection techniques for certain industrial parts may be improved by this means.\nWe achieve the required alignment by matching the real image with a synthetic image obtained from a surface model and known positions of the light sources. The synthetic image intensity is calculated using the reflectance map, a convenient way of describing surface reflection as a function of surface gradient. We illustrate the technique using LANDSAT images and digital terrain models."

Support for this idea comes from three sources: the obvious utility of intrinsic characteristics for higher-level scene analysis; the apparent ability of humans to determine these characteristics, regardless of viewing conditions or familiarity with the scene; and a theoretical argument that such a description is obtainable, by a noncognitive and nonpurposive process, at least, for simple scene domains. The central problem in recovering intrinsic scene characteristics is that the information is confounded in the original light-intensity image: a single intensity value encodes all the characteristics of the corresponding scene point. Recovery depends on exploiting constraints, derived from assumptions about the nature of the scene and the physics of the imaging process."

                "text": "A general and rigorous treatment is given of the photometric method for deriving surface elevation information from a single picture of the surface. In the course of the derivation a brief indication is given of possible photometric function symmetries yielding exact solutions to the problem. It is shown that the photometric properties of the lunar maria are sufficient to produce an exact solution but with an inherent practical difficulty. The resulting equations are then specialized to the case of lunar photography and applied to the Ranger pictures as part of a digital processing procedure. Examples of the resulting elevation maps are given. INTRODUCTION QUANTITATIVE ELEVATION INFORMATION about a surface can be derived from pictures both by stereoscopic and by photometric methods. The second method, which is of interest here, was first suggested by van Diggelen (Ref. 1) in 1951. Extending his original formulation of the problem, it is desired to reconstruct quantitatively the shape of a surface being photographed using the imaging geometry, the facsi mile system transfer characteristics, and the surface photometric properties. A rigorous solution to this problem is presented and the results are applied to the lunar pictures taken by the three Ranger impacting spacecraft. CALCULATION OF ELEVATIONS IN TEl{]vIS OF A LENS-CENTERED COORDINATE SYSTEM The pertinent photometry of extended surfaces can be summarized as follows. For simplicity, it will be assumed that the surface possesses homogenous photometric properties at least over the local area under consideration. The photometric geometry can be com pletely defined in terms of three angles; the incidence angle i (angle between the direction of incident light and the surface normal), the emission angle e (angle between the direction of emitted light and the surface normal), and the phase angle g (angle between the directions of incident and emitted light). This geometry is shown in Figure 1. For uniform collimated illumination of the surface, such as with sunlight, the luminence b can be written b(i, e, g) = poEo\u00a2(i, e, g) (1) where Po is the normal albedo of the surface, Eo is the uniform illumination intensity, and \u00a2 (i, e, g) is the surface photometric function. The normalization of \u00a2 is such that \u00a2(O, 0, 0) = 1. * This paper presents the results of one phase of research conducted at J.P.L., California Institute of Technology, under Contract No. NAS 7-100, sponsored by NASA.

Prompt, accurate, and versatile performance is achieved. Earth-returned digital imagery data are driven from a computer to a pair of video monitors. Powerful computer support enables a photogrammetrist, stereoscopically viewing the video displays, to create diverse topographic products. Profiles, representing the intersection of any definable surface with the Martian relief, are readily generated. Vertical profiles and elevation contour maps, including stereo versions, are produced. Computer overlays of map products on stereo images aid map interpretation and permit independent quality evaluation. Slaved monitors enable parallel viewing. Maps span from the immediate foreground to the remote limits of ranging capability. Surface sampler arm specific vertical profiles enable direct reading of arm commands required for sample acquisition, rock rolling, and trenching. The ranging accuracy of \u00b12 cm throughout the sample area degrades to \u00b120 m at 100-m range."

In this paper, we apply this approach to the problem of representing three-dimensional shapes for the purpose of recognition. 1. Three criteria, accessibility, scope and uniqueness, and stability and sensitivity, are presented for judging the usefulness of a representation for shape recognition. 2. Three aspects of a representation\u2019s design are considered, (i) the representation\u2019s coordinate system, (ii) its primitives, which are the primary units of shape information used in the representation, and (iii) the organization the representation imposes on the information in its descriptions. 3. In terms of these design issues and the criteria presented, a shape representation for recognition should: (i) use an object-centred coordinate system, (ii) include volumetric primitives of varied sizes, and (iii) have a modular organization. A representation based on a shape\u2019s natural axes (for example the axes identified by a stick figure) follows directly from these choices. 4. The basic process for deriving a shape description in this representation must involve: (i) a means for identifying the natural axes of a shape in its image and (ii) a mechanism for transforming viewer-centred axis specifications to specifications in an object-centred coordinate system. 5. Shape recognition involves: (i) a collection of stored shape descriptions, and (ii) various indexes into the collection that allow a newly derived description to be associated with an appropriate stored description. The most important of these indexes allows shape recognition to proceed conservatively from the general to the specific based on the specificity of the information available from the image. 6. New constraints supplied by a conservative recognition process can be used to extract more information from the image. A relaxation process for carrying out this constraint analysis is described."

                "text": "An Algorithm is proposed for solving the stereoscopic matching problem. The algorithm consists of five steps: (1) Each image is filtered with bar masks of four sizes that vary with eccentricity; the equivalent filters are about one octave wide. (2) Zero-crossings of the mask values are localized, and positions that correspond to terminations are found; (3) For each mask size, matching takes place between pairs of zero- crossings or terminations of the same sign in the two images, for a range of disparities up to about the vergence movements, thus causing small masks to come into correspondence; (5) When a correspondence is achieved, it is written into a dynamic buffer, called the 2 1/2 D sketch. It is shown that this proposal provides a theoretical framework for most existing phychophysical and neurophysiological data about stereopsis. Several critical experimental predictions are also made, for instance, about the wsize of Panum?s area under various conditions. The results of such experiments would tell us whether, for example, cooperativity is necessary for the fusion process."
