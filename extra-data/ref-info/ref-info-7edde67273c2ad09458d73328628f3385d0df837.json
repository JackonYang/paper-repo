The space of functions on a Riemannian manifold has a family of smoothness functionals and a canonical basis associated to the Laplace-Beltrami operator. Moreover, the Laplace-Beltrami operator can be reconstructed with certain convergence guarantees when the manifold is only known through the sampled data points. This allows the techniques of regularization and Fourier analysis to be applied to functions defined on data. A convergence result is proved for the case when data is sampled from a compact submanifold of R\u2227k . Several applications are considered."

Riemann proposed the generalisation, to spaces of any order, of Gauss's theory of surfaces, and introduced certain fundamental ideas in this general theory. Bianchi, Beltrami, and others made substantial contributions to the subject, which was extended by Ricci with the use of tensor analysis and his absolute calculus. Recently there has been an extensive study and development of Riemannian geometry, and the book before us aims at presenting the existing theory.Riemannian Geometry.By Prof. L. P. Eisenhart.

We present a simple algorithm to obtain such a smooth solution. Our method yields encouraging experimental results on a number of classification problems and demonstrates effective use of unlabeled data."

For a possibly non-uniform partition of $[0,1]$ define a finite measure on the path space $C_L[0,1]$ by using a) $S(\\Delta t)$ for the transition between any two consecutive partition times of distance $\\Delta t$ and b) a suitable continuous interpolation scheme (e.g. Brownian bridges or geodesics). If necessary normalize the result to get a probability measure. We prove a version of Chernoff's theorem of semigroup theory and tightness results which yield convergence in law of such measures as the partition gets finer. In particular let $L$ be a closed smooth submanifold of a manifold $M$. We prove convergence of Brownian motion on $M$, conditioned to visit $L$ at all partition times, to a process on $L$ whose law has a density with respect to Brownian motion on $L$ which contains scalar, mean and sectional curvatures terms. Various approximation schemes for Brownian motion on $L$ are also given."
