We study this approach with new multi-class classification methods and examined many issues important for a practical recognition system.\n\n\nRESULTS\nMost current discriminative methods for protein fold prediction use the one-against-others method, which has the well-known 'False Positives' problem. We investigated two new methods: the unique one-against-others and the all-against-all methods. Both improve prediction accuracy by 14-110% on a dataset containing 27 SCOP folds. We used the Support Vector Machine (SVM) and the Neural Network (NN) learning methods as base classifiers. SVMs converges fast and leads to high accuracy. When scores of multiple parameter datasets are combined, majority voting reduces noise and increases recognition accuracy. We examined many issues involved with large number of classes, including dependencies of prediction accuracy on the number of folds and on the number of representatives in a fold. Overall, recognition systems achieve 56% fold prediction accuracy on a protein test dataset, where most of the proteins have below 25% sequence identity with the proteins used in training."

A subsequence is any ordered sequence of k characters occurring in the text though not necessarily contiguously. The subsequences are weighted by an exponentially decaying factor of their full length in the text, hence emphasising those occurrences which are close to contiguous. A direct computation of this feature vector would involve a prohibitive amount of computation even for modest values of k, since the dimension of the feature space grows exponentially with k. The paper describes how despite this fact the inner product can be efficiently evaluated by a dynamic programming technique. A preliminary experimental comparison of the performance of the kernel compared with a standard word feature space kernel [6] is made showing encouraging results."

The basis for comparison is not only the customary Dayhoff mutational-distance matrix but also the results of structural studies and information implicit in the alignments of the sequences of families of similar proteins. This information is expressed in a position-specific scoring table (profile), which is created from a group of sequences previously aligned by structural or sequence similarity. The similarity of any other sequence (target) to the group of aligned sequences (probe) can be tested by comparing the target to the profile using dynamic programming algorithms. The profile method differs in two major respects from methods of sequence comparison in common use: (i) Any number of known sequences can be used to construct the profile, allowing more information to be used in the testing of the target than is possible with pairwise alignment methods. (ii) The profile includes the penalties for insertion or deletion at each position, which allow one to include the probe secondary structure in the testing scheme. Tests with globin and immunoglobulin sequences show that profile analysis can distinguish all members of these families from all other sequences in a database containing 3800 protein sequences."

By contrast with PROSITE, which uses single consensus expressions to characterise particular families, PRINTS exploits groups of motifs to build characteristic signatures. These signatures offer improved diagnostic reliability by virtue of the mutual context provided by motif neighbours. To date, 800 fingerprints have been constructed and stored in PRINTS. The current version, 17.0, encodes approximately 4500 motifs, covering a range of globular and membrane proteins, modular polypeptides, and so on. The database is accessible via the UCL Bioinformatics World Wide Web (WWW) Server at http://www. biochem.ucl.ac.uk/bsm/dbbrowser/ . We have recently enhanced the usefulness of PRINTS by making available new, intuitive search software. This allows both individual query sequence and bulk data submission, permitting easy analysis of single sequences or complete genomes. Preliminary results indicate that use of the PRINTS system is able to assign additional functions not found by other methods, and hence offers a useful adjunct to current genome analysis protocols."

                "text": "Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are applied to the problems of statistical modeling, database searching and multiple sequence alignment of protein families and protein domains. These methods are demonstrated on the globin family, the protein kinase catalytic domain, and the EF-hand calcium binding motif. In each case the parameters of an HMM are estimated from a training set of unaligned sequences. After the HMM is built, it is used to obtain a multiple alignment of all the training sequences. It is also used to search the SWISS-PROT 22 database for other sequences that are members of the given protein family, or contain the given domain. The HMM produces multiple alignments of good quality that agree closely with the alignments produced by programs that incorporate three-dimensional structural information. When employed in discrimination tests (by examining how closely the sequences in a database fit the globin, kinase and EF-hand HMMs), the HMM is able to distinguish members of these families from non-members with a high degree of accuracy. Both the HMM and PROFILESEARCH (a technique used to search for relationships between a protein sequence and multiply aligned sequences) perform better in these tests than PROSITE (a dictionary of sites and patterns in proteins). The HMM appears to have a slight advantage over PROFILESEARCH in terms of lower rates of false negatives and false positives, even though the HMM is trained using only unaligned sequences, whereas PROFILESEARCH requires aligned training sequences. Our results suggest the presence of an EF-hand calcium binding motif in a highly conserved and evolutionary preserved putative intracellular region of 155 residues in the alpha-1 subunit of L-type calcium channels which play an important role in excitation-contraction coupling. This region has been suggested to contain the functional domains that are typical or essential for all L-type calcium channels regardless of whether they couple to ryanodine receptors, conduct ions or both."

The basic idea is to find a hyperplane which separates the d-dimensional data perfectly into its two classes. However, since example data is often not linearly separable, SVM\u2019s introduce the notion of a \u201ckernel induced feature space\u201d which casts the data into a higher dimensional space where the data is separable. Typically, casting into such a space would cause problems computationally, and with overfitting. The key insight used in SVM\u2019s is that the higher-dimensional space doesn\u2019t need to be dealt with directly (as it turns out, only the formula for the dot-product in that space is needed), which eliminates the above concerns. Furthermore, the VC-dimension (a measure of a system\u2019s likelihood to perform well on unseen data) of SVM\u2019s can be explicitly calculated, unlike other learning methods like neural networks, for which there is no measure. Overall, SVM\u2019s are intuitive, theoretically wellfounded, and have shown to be practically successful. SVM\u2019s have also been extended to solve regression tasks (where the system is trained to output a numerical value, rather than \u201cyes/no\u201d classification)."

The use of protein sequence patterns (or motifs) to determine the function of proteins is becoming very rapidly one of the essential tools of sequence analysis. This reality has been recognized by many authors. While there have been a number of recent reports that review published patterns, no attempt had been made until very recently [5,6] to systematically collect biologically significant patterns or to discover new ones. It is for these reasons that we have developed, since 1988, a dictionary of sites and patterns which we call PROSITE. Some of the patterns compiled in PROSITE have been published in the literature, but the majority have been developed,in the last two years, by the author."

The method can be applied iteratively to build a kernel on a innnite set from kernels involving generators of the set. The family of kernels generated generalizes the family of radial basis kernels. It can also be used to deene kernels in the form of joint Gibbs probability distributions. Kernels can be built from hidden Markov random elds, generalized regular expressions, pair-HMMs, or ANOVA de-compositions. Uses of the method lead to open problems involving the theory of innnitely divisible positive deenite functions. Fundamentals of this theory and the theory of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces are reviewed and applied in establishing the validity of the method."

The k-mer contents, also called the spectrum of the sequence, is not sufficient to uniquely reconstruct a sequence longer than a few hundred bases. We have devised a polynomial algorithm that reconstructs the sequence, given the spectrum and a homologous sequence. This situation occurs, for example, in the identification of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and whenever a homologue of the target sequence is known. The algorithm is robust, can handle errors in the spectrum and assumes no knowledge of the k-mer multiplicities. Our simulations show that with realistic levels of SNPs, the algorithm correctly reconstructs a target sequence of length up to 2,000 nucleotides when a polymorphic sequence is known. The technique is generalized to handle profiles and HMMs as input instead of a single homologous sequence."

For protein comparisons, a variety of definitional, algorithmic and statistical refinements described here permits the execution time of the BLAST programs to be decreased substantially while enhancing their sensitivity to weak similarities. A new criterion for triggering the extension of word hits, combined with a new heuristic for generating gapped alignments, yields a gapped BLAST program that runs at approximately three times the speed of the original. In addition, a method is introduced for automatically combining statistically significant alignments produced by BLAST into a position-specific score matrix, and searching the database using this matrix. The resulting Position-Specific Iterated BLAST (PSI-BLAST) program runs at approximately the same speed per iteration as gapped BLAST, but in many cases is much more sensitive to weak but biologically relevant sequence similarities. PSI-BLAST is used to uncover several new and interesting members of the BRCT superfamily."

If numerical values are assigned to each of these characters, then the resulting numerical sequences are readily amenable to digital signal processing.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWe introduce new computational and visual tools for biomolecular sequences analysis. In particular, we provide an optimization procedure improving upon traditional Fourier analysis performance in distinguishing coding from noncoding regions in DNA sequences. We also show that the phase of a properly defined Fourier transform is a powerful predictor of the reading frame of protein coding regions. Resulting color maps help in visually identifying not only the existence of protein coding areas for both DNA strands, but also the coding direction and the reading frame for each of the exons. Furthermore, we demonstrate that color spectrograms can visually provide, in the form of local 'texture', significant information about biomolecular sequences, thus facilitating understanding of local nature, structure and function."

A single sequence representing a protein family is enriched by replacing conserved regions with position\u2010specific scoring matrices (PSSMs) or consensus residues derived from multiple alignments of family members. In comprehensive tests of these and other family representations, PSSM\u2010embedded queries produced the best results overall when used with a special version of the Smith\u2010Waterman searching algorithm. Moreover, embedding consensus residues instead of PSSMs improved performance with readily available single sequence query searching programs, such as BLAST and FASTA. Embedding PSSMs or consensus residues into a representative sequence improves searching performance by extracting multiple alignment information from motif regions while retaining single sequence information where alignment is uncertain."

Simulated annealing in turn uses a dynamic programming algorithm for correctly sampling suboptimal multiple alignments according to their probability and a Boltzmann temperature factor. The quality of simulated annealing alignments is evaluated on structural alignments of ten different protein families, and compared to the performance of other HMM training methods and the ClustalW program. Simulated annealing is better able to find near-global optima in the multiple alignment probability landscape than the other tested HMM training methods. Neither ClustalW nor simulated annealing produce consistently better alignments compared to each other. Examination of the specific cases in which ClustalW outperforms simulated annealing, and vice versa, provides insight into the strengths and weaknesses of current hidden Markov model approaches."

If not done very carefully, comparative studies of classification and other types of algorithms can easily result in statistically invalid conclusions. This is especially true when one is using data mining techniques to analyze very large databases, which inevitably contain some statistically unlikely data. This paper describes several phenomena that can, if ignored, invalidate an experimental comparison. These phenomena and the conclusions that follow apply not only to classification, but to computational experiments in almost any aspect of data mining. The paper also discusses why comparative analysis is more important in evaluating some types of algorithms than for others, and provides some suggestions about how to avoid the pitfalls suffered by many experimental studies."
