On the other hand, document analysis tasks are more and more frequently being applied to multimedia documents such as video sequences. Due to low resolution and lossy compression, the binarization of text included in the frames is a non-trivial task. Existing techniques work without a model of the spatial relationships in the image, which makes them less powerful. We introduce a new technique based on a Markov random field model of the document. The model parameters (clique potentials) are learned from training data and the binary image is estimated in a Bayesian framework. The performance is evaluated using commercial OCR software."

A descriptor that captures the regional properties around a given pixel is first defined for this purpose. For each pixel, the descriptor is defined as a vector composed of filter responses with varying length. This descriptor is shown to give highly discriminating pattern with respect to the background region, text region, and near text region. Of course there are misclassified pixels, which are then relabeled using an energy optimization method, specifically by using the graph cut method. For this, we devise an appropriate energy function that leads to clear and correct binarization. The proposed descriptor is also used for the skew detection, and thus correcting the skewed documents."

The first is generation of tentatively binarized images via every dichotomization of k clusters obtained by k-means clustering in the HSI color space. The total number of tentatively binarized images equals 2^k\u22122. The second is use of support vector machines (SVM) to determine whether and to what degree each tentatively binarized image represents a character or non-character. We feed the SVM with mesh and weighted direction code histogram features to output the degree of \u201ccharacter-likeness.\u201d The third is selection of a single binarized image with the maximum degree of \u201ccharacter likeness\u201d as an optimal binarization result. Experiments using a total of 1000 single-character color images extracted from the ICDAR 2003 robust OCR dataset show that the proposed method achieves a correct binarization rate of 93.7%."

On one hand, this separation is useful to apply a particular algorithm on each of these cases and on the other hand to decrease the computation time for clean cases for which a faster method could be considered. Finally, several experiments were done to discuss results and to conclude that the use of a discrimination between kinds of backgrounds gives better results in terms of Precision and Recall."

In the MRF based framework, an edge potential feature is extracted to preserve the strokes of foreground text and to remove isolated noise and an intensity feature is used to smooth the entire document image. Prior to binarization, we use a nonlinear function to enhance the quality of document images which suffer from insufficient or uneven illumination. Experimental results show that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches."

Estimation is performed by solving a graph cut problem for which very efficient algorithms have recently been developed.

Classical image segmentation tools use either texture (colour) information, e.g. Magic Wand, or edge (contrast) information, e.g. Intelligent Scissors. Recently, an approach based on optimization by graph-cut has been developed which successfully combines both types of information. In this paper we extend the graph-cut approach in three respects. First, we have developed a more powerful, iterative version of the optimisation. Secondly, the power of the iterative algorithm is used to simplify substantially the user interaction needed for a given quality of result. Thirdly, a robust algorithm for \"border matting\" has been developed to estimate simultaneously the alpha-matte around an object boundary and the colours of foreground pixels. We show that for moderately difficult examples the proposed method outperforms competitive tools."

Our method is simple in its implementation and can be performed on any binarization algorithm since it doesn't require anything more than the binarization stage. As a demonstration of the proposed technique, we use the case of degraded historical documents. Then we apply the proposed technique to 30 binarization algorithms.

The user marks certain pixels as \"object\" or \"background\" to provide hard constraints for segmentation. Additional soft constraints incorporate both boundary and region information. Graph cuts are used to find the globally optimal segmentation of the N-dimensional image. The obtained solution gives the best balance of boundary and region properties among all segmentations satisfying the constraints. The topology of our segmentation is unrestricted and both \"object\" and \"background\" segments may consist of several isolated parts. Some experimental results are presented in the context of photo/video editing and medical image segmentation. We also demonstrate an interesting Gestalt example. A fast implementation of our segmentation method is possible via a new max-flow algorithm."

The combinatorial optimization literature provides many min-cut/max-flow algorithms with different polynomial time complexity. Their practical efficiency, however, has to date been studied mainly outside the scope of computer vision. The goal of this paper is to provide an experimental comparison of the efficiency of min-cut/max flow algorithms for applications in vision. We compare the running times of several standard algorithms, as well as a new algorithm that we have recently developed. The algorithms we study include both Goldberg-Tarjan style \"push -relabel\" methods and algorithms based on Ford-Fulkerson style \"augmenting paths.\" We benchmark these algorithms on a number of typical graphs in the contexts of image restoration, stereo, and segmentation. In many cases, our new algorithm works several times faster than any of the other methods, making near real-time performance possible. An implementation of our max-flow/min-cut algorithm is available upon request for research purposes."

Each of these techniques constructs a graph such that the minimum cut on the graph also minimizes the energy. Yet, because these graph constructions are complex and highly specific to a particular energy function, graph cuts have seen limited application to date. In this paper, we give a characterization of the energy functions that can be minimized by graph cuts. Our results are restricted to functions of binary variables. However, our work generalizes many previous constructions and is easily applicable to vision problems that involve large numbers of labels, such as stereo, motion, image restoration, and scene reconstruction. We give a precise characterization of what energy functions can be minimized using graph cuts, among the energy functions that can be written as a sum of terms containing three or fewer binary variables. We also provide a general-purpose construction to minimize such an energy function. Finally, we give a necessary condition for any energy function of binary variables to be minimized by graph cuts. Researchers who are considering the use of graph cuts to optimize a particular energy function can use our results to determine if this is possible and then follow our construction to create the appropriate graph. A software implementation is freely available."
