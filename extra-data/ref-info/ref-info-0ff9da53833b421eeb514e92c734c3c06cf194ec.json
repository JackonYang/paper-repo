Intuitively, given a set of points which belong to either of two classes, a linear SVM finds the hyperplane leaving the largest possible fraction of points of the same class on the same side, while maximizing the distance of either class from the hyperplane. The hyperplane is determined by a subset of the points of the two classes, named support vectors, and has a number of interesting theoretical properties. In this paper, we use linear SVMs for 3D object recognition. We illustrate the potential of SVMs on a database of 7200 images of 100 different objects. The proposed system does not require feature extraction and performs recognition on images regarded as points of a space of high dimension without estimating pose. The excellent recognition rates achieved in all the performed experiments indicate that SVMs are well-suited for aspect-based recognition."

In contrast to traditional strategies that rely on object geometry and local image features, the present system is founded on the concept of appearance matching. Appearance manifolds of the 100 objects were automatically learned using a computer-controlled turntable. The entire learning process was completed in 1 day. A recognition loop has been implemented that performs scene change detection, image segmentation, region normalizations, and appearance matching, in less than 1 second. The hardware used by the recognition system includes no more than a CCD color camera and a workstation. The real-time capability and interactive nature of the system have allowed numerous observers to test its performance. To quantify performance, we have conducted controlled experiments on recognition and pose estimation. The recognition rate was found to be 100% and object pose was estimated with a mean absolute error of 2.02 degrees and standard deviation of 1.67 degrees."

This surface, which in some feature space of possibly infinite dimension can be regarded as a hyperplane, is obtained from the solution of a problem of quadratic programming that depends on a regularization parameter. In this article, we study some mathematical properties of support vectors and show that the decision surface can be written as the sum of two orthogonal terms, the first depending on only the margin vectors (which are SVs lying on the margin), the second proportional to the regularization parameter. For almost all values of the parameter, this enables us to predict how the decision surface varies for small parameter changes. In the special but important case of feature space of finite dimension m, we also show that there are at most m + 1 margin vectors and observe that m + 1 SVs are usually sufficient to determine the decision surface fully. For relatively small m, this latter result leads to a consistent reduction of the SV number."

This finding opens up the possibility of compressing data bases significantly by disposing of the data which is not important for the solution of a given task. \n \nIn addition, we show that the theory allows us to predict the classifier that will have the best generalization ability, based solely on performance on the training set and characteristics of the learning machines.

One way to address this question is to explore the ability of the human visual system to generalize recognition from familiar to unfamiliar views of three-dimensional objects. Three recently proposed theories of object recognition--viewpoint normalization or alignment of three-dimensional models [Ullman, S. (1989) Cognition 32, 193-254], linear combination of two-dimensional views [Ullman, S. & Basri, R. (1990) Recognition by Linear Combinations of Models (Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge), A. I. Memo No. 1152], and view approximation [Poggio, T. & Edelman, S. (1990) Nature (London) 343, 263-266]--predict different patterns of generalization to unfamiliar views. We have exploited the conflicting predictions to test the three theories directly in a psychophysical experiment involving computer-generated three-dimensional objects. Our results suggest that the human visual system is better described as recognizing these objects by two-dimensional view interpolation than by alignment or other methods that rely on object-centered three-dimensional models."
