We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O. 1. Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms."

Given its ubiquity in human transactions, machine recognition of handwriting has practical significance, as in reading handwritten notes in a PDA, in postal addresses on envelopes, in amounts in bank checks, in handwritten fields in forms, etc. This overview describes the nature of handwritten language, how it is transduced into electronic data, and the basic concepts behind written language recognition algorithms. Both the online case (which pertains to the availability of trajectory data during writing) and the off-line case (which pertains to scanned images) are considered. Algorithms for preprocessing, character and word recognition, and performance with practical systems are indicated. Other fields of application, like signature verification, writer authentification, handwriting learning tools are also considered."

The input provided to an off-line handwriting recognition system is an image of a digit, a word, or - more generally -some text, and the system produces, as output, an ASCII transcription of the input. This task involves a number of processing steps, some of which are quite difficult. Typically, preprocessing, normalization, feature extraction, classification, and postprocessing operations are required. We'll survey the state of the art, analyze recent trends, and try to identify challenges for future research in this field."

                "text": "This paper deals with the recognition of handwriting text character by using a reduced character methodology and neural nets (BNN, RNN). The reduced characters methodology is based on the representation (mapping) of the text characters on a small size 2-D array of 12 X 9. For the recognition process each character is considered as a composition of `main' and `secondary' features. The main features are the necessary and important parts of a character for its recognition. The secondary (or artistic) features are the parts of a character which contribute to its various representations. The reduced character methodology presented in this paper attempts to prove that the recognition of a reduced size character provides a robust approach for recognition of handwritten text. The RNN approach for handwritten character recognition is based upon recurrent neural networks. The recurrent networks have a feedback mechanism. The feedback mechanism acts to integrate new values of feature vector with their predecessors. The output is supervised according to a target function. These networks can deal with inputs and outputs that are explicit functions of time. A new way of associating shape information was used, which gives very consistent results for handwritten character recognition. In this scheme the `shadow' each character was considered to find was the distances between the margins of the character. The distances are normalized with respect to the maximum distance in the entire shape to minimize the effect of disproportionately formed characters. For this effort two neural networks and an attributed graph approach are used and their results are compared on a set of 5000 handwritten characters."

In this framework, neural networks (and in particular, multilayer perceptrons or MLPs) have been restricted to well-defined subtasks of the whole system, i.e., HMM emission probability estimation and feature extraction. The book describes a successful five year international collaboration between the authors. The lessons learned form a case study that demonstrates how hybrid systems can be developed to combine neural networks with more traditional statistical approaches. The book illustrates both the advantages and limitations of neural networks in the framework of a statistical system. Using standard databases and comparing with some conventional approaches, it is shown that MLP probability estimation can improve recognition performance. Other approaches are discussed, though there is no such unequivocal experimental result for these methods. Connectionist Speech Recognition: A Hybrid Approach is of use to anyone intending to use neural networks for speech recognition or within the framework provided by an existing successful statistical approach. This includes research and development groups working in the field of speech recognition, both with standard and neural network approaches, as well as other pattern recognition and/or neural network researchers. This book is also suitable as a text for advanced courses on neural networks or speech processing."

We wish to treat the outputs of the network as probabilities of alternatives (e.g. pattern classes), conditioned on the inputs. We look for appropriate output non-linearities and for appropriate criteria for adaptation of the parameters of the network (e.g. weights). We explain two modifications: probability scoring, which is an alternative to squared error minimisation, and a normalised exponential (softmax) multi-input generalisation of the logistic non-linearity. The two modifications together result in quite simple arithmetic, and hardware implementation is not difficult either. The use of radial units (squared distance instead of dot product) immediately before the softmax output stage produces a network which computes posterior distributions over class labels based on an assumption of Gaussian within-class distributions. However the training, which uses cross-class information, can result in better performance at class discrimination than the usual within-class training method, unless the within-class distribution assumptions are actually correct."

Experimental results showed that the proposed method could estimate segment boundaries significantly better than an HMM or a multilayer perceptron-based method. Furthermore, we incorporated the BRNN-based segment boundary estimator into the HMM-based and segment model-based recognition systems. As a result, we confirmed that (1) BRNN outputs were effective for improving the recognition rate and reducing computational time in an HMM-based recognition system and (2) segment lattices obtained by the proposed methods dramatically reduce the computational complexity of segment model-based recognition. \u00a9 1999 Scripta Technica, Syst Comp Jpn, 30(4): 20\u201330, 1999"

Thus linguistic knowledge beyond the lexicon level is incorporated in the recognition process. Another novel feature of the system is that the HMM is applied in such a way that the difficult problem of segmenting a line of text into individual words is avoided. A number of experiments with various language models and large vocabularies have been conducted. The language models used in the system were also analytically compared based on their perplexity."

The NPen++ recognition engine is based on a multi-state time delay neural network and yields recognition rates from 96% for a 5,000 word dictionary to 93.4% on a 20,000 word dictionary and 91.2% for a 50,000 word dictionary. The proposed tree search and pruning technique reduces the search space considerably without losing too much recognition performance compared to an exhaustive search. This enables the NPen++ recognizer to be run in real-time with large dictionaries. Initial recognition rates for whole sentences are promising and show that the MS-TDNN architecture is suited to recognizing handwritten data ranging from single characters to whole sentences."

This corpus is a collection of texts that comprise about one million word instances. The database includes 1,066 forms produced by approximately 400 different writers. A total of 82,227 word instances out of a vocabulary of 10,841 words occur in the collection. The database consists of full English sentences. It can serve as a basis for a variety of handwriting recognition tasks. However, it is expected that the database would be particularly useful for recognition tasks where linguistic knowledge beyond the lexicon level is used, because this knowledge can be automatically derived from the underlying corpus. The database also includes a few image-processing procedures for extracting the handwritten text from the forms and the segmentation of the text into lines and words."

This input modality has received relatively little attention in the handwriting recognition community in the past. The system proposed in this paper uses state-of-the-art normalization and feature extraction strategies to transform a handwritten text line into a sequence of feature vectors. Additional preprocessing techniques are introduced, which significantly increase the word recognition rate. For classification, Hidden Markov Models are used together with a statistical language model. In writer independent experiments we achieved word recognition rates of 67.3% on the test set when no language model is used, and 70.8% by including a language model."

This approach has only been recently introduced successfully to online handwriting recognition and is now investigated for the first time for offline recognition. 2) The hybrid approach is extensively compared to traditional HMM modeling techniques and the superior performance of the new hybrid approach is demonstrated. 3) The data for the comparison has been obtained from a database containing online handwritten data which has been converted to offline data. Therefore, a multiple evaluation has been carried out, incorporating the comparison of different modeling techniques and the additional comparison of each technique for online and offline recognition, using a unique database. The results confirm that online recognition leads to better recognition results due to the dynamic information of the data, but also show that it is possible to obtain recognition rates for offline recognition that are close to the results obtained for online recognition. Furthermore, it can be shown that for both online and offline recognition, the new hybrid approach clearly outperforms the competing traditional HMM techniques. It is also shown that the new hybrid approach yields superior results for the offline recognition of machine printed multifont characters."

Although the trajectory provides a compact and complete representation of the written output, it is hard to transcribe directly, because each letter is spread over many pen locations. Most recognition systems therefore employ sophisticated preprocessing techniques to put the inputs into a more localised form. However these techniques require considerable human effort, and are specific to particular languages and alphabets. This paper describes a system capable of directly transcribing raw online handwriting data. The system consists of an advanced recurrent neural network with an output layer designed for sequence labelling, combined with a probabilistic language model. In experiments on an unconstrained online database, we record excellent results using either raw or preprocessed data, well outperforming a state-of-the-art HMM based system in both cases."

After preprocessing, a word image is segmented into letters or pseudoletters and represented by two feature sequences of equal length, each consisting of an alternating sequence of shape-symbols and segmentation-symbols, which are both explicitly modeled. The word model is made up of the concatenation of appropriate letter models consisting of elementary HMMs and an HMM-based interpolation technique is used to optimally combine the two feature sets. Two rejection mechanisms are considered depending on whether or not the word image is guaranteed to belong to the lexicon. Experiments carried out on real-life data show that the proposed approach can be successfully used for handwritten word recognition."

                "text": "Recurrent connectionist networks are important because they can perform temporally extended tasks, giving them considerable power beyond the static mappings performed by the now-familiar multilayer feedforward networks. This ability to perform highly nonlinear dynamic mappings makes these networks particularly interesting to study and potentially quite useful in tasks which have an important temporal component not easily handled through the use of simple tapped delay lines. Some examples are tasks involving recognition or generation of sequential patterns and sensorimotor control. This report examines a number of learning procedures for adjusting the weights in recurrent networks in order to train such networks to produce desired temporal behaviors from input-output stream examples. The procedures are all based on the computation of the gradient of performance error with respect to network weights, and a number of strategies for computing the necessary gradient information are described. Included here are approaches which are familiar and have been rst described elsewhere, along with several novel approaches. One particular purpose of this report is to provide uniform and detailed descriptions and derivations of the various techniques in order to emphasize how they relate to one another. Another important contribution of this report is a detailed analysis of the computational requirements of the various approaches discussed."

The pen trajectory is recorded by a touch sensitive pad, such as those used by note-pad computers. The input to the system contains the pen trajectory information, encoded as a time-ordered sequence of feature vectors. Features include X and Y coordinates, pen-lifts, speed, direction and curvature of the pen trajectory. A time delay neural network with local connections and shared weights is used to estimate a posteriori probabilities for characters in a word. A hidden Markov model segments the word into characters in a way which optimizes the global word score, taking a dictionary into account. A geometrical normalization scheme and a fast but efficient dictionary search are also presented. Trained on 20000 unconstrained cursive words from 59 writers and using a 25000 word dictionary the authors reached a 89% character and 80% word recognition rate on test data from a disjoint set of writers.<<ETX>>"

While Hidden Markov Models tend to ignore this information, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) can in principle learn to make use of it. We focus on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) because it has been shown to outperform other RNNs on tasks involving long time lags. We find that LSTM augmented by \"peephole connections\" from its internal cells to its multiplicative gates can learn the fine distinction between sequences of spikes spaced either 50 or 49 time steps apart without the help of any short training exemplars. Without external resets or teacher forcing, our LSTM variant also learns to generate stable streams of precisely timed spikes and other highly nonlinear periodic patterns. This makes LSTM a promising approach for tasks that require the accurate measurement or generation of time intervals."

It is demonstrated that either a three-state ESHMM or a standard HMM with an increased number of states is capable of closely matching both Gamma distributions and duration distributions of phonemes from the TIMIT corpus, as measured by Bhattacharyya distance to the true distributions. Standard HMMs are easily implemented with off-the-shelf tools, whereas duration models require substantial algorithmic development and have higher computational costs when implemented, suggesting that a simple adjustment to HMM topologies is perhaps a more efficient solution to the problem of duration than more complex approaches."

                "text": "MOTIVATION\nPredicting the secondary structure of a protein (alpha-helix, beta-sheet, coil) is an important step towards elucidating its three-dimensional structure, as well as its function. Presently, the best predictors are based on machine learning approaches, in particular neural network architectures with a fixed, and relatively short, input window of amino acids, centered at the prediction site. Although a fixed small window avoids overfitting problems, it does not permit capturing variable long-rang information.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWe introduce a family of novel architectures which can learn to make predictions based on variable ranges of dependencies. These architectures extend recurrent neural networks, introducing non-causal bidirectional dynamics to capture both upstream and downstream information. The prediction algorithm is completed by the use of mixtures of estimators that leverage evolutionary information, expressed in terms of multiple alignments, both at the input and output levels. While our system currently achieves an overall performance close to 76% correct prediction--at least comparable to the best existing systems--the main emphasis here is on the development of new algorithmic ideas.\n\n\nAVAILABILITY\nThe executable program for predicting protein secondary structure is available from the authors free of charge.\n\n\nCONTACT\npfbaldi@ics.uci.edu, gpollast@ics.uci.edu, brunak@cbs.dtu.dk, paolo@dsi.unifi.it."

The focus of this work concerns the presentation of the classification/training approach, which we call cluster generative statistical dynamic time warping (CSDTW). CSDTW is a general, scalable, HMM-based method for variable-sized, sequential data that holistically combines cluster analysis and statistical sequence modeling. It can handle general classification problems that rely on this sequential type of data, e.g., speech recognition, genome processing, robotics, etc. Contrary to previous attempts, clustering and statistical sequence modeling are embedded in a single feature space and use a closely related distance measure. We show character recognition experiments of frog on hand using CSDTW on the UNIPEN online handwriting database. The recognition accuracy is significantly higher than reported results of other handwriting recognition systems. Finally, we describe the real-time implementation of frog on hand on a Linux Compaq iPAQ embedded device."

In speech recognition, for example, an acoustic signal is transcribed into words or sub-word units. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are powerful sequence learners that would seem well suited to such tasks. However, because they require pre-segmented training data, and post-processing to transform their outputs into label sequences, their applicability has so far been limited. This paper presents a novel method for training RNNs to label unsegmented sequences directly, thereby solving both problems. An experiment on the TIMIT speech corpus demonstrates its advantages over both a baseline HMM and a hybrid HMM-RNN."

                "text": "In online handwriting recognition the trajectory of the pen is recorded during writing. Although the trajectory provides a compact and complete representation of the written output, it is hard to transcribe directly, because each letter is spread over many pen locations. Most recognition systems therefore employ sophisticated preprocessing techniques to put the inputs into a more localised form. However these techniques require considerable human effort, and are specific to particular languages and alphabets. This paper describes a system capable of directly transcribing raw online handwriting data. The system consists of an advanced recurrent neural network with an output layer designed for sequence labelling, combined with a probabilistic language model. In experiments on an unconstrained online database, we record excellent results using either raw or preprocessed data, well outperforming a state-of-the-art HMM based system in both cases."

We present here some new results concerning a hybrid on-line handwriting recognition system based on Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and Neural Networks (NNs), which has already been presented in several contributions. In our approach, a letter-model is a Left-Right HMM, whose emission probability densities are approximated with mixtures of predictive multilayer perceptrons. The basic letter models are cascaded in order to build models for words and sentences. At the word level, recognition is performed thanks to a dictionary organized with a tree-structure. At the sentence level, a word-predecessor conditioned frame synchronous beam search algorithm allows to perform simultaneously segmentation into words and word recognition. It processes through the building of a word graph from which a set of candidate sentences may be extracted. Word and sentence recognition performances are evaluated on parts of the UNIPEN international database."

The BRNN can be trained without the limitation of using input information just up to a preset future frame. This is accomplished by training it simultaneously in positive and negative time direction. Structure and training procedure of the proposed network are explained. In regression and classification experiments on artificial data, the proposed structure gives better results than other approaches. For real data, classification experiments for phonemes from the TIMIT database show the same tendency. In the second part of this paper, it is shown how the proposed bidirectional structure can be easily modified to allow efficient estimation of the conditional posterior probability of complete symbol sequences without making any explicit assumption about the shape of the distribution. For this part, experiments on real data are reported."

The technique combines dynamic time warping (DTW) and support vector machines (SVMs) by establishing a new SVM kernel. We call this kernel Gaussian DTW (GDTW) kernel. This kernel approach has a main advantage over common HMM techniques. It does not assume a model for the generative class conditional densities. Instead, it directly addresses the problem of discrimination by creating class boundaries and thus is less sensitive to modeling assumptions. By incorporating DTW in the kernel function, general classification problems with variable-sized sequential data can be handled. In this respect the proposed method can be straightforwardly applied to all classification problems, where DTW gives a reasonable distance measure, e.g., speech recognition or genome processing. We show experiments with this kernel approach on the UNIPEN handwriting data, achieving results comparable to an HMM-based technique."

The tied posterior model approximates the output probability density function of a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) with a neural net (NN). This allows a discriminative training of the model. The second system is the tandem approach: A NN is used as part of the feature extraction, and then a standard HMM apporach is applied. This adds more discrimination to the features. In an experimental section we compare the two proposed models with a baseline standard HMM system. We show that enhancing the feature vector has only a limited effect on the standard HMMs, but a significant influence to the hybrid systems. With an enhanced feature vector the two hybrid models highly outperform all baseline models. The tandem approach improves the recognition performance by 4.6% (52.9% rel. error reduction) absolute compared to the best baseline HMM."

The purpose of the project is to propose and implement solutions to the growing need of handwriting samples for online handwriting recognizers used by pen-based computers. Researchers from several companies and universities have agreed on a data format, a platform of data exchange and a protocol for recognizer benchmarks. The online handwriting data of concern may include handprint and cursive from various alphabets (including Latin and Chinese), signatures and pen gestures. These data will be compiled and distributed by the Linguistic Data Consortium. The benchmarks will be arbitrated the US National Institute of Standards and Technologies. We give a brief introduction to the UNIPEN format. We explain the protocol of data exchange and benchmarks."

While on-line recognition is based on pen trajectory data, off-line recognition has to rely on pixel data only. We present a comparison between an off-line and an on-line recognition system using the same databases and system design. Both systems use a sliding window technique which avoids any segmentation before recognition. The recognizer is a hybrid system containing a neural network and a hidden Markov model. New normalization and feature extraction techniques for the off-line recognition are presented, including a connectionist approach for non-linear core height estimation.
