                "text": "In practice the relevant details of images exist only over a restricted range of scale. Hence it is important to study the dependence of image structure on the level of resolution. It seems clear enough that visual perception treats images on several levels of resolution simultaneously and that this fact must be important for the study of perception. However, no applicable mathematically formulated theory to deal with such problems appers to exist. In this paper it is shown that any image can be embedded in a one-parameter family of derived images (with resolution as the parameter) in essentially only one unique way if the constraint that no spurious detail should be generated when the resolution is diminished, is applied. The structure of this family is governed by the well known diffusion equation (a parabolic, linear, partial differential equation of the second order). As such the structure fits into existing theories that treat the front end of the visual system as a continuous tack of homogeneous layer, characterized by iterated local processing schemes. When resolution is decreased the images becomes less articulated because the extrem (\u201clight and dark blobs\u201d) disappear one after the other. This erosion of structure is a simple process that is similar in every case. As a result any image can be described as a juxtaposed and nested set of light and dark blobs, wherein each blod has a limited range of resolution in which it manifests itself. The structure of the family of derived images permits a derivation of the sampling density required to sample the image at multiple scales of resolution. The natural scale along the resolution axis (leading to an informationally uniform sampling density) is logarithmic, thus the structure is apt for the description of size invariances."

                "text": "notation: A = {F, </>}. In sloppy form: A = J dx f (x) </>( x). Samples are always finite, as opposed to point values of the underlying source field. Apart from this they may be positive, zero, or negative. A positive sample does not imply positivity of the underlying source field; a source is positive if all samples obtained by positive definite detectors tum out positive. If we want to compare different samples, we have to gauge our detectors by a conventional normalisation. For the moment we will require neither positivity nor normalisation. Since Definition 3.1 claims to define a local sample, we have to be able to tell what its base point is. In order to do so we need an explicit definition of a projection map 7r : ~ -+ M which associates each detector element </> E ~ with its corresponding base point x = 7r[</>]. This in tum assumes that we can perceive of ~ as a \"bundle\" of local device spaces ~x, comprising one \"fibre\" for each base point: ~ = UxEM~x' The inverse image 7r1(x) of a base point x is, by definition, the entire local device space ~x at that point. A local state space ~x is then established as the physical degrees of freedom probed by a local device space ~x, i.e. \"what we are looking at\" with a localised detector. We will return to a precise definition of 7r in Section 3.9. For the moment it suffices to think of the base point as a the \"centre of gravity\" for the filter </>. The base point we would like to attribute to a sample is of course the one corresponding to the detector, but note that there is no way of telling from the value of a local sample \"where it's at\"; the geometric notion of a base point is established as an extrinsic detector property (a label). Obviously, local samples are obtained at finite resolution. Again, being a spatiotemporal property, resolution cannot be inferred from a sample's value, only 3.1 Local Samples 41 from its underlying aperture. A precise definition of the resolution of a local detector requires us to define a notion of extent or inner scale for that detector. A definition of inner scale will also be postponed until Section 3.9; think of it for the moment as the width of a central region, containing the filter's base point, where most of the filter's weight is concentrated (it is clearly not very useful to relate inner scale to detector support, since by construction this may be all of spacetime). See also Problem 3.2. We can consider the transformation (push forward) of a detector under an arbitrary spacetime automorphism, i.e. a \"warping\", or a smooth transformation of spacetime with smooth inverse. Definition 3.2 (Push Forward) Let () : M -t M : x 1-+ ()(x) be a smooth spacetime automorphism. The push forward of a filter is then defined as the mapping with Jacobian determinant J'X. == I det Vx I\u00b7 This induces a natural, so-called pull back (also called \"reciprocal image\") of the source. Definition 3.3 (Pull Back) With the automorphism () and its push forward ()* as defined in Definition 3.2, the pull back of the source is defined as the mapping ()* : Eo(x) -t Ex : F 1-+ ()* F defined by ()* F[\u00a2] ~f F[()*\u00a2]. In sloppy form this states that ()* f == f 0 (), which physicists tend to refer to as \"scalar field transformation\" (Problem 3.3). Note that if \u00a2 lives at base point x, then its push forward ()*\u00a2 is associated with the mapped point ()(x), which explains its name. Naturally, pull back works the other way around. Push forward and pull back are instances of a so-called\" carry along\" principle. If we have two communicating objects-i.c. sources plus detectors producing a response-then a change of either will in general be reflected in the output. Reversely, a given change in output can be explained as being caused by a change in either object. For example, shifting a patient underneath a scanner will have the same effect as moving the scanner in opposite sense over a stationary patient. This principle generalises to arbitrary deformations beyond rigid transformations (at least conceptually: one of the options is not necessarily in the interest of the patient). The idea is that at least one of these dual views is practicable and legitimate (e.g. processing scanner output). It would be formally more correct to attach base points to sources and detectors matching the labels of E and tl in Definitions 3.2 and 3.3, but that would yield rather cumbersome notations. There ought to be no confusion if we simply 42 Local Samples and Images keep in mind the following commutative diagram:"

The density function is compared with anatomical and electrophysiological knowledge of the density of retinal and cortical receptive fields. This density function permits a particularly lucid interpretation in terms of pattern processing. It can be considered as a system that permits simultaneous global and focal views of the surroundings. The density function, together with a schematized adaptation behaviour of single units, and an incoherent summation rule permit us to calculate a measure of the mass response, and consequently the threshold function.

Various families of operators with special kinds of symmetries (such as translation, rotation, magnification) are explicitly constructed in 1-D, 2-D, and 3-D. A concept of 'order' is defined, and finite orthonormal bases of functions closely connected with the operators of various orders are constructed. Linear transformations between the various representations are considered. The method is based on two fundamental assumptions: a decrease of resolution should not introduce spurious detail, and the local operators should be self-similar under changes of resolution. These assumptions merely sum up the even more general need for homogeneity isotropy, scale invariance, and separability of independent dimensions of front-end processing in the absence of a priori information. >"

The hypothesis that the elementary sample apertures are virtually identical except for size, which is augmented with general functional forms for pooling of elementary responses and coding properties for the elementary samples, suffices to derive the phenomenological facts.

The vast majority of research to date has concentrated on the detection deficit for stimuli presented in isolation. Some of this work is reviewed and it is argued that these anomalies in detection, though interesting and useful, do not really explain amblyopia. A new approach is suggested in which discrimination tasks are employed for stimuli having the same amplitude spectra but different phase spectra. For this task amblyopes exhibit a dramatic and selective impairment."
