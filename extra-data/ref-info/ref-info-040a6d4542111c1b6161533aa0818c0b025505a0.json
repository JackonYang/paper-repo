Given a large and representative sample of text, LSA combines the way thousands of words are used in thousands of contexts to map a point for each into a common semantic space. LSA goes beyond pair-wise co-occurrence or correlation to find latent dimensions of meaning that best relate every word and passage to every other. After learning from comparable bodies of text, LSA has scored almost as well as humans on vocabulary and subject-matter tests, accurately simulated many aspects of human judgment and behavior based on verbal meaning, and been successfully applied to measure the coherence and conceptual content of text. The surprising success of LSA has implications for the nature of generalization and language."

                "text": "Many computational models of semantic memory rely on vector representations of concepts based on explicit encoding of arbitrary feature sets. Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) creates high dimensional (n = 300+) vectors for concepts in semantic memory through statistical analysis of a large representative corpus of text rather than subjective feature sets linked to object names (for details see Landauer & Dumais, 1997; Landauer, Foltz, & Laham, in press). Concepts can be compared in the semantic space and their similarity indexed by the cosine of the angle between vectors. Computational models of concept relations using LSA representations demonstrate that categories can be emergent and self-organizing based exclusively on the way language is used in the corpus without explicit hand-coding of category membership or semantic features. LSA categorization is context dependent and occurs through a dynamic process of induction. Semantic \u201cmeaning\u201d is not encapsulated within an object representation, but emerges as the set of relationships between selected objects in a context-based sub-space. Neuropsychological studies (e.g. Warrington & Shallice, 1984) point to a class of patients who exhibit disnomias for specific categories of objects (natural kinds) while retaining the ability to name other objects (man-made artifacts). The objects from natural kind categories tend to be significantly more clustered in LSA space than are those from artifact categories. If brain structure corresponds to LSA structure, the identification of concepts belonging to strongly clustered categories should suffer more than weakly clustered concepts when their representations are partially damaged. Three types of modeling experiments were conducted: matching base concept names to superordinate categories in forced-choice testing, correlating LSA similarity measures to human judgments of typicality, and multivariate analyses of similarity matrices to capture category boundaries. For the forced-choice matching of concept names to superordinate categories, a selection of 140 objects (rated as most typical in their category) from 14 categories was used. Each object name was compared to each of the 14 category names (apple\u2014flower, apple\u2014mammal, etc.). The LSA match was considered correct when the highest cosine comparison in the set was between an object and its relevant superordinate (apple\u2014fruit). The results show that in all 14 categories, LSA predicts membership well above chance (chance = 7%), however, there are differences in the degree of clustering: the percent correct for animate natural kinds (flowers, mammals, fruit, trees, vegetables, and birds) = 92%; for inanimate natural kinds with observed deficits in neuropsychological patients (gemstones, musical instruments) = 100%; and for man-made artifacts (furniture, vehicles, weapons, tools, toys, and clothing) = 53%. Correlations between LSA similarity judgments and human typicality judgments were consistently better for the natural kinds than for the artifacts. For natural categories, LSA similarities (cosine between concept and either superordinate name, most typical member, or centroid of all members) showed high correlations with human judgments (e.g. fruit: r = .82), while artifact similarities showed low to near-zero correlations with human judgments. As illustrated in Figure 1, multivariate analyses of LSAbased similarity matrices show more cohesive structure for natural kinds than for artifacts. Factors 4-6 in this analysis load high on concepts in the bird category\u2014additional factors (7-15) load on specific artifact concepts (not shown)."

By comparing the vectors for 2 adjoining segments of text in a high\u2010dimensional semantic space, the method provides a characterization of the degree of semantic relatedness between the segments. We illustrate the approach for predicting coherence through reanalyzing sets of texts from 2 studies that manipulated the coherence of texts and assessed readers\u2019 comprehension. The results indicate that the method is able to predict the effect of text coherence on comprehension and is more effective than simple term\u2010term overlap measures. In this manner, LSA can be applied as an automated method that produces coherence predictions similar to propositional modeling. We describe additional studies investigating the application of LSA to analyzing discourse structure and examine the potential of LSA as a psychological model of coherence effects in text comprehension."

In addressing these issues, I will discuss what I think are some of the central problems facing the lexical semantics community, and suggest ways of best approaching these issues. Then, I will provide a method for the decomposition of lexical categories and outline a theory of lexical semantics embodying a notion of cocompositionality and type coercion, as well as several levels of semantic description, where the semantic load is spread more evenly throughout the lexicon. I argue that lexical decomposition is possible if it is performed generatively. Rather than assuming a fixed set of primitives. I will assume a fixed number of generative devices that can be seen as constructing semantic expressions. I develop a theory of Qualia Structure, a representation language for lexical items, which renders much lexical ambiguity in the lexicon unnecessary, while still explaining the systematic polysemy that words carry. Finally, I discuss how individual lexical structures can be integrated into the larger lexical knowledge base through a theory of lexical inheritance. This provides us with the necessary principles of global organization for the lexicon, enabling us to fully integrate our natural language lexicon into a conceptual whole."

By inducing global knowledge indirectly from local co-occurrence data in a large body of representative text, LSA acquired knowledge about the full vocabulary of English at a comparable rate to schoolchildren. LSA uses no prior linguistic or perceptual similarity knowledge; it is based solely on a general mathematical learning method that achieves powerful inductive effects by extracting the right number of dimensions (e.g., 300) to represent objects and contexts.

It offers a methodology which makes it possible to demonstrate, on an empirical basis, that syntax is neither \u201cautonomous\u201d nor \u201carbitrary\u201d, but that it follows from \u201csemantics\u201d. It is shown that every grammatical construction encodes a certain semantic structure, which can be revealed and rigorously stated, so that the meanings encoded in grammar can be compared in a precise and illuminating way, within one language and across language boundaries. The author develops a semantic metalanguage based on lexical universals or near-universals (and, ultimately, on a system of universal semantic primitives), and shows that the same semantic metalanguage can be used for explicating lexical, grammatical and pragmatic aspects of language and thus offers a method for an integrated linguistic description based on semantic foundations. Analyzing data from a number of different languages (including English, Russian and Japanese) the author explores the notion of ethnosyntax and, via semantics, links syntax and morphology with culture. She attemps to demonstrate that the use of a semantic metalanguage based on lexical universals makes it possible to rephrase the Humboldt-Sapir-Whorf hypothesis in such a way that it can be tested and treated as a program for empirical research."

In three experiments, subjects read texts presented by a rapid serial visual procedure and performed a lexical decision on visually presented targets that followed ambiguous prime words. When the target was a word, it was either an associate of the prime word, a probable inference suggested by the discourse, or an unrelated word. For associates, lexical decisions that related to either the appropriate or the inappropriate sense of the ambiguous word were generally facilitated at short (200-400 msec) prime-target stimulus onset asynchronies (SOAs). At longer SOAs, responses were faster to appropriate than to inappropriate associates. For the thematic inferences, there was no difference between these (appropriate) inferences and (inappropriate) control words at short SOAs. At long SOAs (1,000 and 1,500 msec), however, inference words were facilitated. The results are interpreted as consistent with a model of lexical processing in which sense activation functions independently of context. Discourse context effects, whether on sense selection (suppression of inappropriate associates) or on sense elaboration (creation of inferences), are seen as postlexical."

Tversky's account of similarity is applied to such nonliteral similarity expressions, and is shown to apply as readily to nonliteral comparisons as to literal comparisons. But treating metaphors as comparison statements fails to account for certain important phenomena, including metaphoricity itself (the judgment that a comparison statement is nonliteral). We argue that metaphors are exactly what they appear to be: class-inclusion assertions, in which the topic of the metaphor (e.g., \"my job\") is assigned to a diagnostic category (e.g., entities that confine one against one's will, are unpleasant, are difficult to escape from). In such assertions, the metaphor vehicle (e.g., \"jail\") refers to that category, and at the same time is a prototypical exemplar of that category. This account of metaphor provides a basis for a theory of metaphor comprehension, and also clarifies why people use metaphors instead of similes. How do people understand nonliteral expressions such as my grandfather is a baby? Taken literally, this sentence seems false. A grandfather must be an adult, and an adult cannot be of an age to be included in the category baby. According to traditional theories of metaphor comprehension (see Ortony, 1979a), the listener must reject this \"false\" literal interpretation and somehow find a nonliteral interpretation that is appropriate to the context of the conversation. In terms of speech act theory, \"where an utterance is defective if taken literally, look for an utterance meaning that differs from sentence meaning\" (Searle, 1979, p. 114, italics added). A comprehension model based on this assumption postulates three stages:"

The properties attributed from the vehicle to the topic are those that are epitomized by the vehicle, and may characterize a dimension of within-category variation in the topic. We report two experiments that tested the implications of this \u201cproperty attribution\u201d view of metaphor comprehension. One implication of this view is that metaphors are not implicitly transformed into comparisons (X is like a Y), but rather are understood as what they appear to be: class-inclusion assertions. If metaphors are understood as class-inclusion assertions, they should either change meaning or become nonsensical when reversed. Experiment 1 provides evidence for this claim. A second implication of the property attribution view is that topics and vehicles provide different kinds of information to guide and constrain the comprehension process. Experiment 2 provides evidence for this claim. These findings cannot be accounted for by models which assume that metaphors are understood as implicit comparisons."

Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), a statistical technique that represents the content of a document as a vector in high\u2010dimensional semantic space based on a large text corpus, is used to predict how much readers will learn from texts based on the estimated conceptual match between their topic knowledge and the text information. Participants completed tests to assess their knowledge of the human heart and circulatory system, then read one of four texts that ranged in difficulty from elementary to medical school level, then completed the tests again. Results show a nonmonotonic relation in which learning was greatest for texts that were neither too easy nor too difficult.

The approach is to take advantage of implicit higher-order structure in the association of terms with documents (\u201csemantic structure\u201d) in order to improve the detection of relevant documents on the basis of terms found in queries. The particular technique used is singular-value decomposition, in which a large term by document matrix is decomposed into a set of ca. 100 orthogonal factors from which the original matrix can be approximated by linear combination. Documents are represented by ca. 100 item vectors of factor weights. Queries are represented as pseudo-document vectors formed from weighted combinations of terms, and documents with supra-threshold cosine values are returned. initial tests find this completely automatic method for retrieval to be promising."

A much more restrictive bound is implied by the assumption that the data points represent a sample from some continuous distribution in a multidimensional Euclidean space. The analysis of 100 data sets shows that most perceptual data satisfy the geometric-statistical bound whereas many conceptual data sets exceed it. The most striking discrepancies between the data and their multidimensional representations arise in semantic fields when the stimulus set includes a focal element (e.g., a superordinate category) that is the nearest neighbor of many of its instances. Theoretical and methodological implications of nearest neighbor analysis are discussed."

Summary Street provides various kinds of feedback, primarily about whether a student summary adequately covers important source content and fulfills other requirements, such as length. The feedback allows students to engage in extensive, independent practice in writing and revising without placing excessive demands on teachers for feedback. We first discuss the underlying educational rationale, then present some results of the trials conducted with the system. We describe the collaborative process among researchers and teachers which enabled the development of a viable and supportive educational tool and its integration into classroom instruction."

                "text": "There are many reasons why a budding academic might want to avoid interdisciplinary research. It is diffi cult enough to acquire expertise in one fi eld of research, let alone two or more. The time required to read the literature in a fi eld outside your own main area can be hard to fi nd, and the additional time investment to learn novel methods from another fi eld can be huge. Moreover, the hiring and reward systems in academia still run strongly along disciplinary lines, so that work that draws on or contributes to other fi elds may not be fully valued in one\u2019s own fi eld. Interdisciplinary research may not be appreciated by narrow-minded colleagues. Some interdisciplinary projects have a bogus air about them, looking like they were designed more to bring in big research grants than to accomplish intellectual goals. The interdisciplinary scholar can look a bit like a dilettante, dabbling in multiple fi elds in order to avoid tackling the diffi cult problems in an established fi eld. Grants for interdisciplinary research can be diffi cult to get, because most granting agencies are organized along disciplinary lines. Despite these deterrents to interdisciplinary research, there are powerful intellectual reasons why work that oversteps the ossifi ed boundaries of established fi elds can have great intellectual benefi ts. Such benefi ts are vividly apparent in the interdisciplinary fi eld of cognitive science, which attempts to understand the mind by combining insights from the fi elds of psychology, philosophy, linguistics, neuroscience, anthropology, and artifi cial intelligence. After a brief review of the history of the fi eld and its contributing disciplines, this chapter will examine some of the main theoretical and experimental advances that cognitive science has accomplished over the past half century, deriving lessons that might be useful for researchers in any emerging interdisciplinary area."

Architectural support for predicated execution increases the degree of instruction level parallelism by allowing instructions from different basic blocks to be converted to straight-line code guarded by boolean predicates. However predicated execution also presents significant challenges to an optimizing compiler. For example, in live range analysis, a predicated definition does not necessarily end the live range of a virtual register. This paper describes techniques to analyze the relations among predicates in order to improve the precision and effectiveness of various compiler analysis and transformation phases in the presence of predicated code. Our predicate analysis operates globally to obtain relations among predicates. Moreover, we analyze control flow and predication in a single unified framework. The result can be queried by subsequent optimization and analysis phases. Based on this framework, we extend a traditional method to a predicate-aware register allocator which takes global predicate relations into account. We have implemented the proposed algorithms to effectively reduce register pressure. Our experimental results show 24.6% of a large test suite obtain, on average, 20.71% and better register allocation due to the algorithms presented in this paper."

However, translating phi instructions into native instructions is nontrivial when transformations such as copy propagation and code motion have been performed. In this paper we present a new framework for translating out of SSA form. By appropriately placing copy instructions, we ensure that none of the resources in a phi congruence class interfere. Within our framework, we propose three methods for copy placement. The first method pessimistically places copies for all operands of phi instructions. The second method uses an interference graph to guide copy placement. The third method uses both data flow liveness sets and an interference graph to guide copy placement. We also present a new SSA-based coalescing method that can selectively remove redundant copy instructions with interfering operands. Our experimental results indicate that the third method results in 35% fewer copy instructions than the second method. Compared to the first method, the third method, on average, inserts 89.9% fewer copies during copy placement and runs 15% faster, which are significant reductions in compilation time and space."

Data speculation refers to the execution of instructions with potentially incorrect operand values, and a typical example is to execute a load before its preceding aliasing stores. Both types of speculation are effective techniques to enrich instruction level parallelism, but the research work for these two types of speculation have remained largely independent so far and the required compiler support has not been well studied. This paper proposes a unified compiler framework to exploit both control and data speculation and provides an in-depth discussion of various compilation issues. The adopted recovery mechanism guarantees the original program semantics including exceptions fully recoverable from a mis-speculation. Cascaded speculation and predication are also addressed. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the compiler optimization techniques for control and data speculation in terms of run-time performance improvements and code size increases through experimental results."

The primary objective of the positioning is to reduce the overhead of the instruction memory hierarchy.\nAfter initial investigation in the literature, we decided to implement two prototypes for the Hewlett-Packard Precision Architecture (PA-RISC). The first, built on top of the linker, positions code based on whole procedures. This prototype has the ability to move procedures into an order that is determined by a \u201cclosest is best\u201d strategy.\nThe second prototype, built on top of an existing optimizer package, positions code based on basic blocks within procedures. Groups of basic blocks that would be better as straight-line sequences are identified as chains. These chains are then ordered according to branch heuristics. Code that is never executed during the data collection runs can be physically separated from the primary code of a procedure by a technique we devised called procedure splitting.\nThe algorithms we implemented are described through examples in this paper. The performance improvements from our work are also summarized in various tables and charts."

Register promotion is aimed at promoting program names from memory locations to registers. Our algorithm is profile-driven and is based on the scope of intervals. In cases where a complete promotion is not possible because of the presence of function calls or pointer references, the proposed algorithm is capable of eliminating loads and stores on frequently executed paths by placing loads and stores on less frequently executed paths. We also describe an efficient method to incrementally update SSA form when new definitions are cloned from an existing name during register promotion. On SPECInt95 benchmarks, our algorithm removes about ~12% of memory operations which access scalar variables."

As with any instruction scheduling technique, its effectiveness is constrained by both the source program dependencies as deduced by the compiler and the resources available in the target machine. Data speculation is a technique for eliminating memory dependencies in the instruction dependence graph with demonstrated benefits in acyclic scheduling. Therefore, by applying data speculation in modulo scheduled loops we are able to achieve higher degrees of instruction level parallelism. This paper addresses a number of key issues in applying data speculation to modulo scheduling: effectively identifying the additional instructions required to recover from misspeculation, ensuring full recoverability of instructions speculated across multiple stages and possibly executed speculatively multiple times on-the-fly, and coloring rotating registers for speculated instructions and instructions in recovery blocks. We implemented the framework proposed in this paper and demonstrated its effectiveness through experimental results."

Our implementation of inlining and cloning yields excellent results on average and very rarely lowers performance. We believe our good results can be explained by a number of factors: inlining at the intermediate-code level removes most technical restrictions on what can be inlined; the ability to inline across files and incorporate profile information enables us to choose better inline candidates; a high-quality back end can exploit the scheduling and register allocation opportunities presented by larger subroutines; an aggressive processor architecture benefits from more predictable branch behavior; and a large instruction cache mitigates the impact of code expansion. We describe the often dramatic impact of our inlining and cloning on performance: for example, the implementations of our inlining and cloning algorithms in the HP-UX 10.20 compilers boost SPECint95 performance on a PA8000-based workstation by a factor of 1.32."

Large performance gains in these applications are available by optimizing across module boundaries. One barrier to applying crossmodule optimization (CMO) to large applications is the potentially enormous amount of time and space consumed by the optimization process.We describe a framework for scalable CMO that provides large gains in performance on applications that contain millions of lines of code. Two major techniques are described. First, careful management of in-memory data structures results in sub-linear memory occupancy when compared to the number of lines of code being optimized. Second, profile data is used to focus optimization effort on the performance-critical portions of applications. We also present practical issues that arise in deploying this framework in a production environment. These issues include debuggability and compatibility with existing development tools, such as make. Our framework is deployed in Hewlett-Packard's (HP) UNIX compiler products and speeds up shipped independent software vendors' applications by as much as 71%."
