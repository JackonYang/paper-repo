Classifier error rate as a function of training set size was tested for synthetic data drawn from several different probability distributions. In cases where the true distributions were poorly modeled, ANN was significantly better than BGM. In some cases, ANN was also better than KNN. Similar experiments were performed on a voiced/unvoiced speech classification task. ANN had a lower error rate than KNN or BGM for all training set sizes, although BGM approached the ANN error rate as the training set became larger. It is concluded that there are pattern classification tasks in which an ANN is able to make better use of training data to achieve a lower error rate with a particular size training set.<<ETX>>"

We wish to treat the outputs of the network as probabilities of alternatives (e.g. pattern classes), conditioned on the inputs. We look for appropriate output non-linearities and for appropriate criteria for adaptation of the parameters of the network (e.g. weights). We explain two modifications: probability scoring, which is an alternative to squared error minimisation, and a normalised exponential (softmax) multi-input generalisation of the logistic non-linearity. The two modifications together result in quite simple arithmetic, and hardware implementation is not difficult either. The use of radial units (squared distance instead of dot product) immediately before the softmax output stage produces a network which computes posterior distributions over class labels based on an assumption of Gaussian within-class distributions. However the training, which uses cross-class information, can result in better performance at class discrimination than the usual within-class training method, unless the within-class distribution assumptions are actually correct."

                "text": "The concept of the stochastic Boltzmann machine (BM) is attractive for decision making and pattern classification purposes since the probability of attaining the network states is a function of the network energy. Hence, the probability of attaining particular energy minima may be associated with the probabilities of making certain decisions (or classifications). However, because of its stochastic nature, the complexity of the BM is fairly high and therefore such networks are not very likely to be used in practice. In this paper we suggest a way to alleviate this drawback by converting the stochastic BM into a deterministic network which we call the Boltzmann Perceptron Network (BPN). The BPN is functionally equivalent to the BM but has a feed-forward structure and low complexity. No annealing is required. The conditions under which such a conversion is feasible are given. A learning algorithm for the BPN based on the conjugate gradient method is also provided which is somewhat akin to the backpropagation algorithm."

                "text": "Hidden Markov modeling is a probabilistic technique for the study of time series. Hidden Markov theory permits modeling with any of the classical probability distributions. The costs of implementation are linear in the length of data. Models can be nested to reflect hierarchical sources of knowledge. These and other desirable features have made hidden Markov methods increasingly attractive for problems in language, speech and signal processing. The basic ideas are introduced by elementary examples in the spirit of the Polya urn models. The main tool in hidden Markov modeling is the Baum-Welch (or forward-backward) algorithm for maximum likelihood estimation of the model parameters. This iterative algorithm is discussed both from an intuitive point of view as an exercise in the art of counting and from a formal point of view via the information-theoretic Q-function. Selected examples drawn from the literature illustrate how the Baum-Welch technique places a rich variety of computational models at the disposal of the researcher.<<ETX>>"
