                "text": "This thesis, within the subfield of computer science known as computer vision, deals with the use of scale-space analysis in early low-level processing of visual information. The main contributions comprise the following five subjects: The formulation of a scale-space theory for discrete signals. Previously, the scale-space concept has been expressed for continuous signals only. We propose that the canonical way to construct a scale-space for discrete signals is by convolution with a kernel called the discrete analogue of the Gaussian kernel, or equivalently by solving a semi-discretized version of the diffusion equation. Both the one-dimensional and two-dimensional cases are covered. An extensive analysis of discrete smoothing kernels is carried out for one-dimensional signals and the discrete scale-space properties of the most common discretizations to the continuous theory are analysed. A representation, called the scale-space primal sketch, which gives a formal description of the hierarchical relations between structures at different levels of scale. It is aimed at making information in the scale-space representation explicit. We give a theory for its construction and an algorithm for computing it. A theory for extracting significant image structures and determining the scales of these structures from this representation in a solely bottom-up data-driven way. Examples demonstrating how such qualitative information extracted from the scale-space primal sketch can be used for guiding and simplifying other early visual processes. Applications are given to edge detection, histogram analysis and classification based on local features. Among other possible applications one can mention perceptual grouping, texture analysis, stereo matching, model matching and motion. A detailed theoretical analysis of the evolution properties of critical points and blobs in scale-space, comprising drift velocity estimates under scale-space smoothing, a classification of the possible types of generic events at bifurcation situations and estimates of how the number of local extrema in a signal can be expected to decrease as function of the scale parameter. For two-dimensional signals the generic bifurcation events are annihilations and creations of extremum-saddle point pairs. Interpreted in terms of blobs, these transitions correspond to annihilations, merges, splits and creations. Experiments on different types of real imagery demonstrate that the proposed theory gives perceptually intuitive results."

For continuous signals, a scaling argument directly gives a natural unit for measuring scale-space lifetime in terms of the logarithm of the ordinary scale parameter. That approach is, however, not appropriate for discrete signals since an infinite lifetime would be assigned to structures existing in the original signal. It is shown how such an effective scale parameter can be defined to give consistent results for both discrete and continuous signals. The treatment is based on the assumption that the probability that a local extremum disappears during a short-scale interval should not vary with scale. As a tool for the analysis, estimates are given of how the density of local extrema can be expected to vary with scale in the scale-space representation of different random noise signals both in the continuous and discrete cases. >"

In particular, if one assumes scale space filters to be linear, isotropic convolution filters, then two conditions (viz. recursivity and scale-invariance) suffice to narrow down the collection of possible filters to a family that essentially depends on one parameter which determines the qualitative shape of the filter. Gaussian filters correspond to one particular value of this shape-parameter. For other values the filters exhibit a more complicated pattern of excitatory and inhibitory regions. This might well be relevant to the study of the neurophysiology of biological visual systems, for recent research shows the existence of extensive disinhibitory regions outside the periphery of the classical center-surround receptive field of LGN and retinal ganglion cells (in cats). Such regions cannot be accounted for by models based on the second order derivative of the Gaussian. Finally, the authors investigate how this work ties in with another axiomatic approach of scale space operators which focuses on the semigroup properties of the operator family. The authors show that only a discrete subset of filters gives rise to an evolution which can be characterized by means of a partial differential equation. >"

A genuinely discrete scale-space theory is developed and its connection to the continuous scale-space theory is explained. Special attention is given to discretization effects, which occur when results from the continuous scale-space theory are to be implemented computationally. The 1D problem is solved completely in an axiomatic manner. For the 2D problem, the author discusses how the 2D discrete scale space should be constructed. The main results are as follows: the proper way to apply the scale-space theory to discrete signals and discrete images is by discretization of the diffusion equation, not the convolution integral; the discrete scale space obtained in this way can be described by convolution with the kernel, which is the discrete analog of the Gaussian kernel, a scale-space implementation based on the sampled Gaussian kernel might lead to undesirable effects and computational problems, especially at fine levels of scale; the 1D discrete smoothing transformations can be characterized exactly and a complete catalogue is given; all finite support 1D discrete smoothing transformations arise from repeated averaging over two adjacent elements (the limit case of such an averaging process is described); and the symmetric 1D discrete smoothing kernels are nonnegative and unimodal, in both the spatial and the frequency domain. >"

This paper introduces a new tool for dealing with this problem. A heuristic principle is proposed stating that local extrema over scales of diierent combinations of normalized scale invariant derivatives are likely candidates to correspond to interesting structures. Support is given by theoretical considerations and experiments on real and synthetic data. The resulting methodology lends itself naturally to two-stage algorithms; feature detection at coarse scales followed by feature localization at ner scales. Experiments on blob detection, junction detection and edge detection demonstrate that the proposed method gives intuitively reasonable results."

It is shown that the second derivative of the contrast function at the critical point is related to the classification of the associated edge as being phantom or authentic. The contrast of authentic edges decreases with filter scale, while the contrast of phantom edges are shown to increase with scale. As the filter scale increases, an authentic edge must either turn into a phantom edge or join with a phantom edge and vanish. The points in the scale space at which these events occur are seen to be singular points of the contrast function. Using ideas from singularity, or catastrophy theory, the scale map contours near these singular points are found to be either vertical or parabolic. >"

This paper introduces a new tool for dealing with this problem. A heuristic principle is proposed stating that local extrema over scales of di erent combinations of normalized scale invariant derivatives are likely candidates to correspond to interesting structures. Support is given by theoretical considerations and experiments on real and synthetic data. The resulting methodology lends itself naturally to two-stage algorithms; feature detection at coarse scales followed by feature localization at ner scales. Experiments on blob detection, junction detection and edge detection demonstrate that the proposed method gives intuitively reasonable results."

The theorems, corollaries, and assertions presented can be used to recover edges, and related features, in complex images. The results reported include one lemma, three theorems, a number of corollaries and six assertions. The rigorous mathematical proofs for the theorems and corollaries are presented.

The method employs a technique of edge-affected diffusion, where blurring is limited by the presence of edges as measured at the scale of interest. By repeating such processing and measuring gradients at successively smaller scales one is able to trace a \"path\" through scale space which can preserve accurate information about boundaries of objects, and yet selectively remove objects that fall below a scale of interest. We compared this approach with the anisotropic diffusion technique described by Perona and Malik, which depends only on the local gradient of intensity of the processed image. We show some examples which indicate that this method could be useful for boundary detection in the presence of blurring and noise and which is also capable of performing grouping of distinct objects at various scales. This paper also examines the sensitivity of this process with respect to one\u2032s choice of parameters."

A complete classification is given of all image multiscale transforms satisfying these requirements. This classification yields a characterization of all classical models and includes new ones, which all are partial differential equations. The new models we introduce have more invariance properties than all the previously known models and in particular have a projection invariance essential for shape recognition. Numerical experiments are presented and compared. The same method is applied to the multiscale analysis of movies. By introducing a property of Galilean invariance, we find a single multiscale morphological model for movie analysis."

Various families of operators with special kinds of symmetries (such as translation, rotation, magnification) are explicitly constructed in 1-D, 2-D, and 3-D. A concept of 'order' is defined, and finite orthonormal bases of functions closely connected with the operators of various orders are constructed. Linear transformations between the various representations are considered. The method is based on two fundamental assumptions: a decrease of resolution should not introduce spurious detail, and the local operators should be self-similar under changes of resolution. These assumptions merely sum up the even more general need for homogeneity isotropy, scale invariance, and separability of independent dimensions of front-end processing in the absence of a priori information. >"

The need for two scale parameters is emphasized: a local scale, for describing the amount of smoothing used for suppressing noise and irrelevant details when computing primitive texture descriptors from image data; and an integration scale, for describing the size of the region in space over which the statistics of the local descriptors is accummulated. The proposed computational model is expressed completely in terms of different invariants defined from Gaussian derivatives at multiple scales in scale-space. The resulting texture description can be combined with various assumptions about surface texture to estimate local surface orientation. Two specific assumptions, weak isotropy and constant area, are explored in more detail. Results from experiments on real and synthetic reference data with known geometry that demonstrate the viability of the approach are presented.<<ETX>>"

This is achieved by repeatedly convolving the signal with a very small averaging filter modulated by a measure of the signal discontinuity at each point. This process is related to the anisotropic diffusion reported by P. Perona and J. Malik (1987) but it has a much simpler formulation and is not subject to instability or divergence. Real examples show how this approach can be applied to the smoothing of various types of signals. The detected features do not move, and thus no tracking is needed. The last property makes it possible to derive a novel scale-space representation of a signal using a small number of scales. Finally, this process is easily implemented on parallel architectures: the running time on a 16 K connection machine is three orders of magnitude faster than on a serial machine.<<ETX>>"

The representation gives a qualitative description of the image structure that allows for detection of stable scales and regions of interest in a solely bottom-up data-driven way. In other words, it generates coarse segmentation cues and can be hence seen as preceding further processing, which can then be properly tuned. The authors argue that once such information is available many other processing tasks can become much simpler.

(1) Intensity changes, which occur in a natural image over a wide range of scales, are detected separately at different scales. An appropriate filter for this purpose at a given scale is found to be the second derivative of a Gaussian, and it is shown that, provided some simple conditions are satisfied, these primary filters need not be orientation-dependent. Thus, intensity changes at a given scale are best detected by finding the zero values of \u22072G(x, y)* I(x, y) for image I, where G(x, y) is a two-dimensional Gaussian distribution and \u22072 is the Laplacian. The intensity changes thus discovered in each of the channels are then represented by oriented primitives called zero-crossing segments, and evidence is given that this representation is complete. (2) Intensity changes in images arise from surface discontinuities or from reflectance or illumination boundaries, and these all have the property that they are spatially localized. Because of this, the zero-crossing segments from the different channels are not independent, and rules are deduced for combining them into a description of the image. This description is called the raw primal sketch. The theory explains several basic psychophysical findings, and the operation of forming oriented zero-crossing segments from the output of centre-surround \u22072G filters acting on the image forms the basis for a physiological model of simple cells (see Marr & Ullman 1979)."

The properties of the operator which approximates a signal at a given resolution were studied. It is shown that the difference of information between the approximation of a signal at the resolutions 2/sup j+1/ and 2/sup j/ (where j is an integer) can be extracted by decomposing this signal on a wavelet orthonormal basis of L/sup 2/(R/sup n/), the vector space of measurable, square-integrable n-dimensional functions. In L/sup 2/(R), a wavelet orthonormal basis is a family of functions which is built by dilating and translating a unique function psi (x). This decomposition defines an orthogonal multiresolution representation called a wavelet representation. It is computed with a pyramidal algorithm based on convolutions with quadrature mirror filters. Wavelet representation lies between the spatial and Fourier domains. For images, the wavelet representation differentiates several spatial orientations. The application of this representation to data compression in image coding, texture discrimination and fractal analysis is discussed. >"

In particular, the zero crossings of this so-called scale-space data are associated with edges and have been proposed by D. Marr (1982) and others as the basis of a representation of the image data. The question arises as to whether the representation is complete and stable. The authors survey some of the studies and results related to these questions as well as several studies that attempt reconstructions based on this or related representations. They formulate a novel method for reconstruction from zero crossings in scale space that is based on minimizing equation error, and they present results showing that the reconstruction is possible but can be unstable. They further show that the method applies when gradient data along the zero crossings are included in the representation, and they demonstrate empirically that the reconstruction is then stable. >"

The success of the approach depends on the definition of a comprehensive set of goals for the computation of edge points. These goals must be precise enough to delimit the desired behavior of the detector while making minimal assumptions about the form of the solution. We define detection and localization criteria for a class of edges, and present mathematical forms for these criteria as functionals on the operator impulse response. A third criterion is then added to ensure that the detector has only one response to a single edge. We use the criteria in numerical optimization to derive detectors for several common image features, including step edges. On specializing the analysis to step edges, we find that there is a natural uncertainty principle between detection and localization performance, which are the two main goals. With this principle we derive a single operator shape which is optimal at any scale. The optimal detector has a simple approximate implementation in which edges are marked at maxima in gradient magnitude of a Gaussian-smoothed image. We extend this simple detector using operators of several widths to cope with different signal-to-noise ratios in the image. We present a general method, called feature synthesis, for the fine-to-coarse integration of information from operators at different scales. Finally we show that step edge detector performance improves considerably as the operator point spread function is extended along the edge."

The central problem in structural pattern matching is to determine the correspondence between the symbols which comprise a model and symbols which describe a pattern. The difficulty of determining this correspondence depends critically on the representation that is used to describe patterns. This correspondence presents a probabilistic representation for structural models of pattern classes. Both pattern descriptions and models for pattern classes are based on symbols which represent grayscale information at multiple resolutions. A pattern description is given by a tree of symbols with attribute values. Structural models are represented by a tree of symbols with probabilistic attributes. The position and scale (resolution) of the symbols, as well as other ``features,'' are represented by these attributes. An algorithm is presented for determining the correspondence between symbols in a description of a pattern and symbols in a model of a pattern class. This algorithm uses the connectivity between symbols at different scales to constrain the search for correspondence. An interactive training program for learning models of pattern classes is described, and some conclusions from the work are presented."

The goal is to relate the results of this analysis to the structure of the picture, which is determined by the physics of the image generation process. Candidates for contour points are the maximal magnitudes of the gray-value gradient for different scales in the direction of the gradient. Based on the output of such a bank of gradient filters, a procedure is proposed to select automatically a suitable scale, and with that, the size of the right convolution kernel. The application of poorly adapted filters, which make the exact localization of gray-value corners or T-, X-, and Y-junctions more difficult, is thus avoided. Possible gaps at such junctions are discussed for images of real scenes, and possibilities for the closure of some of these gaps are demonstrated when the extrema of the magnitudes of the gray-value gradients are used. >"

Using basic concepts from algebra, he examines the various properties of the groups. Analysis and topology are used wherever appropriate. The book also covers topics such as matrix algebras, semigroups, commutators, and spinors, which are of great importance in understanding the group-theoretic structure of quantum mechanics. Hermann Weyl was among the greatest mathematicians of the twentieth century. He made fundamental contributions to most branches of mathematics, but he is best remembered as one of the major developers of group theory, a powerful formal method for analyzing abstract and physical systems in which symmetry is present. In The Classical Groups, his most important book, Weyl provided a detailed introduction to the development of group theory, and he did it in a way that motivated and entertained his readers. Departing from most theoretical mathematics books of the time, he introduced historical events and people as well as theorems and proofs. One learned not only about the theory of invariants but also when and where they were originated, and by whom. He once said of his writing, \"My work always tried to unite the truth with the beautiful, but when I had to choose one or the other, I usually chose the beautiful.\" Weyl believed in the overall unity of mathematics and that it should be integrated into other fields. He had serious interest in modern physics, especially quantum mechanics, a field to which The Classical Groups has proved important, as it has to quantum chemistry and other fields. Among the five books Weyl published with Princeton, Algebraic Theory of Numbers inaugurated the Annals of Mathematics Studies book series, a crucial and enduring foundation of Princeton's mathematics list and the most distinguished book series in mathematics."

A critical, intermediate goal of edge detection is the detection and characterization of significant intensity changes. This paper discusses this part of the edge detection problem. To characterize the types of intensity changes derivatives of different types, and possibly different scales, are needed. Thus, we consider this part of edge detection as a problem in numerical differentiation. We show that numerical differentiation of images is an ill-posed problem in the sense of Hadamard. Differentiation needs to be regularized by a regularizing filtering operation before differentiation. This shows that this part of edge detection consists of two steps, a filtering step and a differentiation step. Following this perspective, the paper discusses in detail the following theoretical aspects of edge detection. 1) The properties of different types of filters-with minimal uncertainty, with a bandpass spectrum, and with limited support-are derived. Minimal uncertainty filters optimize a tradeoff between computational efficiency and regularizing properties. 2) Relationships among several 2-D differential operators are established. In particular, we characterize the relation between the Laplacian and the second directional derivative along the gradient. Zero crossings of the Laplacian are not the only features computed in early vision. 3) Geometrical and topological properties of the zero crossings of differential operators are studied in terms of transversality and Morse theory."

This representation is constructed by detecting peaks and ridges in the difference of lowpass (DOLP) transform. Descriptions of shapes which are encoded in this representation may be matched efficiently despite changes in size, orientation, or position. Motivations for a multiple resolution representation are presented first, followed by the definition of the DOLP transform. Techniques are then presented for encoding a symbolic structural description of forms from the DOLP transform. This process involves detecting local peaks and ridges in each bandpass image and in the entire three-dimensional space defined by the DOLP transform. Linking adjacent peaks in different bandpass images gives a multiple resolution tree which describes shape. Peaks which are local maxima in this tree provide landmarks for aligning, manipulating, and matching shapes. Detecting and linking the ridges in each DOLP bandpass image provides a graph which links peaks within a shape in a bandpass image and describes the positions of the boundaries of the shape at multiple resolutions. Detecting and linking the ridges in the DOLP three-space describes elongated forms and links the largest peaks in the tree. The principles for determining the correspondence between symbols in pairs of such descriptions are then described. Such correspondence matching is shown to be simplified by using the correspondence at lower resolutions to constrain the possible correspondence at higher resolutions."

                "text": "Edge detection in a gray-scale image at a fine resolution typically yields noise and unnecessary detail, whereas edge detection at a coarse resolution distorts edge contours. We show that ``edge focusing'', i.e., a coarse-to-fine tracking in a continuous manner, combines high positional accuracy with good noise-reduction. This is of vital interest in several applications. Junctions of different kinds are in this way restored with high precision, which is a basic requirement when performing (projective) geometric analysis of an image for the purpose of restoring the three-dimensional scene. Segmentation of a scene using geometric clues like parallelism, etc., is also facilitated by the algorithm, since unnecessary detail has been filtered away. There are indications that an extension of the focusing algorithm can classify edges, to some extent, into the categories diffuse and nondiffuse (for example diffuse illumination edges). The edge focusing algorithm contains two parameters, namely the coarseness of the resolution in the blurred image from where we start the focusing procedure, and a threshold on the gradient magnitude at this coarse level. The latter parameter seems less critical for the behavior of the algorithm and is not present in the focusing part, i.e., at finer resolutions. The step length of the scale parameter in the focusing scheme has been chosen so that edge elements do not move more than one pixel per focusing step."

This approach goes beyond edge-based and area-based approaches by using a richer image description and incorporating several stereo cues that previously have been neglected in the computer vision literature. A technique based on using the pseudo-inverse is presented for characterizing the information present in a vector of filter responses. We show how in our framework viewing geometry can be recovered to determine the locations of epipolar lines. An assumption that visible surfaces in the scene are piecewise smooth leads to differential treatment of image regions corresponding to binocularly visible surfaces, surface boundaries, and occluded regions that are only monocularly visible. The constraints imposed by viewing geometry and piecewise smoothness are incorporated into an iterative algorithm that gives good results on random-dot stereograms, artificially generated scenes, and natural grey-level images."

Group representation theory, Lie groups and Lie algebras, the theory of invariance, tensor calculus, differential geometry and projective geometry are used for three-dimensional shape and motion analysis from images, making use of techniques such as shape from motion, shape from texture, shape from angle and shape from surface. Although the mathematics itself may be well known to mathematicians, people working in areas related to computer science, image understanding, computer vision and image processing have usually never studied such mathematics, and so may be surprised to learn that abstract mathematical concepts can be of enormous help in building intelligent computer vision systems."

The apparent changes in texture element properties can be analyzed to recover information about the physical layout of the scene. In practice it is difficult to identify texture elements, especially in images where the texture elements are partially occluded or are themselves textured at a finer scale. To solve this problem, it is necessary to integrate the extraction of texture elements with the recognition of scene layout. This paper presents a method for recovering the orientation of textured surfaces while simultaneously identifying texture elements. Candidate texture elements are constructed from overlapping circular regions of relatively uniform gray level. The uniform circular regions are found by convolving the image with Del sq G (Laplacian-of-Gaussian) masks over a range of scales, and comparing the convolution output to that expected for a circular disk of constant gray level. True texture elements are selected from the set of candidate texture elements by finding the planar surface that best predicts the properties of the candidate texture elements. A planar fit is evaluated by comparing the predicted texture-element areas to the actual areas of the candidate texture elements. The planar fit receiving support from the most regions is chosen as the correct interpretation."

This article describes a way of reducing this effect for a general class of methods for deriving 3-D shape cues from 2-D image data, which are based on the estimation of locally linearized distortion of brightness patterns. By extending the linear scale-space concept into an affine scale-space representation and performing affine shape adaption of the smoothing kernels, the accuracy of surface orientation estimates derived from texture and disparity cues can be improved by typically one order of magnitude. The reason for this is that the image descriptors, on which the methods are based, will be relative invariant under affine transformations, and the error will thus be confined to the higher-order terms in the locally linearized perspective mapping."

The image is described in terms of nested light and dark regions. This algorithm, successfully implemented in one, two, and three dimensions, can theoretically work with any number of dimensions. The interactive postprocessing developed technique selects regions from the descriptive tree for display in several ways: pointing to a branch of the image description tree, specifying by sliders the range of scale and/or intensity of all regions which should be displayed, and pointing (on the original image) to any pixel in the desired region. The algorithm has been applied to approximately 15 computer tomography (CT) images of the abdomen. >"

If these ordinates are the values of a known analytic function F(x), then the problem of interpolation between these ordinates has an obvious and precise meaning: we are required to compute intermediate values F(x) to the same accuracy to which the ordinates are known. Undoubtedly, the most convenient tool for the solution of this problem is the polynomial central interpolation method. It uses the polynomial of degree k \u2014 1, interpolating k successive ordinates, as an approximation to F(x) only within a unit interval in x, centrally located with respect to its k defining ordinates. Assuming k fixed, successive approximating arcs for F(x) are thus obtained which present discontinuities on passing from one arc to the next if k is odd, or discontinuities in their first derivatives if k is even (see section 2.121). Actually these discontinuities are irrelevant in our present case of an analytic function F(x). Indeed, if the interpolated values obtained are sufficiently accurate, these discontinuities will be apparent only if we force the computation beyond the intrinsic accuracy of the y n."

In the same paper of 1930 the author showed that (1) is certainly variationdiminishing if the matrix A does not possess two minors of equal orders and of opposite signs; also the converse holds to a certain extent: If (1) is variation-diminishing, then A cannot have two minors of equal orders and of opposite signs, provided the rank of A is = n. The necessary and sufficient conditions in order that (1) be variation-diminishing were found in 1933 by Th. Motzkin 3). Since they will be used in this paper we state them here as follows: Let r be the rank of A then A should not have two minors of equal orders and of opposite signs if their common order is < r, while if their common order is = r then again they should never be of opposite signs if they belong to the same combination of r columns of A."

The geometric information content of the gradient of binocular disparity is analyzed for the general case of a fixating system with symmetric or asymmetric vergence, and with either known or unknown viewing geometry. A computationally inexpensive technique which exploits this analysis is proposed. This technique allows a local estimate of surface orientation to be computed directly from the local statistics of the left and right image brightness gradients, without iterations or search. The viability of the approach is demonstrated with experimental results for both synthetic and natural gray-level images."

The representation differs from established techniques in that the code elements are localized in spatial frequency as well as in space. Pixel-to-pixel correlations are first removed by subtracting a lowpass filtered copy of the image from the image itself. The result is a net data compression since the difference, or error, image has low variance and entropy, and the low-pass filtered image may represented at reduced sample density. Further data compression is achieved by quantizing the difference image. These steps are then repeated to compress the low-pass image. Iteration of the process at appropriately expanded scales generates a pyramid data structure. The encoding process is equivalent to sampling the image with Laplacian operators of many scales. Thus, the code tends to enhance salient image features. A further advantage of the present code is that it is well suited for many image analysis tasks as well as for image compression. Fast algorithms are described for coding and decoding."

Frequently employed generating kernels are compared to the optimal kernel that assures minimal information loss after the resolution reduction, i.e., the one corresponding to an ideal low pass filter. Physically realizable, optimal generating kernels are presented. The amount of computation required for generation of the image pyramid can be reduced significantly by employing half-band filters as components of the optimal kernel. Image pyramids generated by the optimal kernel show a better command of details than the ones generated by a simple 4 \u00d7 4 averaging, or a computationally equivalent kernel."

In psychophysiology, multichannel models have been particularly successful in explaining some low-level processing in the visual cortex. The expansion of a function into several frequency channels provides a representation which is intermediate between a spatial and a Fourier representation. The author describes the mathematical properties of such decompositions and introduces the wavelet transform. He reviews the classical multiresolution pyramidal transforms developed in computer vision and shows how they relate to the decomposition of an image into a wavelet orthonormal basis. He discusses the properties of the zero crossings of multifrequency channels. Zero-crossing representations are particularly well adapted for pattern recognition in computer vision. >"

The DOLP is a reversible transform which converts an image into a set of bandpass images. A DOLP transform is shown to require O(N2) multiplies and produce O(N log(N)) samples from an N sample image. When Gaussian low-pass filters are used, the result is a set of images which have been convolved with difference of Gaussian (DOG) filters from an exponential set of sizes. A fast computation technique based on ``resampling'' is described and shown to reduce the DOLP transform complexity to O(N log(N)) multiplies and O(N) storage locations. A second technique, ``cascaded convolution with expansion,'' is then defined and also shown to reduce the computational cost to O(N log(N)) multiplies. Combining these two techniques yields an algorithm for a DOLP transform that requires O(N) storage cells and requires O(N) multiplies."

It presents those parts of the theory which are especially useful in calculations and stresses the representation of splines as linear combinations of B-splines. After two chapters summarizing polynomial approximation, a rigorous discussion of elementary spline theory is given involving linear, cubic and parabolic splines. The computational handling of piecewise polynomial functions (of one variable) of arbitrary order is the subject of chapters VII and VIII, while chapters IX, X, and XI are devoted to B-splines. The distances from splines with fixed and with variable knots is discussed in chapter XII. The remaining five chapters concern specific approximation methods, interpolation, smoothing and least-squares approximation, the solution of an ordinary differential equation by collocation, curve fitting, and surface fitting. The present text version differs from the original in several respects. The book is now typeset (in plain TeX), the Fortran programs now make use of Fortran 77 features. The figures have been redrawn with the aid of Matlab, various errors have been corrected, and many more formal statements have been provided with proofs. Further, all formal statements and equations have been numbered by the same numbering system, to make it easier to find any particular item. A major change has occured in Chapters IX-XI where the B-spline theory is now developed directly from the recurrence relations without recourse to divided differences. This has brought in knot insertion as a powerful tool for providing simple proofs concerning the shape-preserving properties of the B-spline series."

Dieser Satz von der Endlichkeit des vollen Invariantensystems bildet den Ausgangspunkt und die Grundlage fur die Untersuchungen der vorliegenden Abhandlung 2. Die im folgenden entwickelten Methoden unterscheiden sich wesentlich von den bisher in der Invariantentheorie angewandten Mitteln; bei den nachfolgenden Untersuchungen namlich ordnet sich die Theorie der algebraischen Invarianten unmittelbar unter die allgemeine Theorie der algebraischen Funktionenkorper unter: so das die Theorie der Invarianten lediglich als ein besonders bemerkenswertes Beispiel fur die Theorie der algebraischen Funktionenkorper mit mehr Veranderlichen erscheint \u2014 gerade wie man in der Zahlentheorie die Theorie der Kreisteilungskorper lediglich als ein besonders bemerkenswertes Beispiel aufzufassen hat, an welchem die wichtigsten Satze der Theorie der allgemeinen Zahlenkorper zuerst erkannt und bewiesen worden sind."

The scale parameter in the scale-space representation determines the minimum scale, or the inner scale, that can be reached in an observation of an image at that scale. Referring to the analogy with cartography given in the introduction, let us note that an atlas usually contains a set of maps covering some region of interest. Within each map the outer scale typically scales in proportion with the inner scale. A single map is, however, usually not su cient for us in order to nd our way around the world. We need the ability to zoom in to structures at di erent scales; i.e., decrease and increase the inner scale of the observation according to the type of situation at hand. Koenderink also stressed that if there is no a priori reason for looking at speci c image structures, then the visual system must be able to handle image structures at all scales. Pyramid representations approach this problem by successive smoothing and subsampling of images. However, The challenge is to understand the image really on all these levels simultaneously , and not as unrelated set of derived images at di erent levels of blurring ... Adding a scale dimension onto the original data set, as is done in the one-parameter embedding, provides a formal way to express this interrelation. The observation that new local extrema cannot be created with increasing scale shows that Gaussian convolution satis es certain su ciency requirements for being a smoothing operation. The rst proof of the necessity of Gaussian smoothing for scale-space representation was given by Koenderink (1984), who also gave a formal extension of the scale-space theory to higher dimensions."

On the other hand, if the image contains a small number of regions with a relatively uniform grey-level, then a substantial data reduction can be obtained in this way. Concerning grey-level data, this representation has been used in simple segmentation algorithms for image processing. In the \\split-and-merge\" algorithm, a splitting step is rst performed according to the above scheme. Then, adjacent regions are merged if the variation measure of the union of the two regions is below the threshold. Another application (when typically = 0) concerns objects de ned by uniform grey-levels, e.g. binary objects; see e.g. the book by Tanimoto and Klinger (1980) for more references on this type representation."
