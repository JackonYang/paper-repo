A framework is presented for examining the effect of particular variables on the performance of the system, and preliminary results are presented showing the effect of cohesion measures based on the simplest domain-independent analyses, with the aim allowing future comparison with more knowledge-intensive analyses based on natural language processing. These baseline results suggest that very simple string-based cohesion measures are not sufficient to support the extraction of tuples as we require. Future work will pursue the aim of more adequate approximations to a notional subtype/supertype definition of the relationship between value cells and label cells."

Visual clues that exist in the image are used for extracting first the physical, and then the logical structure of the table. Since these visual clues generally have a logical meaning, there must be some association made between the graphical attributes extracted and their function of reflecting the logic expressed by the table; this knowledge is coordinated in a model. This approach, therefore, can be adapted to all tables which have graphical attributes discernible to the image analysis being used."
