On standard benchmarks in natural language processing, it asymptotically outperforms previous stochastic gradient methods for parameter estimation in conditional random fields.

We give an update formula which generates matrices using information from the last m iterations, where m is any number supplied by the user. The quasi-Newton matrix is updated at every iteration by dropping the oldest information and replacing it by the newest informa- tion. It is shown that the matrices generated have some desirable properties. The resulting algorithms are tested numerically and compared with several well- known methods. 1. Introduction. For the problem of minimizing an unconstrained function / of n variables, quasi-Newton methods are widely employed (4). They construct a se- quence of matrices which in some way approximate the hessian of /(or its inverse). These matrices are symmetric; therefore, it is necessary to have n(n + l)/2 storage locations for each one. For large dimensional problems it will not be possible to re- tain the matrices in the high speed storage of a computer, and one has to resort to other kinds of algorithms. For example, one could use the methods (Toint (15), Shanno (12)) which preserve the sparsity structure of the hessian, or conjugate gradient methods (CG) which only have to store 3 or 4 vectors. Recently, some CG algorithms have been developed which use a variable amount of storage and which do not require knowledge about the sparsity structure of the problem (2), (7), (8). A disadvantage of these methods is that after a certain number of iterations the quasi-Newton matrix is discarded, and the algorithm is restarted using an initial matrix (usually a diagonal matrix). We describe an algorithm which uses a limited amount of storage and where the quasi-Newton matrix is updated continuously. At every step the oldest information contained in the matrix is discarded and replaced by new one. In this way we hope to have a more up to date model of our function. We will concentrate on the BFGS method since it is considered to be the most efficient. We believe that similar algo- rithms cannot be developed for the other members of the Broyden 0-class (1). Let / be the function to be nnnimized, g its gradient and h its hessian. We define"

Consider, for instance, a system that \u2018watches\u2019 television for a few weeks and learns to enumerate the objects present in these images. Most current learning algorithms do not scale well enough to handle such massive quantities of data. Experience suggests that the stochastic learning algorithms are best suited to such tasks. This is at first surprising because stochastic learning algorithms optimize the training error rather slowly. Our paper reconsiders the convergence speed in terms of how fast a learning algorithm optimizes the testing error. This reformulation shows the superiority of the well designed stochastic learning algorithm. Copyright \u00a9 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."

We prove that the number of iterations required to obtain a solution of accuracy $${\\epsilon}$$ is $${\\tilde{O}(1 / \\epsilon)}$$, where each iteration operates on a single training example. In contrast, previous analyses of stochastic gradient descent methods for SVMs require $${\\Omega(1 / \\epsilon^2)}$$ iterations. As in previously devised SVM solvers, the number of iterations also scales linearly with 1/\u03bb, where \u03bb is the regularization parameter of SVM. For a linear kernel, the total run-time of our method is $${\\tilde{O}(d/(\\lambda \\epsilon))}$$, where d is a bound on the number of non-zero features in each example. Since the run-time does not depend directly on the size of the training set, the resulting algorithm is especially suited for learning from large datasets. Our approach also extends to non-linear kernels while working solely on the primal objective function, though in this case the runtime does depend linearly on the training set size. Our algorithm is particularly well suited for large text classification problems, where we demonstrate an order-of-magnitude speedup over previous SVM learning methods."

Any efficient learning algorithm should at least take a brief look at each example. But should all examples be given equal attention?This contribution proposes an empirical answer. We first present an online SVM algorithm based on this premise. LASVM yields competitive misclassification rates after a single pass over the training examples, outspeeding state-of-the-art SVM solvers. Then we show how active example selection can yield faster training, higher accuracies, and simpler models, using only a fraction of the training example labels."

These diverse areas echo the classes of models which conveniently describe each corresponding system. Thus although there can hardly be a \"general theory of adaptive systems\" encompassing both the modelling task and the design of the adaptation procedure, nevertheless, these diverse issues have a major common component: namely the use of adaptive algorithms, also known as stochastic approximations in the mathematical statistics literature, that is to say the adaptation procedure (once all modelling problems have been resolved). The juxtaposition of these two expressions in the title reflects the ambition of the authors to produce a reference work, both for engineers who use these adaptive algorithms and for probabilists or statisticians who would like to study stochastic approximations in terms of problems arising from real applications. Hence the book is organised in two parts, the first one user-oriented, and the second providing the mathematical foundations to support the practice described in the first part. The book covers the topcis of convergence, convergence rate, permanent adaptation and tracking, change detection, and is illustrated by various realistic applications originating from these areas of applications."

Il est divise en trois parties. La premiere partie traite des fondements. Il arrive qu'un probleme n'ait pas trouve de solution analytique mais soit decrit par des exemples et par un critere d'erreur, permettant l'usage de procedures de descente de gradient stochastique. Nous etablissons un nouveau theoreme de convergence generalisant le theoreme de bottou. La reconnaissance des formes emploie generalement des criteres d'erreur constants par paliers, impropres a l'optimisation par descente de gradient. Il faut contourner le probleme, via les probabilites a posteriori ou via les vraissemblances conditionnelles ou encore en lissant le risque empirique: nous introduisons lvq2+. La deuxieme partie est consacree aux algorithmes, notamment systemes modulaires pour la reconnaissance de formes temporelles. Nous mettons en evidence le codage ponctuel, phenomene d'abberration propre aux systemes compose d'un filtre suivit d'un module de plus-proches voisins. Nous proposons deux familles de solutions dont l'usage de criteres d'erreur adimensionels tels que lvq2+. Ceci permet d'optimiser des systemes modulaires combinant un filtre neuronal mlp avec un module plus proche voisin dont la metrique est induite par la programmation dynamique dp. La troisieme partie est consacree a une tache reelle de reconnaissance de la parole. Nous comparons differents systemes: dp, reseaux neuronaux a delais, reseaux recurrents, kmeans, lvq nos systemes modulaires divisent par trois l'erreur des autres systemes. L'optimisation simultanee des differents modules permet au module dp de se contenter d'une reference par classe"

We benchmark several widely used supervised learning methods on RCV1-v2, illustrating the collection's properties, suggesting new directions for research, and providing baseline results for future studies.
