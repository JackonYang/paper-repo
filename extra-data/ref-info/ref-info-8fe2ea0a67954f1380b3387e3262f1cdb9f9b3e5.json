This approach does not require the commonly used assumption that the source to be modeled is a hidden Markov process. The algorithm is started from the model estimated by the traditional maximum likelihood (ML) approach and alternatively decreases the discrimination information over all probability distributions of the source which agree with the given measurements and all hidden Markov models. The proposed procedure generalizes the Baum algorithm for ML hidden Markov modeling. The procedure is shown to be a descent algorithm for the discrimination information measure and its local convergence is proved."

Such models are called Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and are useful representations for speech signals in terms of some convenient observations (e.g., cepstral coefficients or pseudolog area ratios). One method of estimating parameters of HMMs is the well-known Baum-Welch reestimation method. For continuous pdf's, the method was known to work only for elliptically symmetric densities. We have recently shown that the method can be generalized to handle mixtures of elliptically symmetric pdf's. Any continuous pdf can be approximated to any desired accuracy by such mixtures, in particular, by mixtures of multivariate Gaussian pdf's. To effectively make use of this method of parameter estimation, it is necessary to understand how it is affected by the amount of training data available, the number of states in the Markov chain, the dimensionality of the signal, etc. To study these issues, Markov chains and random vector generators were simulated to generate training sequences from \u201ctoy\u201d models. The model parameters were estimated from these training sequences and compared to the \u201ctrue\u201d parameters by means of an appropriate distance measure. The results of several such experiments show the strong sensitivity of the method to some (but not all) of the model parameters. A procedure for getting good initial parameter estimates is, therefore, of considerable importance."

This is done in the framework of a standard statistical pattern recognition model. Both the vector quantizer and the hidden Markov models need to be trained for the vocabulary being recognized. Such training results in a distinct hidden Markov model for each word of the vocabulary. Classification consists of computing the probability of generating the test word with each word model and choosing the word model that gives the highest probability. There are several factors, in both the vector quantizer and the hidden Markov modeling, that affect the performance of the overall word recognition system, including the size of the vector quantizer, the structure of the hidden Markov model, the ways of handling insufficient training data, etc. The effects, on recognition accuracy, of many of these factors are discussed in this paper. The entire recognizer (training and testing) has been evaluated on a 10-word digits vocabulary. For training, a set of 100 talkers spoke each of the digits one time. For testing, an independent set of 100 tokens of each of the digits was obtained. The overall recognition accuracy was found to be 96.5 percent for the 100-talker test set. These results are comparable to those obtained in earlier work, using a dynamic time-warping recognition algorithm with multiple templates per digit. It is also shown that the computation and storage requirements of the new recognizer were an order of magnitude less than that required for a conventional pattern recognition system using linear prediction with dynamic time warping."

Recently, attention has been focused on the application of these models to talker-independent, isolated-word recognition. Initial results using models with discrete output densities for isolated-digit recognition were later improved using models based on continuous output densities. In a series of experiments on isolated-word recognition, we applied hidden Markov models with multivariate Gaussian output densities to the problem. Speech data was represented by feature vectors consisting of eight log area ratios and the log LPC error. A weak measure of vocal-tract dynamics was included in the observations by appending to the feature vector observed at time t, the vector observed at time t-\u03b4, for some fixed offset \u03b4. The best models were obtained with offsets of 75 or 90 msecs. When a comparison is made on a common data base, the resulting error rate of 0.2% for isolated-digit recognition improves on previous algorithms."

Two types of mixture probability densities are investigated: finite mixtures of Gaussian autoregressive densities (GAM) and nearest-neighbor partitioned finite mixtures of Gaussian autoregressive densities (PGAM). In the former (GAM), the observation density in each Markov state is simply a (stochastically constrained) weighted sum of Gaussian autoregressive densities, while in the latter (PGAM) it involves nearest-neighbor decoding which in effect, defines a set of partitions on the observation space. In this paper we discuss the signal modeling methodology and give experimental results on speaker independent recognition of isolated digits. We also discuss the potential use of the modeling technique for other applications."

The signal is modeled as a linear combination of its past values and present and past values of a hypothetical input to a system whose output is the given signal. In the frequency domain, this is equivalent to modeling the signal spectrum by a pole-zero spectrum. The major part of the paper is devoted to all-pole models. The model parameters are obtained by a least squares analysis in the time domain. Two methods result, depending on whether the signal is assumed to be stationary or nonstationary. The same results are then derived in the frequency domain. The resulting spectral matching formulation allows for the modeling of selected portions of a spectrum, for arbitrary spectral shaping in the frequency domain, and for the modeling of continuous as well as discrete spectra. This also leads to a discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of the least squares error criterion. A spectral interpretation is given to the normalized minimum prediction error. Applications of the normalized error are given, including the determination of an \"optimal\" number of poles. The use of linear prediction in data compression is reviewed. For purposes of transmission, particular attention is given to the quantization and encoding of the reflection (or partial correlation) coefficients. Finally, a brief introduction to pole-zero modeling is given."

One of the major reasons why speech models, based on Markov chains, have not been developed until recently was the lack of a method for optimizing the parameters of the Markov model to match observed signal patterns. Such a method was proposed in the late 1960's and was immediately applied to speech processing in several research institutions. Continued refinements in the theory and implementation of Markov modelling techniques have greatly enhanced the method, leading to a wide range of applications of these models. It is the purpose of this tutorial paper to give an introduction to the theory of Markov models, and to illustrate how they have been applied to problems in speech recognition."

Our first experiments with HMM based recognizers were restricted to a vocabulary of the ten digits. For this simple vocabulary we found that a high performance recognizer (word accuracy on the order of 97%) could be implemented, and that the performance was, for the most part, insensitive to parameters of both the Markov model and the vector quantizer. In this talk we extend our investigations to the recognition of isolated words from a medium size vocabulary, (129 words), as used in the Bell Laboratories airline reservation and information system. For this moderately complex vocabulary we have found that recognition accuracy is indeed a function of the HMM parameter (i.e., the number of states and the number of symbols in the vector quantizer). We have also found that a vector quantizer which uses energy information gives better performance than a conventional LPC shape vector quantizer of the same size (i.e., number of codebook entries)."

Included among these techniques are efficient and accurate speech modeling methods (e.g., vector quantization, hidden Markov models) and efficient, optimal network search procedures (i.e., level building). In this paper we show how to integrate these techniques to give a speaker-independent, syntax-directed, connected word recognition system which requires only a modest amount of computation, and whose performance is comparable to that of previous recognizers requiring an order of magnitude more computation. In particular, the recognizer we studied was an airlines information and reservation system using a 129 word vocabulary, and a deterministic syntax (grammar) with 144 states, 450 state transitions, and 21 final states, generating more than 6 \u00d7 109sentences. An evaluation of the system, using six talkers each speaking 51 test sentences, yielded a sentence accuracy of about 75 percent resulting from a word accuracy of about 93 percent, for an average speaking rate of about 210 words per minute."

It is further shown that the DTW/LP method is implicitly associated with a specific class of Markov models and is equivalent to the probability maximization procedures for Gaussian autoregressive multivariate probabilistic functions of the underlying Markov model. This unified view offers insights into the effectiveness of the probabilistic models in speech recognition applications."

The initial experiments with an HMM word recognizer were restricted to a vocabulary of 10 digits. For this simple vocabulary with dialed-up telephone recordings, we found that a high-performance, speaker-independent word recognizer could be implemented, and that the performance was, for the most part, insensitive to parameters of both the HMM and the VQ. In this paper we extend our investigations of the HMM recognizer to the recognition of isolated words from a medium-size vocabulary (129 words), as used in the AT&T Bell Laboratories airlines reservation and information system. For this moderately complex word vocabulary, we have found that recognition accuracy is indeed a function of the HMM parameters (i.e., the number of states in the model and the number of symbols per state). We have also found that a VQ that includes energy information gives better performance than a conventional VQ of the same size (i.e., same number of code-book entries)."

We have found that these undesirable spectral measurement variations can be controlled (i.e. reduced in the level of variation) through proper cepstral processing and that a statistical model can be established to predict the variances of the cepstral coefficient measurements. The findings lead to the use of a bandpass \"liftering\" process aimed at reducing the variability of the statistical components of spectral measurements. We have applied this liftering process to various speech recognition problems; in particular, vowel recognition and isolated word recognition. With the liftering process, we have been able to achieve an average digit error rate of 1%, which is about half of the previously reported best results, with dynamic time warping in a speaker-independent isolated digit test."

Instead of speaking normally during training, talkers use different, easily produced, talking styles. This technique was tested using a speech data base that included stress speech produced during a workload task and when intense noise was presented through earphones. A continuous-distribution talker-dependent Hidden Markov Model (HMM) recognizer was trained both normally (5 normally spoken tokens) and with multi-style training (one token each from normal, fast, clear, loud, and question-pitch talking styles). The average error rate under stress and normal conditions fell by more than a factor of two with multi-style training and the average error rate under conditions sampled during training fell by a factor of four."

Central to this progress has been the development and application of mathematical methods that permit modeling the speech signal as a complex code with several coexisting levels of structure. The most successful of these are \"template matching,\" stochastic modeling, and probabilistic parsing. The manifestation of common themes such as dynamic programming and finite-state descriptions accentuates a superficial likeness amongst the methods which is often mistaken for the deeper similarity arising from their shared Bayesian foundation. In this paper, we outline the mathematical bases of these methods, invariant metrics, hidden Markov chains, and formal grammars, respectively. We then recount and briefly interpret the results of experiments in speech recognition to which the various methods were applied. Since these mathematical principles seem to bear little resemblance to traditional linguistic characterizations of speech, the success of the experiments is occasionally attributed, even by their authors, merely to excellent engineering. We conclude by speculating that, quite to the contrary, these methods actually constitute a powerful theory of speech that can be reconciled with and elucidate conventional linguistic theories while being used to build truly competent mechanical speech recognizers."

We show that we can effectively increase the codebook size by dividing the feature vector into two vectors of lower dimensionality, and then quantizing and training each vector separately. For a small codebook size, integration of the results of the two parameter vectors provides significant improvement in recognition performance as compared to the quantizing and training of the entire feature set together. Even for a codebook size as small as 64, the results obtained when using the new quantization procedure are quite close to those obtained when using Gaussian distribution of the parameter vectors."

                "text": "This paper describes an experimental continuous speech recognition system comprising procedures for acoustic/phonetic classification, lexical access and sentence retrieval. Speech is assumed to be composed of a small number of phonetic units which may be identified with the states of a hidden Markov model. The acoustic correlates of the phonetic units are then characterized by the observable Gaussian process associated with the corresponding state of the underlying Markov chain. Once the parameters of such a model are determined, a phonetic transcription of an utterance can be obtained by means of a Viterbi-like algorithm. Given a lexicon in which each entry is orthographically represented in terms of the chosen phonetic units, a word lattice is produced by a lexical access procedure. Lexical items whose orthography matches subsequences of the phonetic transcription are sought by means of a hash coding technique and their likelihoods are computed directly from the corresponding interval of acoustic measurements. The recognition process is completed by recovering from the word lattice, the string of words of maximum likelihood conditioned on the measurements. The desired string is derived by a best-first search algorithm. In an experimental evaluation of the system, the parameters of an acoustic/phonetic model were estimated from fluent utterances of 37 seven-digit numbers. A digit recognition rate of 96% was then observed on an independent test set of 59 utterances of the same form from the same speaker. Half of the observed errors resulted from insertions while deletions and substitutions accounted equally for the other half."

The endpoint detection problem is fairly straightforward for high-level speech signals in low-level stationary noise environments (e.g., signal-to-noise ratios greater than 30-dB rms). However, this problem becomes considerably more difficult when either the speech signals are too low in level (relative to the background noise), or when the background noise becomes highly nonstationary. Such conditions are often encountered in the switched telephone network when the limitation on using local dialed-up lines is removed. In such cases the background noise is often highly variable in both level and spectral content because of transmission line characteristics, transients and tones from the line and/or from signal generators, etc. Conventional speech endpoint detectors have been shown to perform very poorly (on the order of 50-percent word detection) under these conditions. In this paper we present an improved word-detection algorithm, which can incorporate both vocabulary (syntactic) and task (semantic) information, leading to word-detection accuracies close to 100 percent for isolated digit detection over a wide range of telephone transmission conditions."

                "text": "One approach to large vocabulary speech recognition, is to build phonetic Markov models, and to concatenate them to obtain word models. In previous work, we already designed a recognizer based on 40 phonetic Markov machines, which accepts a 10,000 words vocabulary ([3]), and recently 200,000 words vocabulary ([5]). Since there is one machine per phoneme, these models obviously do not account for coarticulatory effects, which may lead to recognition errors. In this paper, we improve the phonetic models by using general principles about coarticulation effects on automatic phoneme recognition. We show that both the analysis of the errors made by the recognizer, and linguistic facts about phonetic context influence, suggest a method for choosing context dependent models. This method allows to limit the growing of the number of phonems, and still account for the most important coarticulation effects. We present our experiments with a system applying these principles to a set of models for French. With this new system including context-dependant machines, the phoneme recognition rate goes from 82.2% to 85.3%, and the error rate on words with a 10,000 word dictionary, is decreased from 11.2 to 9.8%."

We describe several algorithms used to recognize phonemes using context-dependent Hidden Markov Models of the phonemes. We present results for several variations of the parameters of the algorithms. In addition, we propose a technique that makes it possible to integrate traditional acoustic-phonetic features into a hidden Markov process. The categorical decisions usually associated with heuristic acoustic-phonetic algorithms are replaced by automated training techniques and global search strategies. The combination of general spectral information and specific acoustic-phonetic features is shown to result in more accurate phonetic recognition than either representation by itself."

The independent quantization of each signal value or parameter is termed scalar quantization, while the joint quantization of a block of parameters is termed block or vector quantization. This tutorial review presents the basic concepts employed in vector quantization and gives a realistic assessment of its benefits and costs when compared to scalar quantization. Vector quantization is presented as a process of redundancy removal that makes effective use of four interrelated properties of vector parameters: linear dependency (correlation), nonlinear dependency, shape of the probability density function (pdf), and vector dimensionality itself. In contrast, scalar quantization can utilize effectively only linear dependency and pdf shape. The basic concepts are illustrated by means of simple examples and the theoretical limits of vector quantizer performance are reviewed, based on results from rate-distortion theory. Practical issues relating to quantizer design, implementation, and performance in actual applications are explored. While many of the methods presented are quite general and can be used for the coding of arbitrary signals, this paper focuses primarily on the coding of speech signals and parameters."

LPC derived-cepstral coefficients are used to represent instantaneous spectral information and best linear fits of each cepstral coefficient over a specified time window are used to represent transitional information. An evaluation has been carried out using a data base of isolated digit utterances over dialed-up telephone lines by 10 talkers. Two vector quantization (VQ) codebooks, instantaneous and transitional, are constructed from training utterances for each speaker. The experimental results show that the instantaneous and transitional representations are relatively uncorrelated thus providing complementary information for speaker recognition. A rectangular window of approximately 100-150 ms duration provides an effective estimate of spectral transitions for speaker recognition. Also, simple transmission channel variations are shown to affect the instantaneous spectral representations and the corresponding recognition performance significantly, while the transitional representations and performance are relatively resistant."

In this paper we approach the problem from an information-theoretic point of view. We describe the overall structure of a linguistic statistical decoder (LSD) for the recognition of continuous speech. The input to the decoder is a string of phonetic symbols estimated by an acoustic processor (AP). For each phonetic string, the decoder finds the most likely input sentence. The decoder consists of four major subparts: 1) a statistical model of the language being recognized; 2) a phonemic dictionary and statistical phonological rules characterizing the speaker; 3) a phonetic matching algorithm that computes the similarity between phonetic strings, using the performance characteristics of the AP; 4) a word level search control. The details of each of the subparts and their interaction during the decoding process are discussed."

MLD proceeds in three steps:\\bulleta Syllable Match procedure uses an acoustic model to build a list of the most probable syllables that match the acoustic signal from a given time frame.\\bulletfrom this list, a Word Match procedure uses the dictionary to build partial word hypothesis.\\bulletthen a Sentence Match procedure uses a probabilistic language model to build partial sentence hypothesis until total sentences are found. An original matching algorithm is proposed for the Syllable Match procedure. This strategy is experimented on a dictation task of French texts. Two different dictionaries are tested,\\bulletone composed of the 10,000 most frequent words,\\bulletthe other composed of 200,000 words. The recognition results are given and compared. The error rate on words with 10,000 words is 17.3%. If the errors due to the lack of coverage are not counted, the error rate with 10,000 words is reduced to 10.6%. The error rate with 200,000 words is 12.7%."

Even the most ambitious connected-word recognition task is practical with today's integrated circuit technology, but extracting reliable, robust whole-word reference patterns still is difficult. In the past, connected-word recognizers relied on isolated-word reference patterns or patterns derived from a limited context (e.g., the middle digit from strings of three digits). These whole-word patterns were adequate for slow rates of articulated speech, but not for strings of words spoken at high rates (e.g., about 200 to 300 words per minute). To alleviate this difficulty, a segmental k-means training procedure was used to extract whole-word patterns from naturally spoken word strings. The segmented words are then used to create a set of word reference patterns for recognition. Recognition string accuracies were 98 to 99 percent for digits in variable length strings and 90 to 98 percent for sentences from an airline reservation task. These performance scores represent significant improvements over previous connected-word recognizers."

The system, designed for large vocabulary applications, integrates acoustic, phonetic, lexical, and linguistic knowledge sources to achieve high recognition performance. The basic approach, as described in previous papers [1, 2], makes extensive use of robust context-dependent models of phonetic coarticulation using Hidden Markov Models (HMM). We describe the components of the BYBLOS system, including: signal processing frontend, dictionary, phonetic model training system, word model generator, grammar and decoder. In recognition experiments, we demonstrate consistently high word recognition performance on continuous speech across: speakers, task domains, and grammars of varying complexity. In speaker-dependent mode, where 15 minutes of speech is required for training to a speaker, 98.5% word accuracy has been achieved in continuous speech for a 350-word task, using grammars with perplexity ranging from 30 to 60. With only 15 seconds of training speech we demonstrate performance of 97% using a grammar."

The measure is a statistically weighted distance measure with weights equal to the inverse variance of the cepstral coefficients. The experimental results show that the weighted cepstral distance measure works substantially better than both the Euclidean cepstral distance and the log likelihood ratio distance measures across two different data bases, namely a 10 digits and a 129 airline vocabulary words. The recognition accuracy obtained using the weighted cepstral distance measure was about 992 for digit recognition. This result was more than 3% higher than that obtained using the simple Euclidean cepstral distance measure and about 2% higher than the results using the log likelihood ratio distance measure. The most significant performance characteristic of the weighted cepstral distance was that it tended to equalize the performance of the recognizer across different talkers."

The system has recently been enhanced by expanding the vocabulary from 5,000 words to 20,000 words and by the addition of a speech workstation to support usability studies on document creation by voice. The system supports spelling and interactive personalization to augment the vocabularies. This paper describes the implementation, user interface, and comparative performance of the recognizer."
