However, successful content-based image retrieval systems require the integration of the two. There is an urgent need to develop integration mechanisms to link the image retrieval model to text retrieval model, such that the well established text retrieval techniques can be utilized. Approaches of converting image feature vectors (IF domain) to weighted-term vectors (IR domain) are proposed in this paper. Furthermore, the relevance feedback technique from the IR domain is used in content-based image retrieval to demonstrate the effectiveness of this conversion. Experimental results show that the image retrieval precision increases considerably by using the proposed integration approach."

To achieve content-based image indexing and retrieval, there are active research efforts in developing techniques to utilize visual features. On the other hand, without an effective indexing scheme, any visual content based image retrieval approach will lose its effectiveness as the number of features increases. This paper presents our initial work in developing an efficient indexing scheme using artificial neural network, which focuses on eliminating unlikely candidates rather than pin-pointing the targets directly. Experiment results in retrieving images using this scheme from a prototype visual database system are given."

The paper starts with discussing the working conditions of content-based retrieval: patterns of use, types of pictures, the role of semantics, and the sensory gap. Subsequent sections discuss computational steps for image retrieval systems. Step one of the review is image processing for retrieval sorted by color, texture, and local geometry. Features for retrieval are discussed next, sorted by: accumulative and global features, salient points, object and shape features, signs, and structural combinations thereof. Similarity of pictures and objects in pictures is reviewed for each of the feature types, in close connection to the types and means of feedback the user of the systems is capable of giving by interaction. We briefly discuss aspects of system engineering: databases, system architecture, and evaluation. In the concluding section, we present our view on: the driving force of the field, the heritage from computer vision, the influence on computer vision, the role of similarity and of interaction, the need for databases, the problem of evaluation, and the role of the semantic gap."

In this paper, we proposed a novel three-tier color index that supports efficient image retrieval by color contents which is important to certain applications, especially when shapes and semantic objects cannot be easily recognized. A prototype painting database system is designed and implemented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed indexing technique. Besides the color index, two other indexes, B+-trees for structured attributes and a signature file for free-text descriptions, were also implemented. As a result, a wide range of queries, both text-based and content-based can be processed efficiently. We also look at existing image database systems based on their query retrieval capabilities."

Towards this goal we propose a technique by which the color content of images and videos is automatically extracted to form a class of meta-data that is easily indexed. The color indexing algorithm uses the back- projection of binary color sets to extract color regions from images. This technique provides for both the automated extraction of regions and representation of their color content. It overcomes some of the problems with color histogram techniques such as high-dimensional feature vectors, spatial localization, indexing and distance computation. We present the binary color set back-projection technique and discuss its implementation in the VisualSEEk content- based image/video retrieval system for the World Wide Web. We also evaluate the retrieval effectiveness of the color set back-projection method and compare its performance to other color image retrieval methods."

The other keyword is the \"scene description keyword\", which is extracted by primitive parameters of color segments. We also propose the introduction of a \"transition probability\" to raise the retrieval accuracy (precision). Moreover, we evaluate the retrieval accuracy of this image database through a retrieval experiment using about 170 scenery images."

For each image, its color-spatial information is compactly captured by a set of color signatures and an image signature. During the image retrieval process, the color and image signatures of the query image and those of the database images are compared to determine the set of candidate images to be retrieved. In particular our similarity measure takes into account contributions of colors that are perceptually similar and the weightage on the object colors. To speed up the retrieval process, we also propose a filtering mechanism that employs a simple similarity measure to prune away irrelevant images quickly, before computing the more complex similarity measure on potential candidate images. We implemented the proposed method and conducted an experimental study on an image database consisting of 12,000 images. Our results show the retrieval effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed color-spatial approach."

The authors are building an image database in which images are indexed by both the numerical index keys generated automatically from the captured primitive image features using a set of rules, and traditional descriptive keywords entered by users when images are loaded. Users can either use the descriptive keywords or provide information regarding these image properties to query and retrieve images from the database. With this approach, the authors turn the difficult problem of image matching into image retrieval by index keys, which can be performed easily and rapidly using current database techniques. Initial experiments on the image database system show promising performance.<<ETX>>"

A 2D image signal is processed using a set of Gabor filters to derive a 120 component feature vector representing the image. The feature components are ordered based on the relative importance in characterizing a given texture pattern, and this facilitates the development of efficient indexing mechanisms. We propose three different sets of indexing features based on the best feature, the average feature and a combination of both. We investigate the tradeoff between accuracy and discriminating power using these different indexing approaches, and conclude that the combination of best feature and the average feature gives the best results."

This paper focuses on automatic extraction of low-level visual features such as texture, color, and shape. Continuing our prior work in compressed video manipulation, we also propose to explore the possibility of deriving visual features directly from the compressed domain, such as the DCT and wavelet transform domain. By stressing at the low-level features, we hope to achieve generic techniques applicable to general applications. By exploring the compressed-domain content extractability, we hope to reduce the computational complexity. We also propose a quad-tree based data structure to bind various signal features. Integrated feature maps are proposed to improve the overall effectiveness of the feature-based image query system. Current technical progress and system prototypes are also described. Part of the prototype work has been integrated into the Multimedia/VOD testbed in the Advanced Image Lab of Columbia University."

We present a novel image coding scheme which captures some of this locally correlated color information and improves the selectivity of the retrieval mechanism -- an important issue for very large databases. The technique uses a histogram of features which represent frequently occurring local combinations color tuples occurring throughout the image. It outperforms straight color histogram matching.

Many visual feature representations have been explored and many systems built. While these research efforts establish the basis of CBIR, the usefulness of the proposed approaches is limited. Specifically, these efforts have relatively ignored two distinct characteristics of CBIR systems: (1) the gap between high-level concepts and low-level features, and (2) the subjectivity of human perception of visual content. This paper proposes a relevance feedback based interactive retrieval approach, which effectively takes into account the above two characteristics in CBIR. During the retrieval process, the user's high-level query and perception subjectivity are captured by dynamically updated weights based on the user's feedback. The experimental results over more than 70000 images show that the proposed approach greatly reduces the user's effort of composing a query, and captures the user's information need more precisely."

In this paper, we present a new image representation which provides a transformation from the raw pixel data to a small set of localized coherent regions in color and texture space. This so-called &ldquo;blobworld&rdquo; representation is based on segmentation using the expectation-maximization algorithm on combined color and texture features. The texture features we use for the segmentation arise from a new approach to texture description and scale selection. We describe a system that uses the blobworld representation to retrieve images. An important and unique aspect of the system is that, in the context of similarity-based querying, the user is allowed to view the internal representation of the submitted image and the query results. Similar systems do not offer the user this view into the workings of the system; consequently, the outcome of many queries on these systems can be quite inexplicable, despite the availability of knobs for adjusting the similarity metric"

While these approaches establish the viability of MIR based on visual features, techniques for incorporating human expertise directly during the query process to improve retrieval performance have not drawn enough attention. To address this limitation, this paper introduces a human-computer interaction based approach to MIR in which the user guides the system during retrieval using relevance feedback.

Specifically, our research group has developed an automatic indexing system for captioned pictures of people; the indexing information and other textual information is subsequently used in a content-based image retrieval system. Our approach presents an alternative to traditional face identification systems; it goes beyond a superficial combination of existing text-based and image-based approaches to information retrieval. By understanding the caption accompanying a picture, we can extract information that is useful both for retrieving the picture and for identifying the faces shown. In designing a pictorial database system, two major issues are (1) the amount and type of processing required when inserting new pictures into the database and (2) efficient retrieval schemes for query processing. Our research has focused on developing a computational model for understanding pictures based on accompanying descriptive text. Understanding a picture can be informally defined as the process of identifying relevant people and objects. Several current vision systems employ the idea of top-down control in picture understanding. We carry the notion of top-down control one step further, exploiting not only general context but also picture-specific context. >"

We present here an implementation of NeTra, a prototype image retrieval system that uses color, texture, shape and spatial location information in segmented image regions to search and retrieve similar regions from the database. A distinguishing aspect of this system is its incorporation of a robust automated image segmentation algorithm that allows object- or region-based search. Image segmentation significantly improves the quality of image retrieval when images contain multiple complex objects. Images are segmented into homogeneous regions at the time of ingest into the database, and image attributes that represent each of these regions are computed. In addition to image segmentation, other important components of the system include an efficient color representation, and indexing of color, texture, and shape features for fast search and retrieval. This representation allows the user to compose interesting queries such as \u201cretrieve all images that contain regions that have the color of object A, texture of object B, shape of object C, and lie in the upper of the image\u201d, where the individual objects could be regions belonging to different images. A Java-based web implementation of NeTra is available at http://vivaldi.ece.ucsb.edu/Netra."

In this paper, we concentrate on the retrieval subsystem of MARS and its support for content-based queries over image databases. Content-based retrieval techniques have been extensively studied for textual documents in the area of automatic information retrieval [24, 21. This paper describes how these techniques can be adapted for ranked retried over image databases. Specifically, we discuss the ranking and retrieval algorithms developed in MARS based on the Boolean retrievaI model and describe the results of our experiments that demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed model for image retrieval."

Most of this data is multimedia in nature, including digital images, video, audio and simple text data. To make use of this vast amount of multimedia data, we need to develop techniques to e ciently retrieve information over large multimedia repositories based on their content. Due to the di culty in capturing the content of multimedia objects using textual annotations and the non-scalability of the approach to large data sets (due to a high degree of manual e ort required in de ning the annotations), the approach based on supporting content-based retrieval over visual features has become a promising research direction. This is evidenced by several prototypes[15, 8, 6, 4] and commercial systems[3, 2] that have been built recently."

This approach identifies the regions within images that contain colors from predetermined color sets. By searching over a large number of color sets, a color index for the database is created in a fashion similar to that for file inversion. This allows very fast indexing of the image collection by the color contents of the images. Furthermore, information about the identified regions, such as the color set, size, and location, enables a rich variety of queries that specify both color content and spatial relationships of regions. We present the single color extraction and indexing method and contrast it to other color approaches. We examine single and multiple color extraction and image query on a database of 3000 color images."

The binary feature sets provide an effective and easily indexable representation of color and texture. We also provide a mechanism for integrating features by combining the binary color and texture feature sets. This enables the extraction and representation of joint color and texture regions. Since all extracted regions are spatially localized, in image database queries the user can specify the locations and spatial boundaries of regions.

Most visual materials in visual information systems are stored in some compressed forms. Therefore, it is desirable to explore image technologies for feature extraction and image manipulation in the compressed domain. In other words, image feature extraction and manipulation are performed on compressed images/video without decoding, or with minimal decoding only. Although the compressed-domain approach imposes many constraints, it provides great potential for reducing computational complexity, because of reduction of the amount of data after compression. This paper provides an overview of our research in this area.

A Gabor feature representation for textured images is proposed, and its performance in pattern retrieval is evaluated on a large texture image database. These features compare favorably with other existing texture representations. A simple hybrid neural network algorithm is used to learn the similarity by simple clustering in the texture feature space. With learning similarity the performance of similar pattern retrieval improves significantly. An important aspect of this work is its application to real image data. Texture feature extraction with similarity learning is used to search through large aerial photographs. Feature clustering enables efficient search of the database as our experimental results indicate."

Examples of the content we use include color, texture, and shape of image objects and regions. Potential applications include medical (\\Give me other images that contain a tumor with a texture like this one\"), photo-journalism (\\Give me images that have blue at the top and red at the bottom\"), and many others in art, fashion, cataloging, retailing, and industry. We describe a set of novel features and similarity measures allowing query by color, texture, and shape of image object. We demonstrate the e ectiveness of the QBIC system with normalized precision and recall experiments on test databases containing over 1000 images and 1000 objects populated from commercially available photo clip art images, and of images of airplane silhouettes. We also consider the e cient indexing of these features, speci cally addressing two problems: (a) for our feature vectors, the desired distance function is not Euclidean, and/or (b) the vectors have high dimensionality. We propose novel, general solutions to both problems by allowing some \\false alarms\" (\\false hits\", or \\false positives\") but no false dismissals. For the rst problem, we introduce a new theorem that makes indexing possible by bounding the non-Euclidean, full cross-term quadratic distance expression with a simple Euclidean distance. For the second, we illustrate how orthogonal transforms, such as the Karhunen Loeve transform, can help reduce the dimensionality, without introducing false dismissals. The resulting QBIC system o ers high quality of output, and signi cant speedup over straightforward indexing alternatives. The system is implemented in X/Motif and C running on an RS/6000.

We provide an overview of the work in computational geometry on this problem and highlight the results we found are most useful in practice, including the use of approximate nearest neighbor algorithms. We also present a variant of the optimized k-d tree we call the VAM k-d tree, and provide algorithms to create an optimized R-tree we call the VAMSplit R-tree. We found that the VAMSplit R-tree provided better overall performance than all competing structures we tested for main memory and secondary memory applications. We observed large improvements in performance relative to the R*-tree and SS-tree in secondary memory applications, and modest improvements relative to optimized k-d tree variants."

We propose a new approach for automated content extraction that allows for efficient database searching using texture features. The algorithm automatically extracts texture regions from image spatial-frequency data which are represented by binary texture feature vectors. We demonstrate that the binary texture features provide excellent performance in image query response time while providing highly effective texture discriminability, accuracy in spatial localization and capability for extraction from compressed data representations. We present the binary texture feature extraction and indexing technique and examine searching by texture on a database of 500 images."

New visual information in the form of images, graphics, animations and videos is being published on the Web at an incredible rate. However, cataloging this visual data is beyond the capabilities of current text-based Web search engines. In this paper, we describe a complete system by which visual information on the Web is (1) collected by automated agents, (2) processed in both text and visual feature domains, (3) catalogued and (4) indexed for fast search and retrieval. We introduce an image and video search engine which utilizes both text-based navigation and content-based technology for searching visually through the catalogued images and videos. Finally, we provide an initial evaluation based upon the cataloging of over one half million images and videos collected from the Web."

Systems are beginning to emerge in both the research and commercial sectors based on 'content-based' image retrieval, a technique which explicitly manages image assets by directly representing their visual attributes. The Virage image search engine provides an open framework for building such systems. The Virage engine expresses visual features as image 'primitives.' Primitives can be very general (such as color, shape, or texture) or quite domain specific (face recognition, cancer cell detection, etc.). The basic philosophy underlying this architecture is a transformation from the data-rich representation of explicit image pixels to a compact, semantic-rich representation of visually salient characteristics. In practice, the design of such primitives is non-trivial, and is driven by a number of conflicting real-world constraints (e.g. computation time vs. accuracy). The virage engine provides an open framework for developers to 'plug-in' primitives to solve specific image management problems. The architecture has been designed to support both static images and video in a unified paradigm. The infrastructure provided by the Virage engine can be utilized to address high-level problems as well, such as automatic, unsupervised keyword assignment, or image classification."

Examples of the content we use include color, texture, and shape of image objects and regions. Potential applications include medical (`Give me other images that contain a tumor with a texture like this one'), photo-journalism (`Give me images that have blue at the top and red at the bottom'), and many others in art, fashion, cataloging, retailing, and industry. Key issues include derivation and computation of attributes of images and objects that provide useful query functionality, retrieval methods based on similarity as opposed to exact match, query by image example or user drawn image, the user interfaces, query refinement and navigation, high dimensional database indexing, and automatic and semi-automatic database population. We currently have a prototype system written in X/Motif and C running on an RS/6000 that allows a variety of queries, and a test database of over 1000 images and 1000 objects populated from commercially available photo clip art images. In this paper we present the main algorithms for color texture, shape and sketch query that we use, show example query results, and discuss future directions."

We present an approach that integrates a relational database retrieval system with a color analysis technique. The Chabot project was initiated at our university to study storage and retrieval of a vast collection of digitized images. These images are from the State of California Department of Water Resources. The goal was to integrate a relational database retrieval system with content analysis techniques that would give our querying system a better method for handling images. Our simple color analysis method, if used in conjunction with other search criteria, improves our ability to retrieve images efficiently. The best result is obtained when text-based search criteria are combined with content-based criteria and when a coarse granularity is used for content analysis. >"

VisualSEEk is distinct from other content-based image query systems in that the user may query for images using both the visual properties of regions and their spatial layout. Furthermore, the image analysis for region extraction is fully automated. VisualSEEk uses a novel system for region extraction and representation based upon color sets. Through a process of color set back-projection, the system automatically extracts salient color regions from images. This paper describes the implementation of the color query system and examines its role for content-based visual query in image and video databases. The next phases of the VisualSEEk implementation will provide additional tools for querying by texture, shape, embedded text and motion features."

This makes indexing difficult since most existing multi-dimensional indexing structures grow exponentially in size as dimensions increase. We approach this problem in three stages: (1) reduce the dimensionality of the feature space, (2) evaluate existing multi-dimensional indexing structures to determine which one can best organize the reduced feature space, and (3) customize the selected structure to improve search performance. To reduce the dimensionality of the feature space without losing much information we apply a statistical technique called principal component analysis (PCA), using Turk and Pentland's eigenimages approach. We then conduct a comparative analysis of a wide range of existing multi-dimensional indexing structures, selecting and implementing three of them (bucket adaptive KD-tree, gridfile, R- tree) for further empirical comparisons. Tests show that the adaptive KD-tree uses the least storage and performs the best during search. Finally, we customize the bucket adaptive KD- tree by implementing techniques that take advantage of the characteristics of the transformed space -- namely, ranked dimensions by decreasing variance, and known dynamic ranges. This prunes the search space and results in very efficient searches. The number of page accesses are reduced significantly, sometimes leading to savings as high as 70%."

We propose an approach that lies between uniformly tesselating the images with rectangular regions and relying on fully segmented images. For each image we define 5 partially overlapping, fuzzy regions. From each region in the image we extract the first three moments of the color distribution and store them in the index. The feature vectors in the index are relatively insensitive to small translations and small rotations of an image because they are extracted from fuzzy regions. To retrieve images we define a function which measures the similarity of two color feature vectors. Invariance of retrieval results with respect to the typical image rotations of 90 degrees around the center of the image is guaranteed because our feature similarity function exploits the spatial arrangement of the 5 image regions. We present experimental results using an image database which contains more than 11,000 color images. Our experiments demonstrate clearly that our weak encoding of spatial information significantly increases the discrimination power of the index compared to plain color indexing techniques."

The query image may be a hand-drawn sketch or a (potentially low-quality) scan of the image to be retrieved. Our searching algorithm makes use of multiresolution wavelet decompositions of the query and database images. The coefficients of these decompositions are distilled into small \u201csignatures\u201d for each image. We introduce an \u201cimage querying metric\u201d that operates on these signatures. This metric essentially compares how many significant wavelet coefficients the query has in common with potential targets. The metric includes parameters that can be tuned, using a statistical analysis, to accommodate the kinds of image distortions found in different types of image queries. The resulting algorithm is simple, requires very little storage overhead for the database of signatures, and is fast enough to be performed on a database of 20,000 images at interactive rates (on standard desktop machines) as a query is sketched. Our experiments with hundreds of queries in databases of 1000 and 20,000 images show dramatic improvement, in both speed and success rate, over using a conventional L1, L2, or color histogram norm.

The salient components of this system include texture feature extraction, image segmentation and grouping, learning similarity measure, and a texture thesaurus model for fast search and indexing. The texture features are computed by filtering the image with a bank of Gabor filters. This is followed by texture flow computation to segment each large airphoto into homogeneous regions. A hybrid neural network algorithm is used to learn the visual similarity by clustering patterns in the feature space. With learning similarity, the retrieval performance improves significantly. Finally, a texture image thesaurus is created by combining the learning similarity algorithm and a hierarchical vector quantiza-tion scheme. This thesaurus facilitates the indexing process while maintaining a good retrieval performance. Experimental results demonstrate the robustness of the overall system in searching over a large collection of airphotos and in selecting a surprisingly diverse collection of geographic features such as housing developments, parking lots, highways, and airports."

Most current image database systems that perform query by content require a distance computation for each image in the database. Distance computations can be time consuming, limiting the usability of such systems. There is thus a need for indexing systems and algorithms that can eliminate candidate images without performing distance calculations. As user needs may change from session to session, there is also a need for run-time creation of distance measures. In this paper, we introduce FIDS, or `Flexible Image Database System.' FIDS allows the user to query the database based on user-defined polynomial combinations of predefined distance measures. Using an indexing scheme and algorithms based on the triangle inequality, FIDS can return matches to the query image without directly comparing the query images to much of the database. FIDS is currently being tested on a database of eighteen hundred images."

In applications such as database retrieval, it is important that image features used in pattern comparison provide good measures of image perceptual similarities. We present an image model with a new set of features that address the challenge of perceptual similarity. The model is based on the 2D Wold decomposition of homogeneous random fields. The three resulting mutually orthogonal subfields have perceptual properties which can be described as \"periodicity,\" \"directionality,\" and \"randomness,\" approximating what are indicated to be the three most important dimensions of human texture perception. The method presented improves upon earlier Wold-based models in its tolerance to a variety of local inhomogeneities which arise in natural textures and its invariance under image transformation such as rotation. An image retrieval algorithm based on the new texture model is presented. Different types of image features are aggregated for similarity comparison by using a Bayesian probabilistic approach. The, effectiveness of the Wold model at retrieving perceptually similar natural textures is demonstrated in comparison to that of two other well-known pattern recognition methods. The Wold model appears to offer a perceptually more satisfying measure of pattern similarity while exceeding the performance of these other methods by traditional pattern recognition criteria. Examples of natural scene Wold texture modeling are also presented."

One important goal in CBRS is to extract local low level image features such as color, texture and shape, to allow queries based on these features. A large CBRS containing tens of thousands of images requires an automatic feature-extraction method since human aided segmentation is impractical. We address this problem in a particular application setting by using an attraction-based grouping method in spatial-color-texture space. The attraction concept makes this approach similar to human aided segmentation. Experimental results show that the method is reasonably better than existing methods, and has the potential to be used in other CBRS-related applications."

Most color-based image retrieval systems adopt color histograms as the feature of color content. One of the most important steps in these systems is to reduce histogram dimensions with the least loss in color content. A good clustering technique is vital for this purpose. This paper examines the color conservation property by applying different clustering techniques in perceptually uniform color spaces and different images. For studying color spaces, the perceptual uniform spaces, such as Mathematical Transformation to Munsell system (MTM) and C.I.E. L*a*b*, are investigated. For evaluating clustering techniques, the equalized quantization approach, the hierarchical clustering approach, and the Color-Naming-System (CNS) supervised clustering approach are studied. For analyzing color loss, the error bound, the quantized error in color space conversion, and the average quantized error of 400 color images are explored. An image retrieval application based on color content is shown to demonstrate the difference in applying these clustering techniques. These simulation results suggest that good clustering techniques usually lead to more effective retrieval."

To gather images expediently, the image collection subsystem utilizes a distributed fleet of WWW robots running on different computers. The image robots gather information about the images they find, computing the appropriate image decompositions and indices, and store this extracted information in vector form for searches based on image content. At search time, users can iteratively guide the search through the selection of relevant examples. Search performance is made efficient through the use of an approximate, optimized k-d tree algorithm.

Finding the desired search engines and learning how to use them, however, can be very time consuming. The integration of such search tools enables the users to access information across the world in a transparent and efficient manner. These systems are called meta-search engines. The recent emergence of visual information retrieval (VIR) search engines on the web is leading to the same efficiency problem. This paper describes and evaluates MetaSEEk, a content-based meta-search engine used for finding images on the Web based on their visual information. MetaSEEk is designed to intelligently select and interface with multiple on-line image search engines by ranking their performance for different classes of user queries. User feedback is also integrated in the ranking refinement. We compare MetaSEEk with a base line version of meta-search engine, which does not use the past performance of the different search engines in recommending target search engines for future queries."

The main image representations we deal with are fractal image coding and wavelet transform coding. The experiments we conducted in this research demonstrate the effectiveness of our approaches. \nWe first investigate the image representation through fractal image coding, which exploits self-similarity within an image. We build an image data model called nona-tree to facilitate image retrieval based on matching of fractal codes between the query image and database images. It ensures a query can be carried out to retrieve images based on the query image not only as a whole example image, but also as a subimage. \nWe then extend the work of fractal coding to joint fractal coding, a technique which can be utilized to explore similarities between images. An effective similarity metric has been set up for measuring degree of similarity between the query image and a database image. Joint fractal coding is proved to be a powerful clustering approach for large image databases. We believe that the clustering of images into categories on the basis of content is a prerequisite to the effective and efficient execution of such queries. Once the query is narrowed to a specific category, image retrieval can then proceed efficiently. \nWe also describe the implementation of an image retrieval approach based on measuring the feature vectors constructed by subband energies obtained from wavelet transform. We compare the effectiveness of image retrieval from the fractal coding approach and the wavelet approach. \nFinally we describe the design and implementation of ImageSeek, a Graphical User Interface developed by X Windows/Motif widget sets, for interactively performing image retrieval. We demonstrate the functions we have for the interface, and discuss future integration into a more comprehensive multimedia retrieving tool. \nThe results presented in this dissertation collectively offer a viable and practical approach to the design and implementation of effective image clustering and image retrieval in a large image database environment. We believe that the research conducted is well suited for incorporation into many digital library applications to support effective and efficient visual data retrieval."

How, then, can it be possible to build a tool for indexing into a large database of, say, thousands of images, which works effectively in `interactive time' on affordable hardware? One important optimization is to take advantage of interaction with the user to find out what types of variation are expected in the database, and to rely on the user to discriminate between similar-looking objects. Another is to create appropriate data structures off-line to speed on-line searches. We are building a tool, called FINDIT, for locating the image of an object from within a large number of images of scenes which may contain the object. The user outlines an object in an image that he wants to find in the database, and specifies the constraints on the transformations of the object that are expected to occur. The program acts as a filter to quickly reduce the possible number of candidates to a number small enough to be perused by the user. FINDIT chooses an appropriate search algorithm depending on the selection of constraints by the user."

In the index we store the cumulative color histograms. The L1-, L2-, L(infinity )-distance between two cumulative color histograms can be used to define a similarity measure of these two color distributions. We show that this method produces slightly better results than color histogram methods, but it is significantly more robust with respect to the quantization parameter of the histograms. The second technique is an example of a new approach to color indexing. Instead of storing the complete color distributions, the index contains only their dominant features. We implement this approach by storing the first three moments of each color channel of an image in the index, i.e., for a HSV image we store only 9 floating point numbers per image. The similarity function which is used for the retrieval is a weighted sum of the absolute differences between corresponding moments. Our tests clearly demonstrate that a retrieval based on this technique produces better results and runs faster than the histogram-based methods."

Using binary Bayesian classifiers, we attempt to capture high-level concepts from low-level image features under the constraint that the test image does belong to one of the classes. Specifically, we consider the hierarchical classification of vacation images; at the highest level, images are classified as indoor or outdoor; outdoor images are further classified as city or landscape; finally, a subset of landscape images is classified into sunset, forest, and mountain classes. We demonstrate that a small vector quantizer (whose optimal size is selected using a modified MDL criterion) can be used to model the class-conditional densities of the features, required by the Bayesian methodology. The classifiers have been designed and evaluated on a database of 6931 vacation photographs. Our system achieved a classification accuracy of 90.5% for indoor/outdoor, 95.3% for city/landscape, 96.6% for sunset/forest and mountain, and 96% for forest/mountain classification problems. We further develop a learning method to incrementally train the classifiers as additional data become available. We also show preliminary results for feature reduction using clustering techniques. Our goal is to combine multiple two-class classifiers into a single hierarchical classifier."

                "text": "A very promising idea for fast searching in traditional and multimedia databases is to map objects into points in k-d space, using k feature-extraction functions, provided by a domain expert [25]. Thus, we can subsequently use highly fine-tuned spatial access methods (SAMs), to answer several types of queries, including the 'Query By Example' type (which translates to a range query); the 'all pairs' query (which translates to a spatial join [8]); the nearest-neighbor or best-match query, etc.However, designing feature extraction functions can be hard. It is relatively easier for a domain expert to assess the similarity/distance of two objects. Given only the distance information though, it is not obvious how to map objects into points.This is exactly the topic of this paper. We describe a fast algorithm to map objects into points in some k-dimensional space (k is user-defined), such that the dis-similarities are preserved. There are two benefits from this mapping: (a) efficient retrieval, in conjunction with a SAM, as discussed before and (b) visualization and data-mining: the objects can now be plotted as points in 2-d or 3-d space, revealing potential clusters, correlations among attributes and other regularities that data-mining is looking for.We introduce an older method from pattern recognition, namely, Multi-Dimensional Scaling (MDS) [51]; although unsuitable for indexing, we use it as yardstick for our method. Then, we propose a much faster algorithm to solve the problem in hand, while in addition it allows for indexing. Experiments on real and synthetic data indeed show that the proposed algorithm is significantly faster than MDS, (being linear, as opposed to quadratic, on the database size N), while it manages to preserve distances and the overall structure of the data-set."

However, a histogram is a coarse characterization of an image, and so images with very different appearances can have similar histograms. We describe a technique for comparing images called histogram refinement, which imposes additional constraints on histogram based matching. Histogram refinement splits the pixels in a given bucket into several classes, based upon some local property. Within a given bucket, only pixels in the same class are compared. We describe a split histogram called a color coherence vector (CCV), which partitions each histogram bucket based on spatial coherence. CCVs can be computed at over 5 images per second on a standard workstation. A database with 15,000 images can be queried using CCVs in under 2 seconds. We demonstrate that histogram refinement can be used to distinguish images whose color histograms are indistinguishable."

We propose a model called incremental clustering which is based on a careful analysis of the requirements of the information retrieval application, and which should also be useful in other applications. The goal is to efficiently maintain clusters of small diameter as new points are inserted. We analyze several natural greedy algorithms and demonstrate that they perform poorly. We propose new deterministic and randomized incremental clustering algorithms which have a provably good performance, and which we believe should also perform well in practice. We complement our positive results with lower bounds on the performance of incremental algorithms. Finally, we consider the dual clustering problem where the clusters are of fixed diameter, and the goal is to minimize the number of clusters."

Once the boundaries of an object are known, it is possible to extract any number of features to be used for subsequent search or retrieval based on image content. The technique combines manual inputs from the user with machine inputs, generated from edge detection algorithms, for assisting in the extraction of the boundaries. This allows for the quick extraction of boundaries by combining the capabilities of the user and the computer. The user is adept at quickly locating an object of interest and at drawing a very rough outline of the object. The computer is adept at quickly making a large number of calculations that refine the rough outline generated by the user. The performance of the technique was tested using both computer simulations and real images. The performance of the technique degrades gracefully in the presence of noise."

The technique is based on the morphological operations of opening and closing. The original computer implementation was designed to find star boundaries in optical astronomical images, where the background is dark and stars, the brightest objects, are uniform or increase in intensity toward their centers. For infrared ocean images, the aim is to find fronts and associated rings; for magnetograms, the aim is to find sunspots, magnetically active regions of the solar surface. Rings, fronts, and sunspots are not very star-like. Hence these images must be pre-processed before applying the method. The edges found from images processed with the algorithm are useful as inputs to other processing, e.g. in automated tracking of ocean features."

The authors show that with this relatively simple feature set, effective texture discrimination can be achieved. In the paper, subband-energy feature sets extracted from the following typical image decompositions are compared: wavelet subband, uniform subband, discrete cosine transform (DCT), and spatial partitioning. The authors report that over 90% correct classification was attained using the feature set in classifying the full Brodatz [1965] collection of 112 textures. Furthermore, the subband energy-based feature set can be readily applied to a system for indexing images by texture content in image databases, since the features can be extracted directly from spatial-frequency decomposed image data. The authors also show that to construct a suitable space for discrimination, Fisher discrimination analysis (Dillon and Goldstein, 1984) can be used to compact the original features into a set of uncorrelated linear discriminant functions. This procedure makes it easier to perform texture-based searches in a database by reducing the dimensionality of the discriminant space. The authors also examine the effects of varying training class size, the number of training classes, the dimension of the discriminant space and number of energy measures used for classification. The authors hope that the performance for texture discrimination of these simple energy-based features will allow images in a database to be efficiently and effectively indexed by contents of their textured regions.<<ETX>>"

These include face recognition, video coding, pose estimation, etc. However, the vision research community has largely overlooked parallel developments in signal processing and numerical linear algebra concerning efficient eigenspace updating algorithms. These new developments are significant for two reasons: adopting them makes some of the current vision algorithms more robust and efficient. More important is the fact that incremental updating of eigenspace representations opens up new and interesting research applications in vision such as active recognition and learning. The main objective of the paper is to put these in perspective and discuss a recently introduced updating scheme that has been shown to be numerically stable and optimal. We provide an example of one particular application to 3D object representation projections and give an error analysis of the algorithm. Preliminary experimental results are shown."

Most present systems place the burden of combination on the user, e.g. the user specifies 50% texture features, 20% color features, etc. This is a problem since most users do not know how to best pick the settings for the given data and search problem. The paper addresses this problem, describing research in progress for a system that: (1) automatically infers which combination of models best represents the data of interest to the user; and (2) learns continuously during interaction with each user. In particular, these two components-inference and learning-provide a solution that adapts to the subjective and hard to predict behaviors frequently seen when people query or browse image libraries."

A relational query language, Query by Pictorial Example (QPE) is introduced for manipulating queries regarding spatial relations as well as conventional queries.

This paper describes some easily computable textural features based on gray-tone spatial dependancies, and illustrates their application in category-identification tasks of three different kinds of image data: photomicrographs of five kinds of sandstones, 1:20 000 panchromatic aerial photographs of eight land-use categories, and Earth Resources Technology Satellite (ERTS) multispecial imagery containing seven land-use categories. We use two kinds of decision rules: one for which the decision regions are convex polyhedra (a piecewise linear decision rule), and one for which the decision regions are rectangular parallelpipeds (a min-max decision rule). In each experiment the data set was divided into two parts, a training set and a test set. Test set identification accuracy is 89 percent for the photomicrographs, 82 percent for the aerial photographic imagery, and 83 percent for the satellite imagery. These results indicate that the easily computable textural features probably have a general applicability for a wide variety of image-classification applications."

Retrieval efficiency is increased by using indexing trees such as kd-trees, quadtrees or R*-trees. However, such trees are usually constructed without reference to the similarity measure, and in practice their performance degrades when the threshold on the similarity value increases beyond zero. This phenomenon is analyzed in this paper with a probabilistic model, and an expression is obtained for the average computation in the tree. Based on this analysis, a greedy algorithm is proposed which adapts the tree by eliminating inefficient nodes. The greedy algorithm is based on a &ldquo;Markovian&rdquo; property of indexing trees. The algorithm is iterative and is guaranteed to improve the performance of the tree with every iteration. Experimental evaluation of the performance of adapted trees for randomly distributed data is reported. The experiments indicate that the performance of the tree improves significantly after adaptation"

In this paper we discuss a system which uses agents to search distributed multimedia databases over the world wide web. Operational goals of the system include the following: accessibility by anyone with a World Wide Web connection; low Response time; and usable by non-artists. Toward these ends, we developed the ImageScape system (http://ind134a.wi.leidenuniv.nl:2001) which includes MPEG based methods for compressing large image databases, optimal agents for analysis and downloading based on utility of the site information, and information theoretic techniques for sketch and representative image icon matching."

We propose a simple, quantifiable measure of an image retrieval system's effectiveness, \"target testing\", in which effectiveness is measured as the average number of images that a user must examine in searching for a given random target. We describe an initial version of PicHunter, a retrieval system designed to test a novel approach to relevance-feedback. This approach is based on a Bayesian framework that incorporates an explicit model of the user's selection process. PicHunter is intentionally designed to have a minimal, \"queryless\" user interface, so that its performance reflects only the performance of the relevance feedback algorithm. The algorithm, however, can easily be incorporated into more traditional, query-based systems. Employing no explicit query, and only a small amount of image processing, PicHunter is able to locate randomly selected targets in a database of 4522 images after displaying an average of only 55 groups of 4 images. This is more than 10 times better than random chance."

To accomplish this, PicHunter uses Bayesian learning based on a probabilistic model of a user's behavior. The predictions of this model are combined with the selections made during a search to estimate the probability associated with each image. These probabilities are then used to select images for display. Details of our model of a user's behavior were tuned using an off-line leaning algorithm. For clarity, our studies were done with the simplest possible user interface but the algorithm can easily be incorporated into systems which support complex queries, including most previously proposed systems. However, even with this constraint and simple image features, PicHunter is able to locate randomly selected targets in a database of 4522 images after displaying an average of only 55 groups of 4 images which is over 10 times better than chance. We therefore expect that the performance of current image database retrieval systems can be improved by incorporation of the techniques described here."

Algorithms for searching, updating, initial packing and reorganization of the structure are discussed in detail. Finally, we provide analytical results indicating that R+-trees achieve up to 50% savings in disk accesses compared to an R-tree when searching files of thousands of rectangles."

First, the fuzzy entropy function is computed based on fuzzy region width and the Shannon's function of the image. Then all of the local entropy maxima are located in order to find the optimal partition for image segmentation scene local entropy maxima corresponding to the uncertainties among various regions in the image. This algorithm is very effective for the images whose histograms have no clear peaks and valleys, or the number of the segmentation classes is unknown, or the probabilistic model of the image and the different segmentation classes are unknown. A large number of experiments have been carried out on different kinds of images. Good performances of the proposed algorithm have been achieved."

Moreover, the theme changes as the user browses through data, so that ultimately it cannot be characterized by a static learning system but must be learned continuO-usly. The earliest systems designed for multimedia retrieval [Furht et al. 19951. and those that havebecome comme~cially available, either ignore subjectivity and use fixed algorithms or require the user to adjust parameters. For example, in user-adaptive systems, before making a query, the user specifies what percent of the query is color and which colors, what percent is texture or shape and which textures or shapes, and so on. The human is stuck with the task of transcoding the theme in his or her head into a set of slider and control knob positions. Consequently, for years I have advocated the importance of finding models of images and sounds that have \u201csemantic control knobs.\u201d For example, the Weld model for retrieving perceptually similar visual patterns has knobs corresponding to periodicity, directionality, and randomness [Liu and Picard 1995]. However, rarely can models with semantic control knobs be found. Even when they exist, it is an effort to know how to set them optimally. Moreover, usually a person does not make a single query, but a succession of queries, with slight variations each time. Therefore, she or he needs to know not only how to set the knobs when initiating a query session, but also how to acljust them with each new query. What I have described is the current trend in content-based retrieval and annotation systems, and it needs to change. The system must recognize that the users\u2019 goals evolve while they browse; subjectivity, mood dependence, and fickleness are to be expected. Furthermore, a system that tracks the evolving goals of a subjective human will also be helpful for the difficult but common query sessions best described as, \u201cI\u2019ll know it when I see it.\u201d"

However, color histograms lack spatial information, so images with very different appearances can have similar histograms. For example, a picture of fall foliage might contain a large number of scattered red pixels; this could have a similar color histogram to a picture with a single large red object. We describe a histogram-based method for comparing images that incorporates spatial information. We classify each pixel in a given color bucket as either coherent or incoherent, based on whether or not it is part of a large similarly-colored region. A color coherence vector (CCV) stores the number of coherent versus incoherent pixels with each color. By separating coherent pixels from incoherent pixels, CCV\u2019s provide finer distinctions than color histograms. CCV\u2019s can be computed at over 5 images per second on a standard workstation. A database with 15,000 images can be queried for the images with the most similar CCV\u2019s in under 2 seconds. We show that CCV\u2019s can give superior results to color his\u2217To whom correspondence should be addressed tograms for image retrieval."

                "text": "One of the most important technologies needed across many traditional and emerging applications is the management of visual information. Every day we are bombarded with information presented in the form of images. So important are images in our world of information technology, that we generate literally millions of images every day, and this number keeps escalating with advances in imaging, visualization, video, and computing technologies. Advances in video technology and its marriage with computing are resulting in the video-computing discipline. High Performance Computing and Communications (HPCC ) is emerging as a key technology for asserting international leadership in industrial, medical, scientific, defense, and environmental areas. Improved computational methods and information management tools are critical in order to enhance the national competitive edge across broad sectors of the economy. The Federal HPCC initiative will address the development of technologies which are essential for building the infrastructure to strengthen our position in meeting the challenges posed by the global developments in industry, political situations, and the environment areas. It would be impossible to cope with this explosion of image information, unless the images were organized for rapid retrieval on demand. A similar situation occurred in the past for numeric and other structured data, and led to the creation of computerized database management systems. In these systems, large amounts of data are organized into fields and important or key fields are used to index the databases making search very efficient. These information management systems have changed several aspects of the modern society. These systems, however, are limited by the fact that they work well only with numeric data and short alpha-numeric strings. Since so much information is in non-alphanumeric form (such as images, video, speech), to deal with such information, researchers started exploring the design and implementation of image databases. But creation of mere image repositories is of little value unless there are methods for fast retrieval of images based on their content, ideally with an efficiency that we find in today's databases. We should be able to search image databases with image-based queries, in addition to alphanumeric queries. The fundamental problem is that images, video, and other similar data differ from numeric data and text in format, and hence they require a totally different technique of organization, indexing, and query processing. We need to consider the issues in visual information management , rather than simply extending the existing database technology to deal with images. We must treat images as one of the central sources of information rather than as an appendix to the main database. A few researchers have addressed problems in image databases. Most of these efforts in image databases, however, focussed either on only a small aspect of the problem, such as data structures or pictorial queries, or on a very narrow application, such as databases for pottery articles of a particular tribe. Other researchers have developed image processing shells which use several images. Clearly, visual information management systems encompass not only databases, but aspects of image processing and image understanding, very sophisticated interfaces, knowledge-based systems, compression and decompression of images. Moreover, memory management and organization issues start becoming much more serious than in the largest alphanumeric databases. In failing to address any of these topics, one may either address only theoretical issues, or may work in a microcosm that will, at best, be extremely narrow in its utility and extensibility. It is clear that the tremendous progress in processing speed and memory technology has made it not only possible, but also attractive to design Visual Information Management Systems (VIMS) for many disparate applications. People already call the 90s the decade of imaging. On considering any of the Grand Challenge problems, such as weather forecasting, air pollution, the earth's biosphere, genome research, or the education network, it becomes clear that the existing database technology must be extended in several new dimensions, from managing tertiary memory to representing an object at varying degrees of detail. Many of the current issues in databases, such as interconnecting heterogeneous databases, are also important to VIMS. Moreover, VIMS have several of their own problems that must be addressed for making progress in challenging industrial and medical applications. Considering the growing need and interest in the organization and retrieval of visual and other non-alphanumeric information, and the insufficient number of academic projects in this area, a workshop on visual information management systems was sponsored Robotics and Machine Inteffigence, and Database and Expert Systems Programs of the National Science Foundation. The aim of the workshop was to bring together active researchers in databases, object- oriented systems, image and signal processing, multi-media, and other related areas to discuss important issues in managing the large amount of visual information that will play a key role in designing information systems of the future. In addition to the researchers in the above and related areas, a few researchers and practitioners interested in applying these systems were also invited."

New media represents a new paradigm for multimedia information representation and processing, in which the emphasis is placed on the actual content. It thus brings the tasks of content creation and searching much closer to actual users and enables them to be active producers of audio-visual information rather than passive recipients. We discuss the state of the art and present next-generation techniques for content representation, searching, creation and editing. We discuss our experiences in developing a Web-based distributed compressed video editing and searching system (WebClip), a media-representation language (Flavor) and an object-based video authoring system (Zest) based on it, and a large image/video search engine for the World Wide Web (WebSEEk).

                "text": "We explore a new approach to shape recognition based on a virtually infinite family of binary features (queries) of the image data, designed to accommodate prior information about shape invariance and regularity. Each query corresponds to a spatial arrangement of several local topographic codes (or tags), which are in themselves too primitive and common to be informative about shape. All the discriminating power derives from relative angles and distances among the tags. The important attributes of the queries are a natural partial ordering corresponding to increasing structure and complexity; semi-invariance, meaning that most shapes of a given class will answer the same way to two queries that are successive in the ordering; and stability, since the queries are not based on distinguished points and substructures. No classifier based on the full feature set can be evaluated, and it is impossible to determine a priori which arrangements are informative. Our approach is to select informative features and build tree classifiers at the same time by inductive learning. In effect, each tree provides an approximation to the full posterior where the features chosen depend on the branch that is traversed. Due to the number and nature of the queries, standard decision tree construction based on a fixed-length feature vector is not feasible. Instead we entertain only a small random sample of queries at each node, constrain their complexity to increase with tree depth, and grow multiple trees. The terminal nodes are labeled by estimates of the corresponding posterior distribution over shape classes. An image is classified by sending it down every tree and aggregating the resulting distributions. The method is applied to classifying handwritten digits and synthetic linear and nonlinear deformations of three hundred symbols. State-of-the-art error rates are achieved on the National Institute of Standards and Technology database of digits. The principal goal of the experiments on symbols is to analyze invariance, generalization error and related issues, and a comparison with artificial neural networks methods is presented in this context.

Experiment 1 studies the importance of using (a) semantic information, (2) memory of earlier input and (3) relative, rather than absolute, judgements of image similarity. The target testing paradigm is used in which a user must search for an image identical to a target. We find that the best performance comes from a version of PicHunter that uses only semantic cues, with memory and relative similarity judgements. Second best is use of both pictorial and semantic cues, with memory and relative similarity judgements. Most reports of CBIR systems provide only qualitative measures of performance based on how similar retrieved images are to a target. Experiment 2 puts PicHunter into this context with a more rigorous test. We first establish a baseline for our database by measuring the time required to find an image that is similar to a target when the images are presented in random order. Although PicHunter's performance is measurably better than this, the test is weak because even random presentation of images yields reasonably short search times. This casts doubt on the strength of results given in other reports where no baseline is established."

The method consists of two separate stages: a splitting phase followed by a merging phase. The splitting phase starts with an initial coarse triangulation and employs the incremental Delaunay triangulation as a directed image region splitting technique. The triangulation process is accomplished by adding points as vertices one by one into the triangulation. A top-down point selection strategy is proposed for selecting these points in the image domain of grey-value and color images. The merging phase coalesces the oversegmentation, generated by the splitting phase, into homogeneous image regions. Because images might be negatively affected by changes in intensity due to shading or surface orientation change, the authors propose homogeneity criteria which are robust to intensity changes caused by these phenomena for both grey-value and color images. Performance of the image segmentation method has been evaluated by experiments on test images."

By running numerous experiments in a standardized testbed under highly varying data, queries and operations, we were able to design the R*-tree which incorporates a combined optimization of area, margin and overlap of each enclosing rectangle in the directory. Using our standardized testbed in an exhaustive performance comparison, it turned out that the R*-tree clearly outperforms the existing R-tree variants. Guttman's linear and quadratic R-tree and Greene's variant of the R-tree. This superiority of the R*-tree holds for different types of queries and operations, such as map overlay, for both rectangles and multidimensional points in all experiments. From a practical point of view the R*-tree is very attractive because of the following two reasons 1 it efficiently supports point and spatial data at the same time and 2 its implementation cost is only slightly higher than that of other R-trees."

For this purpose, the authors first apply a global wavelet transform on the initial image. Due to the localization properties of the WT both in the spatial and in the frequency domain it is possible to describe the local texture features in the surroundings of any pixel by a set of respective wavelet coefficients. This is accomplished by a local traversal of the wavelet pyramid and finally results in the feature vector required. Since the localization is limited by Heisenberg's uncertainty principle one must approximate the single coefficients for each pixel by piecewise linear interpolation. Once the feature vector is derived from the WT, further steps in the analysis pipeline perform decorrelation, normalization and finally clustering and supervised classification. In contrast to many related wavelet-based approaches, that usually apply different WTs on every texture sample and classify based on means derived from the former, the present method especially accounts for many real world applications. In those cases there are not usually large coherent texture regions that allow separated treatment. Moreover the approach employs a global WT and then stresses the local properties of the basis functions to identify local areas of interest from the initial image, as for instance training areas. The authors illustrate the efficiency of the method by classifying different real world textures with LVQ classifiers.<<ETX>>"

To address this problem, this paper proposes the concept of similarity matching toolkit which consists of different similarity measures simulating human's perceptions of the given feature from di erent aspects. The toolkit supports a feedback-driven tool selection mechanism which adapts to the similarity measure that best ts the user's perception. To illustrate the advantage of the proposed toolkit approach, we apply it to shape-based image retrieval. The paper describes a shape matching toolkit consisting of four transformation-invariant and computationally e cient matching tools and describes how relevance feedback can be used for automatic tool selection. Experimental results validate the exibility of the matching toolkit and show the e ectiveness of the relevance feedback for shape matching tool selection."

approach for utilizing many data dependent user dependent and task dependent features in a semi automated tool Instead of requiring universal similarity measures or manual selection of relevant features the approach provides a learning algorithm for selecting and combining groupings of the data where groupings can be induced by highly spe cialized and context dependent features The se lection process is guided by a rich example based interaction with the user The inherent com binatorics of using multiple features is reduced by a multistage grouping generation weighting and collection process The stages closest to the user are trained fastest and slowly propagate their adaptations back to earlier stages The weighting stage adapts the collection stage s search space across uses so that in later interactions good groupings are found given few examples from the user Described is an interactive time imple mentation of this architecture for semi automatic within image segmentation and across image la beling driven by concurrently active color mod els texture models or manually provided group ings Issues for digital libraries Digital libraries of images video and sound are a rich area for pattern recognition research They also introduce a host of new problems and requirements since the range of possible queries is immense and requires the utilization of many spe cialized features Also systems for retrieval browsing and annotation i e classifying regions often must perform with only a small number of examples from a user i e an insuf cient amount of training data by traditional requirements Thus the area is doubly exciting since it presents the eld of pattern recognition with new challenges while beckoning in new applications One important issue for digital libraries is nding good models and similarity measures for comparing database en tries A part of this di culty is that feature extraction and comparison methods are highly data dependent see Figure This work was supported in part by BT PLC Hewlett Packard Labs and NEC for an example with texture Similarity measures are also user and task dependent as demonstrated by Figure Un fortunately these dependencies are not at this point under stood well enough especially by the typical digital library user to permit careful selection of the optimal measure be forehand Note that the multi resolution simultaneous auto regressive MRSAR model of which fares poorly com pared to the shift invariant eigenvector EV model in the above two examples scores clearly above the EV model on the standard Brodatz database On the same test data but for a perceptually motivated similarity criteria based on periodicity directionality and randomness both the EV and MRSAR models are beat by a new Wold based model Attempts to use intuitive texture features like coarseness contrast and directionality are appropri ate in some cases but do not fully determine all the qualities people might use in judging similarity Thus an a priori opti mal context dependent selection among similarity measures either by human or computer seems unlikely Next the scope of queries that databases need to address is immense Current computational solutions attempt to of fer location of perceptual content nd round red objects and objective content nd pictures of people in Boston Desirable queries also extend to subjective content give me a scene of a romantic forest task speci c content I need something with open space to place text collaborative con tent show me pictures children like and more An swering such queries requires a variety of features or meta data to be attached to the data in a digital library some of which may not be computable directly from the data The implication for algorithms is that they cannot rely on one model or one small set of carefully picked features but will have to drink from a veritable feature hydrant from which only a few drops may be relevant for the query Finally there is a signi cant need for semi automated ver sus fully automated tools Human computer synergy can make ill de ned tasks manageable and has the power to over come many of the problems of current pattern recognition tools An important application of semi automated tools is to assist the population of a database viz the creation of metadata A crucial technical issue for such tools is the selec tion and combination of existing features which features are most useful for a given query or annotation how should they be combined and which combinations are useful for the sys tem to remember so that it gets smarter with increased use This last point is important since not only are the queries immensely variable but the amount of training data i e ex amples provided by a user of what they do and don t want available at any instant is usually limited Hence a tool should strive to improve its generalization ability"

The problem of interest is the recognition of which free-form object from a large possible set of articulated deformable objects in arbitrary positions is present in sensed data when clutter is also present and the objects are partially occluded. The modeling approach is to represent complex objects by patches or parts that individually capture significant local information and to geometrically relate them in order to provide the complete structure of an object. A representation that we use generally consists of implicit polynomial curves and surfaces for 2D data and 3D data, respectively. Recognition is based on geometric invariants-functions of patches or parts that capture the shape but are invariant to the geometric transformations. Since an object to be recognized may be a member of a class, or since the invariants for an object may take values in a class, recognition of class membership is necessary, and for this we use Bayesian recognizers. The technology of self and mutual invariants and Bayesian recognizers for implicit polynomial patches or parts is touched on in the paper. Another topic briefly discussed is representation by generalized cylinders within the framework of algebraic curves and invariants."

                "text": "Geometric invariants appear to play an important role in object recognition as an aid to building model libraries of objects. Useful invariants are often found by extensive experience and they are based on geometric invariant properties studied by algebraists over many years. Given a geometric configuration, there is however a need to systematically generate and search for its invariants. In this paper we give a complete solution, in principle, to computing a single invariant for a geometric configuration, if it exists. The algorithm works in three steps: (i) the problem formulation step in which algebraic relations are established between object parameters and image parameters (or equivalently, parameters of two different images) using an imaging transformation, (ii) elimination of transformation parameters resulting in an invariant relation between object and image parameters, and (iii) finally, extraction of a single invariant from the algebraic relation. The main contribution of the paper is to give a complete solution for the third step, called the separability problem. It is shown that there is a simple and efficient solution to the separability problem provided the resultant obtained from the second step is explicitly known. The efficiency of the algorithm is linked to the efficiency of computing the resultant. Dixon's method is proposed to be used for computing the resultant."

Anyone just entering the field, however, may find the few existing books on shape analysis too specific or advanced, and for researchers interested in the specific problem of shape recognition and characterization, traditional books on computer vision are too general.Shape Analysis and Classification: Theory and Practice offers an integrated and conceptual introduction to this dynamic field and its myriad applications. Beginning with the basic mathematical concepts, it deals with shape analysis, from image capture to pattern classification, and presents many of the most advanced and powerful techniques used in practice. The authors explore the relevant aspects of both shape characterization and recognition, and give special attention to practical issues, such as guidelines for implementation, validation, and assessment.Shape Analysis and Classification provides a rich resource for the computational characterization and classification of general shapes, from characters to biological entities. Both beginning and advanced researchers can directly use its state-of-the-art concepts and techniques to solve their own problems involving the characterization and classification of visual shapes."

Using this hierarchical structure reduces the computational load significantly. The algorithm is reasonably simple to implement and is insensitive to noise and other disturbances. The algorithm has been tested in several applications. Two of them are briefly presented. In the first application the outlines of common tools are matched to gray-level images of the same tools, with overlapping. In the second application lake edges from aerial photographs are matched to lake edges from a map, with translation, rotation, scale, and perspective changes. The hierarchical chamfer matching algorithm gives correct results using a reasonable amount of computational resources in all tested applications. >"

                "text": "A new algorithm and systematic evaluation is presented for searching a database via relevance feedback. It represents a new image display strategy for the PicHunter system. The algorithm takes feedback in the form of relative judgments (\"item A is more relevant than item B\") as opposed to the stronger assumption of categorical relevance judgments (\"item A is relevant but item B is not\"). It also exploits a learned probabilistic model of human behavior to make better use of the feedback it obtains. The algorithm can be viewed as an extension of indexing schemes like the k-d tree to a stochastic setting, hence the name \"stochastic-comparison search.\" In simulations, the amount of feedback required for the new algorithm scales like log/sub 2/ |D|, where |D| is the size of the database, while a simple query-by-example approach scales like |D|/sup /spl alpha//, where /spl alpha/<1 depends on the structure of the database. This theoretical advantage is reflected by experiments with real users on a database of 1500 stock photographs."

An analytic camera model is used to predict the location and appearance of landmarks in the image, generating a projection for an assumed viewpoint. Correspondence is achieved by adjusting the parameters of the camera model until the appearances of the landmarks optimally match a symbolic description extracted from the image. \n \nThe matching of image and map features is performed rapidly by a new technique, called \"chamfer matching\", that compares the shapes of two collections of shape fragments, at a cost proportional to linear dimension, rather than area. These two techniques permit the matching of spatially extensive features on the basis of shape, which reduces the risk of ambiguous matches and the dependence on viewing conditions inherent in conventional image based correlation matching."

Kass et al., proposed a variational technique; Amini used dynamic programming; and Williams and Shah introduced a fast, greedy algorithm. We combine the advantages of the latter two methods in a two-stage algorithm. The first stage is a greedy procedure that provides fast initial convergence. It is enhanced with a cost term that extends over a large number of points to avoid oscillations. The second stage, when accuracy becomes important, uses dynamic programming. This step is accelerated by the use of alternating search neighborhoods and by dropping stable points from the iterations. We have also added several features for user interaction. First, the user can define points of high confidence. Mathematically, this results in an extra cost term and, in that way, the robustness in difficult areas (e.g., noisy edges, sharp corners) is improved. We also give the user the possibility of incremental contour tracking, thus providing feedback on the refinement process. The algorithm has been tested on numerous photographic clip art images and extensive tests on medical images are in progress."

                "text": "Toward the development of an object recognition and positioning system, able to deal with arbitrary shaped objects in cluttered environments, methods for matching two arbitrarily shaped regions of different objects are introduced, and how to efficiently compute the coordinate transformation which makes two matching regions coincide is shown. In both cases, matching and positioning, the results are invariant with respect to viewer coordinate system, and these techniques apply to both 2-D and 3-D problems, under either Euclidean or affine coordinate transformations. The 3-D Euclidean case is useful for the recognition and positioning of solid objects from range data, and the 2-D affine case for the recognition and positioning of solid objects from projections, e.g., from curves in a single image, and in motion estimation. The matching of arbitrarily shaped regions is done by computing for each region a vector of centered moments. These vectors are viewpoint-dependent, but the dependence on the viewpoint is algebraic and well known. This paper presents a new family of computationally efficient algorithms based on matrix computations, for the evaluation of both Euclidean and affine algebraic moment invariants of data sets. The use of algebraic moment invariants greatly reduces the computation required for the matching and, hence, initial object recognition. The approach to determining and computing these moment invariants is different than those used by the vision community previously. The method for computing the coordinate transformation which makes the two matching regions coincide provides an estimate of object position. The estimation of the matching transformation is based on the same matrix computation techniques introduced for the computation of invariants. It involves simple manipulations of the moment vectors. It neither requires costly iterative methods, nor going back to the data set. These geometric invariant methods appear to be very important for dealing with the situation of a large number of different possible objects in the presence of occlusion and clutter, and the approach to computing these moment invariants is different than those used by the vision community previously."

A texture model is a mathematical procedure capable of producing and describing a textured image. We explore the use of Markov random fields as texture models. The binomial model, where each point in the texture has a binomial distribution with parameter controlled by its neighbors and ``number of tries'' equal to the number of gray levels, was taken to be the basic model for the analysis. A method of generating samples from the binomial model is given, followed by a theoretical and practical analysis of the method's convergence. Examples show how the parameters of the Markov random field control the strength and direction of the clustering in the image. The power of the binomial model to produce blurry, sharp, line-like, and blob-like textures is demonstrated. Natural texture samples were digitized and their parameters were estimated under the Markov random field model. A hypothesis test was used for an objective assessment of goodness-of-fit under the Markov random field model. Overall, microtextures fit the model well. The estimated parameters of the natural textures were used as input to the generation procedure. The synthetic microtextures closely resembled their real counterparts, while the regular and inhomogeneous textures did not."

The development of this transform is motivated by the observation that a large class of natural textures can be modeled as quasi-periodic signals whose dominant frequencies are located in the middle frequency channels. With the transform, it is possible to zoom into any desired frequency channels for further decomposition. In contrast, the conventional pyramid-structured wavelet transform performs further decomposition in low-frequency channels. A progressive texture classification algorithm which is not only computationally attractive but also has excellent performance is developed. The performance of the present method is compared with that of several other methods."

We work in the typical setting in which the given tree T may have been derived from the given training sample S, and thus may badly over t S. In this setting, we give bounds on the amount of additional generalization error that our pruning su ers compared to the optimal pruning of T . More generally, our results show that if there is a pruning of T with small error, and whose size is small compared to jSj, then our algorithm will nd a pruning whose error is not much larger. This style of result has been called an index of resolvability result by Barron and Cover in the context of density estimation. A novel feature of our algorithm is its locality | the decision to prune a subtree is based entirely on properties of that subtree and the sample reaching it. To analyze our algorithm, we develop tools of local uniform convergence, a generalization of the standard notion that may prove useful in other settings."

For these purpose, we have adopted the Munsell Renotation System in which color signals of tri-attributes of human color perception (Hue, Value and Chroma) and psychometrical color differences are defined. In the Munsell Renotation System, however, intertransformation between (RGB) data and corresponding color data is very cumbersome. Because the intertransformation depends on a look up table. This article presents a new method of mathematical transformation. The mathematical transformation is obtained by multiple regression analysis of 250 color samples, which are uniformly sampled from whole color ranges that a conventional NTSC color TV camera can present. The new method can transform (RGB) data to the data of the Munsell Renotation System far better than the conventional method given by the CIE(1976)L*a*b*."

If A and B are close to being the same shape, then a vision system should report a match and return a measure of how good that match is. To be useful this measure should satisfy a number of properties, including: (1) it should be a metric, (2) it should be invariant under translation, rotation, and change-of-scale, (3) it should be reasonably easy to compute, and (4) it should match our intuition (i.e., answers should be similar to those that a person might give). We develop a method for comparing polygons that has these properties. The method works for both convex and nonconvex polygons and runs in time O(mn log mn) where m is the number of vertices in one polygon and n is the number of vertices in the other. Some examples are presented that show the method produces answers that are intuitively reasonable."

They show that the wavelet descriptor has many desirable properties such as multiresolution representation, invariance, uniqueness, stability, and spatial localization. A deformable wavelet descriptor is also proposed by interpreting the wavelet coefficients as random variables. The applications of the wavelet descriptor to character recognition and model-based contour extraction from low SNR images are examined. Numerical experiments are performed to illustrate the performance of the wavelet descriptor."

A fundamental theorem is established to relate such moment invariants to the well-known algebraic invariants. Complete systems of moment invariants under translation, similitude and orthogonal transformations are derived. Some moment invariants under general two-dimensional linear transformations are also included. Both theoretical formulation and practical models of visual pattern recognition based upon these moment invariants are discussed. A simple simulation program together with its performance are also presented. It is shown that recognition of geometrical patterns and alphabetical characters independently of position, size and orientation can be accomplished. It is also indicated that generalization is possible to include invariance with parallel projection."

We approximated in computational form six basic textural features, namely, coarseness, contrast, directionality, line-likeness, regularity, and roughness. In comparison with psychological measurements for human subjects, the computational measures gave good correspondences in rank correlation of 16 typical texture patterns. Similarity measurements using these features were attempted. The discrepancies between human vision and computerized techniques that we encountered in this study indicate fundamental problems in digital analysis of textures. Some of them could be overcome by analyzing their causes and using more sophisticated techniques."

A conjunction, such as (Color=\u2018red\u2019) \u2227 (Sound=\u2018loud\u2019), is evaluated by first evaluating the individual conjuncts and then combining the answers by some scoring function. Typical scoring functions include the min (the standard scoring function for the conjunction in fuzzy logic) and the average. We address the question of how to permit the user to weight the importance of atomic subformulas. In particular, we give a semantics for permitting non-uniform weights, by giving an explicit formula (that is based on the underlying scoring function). This semantics permits an efficient implementation with a low database access cost in a multimedia database system in important cases of interest."

                "text": "In this paper, we study how human observers judge image similarity. To do so, we have conducted two psychophysical scaling experiments and have compared the results to two algorithmic image similarity metrics. For these experiments, we selected a set of 97 digitized photographic images which represent a range of semantic categories, viewing distances, and colors. We then used the two perceptual and the two algorithmic methods to measure the similarity of each image to every other image in the data set, producing four similarity matrices. These matrices were analyzed using multidimensional scaling techniques to gain insight into the dimensions human observers use for judging image similarity, and how these dimensions differ from the results of algorithmic methods. This paper also describes and validates a new technique for collecting similarity judgments which can provide meaningful results with a factor of four fewer judgments, as compared with the paired comparisons method."

To solve these problems, we must be able to relate natural surfaces to their images; this requires a good model of natural surface shapes. Fractal functions are a good choice for modeling 3-D natural surfaces because 1) many physical processes produce a fractal surface shape, 2) fractals are widely used as a graphics tool for generating natural-looking shapes, and 3) a survey of natural imagery has shown that the 3-D fractal surface model, transformed by the image formation process, furnishes an accurate description of both textured and shaded image regions. The 3-D fractal model provides a characterization of 3-D surfaces and their images for which the appropriateness of the model is verifiable. Furthermore, this characterization is stable over transformations of scale and linear transforms of intensity. The 3-D fractal model has been successfully applied to the problems of 1) texture segmentation and classification, 2) estimation of 3-D shape information, and 3) distinguishing between perceptually ``smooth'' and perceptually ``textured'' surfaces in the scene."

The performance of wavelet packet spaces are measured in terms of sensitivity and selectivity for the classification of twenty-five natural textures. Both energy and entropy metrics were computed for each wavelet packet and incorporated into distinct scale space representations, where each wavelet packet (channel) reflected a specific scale and orientation sensitivity. Wavelet packet representations for twenty-five natural textures were classified without error by a simple two-layer network classifier. An analyzing function of large regularity (D/sub 20/) was shown to be slightly more efficient in representation and discrimination than a similar function with fewer vanishing moments (D/sub 6/) In addition, energy representations computed from the standard wavelet decomposition alone (17 features) provided classification without error for the twenty-five textures included in our study. The reliability exhibited by texture signatures based on wavelet packets analysis suggest that the multiresolution properties of such transforms are beneficial for accomplishing segmentation, classification and subtle discrimination of texture. >"

The method is a hybrid segmentation process utilizing both watershed analysis and relaxation labeling. Initially, watershed analysis is used to subdivide an image into catchment basins, effectively clustering pixels together based on their spatial proximity and intensity homogeneity. Classification estimates in the form of probabilities are set for each of these catchment basins. Relaxation labeling is then used to iteratively refine and update the classifications of the catchment basins through propagating constraints and utilizing local information. The relaxation updating process is continued until a large majority of the catchment basins are unambiguously classified. The method provides fast, accurate segmentation results and exploits the individual strengths of watershed analysis and relaxation labeling. The robustness of the method is illustrated through comparisons to other popular segmentation techniques.<<ETX>>"

This paper extends the approach, as well as an initial work on mutual invariants recognizers, to the recognition of objects too complicated to be represented by a single polynomial. Hence, an object to be recognized is partitioned into patches, each patch is represented by a single implicit polynomial, mutual invariants are computed for pairs of polynomials for pairs of patches, and the object recognition is via a Bayesian recognition of vectors of self and mutual invariants. We discuss why the complete object geometry can be captured by the geometry of pairs of patches, how to design mutual invariants, and how to match patches in the data with those in the database at a low computational cost. The approach is a low computational cost recognition of partially occluded articulated objects in an arbitrary position and in noise by recognizing the self or joint geometry of one or more patches."

A curve is represented parametrically as a function of arc length by the accumulated change in direction of the curve since the starting point. This function is expanded in a Fourier series and the coefficients are arranged in the amplitude/phase-angle form. It is shown that the amplitudes are pure form invariants as well as are certain simple functions of phase angles. Rotational and axial symmetry are related directly to simple properties of the Fourier descriptors. An analysis of shape similarity or symmetry can be based on these relationships; also closed symmetric curves can be synthesized from almost arbitrary Fourier descriptors. It is established that the Fourier series expansion is optimal and unique with respect to obtaining coefficients insensitive to starting point. Several examples are provided to indicate the usefulness of Fourier descriptors as features for shape discrimination and a number of interesting symmetric curves are generated by computer and plotted out."
