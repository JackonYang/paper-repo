Recently, more direct end-to-end methods have been investigated, in which neural architectures were trained to model sequences of characters [1,2]. To our knowledge, all these approaches relied on Connectionist Temporal Classification [3] modules. We investigate an alternative method for sequence modelling based on an attention mechanism that allows a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to learn alignments between sequences of input frames and output labels. We show how this setup can be applied to LVCSR by integrating the decoding RNN with an n-gram language model and by speeding up its operation by constraining selections made by the attention mechanism and by reducing the source sequence lengths by pooling information over time. Recognition accuracies similar to other HMM-free RNN-based approaches are reported for the Wall Street Journal corpus."

The unaries of the CRF are provided by a CNN that predicts characters at each position of the output, while higher order terms are provided by another CNN that detects the presence of N-grams. We show that this entire model (CRF, character predictor, N-gram predictor) can be jointly optimised by back-propagating the structured output loss, essentially requiring the system to perform multi-task learning, and training uses purely synthetically generated data. The resulting model is a more accurate system on standard real-world text recognition benchmarks than character prediction alone, setting a benchmark for systems that have not been trained on a particular lexicon. In addition, our model achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in lexicon-constrained scenarios, without being specifically modelled for constrained recognition. To test the generalisation of our model, we also perform experiments with random alpha-numeric strings to evaluate the method when no visual language model is applicable."

In this paper, we investigate the problem of scene text recognition, which is among the most important and challenging tasks in image-based sequence recognition. A novel neural network architecture, which integrates feature extraction, sequence modeling and transcription into a unified framework, is proposed. Compared with previous systems for scene text recognition, the proposed architecture possesses four distinctive properties: (1) It is end-to-end trainable, in contrast to most of the existing algorithms whose components are separately trained and tuned. (2) It naturally handles sequences in arbitrary lengths, involving no character segmentation or horizontal scale normalization. (3) It is not confined to any predefined lexicon and achieves remarkable performances in both lexicon-free and lexicon-based scene text recognition tasks. (4) It generates an effective yet much smaller model, which is more practical for real-world application scenarios. The experiments on standard benchmarks, including the IIIT-5K, Street View Text and ICDAR datasets, demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm over the prior arts. Moreover, the proposed algorithm performs well in the task of image-based music score recognition, which evidently verifies the generality of it."

In this paper, we take a different route and combine the representational power of large, multilayer neural networks together with recent developments in unsupervised feature learning, which allows us to use a common framework to train highly-accurate text detector and character recognizer modules. Then, using only simple off-the-shelf methods, we integrate these two modules into a full end-to-end, lexicon-driven, scene text recognition system that achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks, namely Street View Text and ICDAR 2003."

While this task is a well-studied problem in OCR, our method takes an inherently different, data-driven approach. Our model does not require any knowledge of the underlying markup language, and is simply trained end-to-end on real-world example data. The model employs a convolutional network for text and layout recognition in tandem with an attention-based neural machine translation system. To train and evaluate the model, we introduce a new dataset of real-world rendered mathematical expressions paired with LaTeX markup, as well as a synthetic dataset of web pages paired with HTML snippets. Experimental results show that the system is surprisingly effective at generating accurate markup for both datasets. While a standard domain-specific LaTeX OCR system achieves around 25% accuracy, our model reproduces the exact rendered image on 75% of examples."

The primary advantages of the proposed method are: (1) use of recursive convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which allow for parametrically efficient and effective image feature extraction, (2) an implicitly learned character-level language model, embodied in a recurrent neural network which avoids the need to use N-grams, and (3) the use of a soft-attention mechanism, allowing the model to selectively exploit image features in a coordinated way, and allowing for end-to-end training within a standard backpropagation framework. We validate our method with state-of-the-art performance on challenging benchmark datasets: Street View Text, IIIT5k, ICDAR and Synth90k."

In this paper, we present a generative model based on a deep recurrent architecture that combines recent advances in computer vision and machine translation and that can be used to generate natural sentences describing an image. The model is trained to maximize the likelihood of the target description sentence given the training image. Experiments on several datasets show the accuracy of the model and the fluency of the language it learns solely from image descriptions. Our model is often quite accurate, which we verify both qualitatively and quantitatively. For instance, while the current state-of-the-art BLEU-1 score (the higher the better) on the Pascal dataset is 25, our approach yields 59, to be compared to human performance around 69. We also show BLEU-1 score improvements on Flickr30k, from 56 to 66, and on SBU, from 19 to 28. Lastly, on the newly released COCO dataset, we achieve a BLEU-4 of 27.7, which is the current state-of-the-art."

This system is based on a region proposal mechanism for detection and deep convolutional neural networks for recognition. Our pipeline uses a novel combination of complementary proposal generation techniques to ensure high recall, and a fast subsequent filtering stage for improving precision. For the recognition and ranking of proposals, we train very large convolutional neural networks to perform word recognition on the whole proposal region at the same time, departing from the character classifier based systems of the past. These networks are trained solely on data produced by a synthetic text generation engine, requiring no human labelled data. Analysing the stages of our pipeline, we show state-of-the-art performance throughout. We perform rigorous experiments across a number of standard end-to-end text spotting benchmarks and text-based image retrieval datasets, showing a large improvement over all previous methods. Finally, we demonstrate a real-world application of our text spotting system to allow thousands of hours of news footage to be instantly searchable via a text query."

Unlike traditional DNN-HMM models, this model learns all the components of a speech recognizer jointly. Our system has two components: a listener and a speller. The listener is a pyramidal recurrent network encoder that accepts filter bank spectra as inputs. The speller is an attention-based recurrent network decoder that emits characters as outputs. The network produces character sequences without making any independence assumptions between the characters. This is the key improvement of LAS over previous end-to-end CTC models. On a subset of the Google voice search task, LAS achieves a word error rate (WER) of 14.1% without a dictionary or a language model, and 10.3% with language model rescoring over the top 32 beams. By comparison, the state-of-the-art CLDNN-HMM model achieves a WER of 8.0%."

Although DNNs work well whenever large labeled training sets are available, they cannot be used to map sequences to sequences. In this paper, we present a general end-to-end approach to sequence learning that makes minimal assumptions on the sequence structure. Our method uses a multilayered Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to map the input sequence to a vector of a fixed dimensionality, and then another deep LSTM to decode the target sequence from the vector. Our main result is that on an English to French translation task from the WMT-14 dataset, the translations produced by the LSTM achieve a BLEU score of 34.8 on the entire test set, where the LSTM's BLEU score was penalized on out-of-vocabulary words. Additionally, the LSTM did not have difficulty on long sentences. For comparison, a phrase-based SMT system achieves a BLEU score of 33.3 on the same dataset. When we used the LSTM to rerank the 1000 hypotheses produced by the aforementioned SMT system, its BLEU score increases to 36.5, which is close to the previous state of the art. The LSTM also learned sensible phrase and sentence representations that are sensitive to word order and are relatively invariant to the active and the passive voice. Finally, we found that reversing the order of the words in all source sentences (but not target sentences) improved the LSTM's performance markedly, because doing so introduced many short term dependencies between the source and the target sentence which made the optimization problem easier."

Our motivation is to further boost the state-of-the-art deep learning-based recognizer by using writer adaptation techniques. First, to perform an effective and flexible writer adaptation, we propose a tandem architecture design for the feature extraction and classification. Specifically, a deep neural network (DNN) or convolutional neural network (CNN) is adopted to extract the deeply learned features which are used to build a discriminatively trained prototype-based classifier initialized by Linde\u2013Buzo\u2013Gray clustering techniques. In this way, the feature extractor can fully utilize the useful information of a DNN or CNN. Meanwhile, the prototype-based classifier could be designed more compact and efficient as a practical solution. Second, the writer adaption is performed via a linear transformation of the deeply learned features which is optimized with a sample separation margin-based minimum classification error criterion. Furthermore, we improve the generalization capability of the previously proposed discriminative linear regression approach for writer adaptation by using the linear interpolation of two transformations and adaptation data perturbation. The experiments on the tasks of both the CASIA-OLHWDB benchmark and an in-house corpus with a vocabulary of 20,936 characters demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach."

We estimate the most likely expression candidate derived from the grammar, rather than solving one by one the three major problems in mathematical expression recognition: symbol segmentation/recognition, 2D structure recognition, and expression syntax analysis. With this method, we can simultaneously recognize the symbols and structure of an expression within the grammatical constraint. Experiments revealed that this simultaneous estimation decreases errors in symbol segmentation and recognition, and that these errors are reduced as grammatical restriction is strengthened."

On the test data, we achieved top-1 and top-5 error rates of 37.5% and 17.0%, respectively, which is considerably better than the previous state-of-the-art. The neural network, which has 60 million parameters and 650,000 neurons, consists of five convolutional layers, some of which are followed by max-pooling layers, and three fully connected layers with a final 1000-way softmax. To make training faster, we used non-saturating neurons and a very efficient GPU implementation of the convolution operation. To reduce overfitting in the fully connected layers we employed a recently developed regularization method called \"dropout\" that proved to be very effective. We also entered a variant of this model in the ILSVRC-2012 competition and achieved a winning top-5 test error rate of 15.3%, compared to 26.2% achieved by the second-best entry."

Unlike the traditional statistical machine translation, the neural machine translation aims at building a single neural network that can be jointly tuned to maximize the translation performance. The models proposed recently for neural machine translation often belong to a family of encoder-decoders and consists of an encoder that encodes a source sentence into a fixed-length vector from which a decoder generates a translation. In this paper, we conjecture that the use of a fixed-length vector is a bottleneck in improving the performance of this basic encoder-decoder architecture, and propose to extend this by allowing a model to automatically (soft-)search for parts of a source sentence that are relevant to predicting a target word, without having to form these parts as a hard segment explicitly. With this new approach, we achieve a translation performance comparable to the existing state-of-the-art phrase-based system on the task of English-to-French translation. Furthermore, qualitative analysis reveals that the (soft-)alignments found by the model agree well with our intuition."

One RNN encodes a sequence of symbols into a fixedlength vector representation, and the other decodes the representation into another sequence of symbols. The encoder and decoder of the proposed model are jointly trained to maximize the conditional probability of a target sequence given a source sequence. The performance of a statistical machine translation system is empirically found to improve by using the conditional probabilities of phrase pairs computed by the RNN Encoder\u2010Decoder as an additional feature in the existing log-linear model. Qualitatively, we show that the proposed model learns a semantically and syntactically meaningful representation of linguistic phrases."

                "text": "Deep neural nets with a large number of parameters are very powerful machine learning systems. However, overfitting is a serious problem in such networks. Large networks are also slow to use, making it difficult to deal with overfitting by combining the predictions of many different large neural nets at test time. Dropout is a technique for addressing this problem. The key idea is to randomly drop units (along with their connections) from the neural network during training. This prevents units from co-adapting too much. During training, dropout samples from an exponential number of different \"thinned\" networks. At test time, it is easy to approximate the effect of averaging the predictions of all these thinned networks by simply using a single unthinned network that has smaller weights. This significantly reduces overfitting and gives major improvements over other regularization methods. We show that dropout improves the performance of neural networks on supervised learning tasks in vision, speech recognition, document classification and computational biology, obtaining state-of-the-art results on many benchmark data sets."

We show that convolutional networks by themselves, trained end-to-end, pixels-to-pixels, exceed the state-of-the-art in semantic segmentation. Our key insight is to build \u201cfully convolutional\u201d networks that take input of arbitrary size and produce correspondingly-sized output with efficient inference and learning. We define and detail the space of fully convolutional networks, explain their application to spatially dense prediction tasks, and draw connections to prior models. We adapt contemporary classification networks (AlexNet [20], the VGG net [31], and GoogLeNet [32]) into fully convolutional networks and transfer their learned representations by fine-tuning [3] to the segmentation task. We then define a skip architecture that combines semantic information from a deep, coarse layer with appearance information from a shallow, fine layer to produce accurate and detailed segmentations. Our fully convolutional network achieves state-of-the-art segmentation of PASCAL VOC (20% relative improvement to 62.2% mean IU on 2012), NYUDv2, and SIFT Flow, while inference takes less than one fifth of a second for a typical image."

This slows down the training by requiring lower learning rates and careful parameter initialization, and makes it notoriously hard to train models with saturating nonlinearities. We refer to this phenomenon as internal covariate shift, and address the problem by normalizing layer inputs. Our method draws its strength from making normalization a part of the model architecture and performing the normalization for each training mini-batch. Batch Normalization allows us to use much higher learning rates and be less careful about initialization, and in some cases eliminates the need for Dropout. Applied to a state-of-the-art image classification model, Batch Normalization achieves the same accuracy with 14 times fewer training steps, and beats the original model by a significant margin. Using an ensemble of batch-normalized networks, we improve upon the best published result on ImageNet classification: reaching 4.82% top-5 test error, exceeding the accuracy of human raters."

However, there has been little work exploring useful architectures for attention-based NMT. This paper examines two simple and effective classes of attentional mechanism: a global approach which always attends to all source words and a local one that only looks at a subset of source words at a time. We demonstrate the effectiveness of both approaches on the WMT translation tasks between English and German in both directions. With local attention, we achieve a significant gain of 5.0 BLEU points over non-attentional systems that already incorporate known techniques such as dropout. Our ensemble model using different attention architectures yields a new state-of-the-art result in the WMT\u201915 English to German translation task with 25.9 BLEU points, an improvement of 1.0 BLEU points over the existing best system backed by NMT and an n-gram reranker. 1"

A significant weakness in conventional NMT systems is their inability to correctly translate very rare words: end-to-end NMTs tend to have relatively small vocabularies with a single unk symbol that represents every possible out-of-vocabulary (OOV) word. In this paper, we propose and implement an effective technique to address this problem. We train an NMT system on data that is augmented by the output of a word alignment algorithm, allowing the NMT system to emit, for each OOV word in the target sentence, the position of its corresponding word in the source sentence. This information is later utilized in a post-processing step that translates every OOV word using a dictionary. Our experiments on the WMT\u201914 English to French translation task show that this method provides a substantial improvement of up to 2.8 BLEU points over an equivalent NMT system that does not use this technique. With 37.5 BLEU points, our NMT system is the first to surpass the best result achieved on a WMT\u201914 contest task."

                "text": "This paper presents an overview of the 5th Competition on Recognition of Online Handwritten Mathematical Expressions (CROHME). As in previous years, the main task is formula recognition from handwritten strokes (Task 1). Additional tasks include classification of isolated symbols (Task 2a), classification of isolated valid and invalid symbols (Task 2b), a new task on parsing formula structure from valid handwritten symbols (Task 3), and parsing expressions with matrices (Task 4, experimental). In total, eleven (11) research labs registered for the competition, with six (6) teams submitting results. Innovations for this CROHME included providing a corpus of formulae from Wikipedia to train language models, and an online system for result submission. The highest recognition rates were obtained by MyScript corporation (Task 1. 67.65%, 2a. 92.81%, 2b. 86.77%, 3. 84.38%, and 4. 68.40%). Using only provided training data, the highest recognition rates were obtained by WIRIS corporation (Task 1. 49.61%, Task 3. 78.80%, Task 4. 56.40%), the Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology (Task 2a. 92.28%), and RIT (Task 2b. 83.34%). The competition results suggest that recognition of handwritten formulae remains a difficult structural pattern recognition task."

Our main contribution is a thorough evaluation of networks of increasing depth using an architecture with very small (3x3) convolution filters, which shows that a significant improvement on the prior-art configurations can be achieved by pushing the depth to 16-19 weight layers. These findings were the basis of our ImageNet Challenge 2014 submission, where our team secured the first and the second places in the localisation and classification tracks respectively. We also show that our representations generalise well to other datasets, where they achieve state-of-the-art results. We have made our two best-performing ConvNet models publicly available to facilitate further research on the use of deep visual representations in computer vision."

We show how a multiscale and sliding window approach can be efficiently implemented within a ConvNet. We also introduce a novel deep learning approach to localization by learning to predict object boundaries. Bounding boxes are then accumulated rather than suppressed in order to increase detection confidence. We show that different tasks can be learned simultaneously using a single shared network. This integrated framework is the winner of the localization task of the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge 2013 (ILSVRC2013) and obtained very competitive results for the detection and classifications tasks. In post-competition work, we establish a new state of the art for the detection task. Finally, we release a feature extractor from our best model called OverFeat."

This paper uses the PEFAC algorithm to extract features and proposes the use of recurrent neural networks with bidirectional Long ShortTerm Memory (RNN-BLSTM) to model the two pitch contours of a mixture of two speech signals. Compared with feedforward deep neural networks (DNN), which are trained on static framelevel acoustic features, RNN-BLSTM is trained on sequential frame-level features and has more power to learn pitch contour temporal dynamics. The results of evaluations using a speech dataset containing mixtures of two speech signals demonstrate that RNN-BLSTM can substantially outperform DNN in multipitch estimation of mixed speech signals."

A fast, incremental parsing algorithm is developed, motivated by the two-dimensional structure of written mathematics. The approach reports all identifiable parses of the input. The parses are represented as a fuzzy set, in which the membership grade of a parse measures the similarity between it and the handwritten input. To identify and report parses efficiently, we adapt and apply existing techniques such as rectangular partitions and shared parse forests, and introduce new ideas such as relational classes and interchangeability. We also present a correction mechanism that allows users to navigate parse results and choose the correct interpretation in case of recognition errors or ambiguity. Such corrections are incorporated into subsequent incremental recognition results. Finally, we include two empirical evaluations of our recognizer. One uses a novel user-oriented correction count metric, while the other replicates the CROHME 2011 math recognition contest. Both evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach."

The system uses a two-dimensional probabilistic version of the Cocke-Younger-Kasami parsing algorithm to find the most likely parse of the observed image, and then traverses the corresponding parse tree in accordance with translation formats associated with each production rule, to produce eqn I troff commands for the imaged equation. In addition, it uses two-dimensional versions of the Inside/Outside and Baum re-estimation algorithms for learning the parameters of the grammar from a training set of examples.

Given an online handwritten character sample, a series of processing steps, including linear size normalization, adding imaginary strokes, nonlinear shape normalization, equidistance resampling, and smoothing, are performed to derive a 64/spl times/64 normalized online character sample. Then, 8-directional features are extracted from each online trajectory point, and 8 directional pattern images are generated accordingly, from which blurred directional features are extracted at 8/spl times/8 uniformly sampled locations using a filter derived from the Gaussian envelope of a Gabor filter. Finally, a 512-dimensional vector of raw features is formed. Extensive experiments on the task of recognizing 3755 level-1 Chinese characters in GB2312-80 standard are performed to compare and discern the best setting for several algorithmic choices and control parameters. The effectiveness of the studied approach is confirmed."

From a list of symbols with bounding boxes the system analyzes an expression in three successive passes. The Layout Pass constructs a Baseline Structure Tree (BST) describing the two-dimensional arrangement of input symbols. Reading order and operator dominance are used to allow efficient recognition of symbol layout even when symbols deviate greatly from their ideal positions. Next, the Lexical Pass produces a Lexed BST from the initial BST by grouping tokens comprised of multiple input symbols; these include decimal numbers, function names, and symbols comprised of nonoverlapping primitives such as \"=\". The Lexical Pass also labels vertical structures such as fractions and accents. The Lexed BST is translated into L/sup A/T/sub E/X. Additional processing, necessary for producing output for symbolic algebra systems, is carried out in the Expression Analysis Pass. The Lexed BST is translated into an Operator Tree, which describes the order and scope of operations in the input expression. The tree manipulations used in each pass are represented compactly using tree transformations. The compiler-like architecture of the system allows robust handling of unexpected input, increases the scalability of the system, and provides the groundwork for handling dialects of mathematical notation."

While in prose significant constraints can be put on the interpretation of a character by the characters immediately preceding and following it, few such simple constraints are present in a mathematical expression. In order to make the problem tractable, effective methods of recognizing mathematical expressions will need to put intelligent constraints on the possible interpretations. The authors present preliminary results on a system for the recognition of both handwritten and typeset mathematical expressions. While previous systems perform character recognition out of context, the current system maintains ambiguity of the characters until context can be used to disambiguate the interpretation. In addition, the system limits the number of potentially valid interpretations by decomposing the expressions into a sequence of compatible convex regions. The system uses A-star to search for the best possible interpretation of an expression. We provide a new lower bound estimate on the cost to goal that improves performance significantly."

As a result, the most accurate parsers are domain specific, complex, and inefficient. In this paper we show that the domain agnostic attention-enhanced sequence-to-sequence model achieves state-of-the-art results on the most widely used syntactic constituency parsing dataset, when trained on a large synthetic corpus that was annotated using existing parsers. It also matches the performance of standard parsers when trained only on a small human-annotated dataset, which shows that this model is highly data-efficient, in contrast to sequence-to-sequence models without the attention mechanism. Our parser is also fast, processing over a hundred sentences per second with an unoptimized CPU implementation."

We evaluate these recurrent units on the tasks of polyphonic music modeling and speech signal modeling. Our experiments revealed that these advanced recurrent units are indeed better than more traditional recurrent units such as tanh units. Also, we found GRU to be comparable to LSTM."

After separating all symbols in an input mathematical expression, we utilize thirteen features to represent each symbol. In order to reduce the computational time, a coarse classification algorithm is used to reduce the number of candidates. Then for each input symbol, the character with the highest similarity is selected as the candidate symbol. Since some of the symbols in an arithmetical expression may touch each other, a dynamic programming algorithm is adopted to identify correct characters from connected symbols. In the expression formation stage, a procedure-oriented method is proposed for translating the recognized symbols appearing in a 2D space into a 1D character string. The authors have used 105 mathematical expressions as training data and 50 expressions as testing data. The experimental results have demonstrated the feasibility of the understanding system.<<ETX>>"

This system is able to recognize a large class of 2-D mathematic formulas written on a graphic tablet. It starts the parsing by localization of the ``principal'' operator in the formula and attempts to partition it into subexpressions which are similarly analyzed by looking for a starting character. The generalized parser used in the system has been developed in our group for continuous speech recognition and picture interpretation."

However the approaches proposed so far have only been applicable to a few simple network architectures. This paper introduces an easy-to-implement stochastic variational method (or equivalently, minimum description length loss function) that can be applied to most neural networks. Along the way it revisits several common regularisers from a variational perspective. It also provides a simple pruning heuristic that can both drastically reduce the number of network weights and lead to improved generalisation. Experimental results are provided for a hierarchical multidimensional recurrent neural network applied to the TIMIT speech corpus."

Each of the extracted primitives is associated with a \"bounding box\" and its label. Using the attributes of the primitives, the system constructs an initial hierarchy. Construction of an initial hierarchy includes merging a group of primitives into a key word. Next, the system checks the validity of the hierarchy according to conventional mathematical syntax rules. If any syntax error is detected, the system makes attempts to correct the errors. The modification step includes reconfiguring the initial hierarchy, revisiting the original image for possible missing primitives, placing dummy primitives into missing spots in the hierarchy, and so on. The corrected hierarchical structure can be converted into the format for a particular publication system such as T/sub E/X."

                "text": "Document recognition and retrieval technologies complement one another, providing improved access to increasingly large document collections. While recognition and retrieval of textual information is fairly mature, with wide-spread availability of optical character recognition and text-based search engines, recognition and retrieval of graphics such as images, figures, tables, diagrams, and mathematical expressions are in comparatively early stages of research. This paper surveys the state of the art in recognition and retrieval of mathematical expressions, organized around four key problems in math retrieval (query construction, normalization, indexing, and relevance feedback), and four key problems in math recognition (detecting expressions, detecting and classifying symbols, analyzing symbol layout, and constructing a representation of meaning). Of special interest is the machine learning problem of jointly optimizing the component algorithms in a math recognition system, and developing effective indexing, retrieval and relevance feedback algorithms for math retrieval. Another important open problem is developing user interfaces that seamlessly integrate recognition and retrieval. Activity in these important research areas is increasing, in part because math notation provides an excellent domain for studying problems common to many document and graphics recognition and retrieval applications, and also because mature applications will likely provide substantial benefits for education, research, and mathematical literacy."

Automatic recognition of mathematical expressions is one of the key vehicles in the drive towards transcribing documents in scientific and engineering disciplines into electronic form. This problem typically consists of two major stages, namely, symbol recognition and structural analysis. In this survey paper, we will review most of the existing work with respect to each of the two major stages of the recognition process. In particular, we try to put emphasis on the similarities and differences between systems. Moreover, some important issues in mathematical expression recognition will be addressed in depth. All these together serve to provide a clear overall picture of how this research area has been developed to date."

Such a tool could be really useful to be able to re-use knowledge in scientific books which are not available in electronic form. We currently also study use of this system for direct input of formulas with a graphical tablet for computer algebra system softwares. Existing solutions for mathematical recognition have problems to analyze 2D expressions like vectors and matrices. This is because they often try to use extended classical grammar to analyze formulas, relatively to baseline. But a lot of mathematical notations do not respect rules for such a parsing and that is the reason why they fail to extend text parsing technic. We investigate graph grammar and graph rewriting as a solution to recognize 2D mathematical notations. Graph grammar provide a powerful formalism to describe structural manipulations of multi-dimensional data. The main two problems to solve are ambiguities between rules of grammar and construction of graph."

Indeed, this impression is so compelling that we tend to ascribe these properties not only to the external world, but to our internal representations as well. But results from several recent experiments argue against this latter ascription. For example, changes in images of real-world scenes often go unnoticed when made during a saccade, flicker, blink, or movie cut. This \u201cchange blindness\u201d provides strong evidence against the idea that our brains contain a picture-like representation of the scene that is everywhere detailed and coherent.\r\nHow then do we represent a scene? It is argued here that focused attention provides spatiotemporal coherence for the stable representation of one object at a time. It is then argued that the allocation of attention can be co-ordinated to create a \u201cvirtual representation\u201d. In such a scheme, a stable object representation is formed whenever needed, making it appear to higher levels as if all objects in the scene are represented in detail simultaneously."

One system, which includes parts of the intraparietal cortex and superior frontal cortex, is involved in preparing and applying goal-directed (top-down) selection for stimuli and responses. This system is also modulated by the detection of stimuli. The other system, which includes the temporoparietal cortex and inferior frontal cortex, and is largely lateralized to the right hemisphere, is not involved in top-down selection. Instead, this system is specialized for the detection of behaviourally relevant stimuli, particularly when they are salient or unexpected. This ventral frontoparietal network works as a 'circuit breaker' for the dorsal system, directing attention to salient events. Both attentional systems interact during normal vision, and both are disrupted in unilateral spatial neglect."

The original ensemble method is Bayesian averaging, but more recent algorithms include error-correcting output coding, Bagging, and boosting. This paper reviews these methods and explains why ensembles can often perform better than any single classifier. Some previous studies comparing ensemble methods are reviewed, and some new experiments are presented to uncover the reasons that Adaboost does not overfit rapidly."
