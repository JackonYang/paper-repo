These filters can all be expressed in a similar way: First, assign each value to be filtered a position in some vector space. Then, replace every value with a weighted linear combination of all values, with weights determined by a Gaussian function of distance between the positions. If the values are pixel colors and the positions are (x, y) coordinates, this describes a Gaussian blur. If the positions are instead (x, y, r, g, b) coordinates in a five-dimensional space-color volume, this describes a bilateral filter. If we instead set the positions to local patches of color around the associated pixel, this describes non-local means. We describe a Monte-Carlo kd-tree sampling algorithm that efficiently computes any filter that can be expressed in this way, along with a GPU implementation of this technique. We use this algorithm to implement an accelerated bilateral filter that respects full 3D color distance; accelerated non-local means on single images, volumes, and unaligned bursts of images for denoising; and a fast adaptation of non-local means to geometry. If we have n values to filter, and each is assigned a position in a d-dimensional space, then our space complexity is O(dn) and our time complexity is O(dn log n), whereas existing methods are typically either exponential in d or quadratic in n."

In contrast to other methods it is not based on an anisotropic modification of the heat conductance equation, rather on a modification of the way the solution of the heat conductance equation is obtained by convolving the initial data with a Gaussian kernel. Hence the method uses simple non-linear modifications of Gaussian filters, thus avoiding iteration steps and convergence problems. A chain of three to five filters with suitable parameters provides excellent smoothing of fine image details without destroying the coarser structures. The size and contrast of the eliminated details can be selected. The choice of the parameters is not critical and the edges are not displaced when changing the scale. The filter stages can be implemented efficiently on almost any parallel hardware architecture."

The quadratic computational complexity of the summation is a significant barrier to the scalability of this algorithm to practical applications. The fast Gauss transform (FGT) has successfully accelerated the kernel density estimation to linear running time for low-dimensional problems. Unfortunately, the cost of a direct extension of the FGT to higher-dimensional problems grows exponentially with dimension, making it impractical for dimensions above 3. We develop an improved fast Gauss transform to efficiently estimate sums of Gaussians in higher dimensions, where a new multivariate expansion scheme and an adaptive space subdivision technique dramatically improve the performance. The improved FGT has been applied to the mean shift algorithm achieving linear computational complexity. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our algorithm."

By showing that a bilateral filter can be decomposed into a number of constant time spatial filters, our method yields a new class of constant time bilateral filters that can have arbitrary spatial and arbitrary range kernels. In contrast, the current available constant time algorithm requires the use of specific spatial or specific range kernels. Also, our algorithm lends itself to a parallel implementation leading to the first real-time O(1) algorithm that we know of. Meanwhile, our algorithm yields higher quality results since we are effectively quantizing the range function instead of quantizing both the range function and the input image. Empirical experiments show that our algorithm not only gives higher PSNR, but is about 10\u00d7 faster than the state-of-the-art. It also has a small memory footprint, needed only 2% of the memory required by the state-of-the-art for obtaining the same quality as exact using 8-bit images. We also show that our algorithm can be easily extended for O(1) median filtering. Our bilateral filtering algorithm was tested in a number of applications, including HD video conferencing, video abstraction, highlight removal, and multi-focus imaging."

The proposed technique replaces the window similarity by a modified multi-resolution based approach with much fewer comparisons rather than all pixels comparison. This approach also uses the concept of filtering out non-similar neighborhood pixels based on fixed sized window gray mean values. Further, mean values of the variable sized windows in the image are computed efficiently using Summed Image (SI) concept, which requires only 3 additions.

Constant time means that the computation time of the filtering remains same even if the filter size becomes very large. Our first method takes advantage of the integral histograms to avoid the redundant operations for bilateral filters with box spatial and arbitrary range kernels. For bilateral filters constructed by polynomial range and arbitrary spatial filters, our second method provides a direct formulation by using linear filters of image powers without any approximation. Lastly, we show that Gaussian range and arbitrary spatial bilateral filters can be expressed by Taylor series as linear filter decompositions without any noticeable degradation of filter response. All these methods drastically decrease the computation time by cutting it down constant times (e.g. to 0.06 seconds per 1MB image) while achieving very high PSNRpsilas over 45 dB. In addition to the computational advantages, our methods are straightforward to implement."

First, we introduce an efficient implementation of the nonlocal means filter based on arranging the data in a cluster tree. The structuring of data allows for a fast and accurate preselection of similar patches. In contrast to previous approaches, the preselection is based on the same distance measure as used by the filter itself. It allows for large speedups, especially when the search for similar patches covers the whole image domain, i.e., when the filter is truly nonlocal. However, also in the windowed version of the filter, the cluster tree approach compares favorably to previous techniques in respect of quality versus computational cost. Second, we suggest an iterative version of the filter that is derived from a variational principle and is designed to yield nontrivial steady states. It reveals to be particularly useful in order to restore regular, textured patterns."

It has demonstrated great effectiveness for a variety of problems in computer vision and computer graphics, and fast versions have been proposed. Unfortunately, little is known about the accuracy of such accelerations. In this paper, we propose a new signal-processing analysis of the bilateral filter which complements the recent studies that analyzed it as a PDE or as a robust statistical estimator. The key to our analysis is to express the filter in a higher-dimensional space where the signal intensity is added to the original domain dimensions. Importantly, this signal-processing perspective allows us to develop a novel bilateral filtering acceleration using downsampling in space and intensity. This affords a principled expression of accuracy in terms of bandwidth and sampling. The bilateral filter can be expressed as linear convolutions in this augmented space followed by two simple nonlinearities. This allows us to derive criteria for downsampling the key operations and achieving important acceleration of the bilateral filter. We show that, for the same running time, our method is more accurate than previous acceleration techniques. Typically, we are able to process a 2\u00a0megapixel image using our acceleration technique in less than a second, and have the result be visually similar to the exact computation that takes several tens of minutes. The acceleration is most effective with large spatial kernels. Furthermore, this approach extends naturally to color images and cross bilateral filtering.\n"

The original nonlocal means method replaces a noisy pixel by the weighted average of pixels with related surrounding neighborhoods. While producing state-of-the-art denoising results, this method is computationally impractical. In order to accelerate the algorithm, we introduce filters that eliminate unrelated neighborhoods from the weighted average. These filters are based on local average gray values and gradients, preclassifying neighborhoods and thereby reducing the original quadratic complexity to a linear one and reducing the influence of less-related areas in the denoising of a given pixel. We present the underlying framework and experimental results for gray level and color images as well as for video."

Consequently, neighborhood similarity weights for denoising are computed using distances in this subspace rather than the full space. This modification to the non-local means algorithm results in improved accuracy and computational performance. We present an analysis of the proposed method's accuracy as a function of the dimensionality of the projection subspace and demonstrate that denoising accuracy peaks at a relatively low number of dimensions."

Computational and memory costs often require that a smaller solution be run over a downsampled image. Although general purpose upsampling methods can be used to interpolate the low resolution solution to the full resolution, these methods generally assume a smoothness prior for the interpolation. We demonstrate that in cases, such as those above, the available high resolution input image may be leveraged as a prior in the context of a joint bilateral upsampling procedure to produce a better high resolution solution. We show results for each of the applications above and compare them to traditional upsampling methods."

In our framework, users specify rough adjustments that are refined interactively by enforcing the policy that similar edits are applied to spatially-close regions of similar appearance. Rather than proposing a specific user interface, our method allows artists to quickly and imprecisely specify the initial edits with any method or workflow they feel most comfortable with. An energy optimization formulation is used to propagate the initial rough adjustments to the final refined ones by enforcing the editing policy over all pairs of points in the dataset. We show that this formulation is equivalent to solving a large linear system defined by a dense matrix. We derive an approximate algorithm to compute such a solution interactively by taking advantage of the inherent structure of the matrix. We demonstrate our approach by editing images, HDR radiance maps, and measured materials. Finally, we show that our framework generalizes prior methods while providing significant improvements in generality, robustness and efficiency."

The first object of the paper is to present a unified theory of these filters and reliable criteria to compare them to other filter classes. A CCD noise model will be presented justifying the involvement of neighborhood filters. A classification of neighborhood filters will be proposed, including classical image and movie denoising methods and discussing further a recently introduced neighborhood filter, NL-means. In order to compare denoising methods three principles will be discussed. The first principle, \u201cmethod noise\u201d, specifies that only noise must be removed from an image. A second principle will be introduced, \u201cnoise to noise\u201d, according to which a denoising method must transform a white noise into a white noise. Contrarily to \u201cmethod noise\u201d, this principle, which characterizes artifact-free methods, eliminates any subjectivity and can be checked by mathematical arguments and Fourier analysis. \u201cNoise to noise\u201d will be proven to rule out most denoising methods, with the exception of neighborhood filters. This is why a third and new comparison principle, the \u201cstatistical optimality\u201d, is needed and will be introduced to compare the performance of all neighborhood filters.\n\nThe three principles will be applied to compare ten different image and movie denoising methods. It will be first shown that only wavelet thresholding methods and NL-means give an acceptable method noise. Second, that neighborhood filters are the only ones to satisfy the \u201cnoise to noise\u201d principle. Third, that among them NL-means is closest to statistical optimality. A particular attention will be paid to the application of the statistical optimality criterion for movie denoising methods. It will be pointed out that current movie denoising methods are motion compensated neighborhood filters. This amounts to say that they are neighborhood filters and that the ideal neighborhood of a pixel is its trajectory. Unfortunately the aperture problem makes it impossible to estimate ground true trajectories. It will be demonstrated that computing trajectories and restricting the neighborhood to them is harmful for denoising purposes and that space-time NL-means preserves more movie details.\n"

Using traditional density estimation techniques it is difficult to remove stochastic noise inherent for photon-based methods while avoiding overblurring lighting details. In this paper we investigate the use of bilateral filtering for lighting reconstruction based on the local density of photon hit points. Bilateral filtering is applied in spatio-temporal domain and provides control over the level-of-details in reconstructed lighting. All changes of lighting below this level are treated as stochastic noise and are suppressed. Bilateral filtering proves to be efficient in preserving sharp features in lighting which is in particular important for high-quality caustic reconstruction. Also, flickering between subsequent animation frames is substantially reduced due to extending bilateral filtering into temporal domain"

Our method is based on a two-scale non-linear decomposition of an image. We modify the different layers based on their histograms and introduce a technique that controls the spatial variation of detail. We introduce a Poisson correction that prevents potential gradient reversal and preserves detail. In addition to directly controlling the parameters, the user can transfer the look of a model photograph to the picture being edited."

Temporal integration enables us to expand the image's dynamic range while simultaneously reducing noise. Our non-linear exposure variation and denoising filters smoothly transition from temporal to spatial for moving scene elements. Our virtual exposure framework also supports temporally coherent per frame tone mapping. Our system outputs restored video sequences with significantly reduced noise, increased exposure time of dark pixels, intact motion, and improved details."

                "text": "Summary form only given. Many researchers have observed that general purpose computing with programmable graphics hardware (GPUs) has shown promise to solve many of the world's compute intensive problems, many orders of magnitude faster the conventional CPUs. The challenge has been working within the constraints of a graphics programming environment and limited language support to leverage this huge performance potential. GPU computing with CUDA is a new approach to computing where hundreds of on-chip processor cores simultaneously communicate and cooperate to solve complex computing problems, transforming the GPU into a massively parallel processor. The NVIDIA C-compiler for the GPU provides a complete development environment that gives developers the tools they need to solve new problems in computation-intensive applications such as product design, data analysis, technical computing, and game physics. In this talk, I will provide a description of how CUDA can solve compute intensive problems and highlight the challenges when compiling parallel programs for GPUs including the differences between graphics shaders vs. CUDA applications"
