There is no need to make any assumption about the shape of blocks, hence the technique can handle not only skewed pages but it can also be extended to handle documents where columns are not rectangles. In this technique, based on the bottom-up strategy, the connected components are extracted on the reduced image and are classified with their local information. Since the skew angle is also estimated with the local information of blocks, the computational time is very short. Merging text blocks into string lines and into columns is performed with the skew information.<<ETX>>"

The structure of the background (white space) is analyzed, assisted by an enumeration of all maximal white rectangles. For this enumeration, the most computationally expensive step, an algorithm has been developed that, aside from a sort, achieves an expected runtime linear in the number of black connected components. The crucial engineering decision is the specification of a partial order on white rectangles to express domain-specific knowledge of preferred shapes and sizes. This order determines a sequence of partial covers of the background, and thus, a sequence of nested page segmentations. In experimental trials on Manhattan layouts, good segmentations often occur early in this sequence, using a simple and uniform shape-direction rule. This is a global-to-local strategy, which for some tasks is superior to strategies currently emphasized in the literature, including bottom-up and top-down.<<ETX>>"

Because the Hough transform is computationally expensive, the amount of data within a document image is reduced through the computation of its horizontal and vertical black runlengths. Histograms of these runlengths are used to determine whether the document is in portrait or landscape orientation. A gray scale burst image is created from the black runlengths that are perpendicular to the text lines by placing the length of the run in the run's bottom-most pixel. By creating a burst image from the original document image, the processing time of the Hough transform can be reduced by a factor of as much as 7.4 for documents with gray-scale images. Because only small runlengths are input to the Hough transform and because the accumulator array is incremented by the runlength associated with a pixel rather than by a factor of 1, the negative effects of noise, black margins, and figures are avoided. Consequently, interline spacing can be determined more accurately.<<ETX>>"

The algorithm outputs two images, one containing text strings and the other graphics. These images can then be processed by suitable character recognition and graphics recognition systems. The performance of the algorithm, both in terms of its effectiveness and computational efficiency, was evaluated using several test images and showed superior performance compared to other techniques. >"
