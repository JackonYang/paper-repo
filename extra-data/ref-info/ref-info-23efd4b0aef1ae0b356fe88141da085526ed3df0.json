We use dog breed identification as a test case to show that extracting corresponding parts improves classification performance. This domain is especially challenging since the appearance of corresponding parts can vary dramatically, e.g., the faces of bulldogs and beagles are very different. To find accurate correspondences, we build exemplar-based geometric and appearance models of dog breeds and their face parts. Part correspondence allows us to extract and compare descriptors in like image locations. Our approach also features a hierarchy of parts (e.g., face and eyes) and breed-specific part localization. We achieve 67% recognition rate on a large real-world dataset including 133 dog breeds and 8,351 images, and experimental results show that accurate part localization significantly increases classification performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches."

The reference set is used in two ways. First, we use it to perform an \u201cidentity-preserving\u201d alignment, warping the faces in a way that reduces differences due to pose and expression but preserves differences that indicate identity. Second, using the aligned faces, we learn a large set of identity classifiers, each trained on images of just two people. We call these \u201cTom-vs-Pete\u201d classifiers to stress their binary nature. We assemble a collection of these classifiers able to discriminate among a wide variety of subjects and use their outputs as features in a same-or-different classifier on face pairs. We evaluate our method on the Labeled Faces in the Wild benchmark, achieving an accuracy of 93.10%, significantly improving on the published state of the art."

We develop an approach for subordinate categorization in vision, focusing on an avian domain due to the fine-grained structure of the category taxonomy for this domain. We explore a pose-normalized appearance model based on a volumetric poselet scheme. The variation in shape and appearance properties of these parts across a taxonomy provides the cues needed for subordinate categorization. Training pose detectors requires a relatively large amount of training data per category when done from scratch; using a subordinate-level approach, we exploit a pose classifier trained at the basic-level, and extract part appearance and shape information to build subordinate-level models. Our model associates the underlying image pattern parameters used for detection with corresponding volumetric part location, scale and orientation parameters. These parameters implicitly define a mapping from the image pixels into a pose-normalized appearance space, removing view and pose dependencies, facilitating fine-grained categorization from relatively few training examples."

Most of the state-of-the-art basic-level object classification algorithms have difficulties in this challenging problem. One reason for this can be attributed to the popular codebook-based image representation, often resulting in loss of subtle image information that are critical for fine-grained classification. Another way to address this problem is to introduce human annotations of object attributes or key points, a tedious process that is also difficult to generalize to new tasks. In this work, we propose a codebook-free and annotation-free approach for fine-grained image categorization. Instead of using vector-quantized codewords, we obtain an image representation by running a high throughput template matching process using a large number of randomly generated image templates. We then propose a novel bagging-based algorithm to build a final classifier by aggregating a set of discriminative yet largely uncorrelated classifiers. Experimental results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art classification approaches on the Caltech-UCSD Birds dataset."

While the choice of feature representation is often not central to the logic of a given algorithm, the quality of the feature representation can have critically important implications for performance. Here, we demonstrate a large-scale feature search approach to generating new, more powerful feature representations in which a multitude of complex, nonlinear, multilayer neuromorphic feature representations are randomly generated and screened to find those best suited for the task at hand. In particular, we show that a brute-force search can generate representations that, in combination with standard machine learning blending techniques, achieve state-of-the-art performance on the Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) [7] unconstrained face recognition challenge set. These representations outperform previous state-of-the-art approaches, in spite of requiring less training data and using a conceptually simpler machine learning backend. We argue that such large-scale-search-derived feature sets can play a synergistic role with other computer vision approaches by providing a richer base of features with which to work."

Both these measures utilize background samples to facilitate better recognition rates. Second, we examine the ranking of images most similar to a query image and employ these as a descriptor for that image. Finally, we provide results underscoring the importance of proper face alignment in automatic face recognition systems. These contributions in concert allow us to obtain a success rate of 86.83% on the Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) benchmark, outperforming current state-of-the-art results."

The user, who is unable to carry out the recognition task by himself, is interactively asked to provide two heterogeneous forms of information: clicking on object parts and answering binary questions. The machine intelligently selects the most informative question to pose to the user in order to identify the object's class as quickly as possible. By leveraging computer vision and analyzing the user responses, the overall amount of human effort required, measured in seconds, is minimized. We demonstrate promising results on a challenging dataset of uncropped images, achieving a significant average reduction in human effort over previous methods."

This setup has hardly been studied in computer vision research, but it is the rule rather than the exception, because the world contains tens of thousands of different object classes and for only a very few of them image, collections have been formed and annotated with suitable class labels. In this paper, we tackle the problem by introducing attribute-based classification. It performs object detection based on a human-specified high-level description of the target objects instead of training images. The description consists of arbitrary semantic attributes, like shape, color or even geographic information. Because such properties transcend the specific learning task at hand, they can be pre-learned, e.g. from image datasets unrelated to the current task. Afterwards, new classes can be detected based on their attribute representation, without the need for a new training phase. In order to evaluate our method and to facilitate research in this area, we have assembled a new large-scale dataset, \u201cAnimals with Attributes\u201d, of over 30,000 animal images that match the 50 classes in Osherson's classic table of how strongly humans associate 85 semantic attributes with animal classes. Our experiments show that by using an attribute layer it is indeed possible to build a learning object detection system that does not require any training images of the target classes."

Describable visual attributes are labels that can be given to an image to describe its appearance. This paper focuses on images of faces and the attributes used to describe them, although the concepts also apply to other domains. Examples of face attributes include gender, age, jaw shape, nose size, etc. The advantages of an attribute-based representation for vision tasks are manifold: They can be composed to create descriptions at various levels of specificity; they are generalizable, as they can be learned once and then applied to recognize new objects or categories without any further training; and they are efficient, possibly requiring exponentially fewer attributes (and training data) than explicitly naming each category. We show how one can create and label large data sets of real-world images to train classifiers which measure the presence, absence, or degree to which an attribute is expressed in images. These classifiers can then automatically label new images. We demonstrate the current effectiveness-and explore the future potential-of using attributes for face verification and image search via human and computational experiments. Finally, we introduce two new face data sets, named FaceTracer and PubFig, with labeled attributes and identities, respectively."

We consider methods which impose fewer representational assumptions on categories of interest, and exploit contemporary detection schemes which consider the ensemble of responses of detectors trained for specific pose-keypoint configurations. We develop representations for poselet-based pose normalization using both explicit warping and implicit pooling as mechanisms. Our method defines a pose normalized similarity or kernel function that is suitable for nearest-neighbor or kernel-based learning methods."

                "text": "Handling intra-personal variation is a major challenge in face recognition. It is difficult how to appropriately measure the similarity between human faces under significantly different settings (e.g., pose, illumination, and expression). In this paper, we propose a new model, called \u201cAssociate-Predict\u201d (AP) model, to address this issue. The associate-predict model is built on an extra generic identity data set, in which each identity contains multiple images with large intra-personal variation. When considering two faces under significantly different settings (e.g., non-frontal and frontal), we first \u201cassociate\u201d one input face with alike identities from the generic identity date set. Using the associated faces, we generatively \u201cpredict\u201d the appearance of one input face under the setting of another input face, or discriminatively \u201cpredict\u201d the likelihood whether two input faces are from the same person or not. We call the two proposed prediction methods as \u201cappearance-prediction\u201d and \u201clikelihood-prediction\u201d. By leveraging an extra data set (\u201cmemory\u201d) and the \u201cassociate-predict\u201d model, the intra-personal variation can be effectively handled. To improve the generalization ability of our model, we further add a switching mechanism \u2014 we directly compare the appearances of two faces if they have close intra-personal settings; otherwise, we use the associate-predict model for the recognition. Experiments on two public face benchmarks (Multi-PIE and LFW) demonstrated that our final model can substantially improve the performance of most existing face recognition methods"

We combine the features using a multiple kernel framework with a SVM classifier. The weights for each class are learnt using the method of Varma and Ray, which has achieved state of the art performance on other large dataset, such as Caltech 101/256. Our dataset has a similar challenge in the number of classes, but with the added difficulty of large between class similarity and small within class similarity.

To this end we introduce a new annotated dataset of pets covering 37 different breeds of cats and dogs. The visual problem is very challenging as these animals, particularly cats, are very deformable and there can be quite subtle differences between the breeds. We make a number of contributions: first, we introduce a model to classify a pet breed automatically from an image. The model combines shape, captured by a deformable part model detecting the pet face, and appearance, captured by a bag-of-words model that describes the pet fur. Fitting the model involves automatically segmenting the animal in the image. Second, we compare two classification approaches: a hierarchical one, in which a pet is first assigned to the cat or dog family and then to a breed, and a flat one, in which the breed is obtained directly. We also investigate a number of animal and image orientated spatial layouts. These models are very good: they beat all previously published results on the challenging ASIRRA test (cat vs dog discrimination). When applied to the task of discriminating the 37 different breeds of pets, the models obtain an average accuracy of about 59%, a very encouraging result considering the difficulty of the problem."

The goal of our method is to explore fine image statistics and identify the discriminative image patches for recognition. We achieve this goal by combining two ideas, discriminative feature mining and randomization. Discriminative feature mining allows us to model the detailed information that distinguishes different classes of images, while randomization allows us to handle the huge feature space and prevents over-fitting. We propose a random forest with discriminative decision trees algorithm, where every tree node is a discriminative classifier that is trained by combining the information in this node as well as all upstream nodes. Our method is tested on both subordinate categorization and activity recognition datasets. Experimental results show that our method identifies semantically meaningful visual information and outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms on various datasets."

They are particularly useful for fine-grained domains where categories are closely related to one other (e.g. bird species recognition). In such scenarios, relevant attributes are often local (e.g. \u201cwhite belly\u201d), but the question of how to choose these local attributes remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose an interactive approach that discovers local attributes that are both discriminative and semantically meaningful from image datasets annotated only with fine-grained category labels and object bounding boxes. Our approach uses a latent conditional random field model to discover candidate attributes that are detectable and discriminative, and then employs a recommender system that selects attributes likely to be semantically meaningful. Human interaction is used to provide semantic names for the discovered attributes. We demonstrate our method on two challenging datasets, Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011 and Leeds Butterflies, and find that our discovered attributes outperform those generated by traditional approaches."

Our system is able to represent highly variable object classes and achieves state-of-the-art results in the PASCAL object detection challenges. While deformable part models have become quite popular, their value had not been demonstrated on difficult benchmarks such as the PASCAL data sets. Our system relies on new methods for discriminative training with partially labeled data. We combine a margin-sensitive approach for data-mining hard negative examples with a formalism we call latent SVM. A latent SVM is a reformulation of MI--SVM in terms of latent variables. A latent SVM is semiconvex, and the training problem becomes convex once latent information is specified for the positive examples. This leads to an iterative training algorithm that alternates between fixing latent values for positive examples and optimizing the latent SVM objective function."

We describe a set of building blocks for constructing descriptors which can be combined together and jointly optimized so as to minimize the error of a nearest-neighbor classifier. We consider both linear and nonlinear transforms with dimensionality reduction, and make use of discriminant learning techniques such as Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Powell minimization to solve for the parameters. Using these techniques, we obtain descriptors that exceed state-of-the-art performance with low dimensionality. In addition to new experiments and recommendations for descriptor learning, we are also making available a new and realistic ground truth data set based on multiview stereo data."

The method applies to classes of objects that are recognizable by people with appropriate expertise (e.g., animal species or airplane model), but not (in general) by people without such expertise. It can be seen as a visual version of the 20 questions game, where questions based on simple visual attributes are posed interactively. The goal is to identify the true class while minimizing the number of questions asked, using the visual content of the image. We introduce a general framework for incorporating almost any off-the-shelf multi-class object recognition algorithm into the visual 20 questions game, and provide methodologies to account for imperfect user responses and unreliable computer vision algorithms. We evaluate our methods on Birds-200, a difficult dataset of 200 tightly-related bird species, and on the Animals With Attributes dataset. Our results demonstrate that incorporating user input drives up recognition accuracy to levels that are good enough for practical applications, while at the same time, computer vision reduces the amount of human interaction required."

After reviewing existing edge and gradient based descriptors, we show experimentally that grids of histograms of oriented gradient (HOG) descriptors significantly outperform existing feature sets for human detection. We study the influence of each stage of the computation on performance, concluding that fine-scale gradients, fine orientation binning, relatively coarse spatial binning, and high-quality local contrast normalization in overlapping descriptor blocks are all important for good results. The new approach gives near-perfect separation on the original MIT pedestrian database, so we introduce a more challenging dataset containing over 1800 annotated human images with a large range of pose variations and backgrounds."

The approach contributes to the recognition of fine-grain object categories, such as animal and plant species, where it may be difficult to collect many images for training, but where textual descriptions of visual attributes are readily available. As an example we tackle recognition of butterfly species, learning models from descriptions in an online nature guide. We propose natural language processing methods for extracting salient visual attributes from these descriptions to use as \u2018templates\u2019 for the object categories, and apply vision methods to extract corresponding attributes from test images. A generative model is used to connect textual terms in the learnt templates to visual attributes. We report experiments comparing the performance of humans and the proposed method on a dataset of ten butterfly categories."

This leads to misclassification. To classify dog breed using face local parts which represent the breed characters can improve the accuracy. However, finding and capturing each local part from dog face images are time-consuming. This paper proposes a method to improve speed of dog breed classification using size and position from local parts in the dog face images and PCA. Firstly, size and position of each local part form the dog face images is trained. Then, the sizes and positions are used to find and capture each local part from test images. Within each part, the Principle Component Analysis (PCA) is applied to classify the dog breed. In the PCA-based classification, Test local part images are represented in term of Eigen vectors. The vectors are compared with main feature part templates for each breed in the database and are calculated as weight. The image under test is classified as the breed that gives the minimum weight between test image and train image. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, experiments with 350 dog face images from 35 dog breeds had been performed. Before the testing, 3 dog face images from every breed (totally 105 dog faces) are divided into 3 main feature parts (left ear, right ear, face without ears) to train the system. The experiments show that he proposed system is faster than the conventional system around 4 times."

Training linear SVMs however is quite expensive, and can become intractable as the number of categories increase. In this work we revisit a much older technique, viz. Linear Discriminant Analysis, and show that LDA models can be trained almost trivially, and with little or no loss in performance. The covariance matrices we estimate capture properties of natural images. Whitening HOG features with these covariances thus removes naturally occuring correlations between the HOG features. We show that these whitened features (which we call WHO) are considerably better than the original HOG features for computing similarities, and prove their usefulness in clustering. Finally, we use our findings to produce an object detection system that is competitive on PASCAL VOC 2007 while being considerably easier to train and test."

These parameters include such variables as position, pose, lighting, background, camera quality, and gender. While there are many applications for face recognition technology in which one can control the parameters of image acquisition, there are also many applications in which the practitioner has little or no control over such parameters. This database, Labeled Faces in the Wild, is provided as an aid in studying the latter, unconstrained, recognition problem. The database contains labeled face photographs spanning the range of conditions typically encountered in everyday life. The database exhibits \u201cnatural\u201d variability in factors such as pose, lighting, race, accessories, occlusions, and background. In addition to describing the details of the database, we provide specific experimental paradigms for which the database is suitable. This is done in an effort to make research performed with the database as consistent and comparable as possible. We provide baseline results, including results of a state of the art face recognition system combined with a face alignment system. To facilitate experimentation on the database, we provide several parallel databases, including an aligned version."

The features are invariant to image scaling, translation, and rotation, and partially invariant to illumination changes and affine or 3D projection. These features share similar properties with neurons in inferior temporal cortex that are used for object recognition in primate vision. Features are efficiently detected through a staged filtering approach that identifies stable points in scale space. Image keys are created that allow for local geometric deformations by representing blurred image gradients in multiple orientation planes and at multiple scales. The keys are used as input to a nearest neighbor indexing method that identifies candidate object matches. Final verification of each match is achieved by finding a low residual least squares solution for the unknown model parameters. Experimental results show that robust object recognition can be achieved in cluttered partially occluded images with a computation time of under 2 seconds."

This is very challenging due to image variations in lighting, pose, facial expression, and age. The task boils down to computing the distance between two face vectors. As such, appropriate distance metrics are essential for face verification accuracy. In this paper we propose a new method, named the Cosine Similarity Metric Learning (CSML) for learning a distance metric for facial verification. The use of cosine similarity in our method leads to an effective learning algorithm which can improve the generalization ability of any given metric. Our method is tested on the state-of-the-art dataset, the Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW), and has achieved the highest accuracy in the literature."

At least two reasons account for this trend: the first is the wide range of commercial and law enforcement applications, and the second is the availability of feasible technologies after 30 years of research. Even though current machine recognition systems have reached a certain level of maturity, their success is limited by the conditions imposed by many real applications. For example, recognition of face images acquired in an outdoor environment with changes in illumination and/or pose remains a largely unsolved problem. In other words, current systems are still far away from the capability of the human perception system.This paper provides an up-to-date critical survey of still- and video-based face recognition research. There are two underlying motivations for us to write this survey paper: the first is to provide an up-to-date review of the existing literature, and the second is to offer some insights into the studies of machine recognition of faces. To provide a comprehensive survey, we not only categorize existing recognition techniques but also present detailed descriptions of representative methods within each category. In addition, relevant topics such as psychophysical studies, system evaluation, and issues of illumination and pose variation are covered."

We make a number of novel contributions towards this goal: first, it is shown that learning the pooling regions for the descriptor can be formulated as a convex optimisation problem selecting the regions using sparsity; second, it is shown that dimensionality reduction can also be formulated as a convex optimisation problem, using the nuclear norm to reduce dimensionality. Both of these problems use large margin discriminative learning methods. The third contribution is a new method of obtaining the positive and negative training data in a weakly supervised manner. And, finally, we employ a state-of-the-art stochastic optimizer that is efficient and well matched to the non-smooth cost functions proposed here. It is demonstrated that the new learning methods improve over the state of the art in descriptor learning for large scale matching, Brown et al. [2], and large scale object retrieval, Philbin et al. [10]."

The method is based on recognizing that certain local binary patterns, termed \"uniform,\" are fundamental properties of local image texture and their occurrence histogram is proven to be a very powerful texture feature. We derive a generalized gray-scale and rotation invariant operator presentation that allows for detecting the \"uniform\" patterns for any quantization of the angular space and for any spatial resolution and presents a method for combining multiple operators for multiresolution analysis. The proposed approach is very robust in terms of gray-scale variations since the operator is, by definition, invariant against any monotonic transformation of the gray scale. Another advantage is computational simplicity as the operator can be realized with a few operations in a small neighborhood and a lookup table. Experimental results demonstrate that good discrimination can be achieved with the occurrence statistics of simple rotation invariant local binary patterns."
