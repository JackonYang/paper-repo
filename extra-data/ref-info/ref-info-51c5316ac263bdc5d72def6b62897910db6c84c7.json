These algorithms are usually defined informally as a sequence of decisions with supporting data observations and transformations. In this investigation, we formalize these algorithms as strategies in an imitation game, where the goal of the game is to match table interpretations from a chosen procedure as closely as possible. The chosen procedure may be a person or persons producing \u2018ground truth,\u2019 or an algorithm. \nTo describe table recognition strategies we have defined the Recognition Strategy Language (RSL). RSL is a simple functional language for describing strategies as sequences of abstract decision types whose results are determined by any suit able decision method. RSL defines and maintains interpretation trees, a simple data structure for describing recognition results. For each interpretation in an interpretation tree, we annotate hypothesis histories which capture the creation, revision, and rejection of individual hypotheses, such as the logical type and structure of regions. \nWe present a proof-of-concept using two strategies from the literature. We demonstrate how RSL allows strategies to be specified at the level of decisions rather than algorithms, and we compare results of our strategy implementations using new techniques. In particular, we introduce historical recall and precision metrics. Conventional recall and precision characterize hypotheses accepted after a strategy has finished. Historical recall and precision provide additional information by describing all generated hypotheses, including any rejected in the final result."

This paper presents an approach to extract the logical structure of text documents. The extracted structure is explicated by means of SGML (Standard Generalized Markup Language). Consequently, the extraction is achieved on the basis of grammars that extend SGML with recognition rules. From these grammars parsing automata are generated. These automata are used to partition a flat text document into its elements, to discard formatting information, and to insert SGML markups. Complex document structures and fallback rules needed for error tolerant parsing make such automata highly ambiguous. A novel parsing strategy has been developed that ranks and prunes ambiguous parsing paths."

We therefore propose a new generic document recognition method, called DMOS (Description and MOdification of Segmentation), that is made up of a new grammatical formalism, called EPF (Enhanced Position Formalism) and an associated parser which is able to introduce context in segmentation. We implement this method to obtain a generator of document recognition systems. This generator can automatically produce new recognition systems. It is only necessary to describe the document with an EPF grammar, which is then simply compiled. In this way, we have developed various recognition systems: one on musical scores, one on mathematical formulae and one on recursive table structures. We have also defined a specific application to damaged military forms of the 19th Century. We have been able to test the generated system on 5,000 of these military forms. This has permitted us to validate the DMOS method on a real-world application."

In this paper we describe a general solution to the problem of recognizing the structure of a detected table region. First hierarchial clustering is used to identify columns and then spatial and lexical criteria to classify headers. We also address the problem of evaluating table structure recognition. Our model is based on a directed acyclic attribute graph, or table DAG. We describe a new paradigm, 'random graph probing,' for comparing the results returned by the recognition system and the representation created during ground-truthing. Probing is in fact a general concept that could be applied to other document recognition tasks and perhaps even other computer vision problems as well."

A table analysis system is described which reconstructs table formatting information from table images whether or not the cells are explicitly delimited. Inputs to the system are word bounding boxes and any horizontal and vertical lines that delimit cells. Using a sequence of carefully-crafted rules, multi-line cells and their interrelationships are found even though no explicit delimiters are visible. This robust system is a component of a commercial document recognition system."

The system also includes a powerful and flexible user interface."
