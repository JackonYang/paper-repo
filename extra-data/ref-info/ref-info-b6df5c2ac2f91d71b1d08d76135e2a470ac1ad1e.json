The algorithm put forth uses a representation of the space of those rules consistent with the observed training data. This \"rule version space\" is modified in response to new training instances by eliminating candidate rule versions found to conflict with each new instance. The use of version spaces is discussed in the context of Meta-DENDRAL, a program which learns rules in the domain of chemical spectroscopy."

A pattern of induction is defined as a framework which relates a theory of behavior generation, underlying knowledge structures, and a learning methodology. One particular learning theory, called interference matching, suggests that knowledge structures which underlie behavior descriptions can be directly abstracted from those descriptions. Because of the close connection between descriptions and inferences in such a framework, the strengths and weaknesses of several types of descriptions are considered. Algorithms which exploit this theory are presented for three classes of problems: pattern learning and classification; induction of quantified production rules; and the induction of syntactic categories and phrase structure rules. Preliminary results are presented and directions for future research are outlined."

'Mathematics' is considered as a type of intelligent behavior, not as a finished product. The local heuristics communicate via an agenda mechanism, a global list of tasks for the system to perform and reasons why each task is plausible. A single task might direct AM to define a new concept, or to explore some facet of an existing concept, or to examine some empirical data for regularities, etc. Repeatedly, the program selects from the agenda the task having the best supporting reasons, and then executes it. Each concept is an active, structured knowledge module. A hundred very incomplete modules are initially provided, each one corresponding to an elementary set-theoretic concept (e.g.,union). This provides a definite but immense 'space' which AM begins to explore. AM extends its knowledge base, ultimately rediscovering hundreds of common concepts (e.g., numbers) and theorems (e.g., unique factorization). This approach to plausible inference contains great powers and great limitations."

This method involves examining a predetermined space or language of possible concept descriptions, finding those which are consistent with the observed training instances. Rather than use heuristic search techniques to examine this concept description space, the subspace (version space) of all plausible concept descriptions is represented and updated with each training instance. This version space approach determines all concept descriptions consistent with the training instances, without backtracking to reexamine past training instances or previously rejected concept descriptions. Proofs are given for the correctness of the method for representing version spaces, and of the associated concept learning algorithm, for any countably infinite concept description language. Empirical results obtained from computer implementations in two domains are presented. The version space approach has been implemented as one component of the Meta-DENDRAL program for learning production rules in the domain of chemical spectroscopy. Its implementation in this program is described in detail."

The proposed method, interference matching, induces abstractions by finding relational properties common to two or more exemplars. Three tasks solved by a program that uses an interference-matching algorithm are presented. Several problems concerning the description of the training examples and the adequacy of interference matching are discussed, and directions for future research are considered."

The paper formulates the theoretical framework and a method for inferring general and optimal (according to certain criteria) descriptions of object classes from examples of classification or partial descriptions. The language for expressing the class descriptions and the guidance rules is an extension of the first-order predicate calculus, called variable-valued logic calculus VL21. VL21 involves typed variables and contains several new operators especially suited for conducting inductive inference, such as selector, internal disjunction, internal conjunction, exception, and generalization. Important aspects of the theory include: 1) a formulation of several kinds of generalization rules; 2) an ability to uniformly and adequately handle descriptors (i.e., variables, functions, and predicates) of different type (nominal, linear, and structured) and of different arity (i.e., different number of arguments); 3) an ability to generate new descriptors, which are derived from the initial descriptors through a rule-based system (i.e., an ability to conduct the so called constructive induction); 4) an ability to use the semantics underlying the problem under consideration. An experimental computer implementation of the method is briefly described and illustrated by an example."

Three main subprobleras are discussed: (1) explain the experimental data for each individual chemical structure, (2) generalize the results from each structure to all structures, and (3) organize the generalizations into a unified theory. The program is built upon the concepts and programmed routines already available in the Heuristic DENDRAL performance program, but goes beyond the performance program in attempting to formulate the theory which the performance program will use."
