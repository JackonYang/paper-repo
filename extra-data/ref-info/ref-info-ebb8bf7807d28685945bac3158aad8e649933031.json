Using log-likelihood algebra, we show that any decoder can be used which accepts soft inputs-including a priori values-and delivers soft outputs that can be split into three terms: the soft channel and a priori inputs, and the extrinsic value. The extrinsic value is used as an a priori value for the next iteration. Decoding algorithms in the log-likelihood domain are given not only for convolutional codes but also for any linear binary systematic block code. The iteration is controlled by a stop criterion derived from cross entropy, which results in a minimal number of iterations. Optimal and suboptimal decoders with reduced complexity are presented. Simulation results show that very simple component codes are sufficient, block codes are appropriate for high rates and convolutional codes for lower rates less than 2/3. Any combination of block and convolutional component codes is possible. Several interleaving techniques are described. At a bit error rate (BER) of 10/sup -4/ the performance is slightly above or around the bounds given by the cutoff rate for reasonably simple block/convolutional component codes, interleaver sizes less than 1000 and for three to six iterations."

After reviewing a variety of graphical models (Markov random fields, Tanner graphs, and Bayesian networks), we derive a general distributed marginalization algorithm for functions described by factor graphs. From this general algorithm, Pearl's (1986) belief propagation algorithm is easily derived as a special case. We point out that iterative decoding algorithms for various codes, including \"turbo decoding\" of parallel-concatenated convolutional codes, may be viewed as probability propagation in a graphical model of the code. We focus on Bayesian network descriptions of codes, which give a natural input/state/output/channel description of a code and channel, and we indicate how iterative decoders can be developed for parallel-and serially concatenated coding systems, product codes, and low-density parity-check codes."

A graph is shown which specifies carefully chosen subsets of the digits of the new codes that must be codewords in one of the shorter subcodes. Lower bounds to the rate and the minimum distance of the new code are derived in terms of the parameters of the graph and the subeodes. Both the encoders and decoders proposed are shown to take advantage of the code's explicit decomposition into subcodes to decompose and simplify the associated computational processes. Bounds on the performance of two specific decoding algorithms are established, and the asymptotic growth of the complexity of decoding for two types of codes and decoders is analyzed. The proposed decoders are able to make effective use of probabilistic information supplied by the channel receiver, e.g., reliability information, without greatly increasing the number of computations required. It is shown that choosing a transmission order for the digits that is appropriate for the graph and the subcodes can give the code excellent burst-error correction abilities.

This is achieved by channel coding with expanded sets of multilevel/phase signals in a manner which increases free Euclidean distance. Soft maximum--likelihood (ML) decoding using the Viterbi algorithm is assumed. Following a discussion of channel capacity, simple hand-designed trellis codes are presented for 8 phase-shift keying (PSK) and 16 quadrature amplitude-shift keying (QASK) modulation. These simple codes achieve coding gains in the order of 3-4 dB. It is then shown that the codes can be interpreted as binary convolutional codes with a mapping of coded bits into channel signals, which we call \"mapping by set partitioning.\" Based on a new distance measure between binary code sequences which efficiently lower-bounds the Euclidean distance between the corresponding channel signal sequences, a search procedure for more powerful codes is developed. Codes with coding gains up to 6 dB are obtained for a variety of multilevel/phase modulation schemes. Simulation results are presented and an example of carrier-phase tracking is discussed."

In particular, the recent success of turbo codes indicates that performance close to the Shannon limit may be achieved. In this thesis, it is showed that many iterative decoding algorithms are special cases of two generic algorithms, the min-sum and sum-product algorithms, which also include non-iterative algorithms such as Viterbi decoding. The min-sum and sum-product algorithms are developed and presented as generalized trellis algorithms, where the time axis of the trellis is replaced by an arbitrary graph, the \u201cTanner graph\u201d. With cycle-free Tanner graphs, the resulting decoding algorithms (e.g., Viterbi decoding) are maximum-likelihood but suffer from an exponentially increasing complexity. Iterative decoding occurs when the Tanner graph has cycles (e.g., turbo codes); the resulting algorithms are in general suboptimal, but significant complexity reductions are possible compared to the cycle-free case. Several performance estimates for iterative decoding are developed, including a generalization of the union bound used with Viterbi decoding and a characterization of errors that are uncorrectable after infinitely many decoding iterations."

The typical minimum distance of these codes increases linearly with block length for a fixed rate and fixed j . When used with maximum likelihood decoding on a sufficiently quiet binary-input symmetric channel, the typical probability of decoding error decreases exponentially with block length for a fixed rate and fixed j . A simple but nonoptimum decoding scheme operating directly from the channel a posteriori probabilities is described. Both the equipment complexity and the data-handling capacity in bits per second of this decoder increase approximately linearly with block length. For j > 3 and a sufficiently low rate, the probability of error using this decoder on a binary symmetric channel is shown to decrease at least exponentially with a root of the block length.

The codes are built from highly irregular bipartite graphs with carefully chosen degree patterns on both sides. Our theoretical analysis of the codes is based on the work of Richardson and Urbanke (see ibid., vol.47, no.2, p.599-618, 2000). Assuming that the underlying communication channel is symmetric, we prove that the probability densities at the message nodes of the graph possess a certain symmetry. Using this symmetry property we then show that, under the assumption of no cycles, the message densities always converge as the number of iterations tends to infinity. Furthermore, we prove a stability condition which implies an upper bound on the fraction of errors that a belief-propagation decoder can correct when applied to a code induced from a bipartite graph with a given degree distribution. Our codes are found by optimizing the degree structure of the underlying graphs. We develop several strategies to perform this optimization. We also present some simulation results for the codes found which show that the performance of the codes is very close to the asymptotic theoretical bounds."

The input bits to the first encoder are scrambled by the interleaver before entering the second encoder. The codeword of the parallel concatenated code consists of the input bits to the first encoder followed by the parity check bits of both encoders. This construction can be generalized to any number of constituent codes. Parallel concatenated schemes employing two convolutional codes as constituent codes, in connection with an iterative decoding algorithm of complexity comparable to that of the constituent codes, have been previously shown to yield remarkable coding gains close to theoretical limits. They have been named, and are known as, \"turbo codes\". We propose a method to evaluate an upper bound to the bit error probability of a parallel concatenated coding scheme averaged over all interleavers of a given length. The analytical bounding technique is then used to shed some light on some crucial questions, which have been floating around in the communications community since the proposal of turbo codes."

(1993) and an algorithm that has been well known in the artificial intelligence community for a decade, but which is relatively unknown to information theorists: Pearl's (1982) belief propagation algorithm. We see that if Pearl's algorithm is applied to the \"belief network\" of a parallel concatenation of two or more codes, the turbo decoding algorithm immediately results. Unfortunately, however, this belief diagram has loops, and Pearl only proved that his algorithm works when there are no loops, so an explanation of the experimental performance of turbo decoding is still lacking. However, we also show that Pearl's algorithm can be used to routinely derive previously known iterative, but suboptimal, decoding algorithms for a number of other error-control systems, including Gallager's (1962) low-density parity-check codes, serially concatenated codes, and product codes. Thus, belief propagation provides a very attractive general methodology for devising low-complexity iterative decoding algorithms for hybrid coded systems."

We improve on Gallager's results by introducing irregular parity-check matrices and a new rigorous analysis of hard-decision decoding of these codes. We also provide efficient methods for finding good irregular structures for such decoding algorithms. Our rigorous analysis based on martingales, our methodology for constructing good irregular codes, and the demonstration that irregular structure improves performance constitute key points of our contribution. We also consider irregular codes under belief propagation. We report the results of experiments testing the efficacy of irregular codes on both binary-symmetric and Gaussian channels. For example, using belief propagation, for rate 1/4 codes on 16000 bits over a binary-symmetric channel, previous low-density parity-check codes can correct up to approximately 16% errors, while our codes correct over 17%. In some cases our results come very close to reported results for turbo codes, suggesting that variations of irregular low density parity-check codes may be able to match or beat turbo code performance."

In this paper we investigate the behavior of an PPA in graphs with a single cycle such as the graph of a tail-biting code. First, we show that for strictly positive local kernels, the iterations of the PPA converge to a unique fixed point, (which was also observed by Anderson and Hladik (1998) and Weiss (1997)). Secondly, we shall generalize a result of McEliece and Rodemich (1995), by showing that if the hidden variables in the cycle are binary-valued, the PPA will always make an optimal decision. (This was also observed independently by Weiss). When the hidden variables can assume 3 or more values, the behavior of the PPA is much harder to characterize."

They then present some theoretical bounds for, and some numerical tables of; IIR code fragments with maximal input weight-2 free distance."

When the graph is singly connected, local propagation rules of the sort proposed by Pearl (1988) are guaranteed to converge to the correct posterior probabilities. Recently a number of researchers have empirically demonstrated good performance of these same local propagation schemes on graphs with loops, but a theoretical understanding of this performance has yet to be achieved. For graphical models with a single loop, we derive an analytical relationship between the probabilities computed using local propagation and the correct marginals. Using this relationship we show a category of graphical models with loops for which local propagation gives rise to provably optimal maximum a posteriori assignments (although the computed marginals will be incorrect). We also show how nodes can use local information in the messages they receive in order to correct their computed marginals. We discuss how these results can be extended to graphical models with multiple loops and show simulation results suggesting that some properties of propagation on single-loop graphs may hold for a larger class of graphs. Specifically we discuss the implication of our results for understanding a class of recently proposed error-correcting codes known as turbo codes."
