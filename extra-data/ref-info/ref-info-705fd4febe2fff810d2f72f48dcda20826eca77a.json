This model is inspired by the restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM), which has been shown to be a powerful model of such distributions. However, an RBM typically does not provide a tractable distribution estimator, since evaluating the probability it assigns to some given observation requires the computation of the so-called partition function, which itself is intractable for RBMs of even moderate size. Our model circumvents this diculty by decomposing the joint distribution of observations into tractable conditional distributions and modeling each conditional using a non-linear function similar to a conditional of an RBM. Our model can also be interpreted as an autoencoder wired such that its output can be used to assign valid probabilities to observations. We show that this new model outperforms other multivariate binary distribution estimators on several datasets and performs similarly to a large (but intractable) RBM."

Efficient greedy algorithms for learning and approximate inference have allowed these models to be applied successfully in many application domains. The main building block of a DBN is a bipartite undirected graphical model called a restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM). Due to the presence of the partition function, model selection, complexity control, and exact maximum likelihood learning in RBM's are intractable. We show that Annealed Importance Sampling (AIS) can be used to efficiently estimate the partition function of an RBM, and we present a novel AIS scheme for comparing RBM's with different architectures. We further show how an AIS estimator, along with approximate inference, can be used to estimate a lower bound on the log-probability that a DBN model with multiple hidden layers assigns to the test data. This is, to our knowledge, the first step towards obtaining quantitative results that would allow us to directly assess the performance of Deep Belief Networks as generative models of data."

In this paper we propose a new architecture for modeling high-dimensional data that requires resources (parameters and computations) that grow only at most as the square of the number of variables, using a multi-layer neural network to represent the joint distribution of the variables as the product of conditional distributions. The neural network can be interpreted as a graphical model without hidden random variables, but in which the conditional distributions are tied through the hidden units. The connectivity of the neural network can be pruned by using dependency tests between the variables. Experiments on modeling the distribution of several discrete data sets show statistically significant improvements over other methods such as naive Bayes and comparable Bayesian networks, and show that significant improvements can be obtained by pruning the network."

Specifically, stacking is used to form a linear combination of finite mixture model and kernel density estimators for non-parametric multivariate density estimation. The method outperforms other strategies such as choosing the single best model based on cross-validation, combining with uniform weights, and even using the single best model chosen by \u201cCheating\u201d and examining the test set. We also investigate (1) how the utility of stacking changes when one of the models being combined is the model that generated the data, (2) how the stacking coefficients of the models compare to the relative frequencies with which cross-validation chooses among the models, (3) visualization of combined \u201ceffective\u201d kernels, and (4) the sensitivity of stacking to overfitting as model complexity increases."

We introduce and motivate a new training principle for unsupervised learning of a representation based on the idea of making the learned representations robust to partial corruption of the input pattern. This approach can be used to train autoencoders, and these denoising autoencoders can be stacked to initialize deep architectures. The algorithm can be motivated from a manifold learning and information theoretic perspective or from a generative model perspective. Comparative experiments clearly show the surprising advantage of corrupting the input of autoencoders on a pattern classification benchmark suite."

This thesis presents methods that overcome the difficulty of training RNNs, and applications of RNNs to challenging problems. \nWe first describe a new probabilistic sequence model that combines Restricted Boltzmann Machines and RNNs. The new model is more powerful than similar models while being less difficult to train. \nNext, we present a new variant of the Hessian-free (HF) optimizer and show that it can train RNNs on tasks that have extreme long-range temporal dependencies, which were previously considered to be impossibly hard. We then apply HF to character-level language modelling and get excellent results. \nWe also apply HF to optimal control and obtain RNN control laws that can successfully operate under conditions of delayed feedback and unknown disturbances. \nFinally, we describe a random parameter initialization scheme that allows gradient descent with momentum to train RNNs on problems with long-term dependencies. This directly contradicts widespread beliefs about the inability of first-order methods to do so, and suggests that previous attempts at training RNNs failed partly due to flaws in the random initialization."

Deep architectures are composed of multiple levels of non-linear operations, such as in neural nets with many hidden layers or in complicated propositional formulae re-using many sub-formulae. Searching the parameter space of deep architectures is a difficult optimization task, but learning algorithms such as those for Deep Belief Networks have recently been proposed to tackle this problem with notable success, beating the state-of-the-art in certain areas. This paper discusses the motivations and principles regarding learning algorithms for deep architectures, in particular those exploiting as building blocks unsupervised learning of single-layer models such as Restricted Boltzmann Machines, used to construct deeper models such as Deep Belief Networks."

The algorithm 1) predicts bits sequentially from those previously seen and 2) has a structure and a number of computations similar to an autoencoder. The likelihood under the model can be calculated exactly, and arithmetic coding can be used directly for compression. When training on digits the algorithm learns filters similar to those of restricted boltzman machines and denoising autoencoders. Independent samples can be drawn from the model by a single sweep through the pixels. The algorithm has a good compression performance when compared to other methods that work under random ordering of pixels."

Chapter 3 focuses on selection of two-level factorial designs and discusses complementary design theory and related topics in the selection of designs. Chapter 4 covers the selection of three level designs followed by the general case of s-levels. Chapter 5 discusses estimation capacity, presenting the connections with complementary designs followed by the estimation capacity for two-level and s-level designs. Chapter 6 discusses and presents results for the construction of mixed-level designs. Giving many examples of the use of mixed two and four-level designs. The final unit of the book discusses designs where there are two-different groups of factors. Chapters 7 and 8 discuss factorial designs with restricted randomization. Focusing first on blocked designs for full factorials as well as blocked fractional factorial designs. Chapter 8 focuses on split-plot designs. The booked is concluded with a chapter on robust parameter designs. This book covers a broad range of topics for regular factorial designs and presents all of the material in very mathematical fashion. However, the authors do a wonderful job of keeping the statistical methodology at the forefront of the book and the mathematical detail is presented as the necessary tool to study these designs. The book will serve as a great text for an advanced graduate level course in design theory for students with the necessary mathematical background. The book will surely become an invaluable resource for researchers and graduate students doing research in the design of factorial experiments. In addition, practitioners will also find the book useful for the comprehensive collection of optimal designs presented at the end of many chapters. Overall, this is a very well written book and a necessary addition to the existing literature on the design of factorial experiments."

The simulation results show that the proposed method performs well in comparison with the back propagation through time algorithm."
