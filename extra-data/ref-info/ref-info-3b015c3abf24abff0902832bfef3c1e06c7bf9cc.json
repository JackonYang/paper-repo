It could be continuously varied both in contrast and fineness (spatial frequency) without the mean luminance of the screen changing. The energy distribution across the grating varied sinuosoidally. The grating filled a rectangular area subtending 2\u00b0 by 1.3\u00b0, and was surrounded by a circular field of 12\u00b0 diameter of the same luminance as the oscilloscope screen (80 cd/m2). The screen was viewed from 57 in., and in all the experiments particular care was taken to correct the eye to within 0.12 diopter with spectacle lenses."

Controlling the modulation amplitude independently of the time-average radiance provides an additional degree of freedom, so that the observer\u2019s adaptation level can be held constant while his amplitude sensitivity is measured as a function of the modulation frequency. With an \u201cedgeless\u201d flickering field, these amplitude sensitivity curves show a broad peak of maximum visual response, in the region from 10 to 20 cps at high photopic levels. Such classic relationships as the Ferry-Porter, Talbot-Plateau, and Weber-Fechner laws are derivable from the present results, as descriptions of the behavior of certain parts of the amplitude sensitivity curves as functions of adaptation level."

The traveling waves were detected by the subject over a range of three log units of background illuminance, including various spatial- and temporal-frequency combinations. The experiments indicate that no resonance phenomena occur in the spatiotemporal color-discrimination system of the eye. This system probably functions as a low-pass filter. The color coding takes place in much narrower frequency bands than the brightness coding. A regular motion of the pattern never enhances the visibility of the color gratings. The temporal characteristics of the chromatic-discrimination system show very much resemblance to its spatial qualities. Our experiments show that the threshold chromatic contrast is proportional to the square root of the illuminance. This fundamental relationship can easily be understood from the statistical properties of the photons, absorbed in the differential receptor systems."

When adjacent grating bars are matched in brightness, wavelength-difference thresholds in all regions of the spectrum increase with spatial frequency within the range of 2.4\u201319.9 cycles per degree (cpd). Unlike luminance-modulated gratings, no sign of low-frequency attenuation was found. Wavelength differences alone do not yield good visual acuity. Small brightness mismatches between adjacent grating bars generally improve wavelength discrimination and cause low-frequency attenuation in the wavelength modulation vs spatial-frequency function so that it resembles conventional luminance modulation vs spatial-frequency functions."

Evaluation of characteristics is limited to elements preceding the computer, and particularly to the \u201cluminance channel\u201d of the color system.The primary photoelectric transfer characteristics n\u00af1=f(Er) of the receptors (rods and cones) are computed as a function of retinal illumination (Er) from threshold signal-to-noise ratios in the effective image area of point sources, disks, and other test objects. The effective image area, which is the convolution of the object area with the sampling area of the visual system, is determined from its Fourier spectrum. The constants of the transfer functions are established from the optical constants of the eye, its storage-time function, and the maximum transfer ratio of statistical units of the rod and cone systems. There is little room for variation of constants, if they are to remain in agreement with observed values."
