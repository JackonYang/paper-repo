The main algorithm has two functions: it generates text region candidates, and it verifies of the label of the candidates (text or non-text). The text region candidates are generated through a modified K-means clustering algorithm, which references texture features, edge information and color information. The candidate labels are then verified in a global sense by the Markov Random Field model where collinearity weight is added as long as most texts are aligned. The proposed method achieves reasonable accuracy for text extraction from moderately difficult examples from the ICDAR 2003 database."

First, it applies the simplified visual attention model to highlight the region of interest (ROI) in an input image and to yield a map, named the VA map, consisting of the ROIs. Second, an edge map of image containing the edge information of four directions is obtained by Sobel operators. Character areas are detected by connected component analysis and merged into candidate text regions. Finally, the VA map is employed to confirm the candidate text regions. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively extract text information and locate text regions contained in camera-based images. It is robust not only for font, size, color, language, space, alignment and complexity of background, but also for perspective distortion and skewed texts embedded in images."

In this paper, we propose an algorithm that employs two novel filters and a basic component-based text detection framework. The framework uses the Niblack algorithm to threshold images and groups components into regions with commonly used geometry features. The intensity filter considers the overlap between the intensity histogram of a component and that of its adjoining area. For non-text regions, we have found that this overlap is large, and so we can prune out components with large values of this measure. The shape filter, on the other hand, deletes regions whose constituent components come from a same object, as most words consist of different characters. The proposed method is evaluated with the text locating database with 249 images used in the ICDAR2003 robust reading competition. The result shows that the algorithm is robust to both indoor images and outdoor images, even for the images of complex background, which usually is a hard factor to overcome for traditional component-based algorithms. In terms of performance statistics, we tested the algorithm on the ICDAR 2003 challenge experiment, and the algorithm achieves 66% precision rate (p), 46% recall rate (r), and 54% the combined rate ( f ), which is the best reported in the literature on this dataset."

The suggested operator is local and data dependent, which makes it fast and robust enough to eliminate the need for multi-scale computation or scanning windows. Extensive testing shows that the suggested scheme outperforms the latest published algorithms. Its simplicity allows the algorithm to detect texts in many fonts and languages."

The paper starts with discussing the working conditions of content-based retrieval: patterns of use, types of pictures, the role of semantics, and the sensory gap. Subsequent sections discuss computational steps for image retrieval systems. Step one of the review is image processing for retrieval sorted by color, texture, and local geometry. Features for retrieval are discussed next, sorted by: accumulative and global features, salient points, object and shape features, signs, and structural combinations thereof. Similarity of pictures and objects in pictures is reviewed for each of the feature types, in close connection to the types and means of feedback the user of the systems is capable of giving by interaction. We briefly discuss aspects of system engineering: databases, system architecture, and evaluation. In the concluding section, we present our view on: the driving force of the field, the heritage from computer vision, the influence on computer vision, the role of similarity and of interaction, the need for databases, the problem of evaluation, and the role of the semantic gap."

With the rapid growth in research over thelast few years on recognizing text in natural scenes, thereis an urgent need to establish some common benchmarkdatasets, and gain a clear understanding of the current stateof the art. We use the term robust reading to refer to text imagesthat are beyond the capabilities of current commercialOCR packages. We chose to break down the robust readingproblem into three sub-problems, and run competitionsfor each stage, and also a competition for the best overallsystem. The sub-problems we chose were text locating,character recognition and word recognition.By breaking down the problem in this way, we hope togain a better understanding of the state of the art in eachof the sub-problems. Furthermore, our methodology involvesstoring detailed results of applying each algorithm toeach image in the data sets, allowing researchers to study indepth the strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm. Thetext locating contest was the only one to have any entries.We report the results of this contest, and show cases wherethe leading algorithms succeed and fail."
