                "text": "The recent growth of online information available in the form of natural language documents creates a greater need for computing systems with the ability to process those documents to simplify access to the information. One type of processing appropriate for many tasks is information extraction, a type of text skimming that retrieves speci c types of information from text. Although information extraction systems have existed for two decades, these systems have generally been built by hand and contain domain speci c information, making them di cult to port to other domains. A few researchers have begun to apply machine learning to information extraction tasks, but most of this work has involved applying learning to pieces of a much larger system. This paper presents a novel rule representation speci c to natural language and a learning system, Rapier, which learns information extraction rules. Rapier takes pairs of documents and lled templates indicating the information to be extracted and learns patterns to extract llers for the slots in the template. This proposal presents initial results on a small corpus of computer-related job postings with a preliminary version of Rapier. Future research will involve several enhancements to Rapier as well as more thorough testing on several domains and extension to additional natural language processing tasks. We intend to extend the rule representation and algorithm to allow for more types of constraints than are currently supported. We also plan to incorporate active learning, or sample selection, methods, speci cally query by committee, into Rapier. These methods have the potential to substantially reduce the amount of annotation required. We will explore the issue of distinguishing relevant and irrelevant messages, since currently Rapier only extracts from the any messages given to it, assuming that all are relevant. We also intend to run much larger tests with Rapier on multiple domains including the terrorism domain from the third and fourth Message Uncderstanding Conferences, which will allow comparison against other systems. Finally, we plan to demonstrate the generality of Rapier`s representation and algorithm by applying it to other natural language processing tasks such as word sense disambiguation."

AutoSlog-TS is based on the AutoSlog system, which generated extraction patterns using annotated text and a set of heuristic rules. By adapting AutoSlog and combining it with statistical techniques, we eliminated its dependency on tagged text. In experiments with the MUG-4 terrorism domain, AutoSlog-TS created a dictionary of extraction patterns that performed comparably to a dictionary created by AutoSlog, using only preclassified texts as input."

CHILL treats parser acquisition as the learning of search-control rules within a logic program representing a shift-reduce parser and uses techniques from Inductive Logic Programming to learn relational control knowledge. Starting with a general framework for constructing a suitable logical form, CHILL is able to train on a corpus comprising sentences paired with database queries and induce parsers that map subsequent sentences directly into executable queries. Experimental results with a complete database-query application for U.S. geography show that CHILL is able to learn parsers that outperform a preexisting, hand-crafted counterpart. These results demonstrate the ability of a corpus-based system to produce more than purely syntactic representations. They also provide direct evidence of the utility of an empirical approach at the level of a complete natural language application."

First, we describe a general client/server architecture used in learning from observation. Then we give a detailed description of our novel decision-tree tagging approach. RoboTag performance for the proper noun tagging task in English and Japanese is compared against humantagged keys and to the best hand-coded pattern performance (as reported in the MUC and MET evaluation results). Related work and future directions are presented. 1 I n t r o d u c t i o n The ability to tag proper names such as organization, person, and place names in multilingual texts has great value for tasks like information extraction, information retrieval, and machine translation (Aone, Charocopos, and Gorlinsky, 1997). The most successful systems currently rely on handcoded patterns to identify the desired names in texts (Adv, 1995; Def, 1996). This approach achieves its best performance using different handcoded rule sets for each language/domain pair. Several of these systems have improved in ease of use, particularly in the speed of the write pattern/evaluate performance/refine pattern loop which plays the central role in the development process. One approach in name tagging is to assist in the creation of hand-coded rules by making it easier for the developer to mark parts of the name and its surrounding context to include in the pattern. This boosts productivity in hand-coding rules but still requires a significant amount of effort by the developer to identify key parts of the pattern. A step up from this is to determine how to generalize the rule so that it is more broadly applicable or to suggest to the developer which parts of the context have highvalue for inclusion in the pattern. Nevertheless, a skilled developer with a thorough knowledge of the particular pattern language is still essential. Our goal in developing RoboTag was to make it possible for an end-user to build a tagging system simply by giving examples of what should be tagged, rather than requiring the user to understand a pattern language. RoboTag uses a machine learning algorithm to discover features that the training examples have in common. This knowledge is used to construct a tagging procedure that can find additional, previously unseen examples for extraction. It was important (for the confidence of our users) that the tagging procedure induced by the system be easily explained in terms of how it makes its decisions. This was one of the factors that led us to consider using decision trees (Quinlan, 1993) as a key component of the system. Other potential learning or statistical approaches for a problem like this (e.g., Neural Nets or Hidden Markov Models) did not offer this advantage. The RoboTag system is particularly well instrumented for exploration of different learning system parameters and inspection of the induced tagging procedures. First, we discuss the overall architecture for the l~oboTag system. Next, we focus on the machine learning algorithm employed for tag learning. We then present experimental results which compare RoboTag to both human-tagged keys and to the best hand-coded rule systems. Lastly, related work and future directions are discussed. 2 RoboTag Architecture RoboTag design was motivated by our goal of developing an interactive learning system. The system had to process a large number of texts as well as provide the ability to visualize learning results and allow feedback to the learning system. To this end, RoboTag was designed as a client/server architecture. The client interface is an enhancement of a manual annotation tool. The interface works with multiple languages and includes support for both singleand double-byte coding schemes. We focus on English and Japanese in this paper. The server por-"

In knowledge based information extraction, linguistic patterns play a central role in the recognition and classification of input texts. Although the knowledge based approach has been proved effective for information extraction on limited domains, there are difficulties in construction of a large number of domain specific linguistic patterns. Manual creation of patterns is time consuming and error prone, even for a small application domain. To solve the scalability and the portability problem, an automatic acquisition of patterns must be provided. We present the PALKA (Parallel Automatic Linguistic Knowledge Acquisition) system that acquires linguistic patterns from a set of domain specific training texts and their desired outputs. A specialized representation of patterns called FP structures has been defined. Patterns are constructed in the form of FP structures from training texts, and the acquired patterns are tuned further through the generalization of semantic constraints. Inductive learning mechanism is applied in the generalization step. The PALKA system has been used to generate patterns for our information extraction system developed for the fourth Message Understanding Conference (MUC-4). >"

This knowledge engineering bottleneck makes knowledge-based NLP systems impractical for real-world applications because they cannot be easily scaled up or ported to new domains. In response to this problem, we developed a system called AutoSlog that automatically builds a domain-specific dictionary of concepts for extracting information from text. Using AutoSlog, we constructed a dictionary for the domain of terrorist event descriptions in only 5 person-hours. We then compared the AutoSlog dictionary with a hand-crafted dictionary that was built by two highly skilled graduate students and required approximately 1500 person-hours of effort. We evaluated the two dictionaries using two blind test sets of 100 texts each. Overall, the AutoSlog dictionary achieved 98% of the performance of the hand-crafted dictionary. On the first test set, the AutoSlog dictionary obtained 96.3% of the performance of the hand-crafted dictionary. On the second test set, the overall scores were virtually indistinguishable with the AutoSlog dictionary achieving 99.7% of the performance of the handcrafted dictionary."

It is particularly useful for problems that involve rules with specific exceptions, such as learning the past-tense of English verbs, a task widely studied in the context of the symbolic/connectionist debate. Foidl is able to learn concise, accurate programs for this problem from significantly fewer examples than previous methods (both connectionist and symbolic)."

An experiment is presented in which the performance of RESOLVE is compared to the performance of a manually engineered set of rules for the same task. The results show that decision trees achieve higher performance than the rules in two of three evaluation metrics developed for the coreference task. In addition to achieving better performance than the rules, RESOLVE provides a framework that facilitates the exploration of the types of knowledge that are useful for solving the conference problem."

Reports associated with terrorism were chosen as the target domain, and all systems were tested on a collection of previously unseen texts released by a government agency. Based on multiple strategies for computing each metric, the competing systems were evaluated for recall, precision, and overgeneration. The results support the claim that systems incorporating natural language\u2010processing techniques are more effective than systems based on stochastic techniques alone. A wide range of language-processing strategies was employed by the top-scoring systems, indicating that many natural language\u2010processing techniques provide a viable foundation for sophisticated text analysis. Further evaluation is needed to produce a more detailed assessment of the relative merits of specific technologies and establish true performance limits for automated information extraction."

While these taggers obtain high accuracy, linguistic information is captured indirectly, typically in tens of thousands of lexical and contextual probabilities. In (Brill 1992), a trainable rule-based tagger was described that obtained performance comparable to that of stochastic taggers, but captured relevant linguistic information in a small number of simple non-stochastic rules. In this paper, we describe a number of extensions to this rule-based tagger. First, we describe a method for expressing lexical relations in tagging that stochastic taggers are currently unable to express. Next, we show a rule-based approach to tagging unknown words. Finally, we show how the tagger-can be extended into a k-best tagger, where multiple tags can be assigned to words in some cases of uncertainty."

Unfortunately, there is no obvious alternative, no other simple way for lexicographers to keep track of what has been done or for readers to find the word they are looking for. But a frequent objection to this solution is that finding things on an alphabetical list can be tedious and time-consuming. Many people who would like to refer to a dictionary decide not to bother with it because finding the information would interrupt their work and break their train of thought."

                "text": "The WorldWideWeb is less agent-friendly than we might hope. Most information on the Web is presented in loosely structured natural language text with no agent-readable semantics. HTML annotations structure the display of Web pages, but provide virtually no insight into their content. Thus, the designers of intelligent Web agents need to address the following questions: (1) To what extent can an agent understand information published at Web sites? (2) Is the agent's understanding sufficient to provide genuinely useful assistance to users? (3) Is site-specific hand-coding necessary, or can the agent automatically extract information from unfamiliar Web sites? (4) What aspects of the Web facilitate this competence? In this paper we investigate these issues with a case study using ShopBot, a fully-implemented, domainindependent comparison-shopping agent. Given the home pages of several online stores, ShopBot autonomously learns how to shop at those vendors. After learning, it is able to speedily visit over a dozen software and CD vendors, extract product information, and summarize the results for the user. Preliminary studies show that ShopBot enables users to both find superior prices and substantially reduce Web shopping time. Remarkably, ShopBot achieves this performance without sophisticated natural language processing, and requires only minimal knowledge about different product domains. Instead, ShopBot relies on a combination of heuristic search, pattern matching, and inductive learning techniques.

Well-known algorithms fail to discover correct logical descriptions for large classes of interesting predicates , due either to the intractability of search or overly strong limitations applied to the hypothesis space. In contrast, search is avoided within Plotkin's framework of relative least general generalisation (rlgg). It is replaced by the process of constructing a unique clause which covers a set of examples relative to given background knowledge. However, such a clause can in the worst case contain innnitely many literals, or at best grow exponentially with the number of examples involved. In this paper we introduce the concept of h-easy rlgg clauses and show that they have nite length. We also prove that the length of a certain class of \\determinate\" rlgg is bounded by a polynomial function of certain features of the background knowledge. This function is independent of the number of examples used to construct them. An existing implementation called GOLEM is shown to be capable of inducing many interesting logic programs which have not been demonstrated to be learnable using other algorithms."

This paper describes CRYSTAL, a fully automated tool that induces such a dictionary of text extraction rules. We discuss some key issues in developing an automatic dictionary induction system, using CRYSTAL as a concrete example. CRYSTAL derives text extraction rules from training instances and generalizes each rule as far as possible, testing the accuracy of each proposed rule on the training corpus. An error tolerance parameter allows CRYSTAL to manipulate a trade-off between recall and precision. We discuss issues involved with creating training data, defining a domain ontology, and allowing a flexible and expressive representation while designing a search control mechanism that avoids intractability."
