An algorithm which will automatically locate the textual regions in the input image will facilitate this task; the optical character recognizer can then be applied to only those regions of the image which contain text. We present a method for automatically locating text in complex color images. The algorithm first finds the approximate locations of text lines using horizontal spatial variance, and then extracts text components in these boxes using color segmentation. The proposed method has been used to locate text in compact disc (CD) and book cover images, as well as in the images of traffic scenes captured by a video camera. Initial results are encouraging and suggest that these algorithms can be used in image retrieval applications."

They describe a text detection algorithm which is based on color clustering and connected component analysis. The algorithm first quantizes the color space of the input image into a number of color classes using a parameter-free clustering procedure. It then identifies text-like connected components in each color class based on their shapes. Finally, a post-processing procedure aligns text-like components into text lines. Experimental results suggest this approach is promising despite the challenging nature of the input data."

One of the possible applications of this scheme is to detect and carefully extract the destination address block (DAB) on flat mail pieces. Concerning the low level design stages, the methodology is based on a multiresolution description of the document image and a joint extraction of both text lines and non text lines using their global aspect. Intermediate and high level stages consist of grouping text words into block structures, and this is performed in a efficient and robust way relying not only on some lines properties, but also on the adjacent lines.<<ETX>>"

Some steps of input form processing (form coding and form dropout) are carried out for any input form and other (form registration and broken characters reconstruction) are needed if the colour of the user filled-in data coincides with the colour of the empty form only.

News captions generally provide vital search information about the video being presented, the names of people and places or descriptions of objects. In this paper, two difficult problems of character recognition for videos are addressed: low resolution characters and extremely complex backgrounds. We apply an interpolation filter, multi-frame integration and a combination of four filters to solve these problems. Segmenting characters is done by a recognition-based segmentation method and intermediate character recognition results are used to improve the segmentation. The overall recognition results are good enough for use in news indexing. Performing video OCR on news video and combining its results with other video understanding techniques will improve the overall understanding of the news video content."

First, we extract subregions with high spatial frequency and great variance in grey-level from an input scene image as candidates of character components. Then, we select characters by using several heuristics such as constraints of size and shape, bimodality of an intensity histogram, alignment and proximity of characters. We conducted an experiment using 20 indoor and 40 outdoor images. As a result, character lines are detected with a high rate of 80%."

It has been successfully tested on a wide range of image segmentation problems, including grey and colour image segmentation, edge and line detection, range data and motion segmentation. In comparison with existing segmentation approaches, the method can resolve image features even if their distributions significantly overlap in the feature space. It can distinguish between noisy regions and genuine fine texture. Moreover, if required, FSD clustering can produce partial segmentation by identifying salient regions only."
