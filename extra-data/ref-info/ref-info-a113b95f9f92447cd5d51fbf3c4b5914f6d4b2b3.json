                "text": "An introduction is given to a theory of early visual information processing. The theory has been implemented, and examples are given of images at various stages of analysis. It is argued that the first step of consequence is to compute a primitive but rich description of the grey-level changes present in an image. The description is expressed in a vocabulary of kinds of intensity change (EDGE, SHADING-EDGE, EXTENDED-EDGE, LINE, BLOB etc.). Modifying parameters are bound to the elements in the description, specifying their POSITION, ORIENTATION, TERMINATION points, CONTRAST, SIZE and FUZZINESS. This description is obtained from the intensity array by fixed techniques, and it is called the primal sketch. For most images, the primal sketch is large and unwieldy. The second important step in visual information processing is to group its contents in a way that is appropriate for later recognition. From our ability to interpret drawings with little semantic content, one may infer the presence in our perceptual equipment of symbolic processes that can define \"place-tokens\" in an image in various ways, and can group them according to certain rules. Homomorphic techniques fail to account for many of these grouping phenomena, whose explanations require mechanisms of construction rather than mechanisms of detection. The necessary grouping of elements in the primal sketch may be achieved by a mechanism that has available the processes inferred from above, together with the ability to select items by first order discriminations acting on the elements' parameters. Only occasionally do these mechanisms use downward-flowing information about the contents of the particular image being processed. It is argued that \"non-attentive\" vision is in practice implemented by these grouping operations and first order discriminations acting on the primal sketch. The class of computations so obtained differs slightly from the class of second order operations on the intensity array. The extraction of a form from the primal sketch using these techniques amounts to the separation of figure from ground. It is concluded that most of the separation can be carried out by using techniques that do not depend upon the particular image in question. Therefore, figure-ground separation can normally precede the description of the shape of the extracted form. Up to this point, higher-level knowledge and purpose are brought to bear on only a few of the decisions taken during the processing. This relegates the widespread use of downward-flowing information to a later stage than is found in current machine-vision programs, and implies that such knowledge should influence the control of, rather than interfering with, the actual data-processing that is taking place lower down."

Since second-order (dipole) statistics determine the autocorrelation functions and hence the power spectra, this observation also meant that in preattentive perception of texture the phase (position) spectra were ignored. In the last two decades many new classes of texture pairs with identical power spectra have been invented that were not effortlessly discriminable; however, recently (Caelli & Julesz 1978; Caelli et al. 1978; Julesz et al. 1978) several counterexamples were found. In these texture pairs with identical power spectra some local structures of 'quasi-collinearity', 'corner', 'closure' and 'granularity' yielded strong discrimination. These features can be regarded as the fundamental building blocks of form, that is, the essential nonlinearities of the preattentive perceptual system. Here, it will be shown that these counter-examples are not independent of each other, but can be described by two elementary units; bars (line segments) and their terminators. Furthermore, the preattentive texture perception system can count the number of terminators but ignores their positions."

The present experiment sought to determine the nature and temporal course of the interference provided by nonattended visual material. Subjects reaction times were measured for deciding which of two targets occupied the indicated position in one or eight element displays. Placing replicas of the target in nonindicated display positions was equivalent to presenting the target alone. Members of the opposite response set produced maximum interference, while encodable and unencodable noise elements not belonging to a response set produced an intermediate decrement. For all display types, presenting the indicator prior to display onset decreased reaction time. Dividing each of the display elements into two parts and presenting the parts asynchronously provided evidence that subjects were indifferent to the presence of complete forms for the first 50 msec. These results were interpreted as supporting the existence of a hiararchical sequence of stages consisting of a preattentive stage which segregates the input into objects and an attentive stage which is likened to a spatial scanner responsible for synthesizing the crude preattentive features into recognized forms. The concurrent operation of these stages provides for the redirection of attention when changes in the input are detected."

If the stimuli are presented very briefly, eye movements are not possible. The time during which the after-image of the stimulus is available for inspection is terminated by presentation of a masking pattern. We show here that in these conditions a small pattern is easily detected against a background made up of many others, only if this target pattern differs from the background patterns in certain local features. In this case the detectability of the target is almost independent of the number of background elements, suggesting that a parallel process is operating. Detection of patterns not differing from their backgrounds in such features requires focal attention which is a serial process. The aperture of this attention is scaled to minimize the number of shifts of attention required."

Such texture pairs could not be discriminated from each other by the human visual system without scrutiny. Unfortunately, Markov processes are inherently one-dimensional while the general processes underlying visual texture discrimination are two-dimensional. Here three new methods are introduced that generate two-dimensional non-Markovian textures with different third-order but identical first- and second-order statistics. All three methods generate texture pairs that cannot be discriminated from each other. The lack of texture discrimination is the more astonishing since the individual elements that form the texture pair are clearly perceived as being very different. However, a counterexample was found that yields discrimination although the texture pair has approximately identical second-order statistics. This case can be explained by assuming that early feature extractors do some preprocessing. These new demonstrations give support to a model of texture discrimination in which the stimulus is first analyzed by local feature extractors that can detect only simple features such as dots and edges of given sizes and orientations. Then the outputs of these simple extractors are evaluated by a global processor that can compute only second- or first-order statistics (that is can compare at most two such outputs)."

In Foundations of Cyclopean Perception (first published in 1971 and unavailable for years), Bela Julesz traced the visual information flow in the brain, analyzing how the brain combines separate images received from the two eyes to produce depth perception. Julesz developed novel tools to do this: random-dot stereograms and cinematograms, generated by early digital computers at Bell Labs. These images, when viewed with the special glasses that came with the book, revealed complex, three-dimensional surfaces; this mode of visual stimulus became a paradigm for research in vision and perception. This reprint edition includes all 48 color random-dot designs from the original, as well as the special 3-D glasses required to view them.Foundations of Cyclopean Perception has had a profound impact on the vision studies community. It was chosen as one of the one hundred most influential works in cognitive science in a poll conducted by the University of Minnesota's Center for Cognitive Sciences. Many copies are \"permanently borrowed\" from college libraries; used copies are sought after online. Now, with this facsimile of the 1971 edition, the book is available again to cognitive scientists, neuroscientists, vision researchers, artists, and designers."

Particularly important is the problem of finding binocular parallax, which involves matching patterns of the left and right visual fields. Stereo pictures of familiar objects or line drawings preclude the separation of interacting cues, and thus this pattern-matching process is difficult to investigate. More insight into the process can be gained by using unfamiliar picture material devoid of all cues except binocular parallax. To this end, artificial stereo picture pairs were generated on a digital computer. When viewed monocularly, they appear completely random, but if viewed binocularly, certain correlated point domains are seen in depth. By introducing distortions in this material and testing for perception of depth, it is possible to show that pattern-matching of corresponding points of the left and right visual fields can be achieved by first combining the two fields and then searching for patterns in the fused field. By this technique, some interesting properties of this fused binocular field are revealed, and a simple analog model is derived. The interaction between the monocular and binocular fields is also describea. A number of stereo images that demonstrate these and other findings are presented."

The displays contained two side-by-side fields with different statistical, topological or heuristic properties. Discrimination was defined as that spontaneous visual process which gives the immediate impression of two distinct fields. The condition for such discrimination was found to be based primarily on clusters or lines formed by proximate points of uniform brightness. A similar rule of connectivity with hue replacing brightness was obtained by using varicolored dots of equal subjective brightness. The limitations in discriminating complex line structures were also investigated."

                "text": "ZusammenfassungVersuche an \u201esplit-brain\u201c Affen legten die Annahme nahe, da\u00df die Wahrnehmung des Raumes und die Wahrnehmung der Identit\u00e4t von Gegenst\u00e4nden auf anatomisch getrennten Hirnmechanismen beruhen. In der vorliegenden Arbeit werden die Sehmechanismen des Gehirns untersucht, wobei von der \u00dcberlegung ausgegangen wird, da\u00df hier zwei parallele Prozesse involviert sind: ein dezentrierter (\u201eambient\u201c), der die Wahrnehmung des den K\u00f6rper umgebenden Raumes bestimmt, und ein zentrierter (\u201efocal\u201c), durch welchen Details kleiner Raumfl\u00e4chen aufgefa\u00dft werden.Bei Wirbeltieren wird eine detaillierte Topographie des k\u00f6rper-zentrierten Verhaltensraumes vom Auge zum Mittelhirn projiziert. Diese visuelle Topographie ist so mit dem bi-symmetrischen motorischen System integriert, da\u00df sich eine Korrespondenz zwischen gesehenen Punkten und Bewegungszielen ergibt.Das phylogenetisch j\u00fcngere visuelle System des Vorderhirns befa\u00dft sich fast ausschlie\u00dflich mit dem zentralen Verhaltensraum; die corticale motorische Kontrolle befa\u00dft sich entsprechend mit sehr spezifischen Handlungen im gleichen zentralen Gebiet.Anatomie und Hirnchirurgie liefern bei Primaten Hinweise auf einen visuellen Mechanismus im Mittelhirn, der f\u00fcr die dezentrierte Raumwahrnehmung eine Rolle spielt. Im Gegensatz dazu greift das auf Fovea, Parafovea und den visuellen Arealen des Cortex beruhende zentrierte Sehen Areale des umgebenden Feldes f\u00fcr eine eingehendere Inspektion heraus. Koordinierte Augenbewegungen sind direkter Ausdruck dieser Aufmerksamkeitszuwendung.Die Wechselwirkung zweier Mechanismen der visuellen Analyse kennzeichnet das Sehen bei allen aktiven Tieren. Die Komplexit\u00e4t des zentrierten Sehens zeigt sich auf allen Stufen des visuellen Systems von Primaten und in den Teilen des motorischen Systems, welche das Sehen ausrichten und die auf bestimmte visuelle Objekte gerichteten Handlungen steuern.SummaryExperiments with split-brain monkeys led me to consider that vision of space and vision of object identity may be subserved by anatomically distinct brain mechanisms. In this paper I examine the visual mechanisms of the brain to test the idea that vision involves two parallel processes; one ambient, determining space at large around the body, the other focal which examines detail in small areas of space.In vertebrates there is a projection from eye to midbrain of a detailed topography of body-centered behavioral space. This visual map is integrated with the bisymmetric motor system to obtain correspondence between visual loci and the goals for movements. The midbrain visual system governs basic vertebrate locomotor behavior.The phylogenetically more recent forebrain visual system looks almost exclusively at central behavioral space, and cortical motor control is likewise concerned with the formulation of highly specific acts in the same central territory.Anatomy and brain surgery reveal a midbrain visual mechanism in primates which plays a part in ambient space perception over the whole field. In contrast, focal vision served by the fovea and parafovea and by the cortical visual areas picks out areas in the ambient field for close attention. Conjugate eye movements are the most direct sign of this attention.The interplay between the two channels of visual analysis is a feature of vision in all active animals; but the complexity of focal vision in primates is revealed in their visual system at all levels, and in the parts of the motor system which orient vision, or which govern acts directed to specific visual objects."

We indicate how this number can be determined, in principle, from the analysis of large angle scattering of radiation. We discuss the bearing of our result on the Debye ``random scatterers'' and the study of models of random close packing of spheres. We give a brief list of possible applications and open problems suggested by this field."
