Unfortunately, as more images are added, the prevalence of semi-occluded regions (pixels visible in some but not all images) also increases. We propose some novel techniques to deal with this problem. Our first idea is to use a combination of shiftable windows and a dynamically selected subset of the neighboring images to do the matches. Our second idea is to explicitly label occluded pixels within a global energy minimization framework, and to reason about visibility within this framework so that only truly visible pixels are matched. Experimental results show a dramatic improvement using the first idea over conventional multibaseline stereo, especially when used in conjunction with a global energy minimization technique. These results also show that explicit occlusion labeling and visibility reasoning do help, but not significantly, if the spatial and temporal selection is applied first."

In this paper we propose an experimental comparison of several different stereo algorithms. We use real imagery, and explore two different methodologies, with different strengths and weaknesses. Our first methodology is based upon manual computation of dense ground truth. Here we make use of a two stereo pairs: one of these, from the University of Tsukuba, contains mostly fronto-parallel surfaces; while the other, which we built, is a simple scene with a slanted surface. Our second methodology uses the notion of prediction error, which is the ability of a disparity map to predict an (unseen) third image, taken from a known camera position with respect to the input pair. We present results for both correlation-style stereo algorithms and techniques based on global methods such as energy minimization. Our experiments suggest that the two methodologies give qualitatively consistent results. Source images and additional materials, such as the implementations of various algorithms, are available on the web from http://www.research.microsoft.com/~szeliski/stereo."

To produce smooth and detailed disparity maps, two assumptions that were originally proposed by Marr and Poggio (1976, 1979) are adopted: uniqueness and continuity. That is, the disparity maps have a unique value per pixel and are continuous almost everywhere. These assumptions are enforced within a three-dimensional array of match values in disparity space. Each match value corresponds to a pixel in an image and a disparity relative to another image. An iterative algorithm updates the match values by diffusing support among neighboring values and inhibiting others along similar lines of sight. By applying the uniqueness assumption, occluded regions can be explicitly identified. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm, we present the processing results from synthetic and real image pairs, including ones with ground-truth values for quantitative comparison with other methods."

These occur typically as parts of the background immediately to the left and right sides of nearby occluding objects, and are present in most natural scenes. Previous approaches to stereo either ignored these unmatchable points or attempted to weed them out in a second pass. An algorithm that incorporates them from the start as a strong clue to depth discontinuities is presented. The authors first derive a measure for goodness of fit and a prior based on a simplified model of objects in space, which leads to an energy functional depending both on the depth as measured from a central cyclopean eye and on the regions of points occluded from the left and right eye perspectives. They minimize this using dynamic programming along epipolar lines followed by annealing in both dimensions. Experiments indicate that this method is very effective even in difficult scenes.<<ETX>>"

                "text": "Energy minimization is an elegant approach to computer vision. Vision problems usually have many solutions due to uncertainties in the imaging process and ambiguities in visual interpretation. The energy function encodes the problem constraints, and its minimum gives the optimal solution. Despite numerous advantages, this approach is severely limited by the high computational cost. \nThe main contribution of my thesis lies in developing efficient combinatorial optimization algorithms for several important classes of energy functions which incorporate everywhere smooth, piecewise constant, and piecewise smooth priors. These priors assume, respectively, that the quantity to be estimated varies smoothly over its domain, consist of several pieces with constant values, or consist of several pieces with smoothly varying values. The algorithms rely on graph cuts as a powerful optimization technique. \nFor a certain everywhere smooth prior we develop an algorithm which finds the exact minimum by computing a single graph cut. This method is most suitable to estimate quantities without discontinuities. But even when discontinuities exist, the method produces good results in certain cases. The running time is low order polynomial. \nFor several wide classes of piecewise smooth priors we develop two approximation algorithms (we show that exact minimization in NP-hard in these cases). These algorithms produce a local minimum in interesting large move spaces. Furthermore, one of them finds a solution within a known factor from the optimum. The algorithms are iterative and compute several graph cuts at each iteration. The running time at each iteration is effectively linear due to the special graph structure. In practice it takes just a few iterations to converge. Moreover most of the progress happens during the first iteration. \nFor a certain piecewise constant prior we adapt the algorithms developed for the piecewise smooth prior. One of them finds a solution within a factor of two from the optimum. In addition we develop a third algorithm which finds a local minimum in yet another move space. \nWe demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on image restoration, stereo, and motion. For the data with ground truth, our methods significantly outperform standard methods."

By segmentation, we mean a map from the set of pixels to a small set of levels such that each connected component of the set of pixels with the same level forms a relatively large and \"meaningful\" region. The method finds a set of levels with associated gray values by first finding junctions in the image and then seeking a minimum set of threshold values that preserves the junctions. Then it finds a segmentation map that maps each pixel to the level with the closest gray value to the pixel data, within a smoothness constraint. For a convex smoothing penalty, we show the global optimal solution for an energy function that fits the data can be obtained in a polynomial time, by a novel use of the maximum-flow algorithm.

The major restriction is that the energy function's smoothness term must only involve pairs of pixels. We propose two algorithms that use graph cuts to compute a local minimum even when very large moves are allowed. The first move we consider is an /spl alpha/-/spl beta/-swap: for a pair of labels /spl alpha/,/spl beta/, this move exchanges the labels between an arbitrary set of pixels labeled a and another arbitrary set labeled /spl beta/. Our first algorithm generates a labeling such that there is no swap move that decreases the energy. The second move we consider is an /spl alpha/-expansion: for a label a, this move assigns an arbitrary set of pixels the label /spl alpha/. Our second algorithm, which requires the smoothness term to be a metric, generates a labeling such that there is no expansion move that decreases the energy. Moreover, this solution is within a known factor of the global minimum. We experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on image restoration, stereo and motion."

We develop efficient algorithms for computing good approximations to the minimum multiway, cut. The visual correspondence problem can be formulated as an MRF in our framework; this yields quite promising results on real data with ground truth. We also apply our techniques to MRFs with linear clique potentials."

                "text": "We make an analogy between images and statistical mechanics systems. Pixel gray levels and the presence and orientation of edges are viewed as states of atoms or molecules in a lattice-like physical system. The assignment of an energy function in the physical system determines its Gibbs distribution. Because of the Gibbs distribution, Markov random field (MRF) equivalence, this assignment also determines an MRF image model. The energy function is a more convenient and natural mechanism for embodying picture attributes than are the local characteristics of the MRF. For a range of degradation mechanisms, including blurring, nonlinear deformations, and multiplicative or additive noise, the posterior distribution is an MRF with a structure akin to the image model. By the analogy, the posterior distribution defines another (imaginary) physical system. Gradual temperature reduction in the physical system isolates low energy states (``annealing''), or what is the same thing, the most probable states under the Gibbs distribution. The analogous operation under the posterior distribution yields the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the image given the degraded observations. The result is a highly parallel ``relaxation'' algorithm for MAP estimation. We establish convergence properties of the algorithm and we experiment with some simple pictures, for which good restorations are obtained at low signal-to-noise ratios."
