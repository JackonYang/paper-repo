The potential benefit from this source is made more significant due to the enormous amount of language data easily available today. We present a system to automatically generate natural language descriptions from images that exploits both statistics gleaned from parsing large quantities of text data and recognition algorithms from computer vision. The system is very effective at producing relevant sentences for images. It also generates descriptions that are notably more true to the specific image content than previous work."

The potential benefit from this source is made more significant due to the enormous amount of language data easily available today. We present a system to automatically generate natural language descriptions from images that exploits both statistics gleaned from parsing large quantities of text data and recognition algorithms from computer vision. The system is very effective at producing relevant sentences for images. It also generates descriptions that are notably more true to the specific image content than previous work."

The input are initial noisy estimates of the objects and scenes detected in the image using state of the art trained detectors. As predicting actions from still images directly is unreliable, we use a language model trained from the English Gigaword corpus to obtain their estimates; together with probabilities of co-located nouns, scenes and prepositions. We use these estimates as parameters on a HMM that models the sentence generation process, with hidden nodes as sentence components and image detections as the emissions. Experimental results show that our strategy of combining vision and language produces readable and descriptive sentences compared to naive strategies that use vision alone."

Such a collection allows us to approach the extremely challenging problem of description generation using relatively simple non-parametric methods and produces surprisingly effective results. We also develop methods incorporating many state of the art, but fairly noisy, estimates of image content to produce even more pleasing results. Finally we introduce a new objective performance measure for image captioning."

We describe a system that can compute a score linking an image to a sentence. This score can be used to attach a descriptive sentence to a given image, or to obtain images that illustrate a given sentence. The score is obtained by comparing an estimate of meaning obtained from the image to one obtained from the sentence. Each estimate of meaning comes from a discriminative procedure that is learned us-ingdata. We evaluate on a novel dataset consisting of human-annotated images. While our underlying estimate of meaning is impoverished, it is sufficient to produce very good quantitative results, evaluated with a novel score that can account for synecdoche."

The proposed I2T framework follows three steps: 1) input images (or video frames) are decomposed into their constituent visual patterns by an image parsing engine, in a spirit similar to parsing sentences in natural language; 2) the image parsing results are converted into semantic representation in the form of Web ontology language (OWL), which enables seamless integration with general knowledge bases; and 3) a text generation engine converts the results from previous steps into semantically meaningful, human readable, and query-able text reports. The centerpiece of the I2T framework is an and-or graph (AoG) visual knowledge representation, which provides a graphical representation serving as prior knowledge for representing diverse visual patterns and provides top-down hypotheses during the image parsing. The AoG embodies vocabularies of visual elements including primitives, parts, objects, scenes as well as a stochastic image grammar that specifies syntactic relations (i.e., compositional) and semantic relations (e.g., categorical, spatial, temporal, and functional) between these visual elements. Therefore, the AoG is a unified model of both categorical and symbolic representations of visual knowledge. The proposed I2T framework has two objectives. First, we use semiautomatic method to parse images from the Internet in order to build an AoG for visual knowledge representation. Our goal is to make the parsing process more and more automatic using the learned AoG model. Second, we use automatic methods to parse image/video in specific domains and generate text reports that are useful for real-world applications. In the case studies at the end of this paper, we demonstrate two automatic I2T systems: a maritime and urban scene video surveillance system and a real-time automatic driving scene understanding system."

After reviewing existing edge and gradient based descriptors, we show experimentally that grids of histograms of oriented gradient (HOG) descriptors significantly outperform existing feature sets for human detection. We study the influence of each stage of the computation on performance, concluding that fine-scale gradients, fine orientation binning, relatively coarse spatial binning, and high-quality local contrast normalization in overlapping descriptor blocks are all important for good results. The new approach gives near-perfect separation on the original MIT pedestrian database, so we introduce a more challenging dataset containing over 1800 annotated human images with a large range of pose variations and backgrounds."

Doing so allows us not only to name familiar objects, but also: to report unusual aspects of a familiar object (\u201cspotty dog\u201d, not just \u201cdog\u201d); to say something about unfamiliar objects (\u201chairy and four-legged\u201d, not just \u201cunknown\u201d); and to learn how to recognize new objects with few or no visual examples. Rather than focusing on identity assignment, we make inferring attributes the core problem of recognition. These attributes can be semantic (\u201cspotty\u201d) or discriminative (\u201cdogs have it but sheep do not\u201d). Learning attributes presents a major new challenge: generalization across object categories, not just across instances within a category. In this paper, we also introduce a novel feature selection method for learning attributes that generalize well across categories. We support our claims by thorough evaluation that provides insights into the limitations of the standard recognition paradigm of naming and demonstrates the new abilities provided by our attribute-based framework."

Our system achieves a two-fold improvement in average precision over the best performance in the 2006 PASCAL person detection challenge. It also outperforms the best results in the 2007 challenge in ten out of twenty categories. The system relies heavily on deformable parts. While deformable part models have become quite popular, their value had not been demonstrated on difficult benchmarks such as the PASCAL challenge. Our system also relies heavily on new methods for discriminative training. We combine a margin-sensitive approach for data mining hard negative examples with a formalism we call latent SVM. A latent SVM, like a hidden CRF, leads to a non-convex training problem. However, a latent SVM is semi-convex and the training problem becomes convex once latent information is specified for the positive examples. We believe that our training methods will eventually make possible the effective use of more latent information such as hierarchical (grammar) models and models involving latent three dimensional pose."

However, such an approach does not work well when there is no distinctive attribute among objects. To overcome this limitation, this paper proposes a method utilizing the perceptual groups of objects and n-ary relations among them. The key is to identify groups of objects that are naturally recognized by humans. We conducted psychological experiments with 42 subjects to collect referring expressions in such situations, and built a generation algorithm based on the results. The evaluation using another 23 subjects showed that the proposed method could effectively generate proper referring expressions."

However, such an approach does not work well when there is no distinctive attribute among objects. To overcome this limitation, this paper proposes a method utilizing the perceptual groups of objects and n-ary relations among them. With the proposed method, an expression like \u201cthe leftmost ball in the left cluster of three balls\u201d can be generated. The key is to identify groups of objects that are naturally recognized by humans. We conducted psychological experiments with 42 subjects to collect referring expressions in such situations, and built a generation algorithm based on the results. The evaluation using another 23 subjects showed that the proposed method could effectively generate proper referring expressions."

However, MTurk offers only limited control over who is allowed to particpate in a particular task. This is particularly problematic for tasks requiring free-form text entry. Unlike multiple-choice tasks there is no correct answer, and therefore control items for which the correct answer is known cannot be used. Furthermore, MTurk has no effective built-in mechanism to guarantee workers are proficient English writers. We describe our experience in creating corpora of images annotated with multiple one-sentence descriptions on MTurk and explore the effectiveness of different quality control strategies for collecting linguistic data using Mechanical MTurk. We find that the use of a qualification test provides the highest improvement of quality, whereas refining the annotations through follow-up tasks works rather poorly. Using our best setup, we construct two image corpora, totaling more than 40,000 descriptive captions for 9000 images."

This minimizes the predominant issue of data sparsity that has informed most previous approaches. We compare several recent approaches, and find improvements from additional training data across the board; however, none outperform a simple n-gram model."

We review previous work on NLG evaluation and on validation of automatic metrics in NLP, and then present the results of two studies of how well some metrics which are popular in other areas of NLP (notably BLEU and ROUGE) correlate with human judgments in the domain of computer-generated weather forecasts. Our results suggest that, at least in this domain, metrics may provide a useful measure of language quality, although the evidence for this is not as strong as we would ideally like to see; however, they do not provide a useful measure of content quality. We also discuss a number of caveats which must be kept in mind when interpreting this and other validation studies."

Abstract Generation of Referring Expressions is concerned with distinguishing descriptions for target referents in a knowledge base. Plural reference introduces novel problems, one of which is the collective/distributive distinction. This paper presents an empirical study of the production of collective spatial references, and an algorithm that determines content for such expressions from spatial data.

This paper, on the other hand, will be concerned with the automatic generation of collective references to sets or groups, focusing on spatial domains. There are three issues to be faced: Keywords: Natural Language Generation; psycholinguistics; reference; collective predication. Introduction Generation of Referring Expressions ( GRE ) is an integral part of the microplanning stage of Natural Language Generation ( NLG ). Given a target referent, a GRE algorithm selects prop- erties (or predicates) that will distinguish the target from its distractors in a knowledge base ( KB ), assumed to be acces- sible to both the system and the user/hearer (Dale & Reiter, 1995). Following Dale and Reiter, this process of content de- termination is usually conceived as a search, during which the GRE algorithm finds properties that are true of the target and not true of at least a subset of the distractors. Such properties are incrementally added to the description, and the process continues until the intersection of all the selected properties has only the target in its extension. Recent work has extended this problem definition to the generation of plural references. Such work has mostly fo- cused on the two interrelated issues of logical completeness and naturalness. Completeness requires that a GRE algorithm find a distinguishing description whenever one exists. In the case of plurals, this requires dealing not only with the inter- section or conjunction of predicates, but also logical disjunc- tion (set union) (van Deemter, 2002). It turns out however, that extending existing algorithms in this way often results in extremely complex descriptions. Taking their cue from Grice\u2019s (1975) notion of Brevity, several authors have pro- posed ways of controlling the search for a distinguishing de- scription in order to avoid this (e.g. Gardent, 2002; Horacek One problem that has recieved very little attention in this area is that of collective predication. Plural predicates can have a collective reading, and the difference between such readings and distributives often has consequences for the truth conditions of a sentence. For instance, (1) could be (dis- tributively) true of each of the men in question, and collec- tively true of a group of men, taken as a whole. A collec- tive reading is often forced by the presence of numerals and P1 The grounding problem: When is it appropriate to refer to a set in the domain as a group? P2 Expressive choice: When is it correct to use a grouping operator and/or a numeral? P3 Descriptive strategy: When is reference to a group suffi- cient and when is it necessary to identify it in relation to its distractors? There are two broad possibilities: 1. absolute strategy: distinguish a group based solely on its properties 2. navigational strategy: explicitly distinguish a group from its distractors In what follows, we assume that there is a domain of en- tities which have, among other things, a location property, represented as a vector of coordinates. Here, the grounding problem (P1) is to determine which sets of entities form a per- ceptual group, warranting the application of a group operator. This also has a bearing on descriptive strategy (P3). If a set of referents form a group, it may be necessary to distinguish it from distractors that are near enough to it. The question of expressive choice is an open empirical question: it\u2019s not clear whether the use of numerals and explicit grouping oper- ators depend on factors such as target set size and distractor proximity. The rest of this paper introduces some related work, then presents an approach to grounding spatial descriptions. An experiment addressing P2 and P3 is described. Finally, we bring together these two strands in a procedure that deter- mines the content of spatial descriptions, which is assumed to constitute the input to a linguistic realisation module."

Intuitively, a candidate is popular if it was discovered many times by other instances in the hyponym pattern. A candidate is productive if it frequently leads to the discovery of other instances. Together, these two measures capture not only frequency of occurrence, but also cross-checking that the candidate occurs both near the class name and near other class members. We developed two algorithms that begin with just a class name and one seed instance and then automatically generate a ranked list of new class instances. We conducted experiments on four semantic classes and consistently achieved high accuracies."
