The properties of the operator which approximates a signal at a given resolution were studied. It is shown that the difference of information between the approximation of a signal at the resolutions 2/sup j+1/ and 2/sup j/ (where j is an integer) can be extracted by decomposing this signal on a wavelet orthonormal basis of L/sup 2/(R/sup n/), the vector space of measurable, square-integrable n-dimensional functions. In L/sup 2/(R), a wavelet orthonormal basis is a family of functions which is built by dilating and translating a unique function psi (x). This decomposition defines an orthogonal multiresolution representation called a wavelet representation. It is computed with a pyramidal algorithm based on convolutions with quadrature mirror filters. Wavelet representation lies between the spatial and Fourier domains. For images, the wavelet representation differentiates several spatial orientations. The application of this representation to data compression in image coding, texture discrimination and fractal analysis is discussed. >"

In this paper we will show that such a representation can be defined from the position of the zero-crossings and the local energy values of a dyadic wavelet decomposition. This representation is experimentally complete and admits a simple distance for pattern matching applications. It provides a multiscale decomposition of the signal and at each scale characterizes the locations of abrupt changes in the signal.

We may test whether a given code is sufficient, in the sense of retaining all the information that the human perceives, and necessary, in the sense of retaining only that information. The latter is a test of efficiency. Here, we explore a code modeled on the simple cells of the primate striate cortex. The Cortex transform maps a digital image into a set of subimages (layers) that are bandpass in spatial frequency and orientation. The layers are sampled so as to minimize the number of samples and still avoid aliasing. Samples are quantized in a manner that exploits the bandpass contrast-masking properties of human vision. The entropy of the samples is computed to provide a lower bound on the code size. Finally, the image is reconstructed from the code. We devise psychophysical methods for comparing the original and reconstructed images to evaluate the sufficiency of the code. When each resolution is coded at the threshold for detection artifacts, the image-code size is about 1 bit/pixel."

Particular attention is given to the fact that receptive field profiles of simple cells in the visual cortex often resemble even-symmetric or odd-symmetric Gabor filters; i.e. their receptive field profiles can be described by the product of a Gaussian and either a cosine or sine function. Their spatial frequency tuning is of medium bandwidth (~one octave) which is narrow enough for a cell to distinguish the third harmonic from the fundamental frequency for square-wave gratings of low spatial frequency. The responses of adjacent simple cells, tuned to the same spatial frequency, orientation, and direction, differ in their phase response to drifting sine-wave gratings by approximately either 90\u00b0 or 180\u00b0. This latter result makes it possible to consider two adjacent simple cell pairs as operating like paired Gaussian-attenuated sine and cosine filters of Gabor filters for restricted regions of visual space. The entire set of simple cells provides a complete representation of the visual scene, yet each simple cell is unique in its response properties. At the complex cell stage, the cell's mean firing rate appears to represent the amplitude of a local Fourier coefficient, but phase information is seldom conveyed with much precision in the action potential code."

For computational reasons the set is also (e) orthogonal and lends itself to (f) rapid computation. The systems are derived from concepts in matrix algebra, but are closely connected to decompositions based on quadrature mirror filters. Our computations take place hierarchically, leading to a pyramid representation in which all of the basis functions have the same basic shape, and appear at many scales. By placing the high-pass and low-pass kernels on staggered grids, we can derived odd-tap QMF kernels that are quite compact. We have developed pyramids using separable, quincunx, and hexagonal kernels. Image data compression with the pyramids gives excellent results, both in terms of MSE and visual appearance. A non-orthogonal variant allows good performance with 3-tap basis kernels and the appropriate inverse sampling kernels."

Logan's conditions, specifying when a one-dimensional signal may be recovered (within a multiplicative constant) from its ZC, are extended for various cases of two-dimensional signals. An algorithm is implemented in reconstruction of context-free band-pass images. It is also successfully applied in reconstruction of contextual images by first dissecting the image into appropriate bandpass-band-limited two-dimensional signals. In almost all cases of spectrum confined to less than an octave in one dimension, the reconstruction algorithm converges, whereas it does not converge for any signal exceeding one octave in bandwidth. This paper substantiates the proposition that images are well represented by the partial information confined to ZC."

In 1977 Marr and Poggio proposed one such computational model, which was characterized as matching certain feature points in difference-of-Gaussian filtered images and using the information obtained by matching coarser resolution representations to restrict the search space for matching finer resolution representations. An implementation of the algorithm and its testing on a range of images was reported in 1980. Since then a number of psychophysical experiments have suggested possible refinements to the model and modifications to the algorithm. As well, recent computational experiments applying the algorithm to a variety of natural images, especially aerial photographs, have led to a number of modifications. In this paper, we present a version of the Marr-Poggio-Grimson algorithm that embodies these modifications, and we illustrate its performance on a series of natural images."

The algorithm consists of five steps: (1) Each image is filtered at different orientations with bar masks of four sizes that increase with eccentricity; the equivalent filters are one or two octaves wide. (2) Zero-crossings in the filtered images, which roughly correspond to edges, are localized. Positions of the ends of lines and edges are also found. (3) For each mask orientation and size, matching takes place between pairs of zero-crossings or terminations of the same sign in the two images, for a range of disparities up to about the width of the mask\u2019s central region. (4) Wide masks can control vergence movements, thus causing small masks to come into correspondence. (5) When a correspondence is achieved, it is stored in a dynamic buffer, called the 2\u00bd-D sketch. It is shown that this proposal provides a theoretical framework for most existing psychophysical and neurophysiological data about stereopsis. Several critical experimental predictions are also made, for instance about the size of Panum\u2019s area under various conditions. The results of such experiments would tell us whether, for example, co-operativity is necessary for the matching process."

This paper presents a simple yet efficient extension of this concept to the source coding of images. We specify the constraints for a set of two-dimensional quadrature mirror filters (QMF's) for a particular frequency-domain partition, and show that these constraints are satisfied by a separable combination of one-dimensional QMF's. Bits are then optimally allocated among the subbands to minimize the mean-squared error for DPCM coding of the subbands. Also, an adaptive technique is developed to allocate the bits within each subband by means of a local variance mask. Optimum quantization is employed with quantizers matched to the Laplacian distribution. Subband coded images are presented along with their signal-to-noise ratios (SNR's). The SNR performance of the subband coder is compared to that of the adaptive discrete cosine transform (DCT), vector quantization, and differential vector quantization for bit rates of 0.67, 1.0, and 2.0 bits per pixel for 256 \u00d7 256 monochrome images. The adaptive subband coder has the best SNR performance."

A fundamental problem in computing such descriptions is scale: a derivative must be taken over some neighborhood, but there is seldom a principled basis for choosing its size. Scale-space filtering is a method that describes signals qualitatively, managing the ambiguity of scale in an organized and natural way. The signal is first expanded by convolution with gaussian masks over a continuum of sizes. This \"scale-space\" image is then collapsed, using its qualitative structure, into a tree providing a concise but complete qualitative description covering all scales of observation. The description is further refined by applying a stability criterion, to identify events that persist of large changes in scale."

These properties concern the relationship between the organizational principle of a two-dimensional anisotropic spatial filter or neural receptive field (such as elongation, or concatenation of subunits, or differential operators mediated by lateral inhibition in neural laminae) and the resulting general consequences for spatial frequency and orientation selectivity. These properties are demonstrated without assuming particular two-dimensional filter functional forms; rather, they are shown as general principles associated with certain broad categories of two-dimensional filters. Such an analysis enhance theoretical understanding of the two-dimensional receptive field organization of neurons in the visual cortex and permits the rejection of some candidate organizational principles on two-dimensional spectral grounds."

                "text": "A theory of edge detection is presented. The analysis proceeds in two parts. (1) Intensity changes, which occur in a natural image over a wide range of scales, are detected separately at different scales. An appropriate filter for this purpose at a given scale is found to be the second derivative of a Gaussian, and it is shown that, provided some simple conditions are satisfied, these primary filters need not be orientation-dependent. Thus, intensity changes at a given scale are best detected by finding the zero values of \u22072G(x, y)* I(x, y) for image I, where G(x, y) is a two-dimensional Gaussian distribution and \u22072 is the Laplacian. The intensity changes thus discovered in each of the channels are then represented by oriented primitives called zero-crossing segments, and evidence is given that this representation is complete. (2) Intensity changes in images arise from surface discontinuities or from reflectance or illumination boundaries, and these all have the property that they are spatially localized. Because of this, the zero-crossing segments from the different channels are not independent, and rules are deduced for combining them into a description of the image. This description is called the raw primal sketch. The theory explains several basic psychophysical findings, and the operation of forming oriented zero-crossing segments from the output of centre-surround \u22072G filters acting on the image forms the basis for a physiological model of simple cells (see Marr & Ullman 1979)."

The representation differs from established techniques in that the code elements are localized in spatial frequency as well as in space. Pixel-to-pixel correlations are first removed by subtracting a lowpass filtered copy of the image from the image itself. The result is a net data compression since the difference, or error, image has low variance and entropy, and the low-pass filtered image may represented at reduced sample density. Further data compression is achieved by quantizing the difference image. These steps are then repeated to compress the low-pass image. Iteration of the process at appropriately expanded scales generates a pyramid data structure. The encoding process is equivalent to sampling the image with Laplacian operators of many scales. Thus, the code tends to enhance salient image features. A further advantage of the present code is that it is well suited for many image analysis tasks as well as for image compression. Fast algorithms are described for coding and decoding."

The algorithm consists of five steps: (1) Each image is filtered with bar masks of four sizes that vary with eccentricity; the equivalent filters are about one octave wide. (2) Zero-crossings of the mask values are localized, and positions that correspond to terminations are found; (3) For each mask size, matching takes place between pairs of zero- crossings or terminations of the same sign in the two images, for a range of disparities up to about the vergence movements, thus causing small masks to come into correspondence; (5) When a correspondence is achieved, it is written into a dynamic buffer, called the 2 1/2 D sketch. It is shown that this proposal provides a theoretical framework for most existing phychophysical and neurophysiological data about stereopsis. Several critical experimental predictions are also made, for instance, about the wsize of Panum?s area under various conditions. The results of such experiments would tell us whether, for example, cooperativity is necessary for the fusion process."

For a vertical test grating, the elevation in contrast threshold produced by adapting to a high-contrast grating of the same spatial frequency but variable orientation was equated with the contrast levels of a vertical adapting grating that produced equivalent effects (equivalent-contrast transformation). This enabled comparisons to be made between the orientation tuning of the aftereffect at different retinal loci.

                "text": "If a scene containing fine spatial detail is viewed at constant high photopic luminance, there are two main factors which limit the perception of the fine detail-the quality of the optics of the eye forming the image on the retina and the ability of the retina (coupled to the brain) to resolve the details of that image. In the past there have been many theoretical studies of the potential resolving power of the optics based on consideration of diffraction and the chromatic and spherical aberrations of the eye. It is only recently that objective measurements of the quality of the optics of man in vivo have been obtained (Flamant, 1955; Westheimer & Campbell, 1962; Krauskopf 1962; R6hler, 1962). As will be demonstrated, it is not possible to use these findings to determine the relative weighting that should be given to the optics and the retina in determining a given threshold. This paper reports the results of experiments using an improved version of the well-known interference fringe technique (Le Grand, 1937; Byram 1944; Westheimer, 1960; Arnulf & Dupuy, 1960) which theoretically allows a sinusoidal pattern of very high contrast to be formed directly on the retina. The practical difficulty in using this technique is to obtain a light source of high intrinsic brightness and coherence with which to form high-luminance interference fringes on the retina; this has been solved by using a neon-helium gas laser. By decreasing the contrast (Fig. 1) of the interference fringes with another source of light it was possible to determine the contrasts on the retina at which the fringes are just detected. Thus a measure of the resolving power of the retina-brain is obtained without prior modification by the optics of the eye. Measurements have also been made of the visual resolution of external gratings whose intensity varied sinusoidally with distance across the gratings and which were imaged on to the retina by the optical components of the eye. By comparing the threshold contrasts of these external sinusoidal gratings with thresholds for sinusoidal fringes of the same spatial frequency formed through interference, the quality of the"

It would be astonishing if such a structure did not profoundly modify the response patterns of fibres coming into it. In the cat's visual cortex, the receptive field arrangements of single cells suggest that there is indeed a degree of complexity far exceeding anything yet seen at lower levels in the visual system. In a previous paper we described receptive fields of single cortical cells, observing responses to spots of light shone on one or both retinas (Hubel & Wiesel, 1959). In the present work this method is used to examine receptive fields of a more complex type (Part I) and to make additional observations on binocular interaction (Part II). This approach is necessary in order to understand the behaviour of individual cells, but it fails to deal with the problem of the relationship of one cell to its neighbours. In the past, the technique of recording evoked slow waves has been used with great success in studies of functional anatomy. It was employed by Talbot & Marshall (1941) and by Thompson, Woolsey & Talbot (1950) for mapping out the visual cortex in the rabbit, cat, and monkey. Daniel & Whitteiidge (1959) have recently extended this work in the primate. Most of our present knowledge of retinotopic projections, binocular overlap, and the second visual area is based on these investigations. Yet the method of evoked potentials is valuable mainly for detecting behaviour common to large populations of neighbouring cells; it cannot differentiate functionally between areas of cortex smaller than about 1 mm2. To overcome this difficulty a method has in recent years been developed for studying cells separately or in small groups during long micro-electrode penetrations through nervous tissue. Responses are correlated with cell location by reconstructing the electrode tracks from histological material. These techniques have been applied to"

Cells in visual cortex have been alternately considered as bar and edge detectors, or as spatial\u2010frequency filters responding to the two\u2010dimensional Fourier component of patterns. 2. The responses to gratings and to checkerboards allow one to test these alternate models: the Fourier components of a checkerboard pattern do not occur at the same orientation as the edges, nor do the checkerboard spatial frequencies correspond to the check widths. 3. Knowing the orientation tuning of a cell for gratings, one can precisely predict its orientation tuning to checkerboards from the orientation of the fundamental Fourier components of the patterns, not from the orientation of their edges. This was found for both square and rectangular checkerboards, and held for both simple and complex cortical cells. 4. Knowing the spatial tuning of a cell for sine\u2010wave gratings, one can precisely predict its spatial tuning to square and rectangular checkerboards from the spatial frequencies of the fundamental Fourier components of the patterns, not from the widths of their checks. 5. When presented with checkerboards in which not the fundamental but the upper harmonics were within its spatial bandpass, a cell's orientation tuning was found to be predictable from the (quite different) orientation of the higher Fourier harmonic components, but not from the orientation of the edges. 6. Knowing a cell's contrast sensitivity for gratings, one can predict the cell's contrast sensitivity for checkerboards much more accurately from the amplitudes of the two\u2010dimensional Fourier components of the patterns than from the contrasts of the patterns. 7. The orientation tuning, spatial\u2010frequency tuning and responsiveness of cells to a plaid pattern were also found to be predictable from the pattern's two\u2010dimensional Fourier spectrum. 8. Both simple and complex striate cortex cells can thus be characterized as two\u2010dimensional spatial\u2010frequency filters. Since different cells responsive to the same region in the visual field are tuned to different spatial frequencies and orientations, the ensemble of such cells would fairly precisely encode the two\u2010dimensional Fourier spectrum of a patch of visual space."

The activity of neurones of the visual cortex (area 17) has been recorded in anaesthetized cats in response to gratings of different profile and to single light and dark bars. 2. At very low spatial frequencies, outside the frequency response range to sinusoidal gratings, the response to square\u2010wave drifting gratings is obtainable from a combination of the response to the single bars of the grating presented in isolation. At higher spatial frequencies this is no longer true. 3. At very low spatial frequencies the responses to square\u2010wave gratings and to missing\u2010fundamental gratings (obtained by subtraction from the square\u2010wave grating of its fundamental gratings (obtained by subtraction from the square\u2010wave grating of its fundamental harmonic) are very similar. 4. At spatial frequencies near the peak of the spatial frequency tuning curve of the cell, the responses to square\u2010wave grating and to sinusoidal gratings are very similar. At these spatial frequencies the response to the missing\u2010fundamental grating is practically zero. 5. At spatial frequencies lower than that of best sensitivity for the cell, the response to square\u2010wave gratings is correlated with the 1st and 3rd harmonic of the stimulus. 6. We conclude that at very low spatial frequencies of the grating the response of cortical cells is correlated with the light or dark edges (or light or dark bars) of the stimulus, because the edges contain high frequencies within the range of sensitivity of the cells. At higher spatial frequencies the results are interpreted best by assuming that cortical cells respond to the harmonics of the visual periodic stimulus. 7. When a background of dynamic visual noise is added to increase the spontaneous discharge of simple cells, their response to visual stimuli becomes linear or quasi\u2010linear. The stimuli could be either single bars or gratings."

Other models of RF shape would predict a greater independence between orientation and spatial-frequency tuning. We have examined this by recording the responses of cat striate-cortex cells to a wide range of different spatial-frequency and orientation combinations. In almost all cells studied, peak orientation did not consistently vary with spatial frequency, but the majority of cells showed some change in peak spatial-frequency tuning with orientation. The amount of change in peak spatial frequency tended to be greater for cells that were narrowly tuned for orientation. However, cells narrowly (and also very broadly) tuned for spatial frequency tended to show considerable independence of spatial-frequency and orientation tuning, and in all but a few cells the degree of change was less than predicted by the classic RF model. Such cells were found to fire only to patterns whose local spatial spectra fell within a compact, restricted, roughly circular two-dimensional spatial-frequency region. We conclude that the two-dimensional RF shape of striate cells more closely approximates that predicted by a two-dimensional Gabor model or by a Gaussian-derivative model than it does the classic shape based on the output of geniculate cells with aligned RF's."

In such systems, it is imperative that the individual channel signals be decimated in such a way that the number of samples coded and transmitted do not exceed the number of samples in the original speech signal. Under this constraint, the systems presented in the past have sought to remove the aliasing distortion while minimizing the overall analysis/reconstruction distortion. In this paper, it is shown that it is possible to design tree-structured analysis/reconstruction systems which meet the sampling rate condition and which result in exact reconstruction of the input signal. The conditions for exact reconstruction are developed and presented. Furthermore, it is shown that these conditions are not overly restrictive and high-quality frequency division may be performed in the analysis section. A filter design procedure is presented which allows high-quality filters to be easily designed."

                "text": "How does an animal see? How might a computer do it? A study of stereo vision guides research on both these questions. Brain science suggests computer programs; the computer suggests what to look for in the brain. T he development of computers of increasing power and sophistication often stimulates comparisons between them and the human brain, and these comparisons are becoming more earnest as computers are applied more and more to tasks formerly associated with essentially human activities and capabilities. Indeed, it is widely expected that a coming generation of computers and robots will have sensory, motor and even \"intellec-tual\" skills closely resembling our own. How might such machines be designed? Can our rapidly growing knowledge of the human brain be a guide? And at the same time can our advances in \"artificial intelligence\" help us to understand the brain? At the level of their hardware (the brain's or a computer's) the differences are great. The neurons, or nerve cells, in a brain are small, delicate structures bound by a complex membrane and closely packed in a medium of supporting cells that control a complexand probably quite variable chemical environment. They are very unlike the wires and etched crystals of semiconducting materials on which computers are based. In the organization of the hardware the differences also are great. The connections between neurons are very numerous (anyone neuron may receive many thousands of inputs) and are distributed in three dimensions. In a computer the wires linking circuit components are limited by present-day solid-state technology to a relatively small number arranged more or less two-dimensionally. In the transmission of signals the differences again are great. The binary (on-off) electric pulses of the computer are mirrored to some extent in the all-or-nothing signal conducted along nerve fibers, but in addition the brain employs graded electrical signals, chemical messenger substances and the transport of ions. In temporal organization the differences are immense. Computers process infonna-tion serially (one step at a time) but at a very fast rate. The time course of their operation is governed by a computer-wide clock. What is known of the brain suggests that it functions much slower but that it analyzes information along millions of channels concurrently without need of clock-driven operation. How, then, are brains and computers alike? Clearly there must be a level at which any two mechanisms can be compared. One can compare the tasks they do. \u2026"

Use of QMF's enables to avoid the aliasing effects due to samples decimation when signal is split into sub-bands. Each sub-band is then coded independently with use of Block Companded PCM (BCPCM) quantizers. Then a variable number of bits is allocated to each sub-band quantizer in order to take advantage of the relative perceptual effect of the quantizing error. The paper is organized as follows: - First, splitting in two sub-bands with QMF's is analysed. -Then, a general description of a splitband voice coding scheme using QMF's is made. -Finally, two coding schemes are considered, operating respectively at 16 KBps and 32 KBps. Averaged values of S/N performances are given when encoding both male and female voices. Comparisons are made with conventional BCPCM and CCITT A-Law. Taped results will be played at the conference."

Assume that U is square integrable, i.e., that there exists in H(U) at least one nonzero vector g such that \u222b\u2016(U(x)g,g)\u20162\u2009dx<\u221e. We give here a reasonably self\u2010contained analysis of the correspondence associating to every vector f\u2208H(U) the function (U(x)g,f) on G, discussing its isometry, characterization of the range, inversion, and simplest interpolation properties. This correspondence underlies many properties of generalized coherent states."
