This paper shows that support vector machines (SVM's) can generalize well on difficult image classification problems where the only features are high dimensional histograms. Heavy-tailed RBF kernels of the form K(x, y) = e(-rho)Sigma(i)/xia-yia/b with a < or = 1 and b < or = 2 are evaluated on the classification of images extracted from the Corel stock photo collection and shown to far outperform traditional polynomial or Gaussian radial basis function (RBF) kernels. Moreover, we observed that a simple remapping of the input x(i)-->x(i)(a) improves the performance of linear SVM's to such an extend that it makes them, for this problem, a valid alternative to RBF kernels."

The HI kernel is proved to be positive definite and thus can be used in support vector machine (SVM) based recognition. Experimentally, it also leads to good recognition performances. However, its derivation applies only for binary strings such as color histograms computed on equally sized images. In this paper, we propose a new kernel, which we named generalized histogram intersection (GHI) kernel, since it applies in a much larger variety of contexts. First, an original derivation of the positive definiteness of the GHI kernel is proposed in the general case. As a consequence, vectors of real values can be used, and the images no longer need to have the same size. Second, a hyper-parameter is added, compared to the HI kernel, which allows us to better tune the kernel model to particular databases. We present experiments which prove that the GHI kernel outperforms the simple HI kernel in a simple recognition task. Comparisons with other well-known kernels are also provided."

Kernel-based classification methods can learn complex decision boundaries, but a kernel over unordered set inputs must somehow solve for correspondences epsivnerally a computationally expensive task that becomes impractical for large set sizes. We present a new fast kernel function which maps unordered feature sets to multi-resolution histograms and computes a weighted histogram intersection in this space. This \"pyramid match\" computation is linear in the number of features, and it implicitly finds correspondences based on the finest resolution histogram cell where a matched pair first appears. Since the kernel does not penalize the presence of extra features, it is robust to clutter. We show the kernel function is positive-definite, making it valid for use in learning algorithms whose optimal solutions are guaranteed only for Mercer kernels. We demonstrate our algorithm on object recognition tasks and show it to be accurate and dramatically faster than current approaches"

This paper presents an in-depth experimental study on pedestrian classification; multiple feature-classifier combinations are examined with respect to their ROC performance and efficiency. We investigate global versus local and adaptive versus nonadaptive features, as exemplified by PCA coefficients, Haar wavelets, and local receptive fields (LRFs). In terms of classifiers, we consider the popular support vector machines (SVMs), feedforward neural networks, and k-nearest neighbor classifier. Experiments are performed on a large data set consisting of 4,000 pedestrian and more than 25,000 nonpedestrian (labeled) images captured in outdoor urban environments. Statistically meaningful results are obtained by analyzing performance variances caused by varying training and test sets. Furthermore, we investigate how classification performance and training sample size are correlated. Sample size is adjusted by increasing the number of manually labeled training data or by employing automatic bootstrapping or cascade techniques. Our experiments show that the novel combination of SVMs with LRF features performs best. A boosted cascade of Haar wavelets can, however, reach quite competitive results, at a fraction of computational cost. The data set used in this paper is made public, establishing a benchmark for this important problem"

This paper presents a large-scale evaluation of an approach that represents images as distributions (signatures or histograms) of features extracted from a sparse set of keypoint locations and learns a Support Vector Machine classifier with kernels based on two effective measures for comparing distributions, the Earth Mover\u2019s Distance and the \u03c72 distance. We first evaluate the performance of our approach with different keypoint detectors and descriptors, as well as different kernels and classifiers. We then conduct a comparative evaluation with several state-of-the-art recognition methods on four texture and five object databases. On most of these databases, our implementation exceeds the best reported results and achieves comparable performance on the rest. Finally, we investigate the influence of background correlations on recognition performance via extensive tests on the PASCAL database, for which ground-truth object localization information is available. Our experiments demonstrate that image representations based on distributions of local features are surprisingly effective for classification of texture and object images under challenging real-world conditions, including significant intra-class variations and substantial background clutter."

Vapnik and his team (AT&T Bell Labs., 1985) that can be seen as a new method for training polynomial, neural network, or Radial Basis Functions classifiers. The decision surfaces are found by solving a linearly constrained quadratic programming problem. This optimization problem is challenging because the quadratic form is completely dense and the memory requirements grow with the square of the number of data points. We present a decomposition algorithm that guarantees global optimality, and can be used to train SVM's over very large data sets. The main idea behind the decomposition is the iterative solution of sub-problems and the evaluation of optimality conditions which are used both to generate improved iterative values, and also establish the stopping criteria for the algorithm. We present experimental results of our implementation of SVM, and demonstrate the feasibility of our approach on a face detection problem that involves a data set of 50,000 data points."

The technique can be seen as a new training algorithm for Polynomial, Radial Basis Function and Multi-Layer Perceptron networks. SVMs are currently considered slower at run-time than other techniques with similar generalization performance. In this paper we focus on SVM for classiication and investigate the problem of reducing its run-time complexity. We present two relevant results: a) the use of SVM itself as a regression tool to approximate the decision surface with a user-speciied accuracy; and b) a reformulation of the training problem that yields the exact same decision surface using a smaller number of basis functions. We believe that this reformulation ooers great potential for future improvements of the technique. For most of the selected problems, both approaches give reductions of run-time in the 50-95% range, with no system degradation."

Traditional approaches require applying a battery of different classifiers to the image, which can be slow and require much training data. We present a multi-class boosting procedure (joint boosting) that reduces both the computational and sample complexity, by finding common features that can be shared across the classes. The detectors for each class are trained jointly, rather than independently. For a given performance level, the total number of features required is observed to scale approximately logarithmically with the number of classes. In addition, we find that the features selected by independently trained classifiers are often specific to the class, whereas the features selected by the jointly trained classifiers are more generic features, such as lines and edges."

In essence, a kernel is a similarity measure between input points satisfying some mathematical requirements and possibly capturing the domain knowledge. We focus on kernels for images: we represent the image information content with binary strings and discuss various bitwise manipulations obtained using logical operators and convolution with nonbinary stencils. In the theoretical contribution of our work, we show that histogram intersection is a Mercer's kernel and we determine the modifications under which a similarity measure based on the notion of Hausdorff distance is also a Mercer's kernel. In both cases, we determine explicitly the mapping from input to feature space. The presented experimental results support the relevance of our analysis for developing effective trainable systems."

The quadratic computational complexity of the summation is a significant barrier to the scalability of this algorithm to practical applications. The fast Gauss transform (FGT) has successfully accelerated the kernel density estimation to linear running time for low-dimensional problems. Unfortunately, the cost of a direct extension of the FGT to higher-dimensional problems grows exponentially with dimension, making it impractical for dimensions above 3. We develop an improved fast Gauss transform to efficiently estimate sums of Gaussians in higher dimensions, where a new multivariate expansion scheme and an adaptive space subdivision technique dramatically improve the performance. The improved FGT has been applied to the mean shift algorithm achieving linear computational complexity. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our algorithm."

Many hand-crafted descriptors have been proposed in the literature for measuring visual similarity. Looking past initial differences, what really distinguishes one descriptor from another is the tradeoff that it achieves between discriminative power and invariance. Since this trade-off must vary from task to task, no single descriptor can be optimal in all situations. Our focus, in this paper, is on learning the optimal tradeoff for classification given a particular training set and prior constraints. The problem is posed in the kernel learning framework. We learn the optimal, domain-specific kernel as a combination of base kernels corresponding to base features which achieve different levels of trade-off (such as no invariance, rotation invariance, scale invariance, affine invariance, etc.) This leads to a convex optimisation problem with a unique global optimum which can be solved for efficiently. The method is shown to achieve state-of-the-art performance on the UIUC textures, Oxford flowers and Cal- tech 101 datasets."

First, we introduce a descriptor that represents local image shape and its spatial layout, together with a spatial pyramid kernel. These are designed so that the shape correspondence between two images can be measured by the distance between their descriptors using the kernel. Second, we generalize the spatial pyramid kernel, and learn its level weighting parameters (on a validation set). This significantly improves classification performance. Third, we show that shape and appearance kernels may be combined (again by learning parameters on a validation set).\n Results are reported for classification on Caltech-101 and retrieval on the TRECVID 2006 data sets. For Caltech-101 it is shown that the class specific optimization that we introduce exceeds the state of the art performance by more than 10%."

The basis of the algorithm is to run an observation window at all possible positions, scales and orientation within the image. A non-linear support vector machine is used to determine whether or not a face is contained within the observation window. The non-linear support vector machine operates by comparing the input patch to a set of support vectors (which can be thought of as face and anti-face templates). Each support vector is scored by some nonlinear function against the observation window and if the resulting sum is over some threshold a face is indicated. Because of the huge search space that is considered, it is imperative to investigate ways to speed up the support vector machine. Within this paper we suggest a method of speeding up the non-linear support vector machine. A set of reduced set vectors (RVs) are calculated from the support vectors. By considering the RV's sequentially, and if at any point a face is deemed too unlikely to cease the sequential evaluation, obviating the need to evaluate the remaining RVs. The idea being that we only need to apply a subset of the RVs to eliminate things that are obviously not a face (thus reducing the computation). The key then is to explore the RVs in the right order and a method for this is proposed."

After reviewing existing edge and gradient based descriptors, we show experimentally that grids of histograms of oriented gradient (HOG) descriptors significantly outperform existing feature sets for human detection. We study the influence of each stage of the computation on performance, concluding that fine-scale gradients, fine orientation binning, relatively coarse spatial binning, and high-quality local contrast normalization in overlapping descriptor blocks are all important for good results. The new approach gives near-perfect separation on the original MIT pedestrian database, so we introduce a more challenging dataset containing over 1800 annotated human images with a large range of pose variations and backgrounds."

Our system achieves a two-fold improvement in average precision over the best performance in the 2006 PASCAL person detection challenge. It also outperforms the best results in the 2007 challenge in ten out of twenty categories. The system relies heavily on deformable parts. While deformable part models have become quite popular, their value had not been demonstrated on difficult benchmarks such as the PASCAL challenge. Our system also relies heavily on new methods for discriminative training. We combine a margin-sensitive approach for data mining hard negative examples with a formalism we call latent SVM. A latent SVM, like a hidden CRF, leads to a non-convex training problem. However, a latent SVM is semi-convex and the training problem becomes convex once latent information is specified for the positive examples. We believe that our training methods will eventually make possible the effective use of more latent information such as hierarchical (grammar) models and models involving latent three dimensional pose."

                "text": "This paper describes a face detection framework that is capable of processing images extremely rapidly while achieving high detection rates. There are three key contributions. The first is the introduction of a new image representation called the \u201cIntegral Image\u201d which allows the features used by our detector to be computed very quickly. The second is a simple and efficient classifier which is built using the AdaBoost learning algorithm (Freund and Schapire, 1995) to select a small number of critical visual features from a very large set of potential features. The third contribution is a method for combining classifiers in a \u201ccascade\u201d which allows background regions of the image to be quickly discarded while spending more computation on promising face-like regions. A set of experiments in the domain of face detection is presented. The system yields face detection performance comparable to the best previous systems (Sung and Poggio, 1998; Rowley et al., 1998; Schneiderman and Kanade, 2000; Roth et al., 2000). Implemented on a conventional desktop, face detection proceeds at 15 frames per second."

Different resolutions are represented using a coarse-to-fine feature hierarchy. During detection, the lower resolution features are initially used to reject the majority of negative windows at relatively low cost, leaving a relatively small number of windows to be processed in higher resolutions. This enables the use of computationally more expensive higher resolution features to achieve high detection accuracy. We applied this framework on Histograms of Oriented Gradient (HOG) features for object detection. Our multi-resolution detector produced better performance for pedestrian detection than state-of-the-art methods (Dalal and Triggs, 2005), and was faster during both training and testing. Testing our method on motorbikes and cars from the VOC database revealed similar improvements in both speed and accuracy, suggesting that our approach is suitable for realtime general object detection applications."

The system derives much of its power from a representation that describes an object class in terms of an overcomplete dictionary of local, oriented, multiscale intensity differences between adjacent regions, efficiently computable as a Haar wavelet transform. This example-based learning approach implicitly derives a model of an object class by training a support vector machine classifier using a large set of positive and negative examples. We present results on face, people, and car detection tasks using the same architecture. In addition, we quantify how the representation affects detection performance by considering several alternate representations including pixels and principal components. We also describe a real-time application of our person detection system as part of a driver assistance system."

We use the orientation histogram as a feature vector for gesture class cation and interpolation. This method is simple and fast to compute, and o ers some robustness to scene illumination changes. We have implemented a real-time version, which can distinguish a small vocabulary of about 10 di erent hand gestures. All the computation occurs on a workstation; special hardware is used only to digitize the image. A user can operate a computer graphic crane under hand gesture control, or play a game. We discuss limitations of this method. For moving or \\dynamic gestures\", the histogram of the spatio-temporal gradients of image intensity form the analogous feature vector and may be useful for dynamic gesture recognition.

Most edge detection schemes ignore the composite nature of these edges, resulting in systematic errors in detection and localization. The problem of detecting and localizing these edges is addressed, along with the problem of false responses in smoothly shaded regions with constant gradient of the image brightness. A class of nonlinear filters, known as quadratic filters, is appropriate for this task, while linear filters are not. Performance criteria are derived for characterizing the SNR, localization and multiple responses of these filters in a manner analogous to Canny's criteria for linear filters. A two-dimensional version of the approach is developed which has the property of being able to represent multiple edges at the same location and determine the orientation of each to any desired precision. This permits junctions to be localized without rounding. Experimental results are presented.<<ETX>>"

This technique works by partitioning the image into increasingly fine sub-regions and computing histograms of local features found inside each sub-region. The resulting \"spatial pyramid\" is a simple and computationally efficient extension of an orderless bag-of-features image representation, and it shows significantly improved performance on challenging scene categorization tasks. Specifically, our proposed method exceeds the state of the art on the Caltech-101 database and achieves high accuracy on a large database of fifteen natural scene categories. The spatial pyramid framework also offers insights into the success of several recently proposed image descriptions, including Torralba\u2019s \"gist\" and Lowe\u2019s SIFT descriptors."

We show that it is possible to learn much information about a category from just one, or a handful, of images. The key insight is that, rather than learning from scratch, one can take advantage of knowledge coming from previously learned categories, no matter how different these categories might be. We explore a Bayesian implementation of this idea. Object categories are represented by probabilistic models. Prior knowledge is represented as a probability density function on the parameters of these models. The posterior model for an object category is obtained by updating the prior in the light of one or more observations. We test a simple implementation of our algorithm on a database of 101 diverse object categories. We compare category models learned by an implementation of our Bayesian approach to models learned from by maximum likelihood (ML) and maximum a posteriori (MAP) methods. We find that on a database of more than 100 categories, the Bayesian approach produces informative models when the number of training examples is too small for other methods to operate successfully."

To achieve this aim, new kinds of vision algorithms need to be developed which run in real time and subserve the robot's goals. Two fundamental goals are determining the location of a known object. Color can be successfully used for both tasks.This article demonstrates that color histograms of multicolored objects provide a robust, efficient cue for indexing into a large database of models. It shows that color histograms are stable object representations in the presence of occlusion and over change in view, and that they can differentiate among a large number of objects. For solving the identification problem, it introduces a technique calledHistogram Intersection, which matches model and image histograms and a fast incremental version of Histogram Intersection, which allows real-time indexing into a large database of stored models. For solving the location problem it introduces an algorithm calledHistogram Backprojection, which performs this task efficiently in crowded scenes."
