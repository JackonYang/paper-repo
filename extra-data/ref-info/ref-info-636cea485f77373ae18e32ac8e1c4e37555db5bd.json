We explicitly train it to distinguish objects with a well-defined boundary in space, such as cows and telephones, from amorphous background elements, such as grass and road. The measure combines in a Bayesian framework several image cues measuring characteristics of objects, such as appearing different from their surroundings and having a closed boundary. These include an innovative cue to measure the closed boundary characteristic. In experiments on the challenging PASCAL VOC 07 dataset, we show this new cue to outperform a state-of-the-art saliency measure, and the combined objectness measure to perform better than any cue alone. We also compare to interest point operators, a HOG detector, and three recent works aiming at automatic object segmentation. Finally, we present two applications of objectness. In the first, we sample a small numberof windows according to their objectness probability and give an algorithm to employ them as location priors for modern class-specific object detectors. As we show experimentally, this greatly reduces the number of windows evaluated by the expensive class-specific model. In the second application, we use objectness as a complementary score in addition to the class-specific model, which leads to fewer false positives. As shown in several recent papers, objectness can act as a valuable focus of attention mechanism in many other applications operating on image windows, including weakly supervised learning of object categories, unsupervised pixelwise segmentation, and object tracking in video. Computing objectness is very efficient and takes only about 4 sec. per image."

                "text": "Generic object detection is confronted by dealing with different degrees of variations in distinct object classes with tractable computations, which demands for descriptive and flexible object representations that are also efficient to evaluate for many locations. In view of this, we propose to model an object class by a cascaded boosting classifier which integrates various types of features from competing local regions, named as region lets. A region let is a base feature extraction region defined proportionally to a detection window at an arbitrary resolution (i.e. size and aspect ratio). These region lets are organized in small groups with stable relative positions to delineate fine grained spatial layouts inside objects. Their features are aggregated to a one-dimensional feature within one group so as to tolerate deformations. Then we evaluate the object bounding box proposal in selective search from segmentation cues, limiting the evaluation locations to thousands. Our approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art on popular multi-class detection benchmark datasets with a single method, without any contexts. It achieves the detection mean average precision of 41.7% on the PASCAL VOC 2007 dataset and 39.7% on the VOC 2010 for 20 object categories. It achieves 14.7% mean average precision on the Image Net dataset for 200 object categories, outperforming the latest deformable part-based model (DPM) by 4.7%."

                "text": "The problem, generic objectness proposal, aims to reduce the candidate windows for object detection tasks. The popular evaluation criterion for related methods is detection-rate/windows-amount(DR-#WIN), where DR is the percentage of groundtruth objects covered by proposal windows. An object is considered \u201ccovered\u201d by a window only if the strict PASCAL-overall criterion [3] is satisfied (the intersection of a proposal window and the object rectangle is not smaller than half of their union, so we call it \u201c0.5-criterion\u201d for short). Under the DR-#WIN evaluation framework, BING [2] in CVPR2014, obtains the best performance on the VOC2007 test set. It recalls 96.2% objects with only 1,000 proposal windows. The more surprising is the method is totally a realtime one. The authors of BING suggest that, after being resized to a fixed size (8\u00d7 8), almost all annotated rectangle regions share a common characteristics in gradients [2]. This commonness is captured by a template W learned from training images with a linear SVM. Besides this, the subtle differences between diverse width/height configurations are captured in a re-weighting model. Therefore BING consists of two stages: calculating W in stage I, and learning the re-weighting model in stage II. Furthermore, BING uses smart bitwise operations to calculate the inner product of W and candidate windows, so to improve the efficiency. We designed several templates by hands to substitute W , to verify whether templates play a key role in BING. These templates become less correlated to W in turn, but their performances on VOC 2007 test set are very close, see Fig.1.a. Next we discarded any templates and directly assigned the scores of stage I with uniformly random values (we call this method RAND-SCORE). Surprisingly, the performance of RANDSCORE is even very close to BING, as shown in Fig.1.b. It is clear that these templates do not have as strong significance as suggested in [2]. Then what on earth makes BING performing so well? To get the deep insight, we finished a theoretical analysis from the view of combinatorial geometry. We try to construct a small set of windows to \u201ccover\u201d all legal rectangles (we call it a full cover set). This is an atypical covering problem in combinatorial geometry [1]. We proposed four lemmas to solve it in the full paper. In conclusion, for an image of the width M and height N, we can use s(i, j)windows of the width 2i \u00b7 \u221a 2 and height 2 j \u00b7 \u221a 2 to cover all 2i \u2264 w \u2264 2i+1,2 j \u2264 h \u2264 2 j+1 rectangle regions, where s(i, j) = \u2308 M\u22122i ( 1\u2212 \u221a 2 2 ) \u00b72i\u00b7 \u221a 2 \u2309 \u00b7 \u2308 N\u22122 j ( 1\u2212 \u221a 2 2 ) \u00b72 j \u00b7 \u221a 2 \u2309.

However, many of existing object proposal generators have strong localization bias or require computationally expensive diversification strategies. In this paper, we present an effective approach to address these issues. We first propose a simple and useful localization bias measure, called superpixel tightness. Based on the characteristics of superpixel tightness distribution, we propose an effective method, namely multi-thresholding straddling expansion (MTSE) to reduce localization bias via fast diversification. Our method is essentially a box refinement process, which is intuitive and beneficial, but seldom exploited before. The greatest benefit of our method is that it can be integrated into any existing model to achieve consistently high recall across various intersection over union thresholds. Experiments on PASCAL VOC dataset demonstrates that our approach improves numerous existing models significantly with little computational overhead."

In experiments on the challenging PASCAL VOC 07 dataset, we show this new cue to outperform a state-of-the-art saliency measure [17], and the combined measure to perform better than any cue alone. Finally, we show how to sample windows from an image according to their objectness distribution and give an algorithm to employ them as location priors for modern class-specific object detectors. In experiments on PASCAL VOC 07 we show this greatly reduces the number of windows evaluated by class-specific object detectors."

However, to enable the use of more expensive features and classifiers and thereby progress beyond the state-of-the-art, a selective search strategy is needed. Therefore, we adapt segmentation as a selective search by reconsidering segmentation: We propose to generate many approximate locations over few and precise object delineations because (1) an object whose location is never generated can not be recognised and (2) appearance and immediate nearby context are most effective for object recognition. Our method is class-independent and is shown to cover 96.7% of all objects in the Pascal VOC 2007 test set using only 1,536 locations per image. Our selective search enables the use of the more expensive bag-of-words method which we use to substantially improve the state-of-the-art by up to 8.5% for 8 out of 20 classes on the Pascal VOC 2010 detection challenge."

To perform localization, one can take a sliding window approach, but this strongly increases the computational cost, because the classifier function has to be evaluated over a large set of candidate subwindows. In this paper, we propose a simple yet powerful branch-and-bound scheme that allows efficient maximization of a large class of classifier functions over all possible subimages. It converges to a globally optimal solution typically in sublinear time. We show how our method is applicable to different object detection and retrieval scenarios. The achieved speedup allows the use of classifiers for localization that formerly were considered too slow for this task, such as SVMs with a spatial pyramid kernel or nearest neighbor classifiers based on the chi2-distance. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of the resulting systems on the UIUC Cars dataset, the PASCAL VOC 2006 dataset and in the PASCAL VOC 2007 competition."

The best-performing methods are complex ensemble systems that typically combine multiple low-level image features with high-level context. In this paper, we propose a simple and scalable detection algorithm that improves mean average precision (mAP) by more than 30% relative to the previous best result on VOC 2012 -- achieving a mAP of 53.3%. Our approach combines two key insights: (1) one can apply high-capacity convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to bottom-up region proposals in order to localize and segment objects and (2) when labeled training data is scarce, supervised pre-training for an auxiliary task, followed by domain-specific fine-tuning, yields a significant performance boost. Since we combine region proposals with CNNs, we call our method R-CNN: Regions with CNN features. We also present experiments that provide insight into what the network learns, revealing a rich hierarchy of image features. Source code for the complete system is available at http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~rbg/rcnn."

                "text": "We present a method for detecting objects in images using a single deep neural network. Our approach, named SSD, discretizes the output space of bounding boxes into a set of default boxes over different aspect ratios and scales per feature map location. At prediction time, the network generates scores for the presence of each object category in each default box and produces adjustments to the box to better match the object shape. Additionally, the network combines predictions from multiple feature maps with different resolutions to naturally handle objects of various sizes. Our SSD model is simple relative to methods that require object proposals because it completely eliminates proposal generation and subsequent pixel or feature resampling stage and encapsulates all computation in a single network. This makes SSD easy to train and straightforward to integrate into systems that require a detection component. Experimental results on the PASCAL VOC, MS COCO, and ILSVRC datasets confirm that SSD has comparable accuracy to methods that utilize an additional object proposal step and is much faster, while providing a unified framework for both training and inference. Compared to other single stage methods, SSD has much better accuracy, even with a smaller input image size. For $300\\times 300$ input, SSD achieves 72.1% mAP on VOC2007 test at 58 FPS on a Nvidia Titan X and for $500\\times 500$ input, SSD achieves 75.1% mAP, outperforming a comparable state of the art Faster R-CNN model.

The object hypotheses are represented as figure-ground segmentations, and are extracted automatically, without prior knowledge of the properties of individual object classes, by solving a sequence of Constrained Parametric Min-Cut problems (CPMC) on a regular image grid. In a subsequent step, we learn to rank the corresponding segments by training a continuous model to predict how likely they are to exhibit real-world regularities (expressed as putative overlap with ground truth) based on their mid-level region properties, then diversify the estimated overlap score using maximum marginal relevance measures. We show that this algorithm significantly outperforms the state of the art for low-level segmentation in the VOC 2009 and 2010 data sets. In our companion papers [1], [2], we show that the algorithm can be used, successfully, in a segmentation-based visual object category recognition pipeline. This architecture ranked first in the VOC2009 and VOC2010 image segmentation and labeling challenges."

Other types of objects of amorphous spatial extent (e.g., trees, sky), however, are more naturally classified based on texture or color. In this paper, we seek to combine recognition of these two types of objects into a system that leverages \"context\" toward improving detection. In particular, we cluster image regions based on their ability to serve as context for the detection of objects. Rather than providing an explicit training set with region labels, our method automatically groups regions based on both their appearance and their relationships to the detections in the image. We show that our things and stuff (TAS) context model produces meaningful clusters that are readily interpretable, and helps improve our detection ability over state-of-the-art detectors. We also present a method for learning the active set of relationships for a particular dataset. We present results on object detection in images from the PASCAL VOC 2005/2006 datasets and on the task of overhead car detection in satellite images, demonstrating significant improvements over state-of-the-art detectors."

These approaches often model an object as a collection of keypoints and associated descriptors, and detection then involves first constructing a set of correspondences between object and image keypoints via descriptor matching, and subsequently using these correspondences as input to a robust geometric estimation algorithm such as RANSAC to find the transformation of the object in the image. In such approaches, the object model is generally constructed offline, and does not adapt to a given environment at runtime. Furthermore, the feature matching and transformation estimation stages are treated entirely separately. In this paper, we introduce a new approach to address these problems by combining the overall pipeline of correspondence generation and transformation estimation into a single structured output learning framework. Following the recent trend of using efficient binary descriptors for feature matching, we also introduce an approach to approximate the learned object model as a collection of binary basis functions which can be evaluated very efficiently at runtime. Experiments on challenging video sequences show that our algorithm significantly improves over state-of-the-art descriptor matching techniques using a range of descriptors, as well as recent online learning based approaches."

This problem could be viewed as a kind of weakly supervised segmentation task, and naturally fits the Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) framework: every training image is known to have (or not) at least one pixel corresponding to the image class label, and the segmentation task can be rewritten as inferring the pixels belonging to the class of the object (given one image, and its object class). We propose a Convolutional Neural Network-based model, which is constrained during training to put more weight on pixels which are important for classifying the image. We show that at test time, the model has learned to discriminate the right pixels well enough, such that it performs very well on an existing segmentation benchmark, by adding only few smoothing priors. Our system is trained using a subset of the Imagenet dataset and the segmentation experiments are performed on the challenging Pascal VOC dataset (with no fine-tuning of the model on Pascal VOC). Our model beats the state of the art results in weakly supervised object segmentation task by a large margin. We also compare the performance of our model with state of the art fully-supervised segmentation approaches."

Despite the popularity and widespread use of detection proposals, it is unclear which trade-offs are made when using them during object detection. We provide an in-depth analysis of twelve proposal methods along with four baselines regarding proposal repeatability, ground truth annotation recall on PASCAL, ImageNet, and MS COCO, and their impact on DPM, R-CNN, and Fast R-CNN detection performance. Our analysis shows that for object detection improving proposal localisation accuracy is as important as improving recall. We introduce a novel metric, the average recall (AR), which rewards both high recall and good localisation and correlates surprisingly well with detection performance. Our findings show common strengths and weaknesses of existing methods, and provide insights and metrics for selecting and tuning proposal methods."

                "text": "We present a method for generating object segmentation proposals from groups of superpixels. The goal is to propose accurate segmentations for all objects of an image. The proposed object hypotheses can be used as input to object detection systems and thereby improve efficiency by replacing exhaustive search. The segmentations are generated in a class-independent manner and therefore the computational cost of the approach is independent of the number of object classes. Our approach combines both global and local search in the space of sets of superpixels. The local search is implemented by greedily merging adjacent pairs of superpixels to build a bottom-up segmentation hierarchy. The regions from such a hierarchy directly provide a part of our region proposals. The global search provides the other part by performing a set of graph cut segmentations on a superpixel graph obtained from an intermediate level of the hierarchy. The parameters of the graph cut problems are learnt in such a manner that they provide complementary sets of regions. Experiments with Pascal VOC images show that we reach state-of-the-art with greatly reduced computational cost."

From the results obtained so far, our evaluation shows a consistent rapid progress over the last few years in terms of both accuracy and running time. The top contenders in this benchmark significantly outperform the models identified as the best in the previous benchmark conducted three years ago. We find that the models designed specifically for salient object detection generally work better than models in closely related areas, which in turn provides a precise definition and suggests an appropriate treatment of this problem that distinguishes it from other problems. In particular, we analyze the influences of center bias and scene complexity in model performance, which, along with the hard cases for the state-of-the-art models, provide useful hints toward constructing more challenging large-scale data sets and better saliency models. Finally, we propose probable solutions for tackling several open problems, such as evaluation scores and data set bias, which also suggest future research directions in the rapidly growing field of salient object detection."

The setting of this problem is fully unsupervised, without even image-level annotations or any assumption of a single dominant class. This is far more general than typical colocalization, cosegmentation, or weakly-supervised localization tasks. We tackle the discovery and localization problem using a part-based region matching approach: We use off-the-shelf region proposals to form a set of candidate bounding boxes for objects and object parts. These regions are efficiently matched across images using a probabilistic Hough transform that evaluates the confidence for each candidate correspondence considering both appearance and spatial consistency. Dominant objects are discovered and localized by comparing the scores of candidate regions and selecting those that stand out over other regions containing them. Extensive experimental evaluations on standard benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms the current state of the art in colocalization, and achieves robust object discovery in challenging mixed-class datasets."

We propose a novel method for generating object bounding box proposals using edges. Edges provide a sparse yet informative representation of an image. Our main observation is that the number of contours that are wholly contained in a bounding box is indicative of the likelihood of the box containing an object. We propose a simple box objectness score that measures the number of edges that exist in the box minus those that are members of contours that overlap the box\u2019s boundary. Using efficient data structures, millions of candidate boxes can be evaluated in a fraction of a second, returning a ranked set of a few thousand top-scoring proposals. Using standard metrics, we show results that are significantly more accurate than the current state-of-the-art while being faster to compute. In particular, given just 1000 proposals we achieve over 96% object recall at overlap threshold of 0.5 and over 75% recall at the more challenging overlap of 0.7. Our approach runs in 0.25 seconds and we additionally demonstrate a near real-time variant with only minor loss in accuracy."

This is achieved by gathering images of complex everyday scenes containing common objects in their natural context. Objects are labeled using per-instance segmentations to aid in precise object localization. Our dataset contains photos of 91 objects types that would be easily recognizable by a 4 year old. With a total of 2.5 million labeled instances in 328k images, the creation of our dataset drew upon extensive crowd worker involvement via novel user interfaces for category detection, instance spotting and instance segmentation. We present a detailed statistical analysis of the dataset in comparison to PASCAL, ImageNet, and SUN. Finally, we provide baseline performance analysis for bounding box and segmentation detection results using a Deformable Parts Model."

The wide and deep information are explored for the object proposal windows extracted in each image. The window-level co-saliency scores are calculated by integrating the intra-image contrast, the intra-group consistency, and the inter-group separability via a principled Bayesian formulation and are then converted to the superpixel-level co-saliency maps through a foreground region agreement strategy. Comprehensive experiments on two existing and one newly established datasets have demonstrated the consistent performance gain of the proposed approach."

We introduce selective search which combines the strength of both an exhaustive search and segmentation. Like segmentation, we use the image structure to guide our sampling process. Like exhaustive search, we aim to capture all possible object locations. Instead of a single technique to generate possible object locations, we diversify our search and use a variety of complementary image partitionings to deal with as many image conditions as possible. Our selective search results in a small set of data-driven, class-independent, high quality locations, yielding 99\u00a0% recall and a Mean Average Best Overlap of 0.879 at 10,097 locations. The reduced number of locations compared to an exhaustive search enables the use of stronger machine learning techniques and stronger appearance models for object recognition. In this paper we show that our selective search enables the use of the powerful Bag-of-Words model for recognition. The selective search software is made publicly available (Software: http://disi.unitn.it/~uijlings/SelectiveSearch.html)."

We introduce a regional contrast based salient object extraction algorithm, which simultaneously evaluates global contrast differences and spatial weighted coherence scores. The proposed algorithm is simple, efficient, naturally multi-scale, and produces full-resolution, highquality saliency maps. These saliency maps are further used to initialize a novel iterative version of GrabCut for high quality salient object segmentation. We extensively evaluated our algorithm using traditional salient object detection datasets, as well as a more challenging Internet image dataset. Our experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm consistently outperforms existing salient object detection and segmentation methods, yielding higher precision and better recall rates. We also show that our algorithm can be used to efficiently extract salient object masks from Internet images, enabling effective sketch-based image retrieval (SBIR) via simple shape comparisons. Despite such noisy internet images, where the saliency regions are ambiguous, our saliency guided image retrieval achieves a superior retrieval rate compared with state-of-the-art SBIR methods, and additionally provides important target object region information."

These algorithms can recover most image objects with high accuracy, but are usually computationally intensive since many graph cuts are computed with different enumerations of segment seeds. In this paper we propose an algorithm, RIGOR, for efficiently generating a pool of overlapping segment proposals in images. By precomputing a graph which can be used for parametric min-cuts over different seeds, we speed up the generation of the segment pool. In addition, we have made design choices that avoid extensive computations without losing performance. In particular, we demonstrate that the segmentation performance of our algorithm is slightly better than the state-of-the-art on the PASCAL VOC dataset, while being an order of magnitude faster."

Advances like SPPnet and Fast R-CNN have reduced the running time of these detection networks, exposing region proposal computation as a bottleneck. In this work, we introduce a Region Proposal Network (RPN) that shares full-image convolutional features with the detection network, thus enabling nearly cost-free region proposals. An RPN is a fully convolutional network that simultaneously predicts object bounds and objectness scores at each position. The RPN is trained end-to-end to generate high-quality region proposals, which are used by Fast R-CNN for detection. We further merge RPN and Fast R-CNN into a single network by sharing their convolutional features---using the recently popular terminology of neural networks with 'attention' mechanisms, the RPN component tells the unified network where to look. For the very deep VGG-16 model, our detection system has a frame rate of 5fps (including all steps) on a GPU, while achieving state-of-the-art object detection accuracy on PASCAL VOC 2007, 2012, and MS COCO datasets with only 300 proposals per image. In ILSVRC and COCO 2015 competitions, Faster R-CNN and RPN are the foundations of the 1st-place winning entries in several tracks. Code has been made publicly available"

In an effort to understand the benefits and drawbacks of existing methods, we empirically compare five state-of-the-art superpixel algorithms for their ability to adhere to image boundaries, speed, memory efficiency, and their impact on segmentation performance. We then introduce a new superpixel algorithm, simple linear iterative clustering (SLIC), which adapts a k-means clustering approach to efficiently generate superpixels. Despite its simplicity, SLIC adheres to boundaries as well as or better than previous methods. At the same time, it is faster and more memory efficient, improves segmentation performance, and is straightforward to extend to supervoxel generation."

The problem of how to accelerate the evaluation process without decreasing accuracy is thus of current interest. In this paper, we deal with this problem by using the idea of ranking. We propose a cascaded architecture which using the ranking SVM generates an ordered set of proposals for windows containing object instances. The top ranking windows may then be fed to a more complex detector. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach is robust, achieving higher overlap-recall values using fewer output proposals than the state-of-the-art. Our use of simple gradient features and linear convolution indicates that our method is also faster than the state-of-the-art."

In this situation the performance of a detector should be assessed on the basis of the area under the ROC curve over that range, rather than over the full curve, as the performance outside the prescribed range is irrelevant. This measure is labelled as the partial area under the ROC curve (pAUC). We propose a novel ensemble learning method which achieves a maximal detection rate at a user-defined range of false positive rates by directly optimizing the partial AUC using structured learning. In addition, in order to achieve high object detection performance, we propose a new approach to extracting low-level visual features based on spatial pooling. Incorporating spatial pooling improves the translational invariance and thus the robustness of the detection process. Experimental results on both synthetic and realworld data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, and we show that it is possible to train state-of-the-art pedestrian detectors using the proposed structured ensemble learning method with spatially pooled features. The result is the current best reported performance on the Caltech-USA pedestrian detection dataset."

Such detectors have recently been shown to benefit many applications such as speeding-up class-specific object detection, weakly supervised learning of object detectors and object discovery. In this paper, we introduce a novel and very efficient method for generic object detection based on a randomized version of Prim's algorithm. Using the connectivity graph of an image's super pixels, with weights modelling the probability that neighbouring super pixels belong to the same object, the algorithm generates random partial spanning trees with large expected sum of edge weights. Object localizations are proposed as bounding-boxes of those partial trees. Our method has several benefits compared to the state-of-the-art. Thanks to the efficiency of Prim's algorithm, it samples proposals very quickly: 1000 proposals are obtained in about 0.7s. With proposals bound to super pixel boundaries yet diversified by randomization, it yields very high detection rates and windows that tightly fit objects. In extensive experiments on the challenging PASCAL VOC 2007 and 2012 and SUN2012 benchmark datasets, we show that our method improves over state-of-the-art competitors for a wide range of evaluation scenarios."

In this paper, we formulate the problem of joint visual attribute and object class image segmentation as a dense multi-labelling problem, where each pixel in an image can be associated with both an object-class and a set of visual attributes labels. In order to learn the label correlations, we adopt a boosting-based piecewise training approach with respect to the visual appearance and co-occurrence cues. We use a filtering-based mean-field approximation approach for efficient joint inference. Further, we develop a hierarchical model to incorporate region-level object and attribute information. Experiments on the aPASCAL, CORE and attribute augmented NYU indoor scenes datasets show that the proposed approach is able to achieve state-of-the-art results."

We argue for a data-driven, semantic approach for ranking object proposals. Our framework, which we call DeepBox, uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to rerank proposals from a bottom-up method. We use a novel four-layer CNN architecture that is as good as much larger networks on the task of evaluating objectness while being much faster. We show that DeepBox significantly improves over the bottom-up ranking, achieving the same recall with 500 proposals as achieved by bottom-up methods with 2000. This improvement generalizes to categories the CNN has never seen before and leads to a 4.5-point gain in detection mAP. Our implementation achieves this performance while running at 260 ms per image."

Compared with classic segmentation algorithms, our system demonstrates its particular advantage in speed, with comparable results in segmentation quality. Adopting HFS in applications like salient object detection and object proposal generation results in a significant performance boost.

Editing such images while preserving the repetitions and their relations is nontrivial due to overlap, missing parts, deformation across instances, illumination variation, etc. Manually enforcing such relations is laborious and error-prone. We propose a novel framework where user scribbles are used to guide detection and extraction of such repeated elements. Our detection process, which is based on a novel boundary band method, robustly extracts the repetitions along with their deformations. The algorithm only considers the shape of the elements, and ignores similarity based on color, texture, etc. We then use topological sorting to establish a partial depth ordering of overlapping repeated instances. Missing parts on occluded instances are completed using information from other instances. The extracted repeated instances can then be seamlessly edited and manipulated for a variety of high level tasks that are otherwise difficult to perform. We demonstrate the versatility of our framework on a large set of inputs of varying complexity, showing applications to image rearrangement, edit transfer, deformation propagation, and instance replacement."

This work is distinguished by three key contributions. The first is the introduction of a new image representation called the \"integral image\" which allows the features used by our detector to be computed very quickly. The second is a learning algorithm, based on AdaBoost, which selects a small number of critical visual features from a larger set and yields extremely efficient classifiers. The third contribution is a method for combining increasingly more complex classifiers in a \"cascade\" which allows background regions of the image to be quickly discarded while spending more computation on promising object-like regions. The cascade can be viewed as an object specific focus-of-attention mechanism which unlike previous approaches provides statistical guarantees that discarded regions are unlikely to contain the object of interest. In the domain of face detection the system yields detection rates comparable to the best previous systems. Used in real-time applications, the detector runs at 15 frames per second without resorting to image differencing or skin color detection."

We propose a simple, fast, and effective algorithm for locating and segmenting salient objects by analysing image collections. As a key novelty, we introduce group saliency to achieve superior unsupervised salient object segmentation by extracting salient objects (in collections of pre-filtered images) that maximize between-image similarities and within-image distinctness. To evaluate our method, we construct a large benchmark dataset consisting of 15\u00a0K images across multiple categories with 6000+ pixel-accurate ground truth annotations for salient object regions where applicable. In all our tests, group saliency consistently outperforms state-of-the-art single-image saliency algorithms, resulting in both higher precision and better recall. Our algorithm successfully handles image collections, of an order larger than any existing benchmark datasets, consisting of diverse and heterogeneous images from various internet sources."

Given an image, the approach rapidly generates a set of regions that delineate candidate objects in the image. The key idea is to train an ensemble of figure-ground segmentation models. The ensemble is trained jointly, enabling individual models to specialize and complement each other. We reduce ensemble training to a sequence of uncapacitated facility location problems and show that highly accurate segmentation ensembles can be trained by combinatorial optimization. The training procedure jointly optimizes the size of the ensemble, its composition, and the parameters of incorporated models, all for the same objective. The ensembles operate on elementary image features, enabling rapid image analysis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the presented approach outperforms prior object proposal algorithms by a significant margin, while having the lowest running time. The trained ensembles generalize across datasets, indicating that the presented approach is capable of learning a generally applicable model of bottom-up segmentation."

Yet, existing approaches exhibit considerable variation in methodology, and it is often difficult to attribute improvements in result quality to specific algorithm properties. In this paper we reconsider some of the design choices of previous methods and propose a conceptually clear and intuitive algorithm for contrast-based saliency estimation. Our algorithm consists of four basic steps. First, our method decomposes a given image into compact, perceptually homogeneous elements that abstract unnecessary detail. Based on this abstraction we compute two measures of contrast that rate the uniqueness and the spatial distribution of these elements. From the element contrast we then derive a saliency measure that produces a pixel-accurate saliency map which uniformly covers the objects of interest and consistently separates fore- and background. We show that the complete contrast and saliency estimation can be formulated in a unified way using high-dimensional Gaussian filters. This contributes to the conceptual simplicity of our method and lends itself to a highly efficient implementation with linear complexity.

However, there has been little investigation on how we could build up a deep learning framework in a weakly supervised setting. In this paper, we attempt to model deep learning in a weakly supervised learning (multiple instance learning) framework. In our setting, each image follows a dual multi-instance assumption, where its object proposals and possible text annotations can be regarded as two instance sets. We thus design effective systems to exploit the MIL property with deep learning strategies from the two ends; we also try to jointly learn the relationship between object and annotation proposals. We conduct extensive experiments and prove that our weakly supervised deep learning framework not only achieves convincing performance in vision tasks including classification and image annotation, but also extracts reasonable region-keyword pairs with little supervision, on both widely used benchmarks like PASCAL VOC and MIT Indoor Scene 67, and also a dataset for image-and patch-level annotations."

In this paper, we introduce a method for salient region detection that outputs full resolution saliency maps with well-defined boundaries of salient objects. These boundaries are preserved by retaining substantially more frequency content from the original image than other existing techniques. Our method exploits features of color and luminance, is simple to implement, and is computationally efficient. We compare our algorithm to five state-of-the-art salient region detection methods with a frequency domain analysis, ground truth, and a salient object segmentation application. Our method outperforms the five algorithms both on the ground-truth evaluation and on the segmentation task by achieving both higher precision and better recall."

However, some equally important tasks such as visual tracking remain relatively unexplored. We believe that a major hurdle that hinders the application of CNN to visual tracking is the lack of properly labeled training data. While existing applications that liberate the power of CNN often need an enormous amount of training data in the order of millions, visual tracking applications typically have only one labeled example in the first frame of each video. We address this research issue here by pre-training a CNN offline and then transferring the rich feature hierarchies learned to online tracking. The CNN is also fine-tuned during online tracking to adapt to the appearance of the tracked target specified in the first video frame. To fit the characteristics of object tracking, we first pre-train the CNN to recognize what is an object, and then propose to generate a probability map instead of producing a simple class label. Using two challenging open benchmarks for performance evaluation, our proposed tracker has demonstrated substantial improvement over other state-of-the-art trackers."

We formulate this problem as a binary labeling task where we separate the salient object from the background. We propose a set of novel features, including multiscale contrast, center-surround histogram, and color spatial distribution, to describe a salient object locally, regionally, and globally. A conditional random field is learned to effectively combine these features for salient object detection. Further, we extend the proposed approach to detect a salient object from sequential images by introducing the dynamic salient features. We collected a large image database containing tens of thousands of carefully labeled images by multiple users and a video segment database, and conducted a set of experiments over them to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach."

Users prefer to ask for pictures using notions of content that are strongly oriented to the presence of abstractly defined objects. Computer programs that implement these queries automatically are desirable, but are hard to build because conventional object recognition techniques from computer vision cannot recognize very general objects in very general contexts. This paper describes our approach to object recognition, which is structured around a sequence of increasingly specialized grouping activities that assemble coherent regions of image that can be shown to satisfy increasingly stringent constraints. The constraints that are satisfied provide a form of object classification in quite general contexts. This view of recognition is distinguished by: far richer involvement of early visual primitives, including color and texture; hierarchical grouping and learning strategies in the classification process; the ability to deal with rather general objects in uncontrolled configurations and contexts. We illustrate these properties with four case-studies: one demonstrating the use of color and texture descriptors; one showing how trees can be described by fusing texture and geometric properties; one learning scenery concepts using grouped features; and one showing how this view of recognition yields a program that can tell, quite accurately, whether a picture contains naked people or not."

Given hours of video, the proposed method produces a compact storyboard summary of the camera wearer\u2019s day. In contrast to traditional keyframe selection techniques, the resulting summary focuses on the most important objects and people with which the camera wearer interacts. To accomplish this, we develop region cues indicative of high-level saliency in egocentric video\u2014such as the nearness to hands, gaze, and frequency of occurrence\u2014and learn a regressor to predict the relative importance of any new region based on these cues. Using these predictions and a simple form of temporal event detection, our method selects frames for the storyboard that reflect the key object-driven happenings. We adjust the compactness of the final summary given either an importance selection criterion or a length budget; for the latter, we design an efficient dynamic programming solution that accounts for importance, visual uniqueness, and temporal displacement. Critically, the approach is neither camera-wearer-specific nor object-specific; that means the learned importance metric need not be trained for a given user or context, and it can predict the importance of objects and people that have never been seen previously. Our results on two egocentric video datasets show the method\u2019s promise relative to existing techniques for saliency and summarization."

Our system is able to represent highly variable object classes and achieves state-of-the-art results in the PASCAL object detection challenges. While deformable part models have become quite popular, their value had not been demonstrated on difficult benchmarks such as the PASCAL data sets. Our system relies on new methods for discriminative training with partially labeled data. We combine a margin-sensitive approach for data-mining hard negative examples with a formalism we call latent SVM. A latent SVM is a reformulation of MI--SVM in terms of latent variables. A latent SVM is semiconvex, and the training problem becomes convex once latent information is specified for the positive examples. This leads to an iterative training algorithm that alternates between fixing latent values for positive examples and optimizing the latent SVM objective function."

By downloading, analyzing, and filtering massive amounts of human images from the Internet, we achieve a database which contains 400 thousands human figures that are segmented out of their background. The human figures are organized based on action semantic, clothes attributes, and indexed by the shape of their poses. They can be queried using either silhouette sketch or a skeleton to find a given pose. We demonstrate applications for this database for multiframe personalized content synthesis in the form of comic-strips, where the main character is the user or his/her friends. We address the two challenges of such synthesis, namely personalization and consistency over a set of frames, by introducing head swapping and clothes swapping techniques. We also demonstrate an action correlation analysis application to show the usefulness of the database for vision application."

Their performance is usually evaluated on partially annotated datasets. In this paper, we argue that the choice of using a partially annotated dataset for evaluation of object proposals is problematic - as we demonstrate via a thought experiment, the evaluation protocol is 'gameable', in the sense that progress under this protocol does not necessarily correspond to a \"better\" category independent object proposal algorithm. To alleviate this problem, we: (1) Introduce a nearly-fully annotated version of PASCAL VOC dataset, which serves as a test-bed to check if object proposal techniques are overfitting to a particular list of categories. (2) Perform an exhaustive evaluation of object proposal methods on our introduced nearly-fully annotated PASCAL dataset and perform cross-dataset generalization experiments, and (3) Introduce a diagnostic experiment to detect the bias capacity in an object proposal algorithm. This tool circumvents the need to collect a densely annotated dataset, which can be expensive and cumbersome to collect. Finally, we have released an easy-to-use toolbox which combines various publicly available implementations of object proposal algorithms which standardizes the proposal generation and evaluation so that new methods can be added and evaluated on different datasets. We hope that the results presented in the paper will motivate the community to test the category independence of various object proposal methods by carefully choosing the evaluation protocol."

Our key objectives are completeness and diversity: every object should have at least one good proposed region, and a diverse set should be top-ranked. Our approach is to generate a set of segmentations by performing graph cuts based on a seed region and a learned affinity function. Then, the regions are ranked using structured learning based on various cues. Our experiments on BSDS and PASCAL VOC 2008 demonstrate our ability to find most objects within a small bag of proposed regions."

After reviewing existing edge and gradient based descriptors, we show experimentally that grids of histograms of oriented gradient (HOG) descriptors significantly outperform existing feature sets for human detection. We study the influence of each stage of the computation on performance, concluding that fine-scale gradients, fine orientation binning, relatively coarse spatial binning, and high-quality local contrast normalization in overlapping descriptor blocks are all important for good results. The new approach gives near-perfect separation on the original MIT pedestrian database, so we introduce a more challenging dataset containing over 1800 annotated human images with a large range of pose variations and backgrounds."

We formulate the problem as a combination of two complementary processes: discovery and tracking. The first one establishes correspondences between prominent regions across videos, and the second one associates similar object regions within the same video. Interestingly, our algorithm also discovers the implicit topology of frames associated with instances of the same object class across different videos, a role normally left to supervisory information in the form of class labels in conventional image and video understanding methods. Indeed, as demonstrated by our experiments, our method can handle video collections featuring multiple object classes, and substantially outperforms the state of the art in colocalization, even though it tackles a broader problem with much less supervision."

Organised annually from 2005 to present, the challenge and its associated dataset has become accepted as the benchmark for object detection.This paper describes the dataset and evaluation procedure. We review the state-of-the-art in evaluated methods for both classification and detection, analyse whether the methods are statistically different, what they are learning from the images (e.g. the object or its context), and what the methods find easy or confuse. The paper concludes with lessons learnt in the three year history of the challenge, and proposes directions for future improvement and extension."

We study different ways of performing spatial and temporal pooling, feature normalization, choice of CNN layers as well as choice of classifiers. Making judicious choices along these dimensions led to a very significant increase in performance over more naive approaches that have been used till now. We evaluate our approach on the challenging TRECVID MED'14 dataset with two popular CNN architectures pretrained on ImageNet. On this MED'14 dataset, our methods, based entirely on image-trained CNN features, can outperform several state-of-the-art non-CNN models. Our proposed late fusion of CNN- and motion-based features can further increase the mean average precision (mAP) on MED'14 from 34.95% to 38.74%. The fusion approach achieves the state-of-the-art classification performance on the challenging UCF-101 dataset."

This issue is common in natural images and forms a fundamental challenge for prior methods. We tackle it from a scale point of view and propose a multi-layer approach to analyze saliency cues. The final saliency map is produced in a hierarchical model. Different from varying patch sizes or downsizing images, our scale-based region handling is by finding saliency values optimally in a tree model. Our approach improves saliency detection on many images that cannot be handled well traditionally. A new dataset is also constructed."

Our main contribution is a thorough evaluation of networks of increasing depth using an architecture with very small (3x3) convolution filters, which shows that a significant improvement on the prior-art configurations can be achieved by pushing the depth to 16-19 weight layers. These findings were the basis of our ImageNet Challenge 2014 submission, where our team secured the first and the second places in the localisation and classification tracks respectively. We also show that our representations generalise well to other datasets, where they achieve state-of-the-art results. We have made our two best-performing ConvNet models publicly available to facilitate further research on the use of deep visual representations in computer vision."

Instead, a multiple instance learning approach is used over sets of object hypotheses in order to represent objects relevant to the actions. We test our method on the extensive Stanford 40 Actions dataset [1] and achieve significant performance gain compared to the state-of-the-art. Our results show that using multiple object hypotheses within multiple instance learning is effective for human action recognition in still images and such an object representation is suitable for using in conjunction with other visual features."

When applying traditional retargeting methods for generating thumbnails, several important issues frequently arise, including thumbnail scales, object completeness and local structure smoothness. To address these issues, we propose a novel image retargeting algorithm, Scale and Object Aware Retargeting (SOAR), which has four components: (1) a scale dependent saliency map to integrate size information of thumbnails, (2) objectness (Alexe et al. 2010) for preserving object completeness, (3) a cyclic seam carving algorithm to guide continuous retarget warping, and (4) a thin-plate-spline (TPS) retarget warping algorithm that champions local structure smoothness. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is evaluated both quantitatively and qualitatively. The quantitative evaluation is conducted through an image browsing user study to measure the effectiveness of different thumbnail generating algorithms, followed by the ANOVA analysis. The qualitative study is performed on the RetargetMe benchmark dataset. In both studies, SOAR generates very promising performance, in comparison with state-of-the-art retargeting algorithms."

We exploit locality-sensitive hashing to replace the dot-product kernel operator in the convolution with a fixed number of hash-table probes that effectively sample all of the filter responses in time independent of the size of the filter bank. To show the effectiveness of the technique, we apply it to evaluate 100,000 deformable-part models requiring over a million (part) filters on multiple scales of a target image in less than 20 seconds using a single multi-core processor with 20GB of RAM. This represents a speed-up of approximately 20,000 times - four orders of magnitude - when compared with performing the convolutions explicitly on the same hardware. While mean average precision over the full set of 100,000 object classes is around 0.16 due in large part to the challenges in gathering training data and collecting ground truth for so many classes, we achieve a mAP of at least 0.20 on a third of the classes and 0.30 or better on about 20% of the classes."

Each model is usually introduced by demonstrating performances on new images, and it is hard to make immediate comparisons between models. To alleviate this problem, we propose a benchmark data set containing 300 natural images with eye tracking data from 39 observers to compare model performances. We calculate the performance of 10 models at predicting ground truth fixations using three different metrics. We provide a way for people to submit new models for evaluation online. We find that the Judd et al. and Graph-based visual saliency models perform best. In general, models with blurrier maps and models that include a center bias perform well. We add and optimize a blur and center bias for each model and show improvements. We compare performances to baseline models of chance, center and human performance. We show that human performance increases with the number of humans to a limit. We analyze the similarity of different models using multidimensional scaling and explore the relationship between model performance and fixation consistency. Finally, we offer observations about how to improve saliency models in the future."

Our key objectives are completeness and diversity: Every object should have at least one good proposed region, and a diverse set should be top-ranked. Our approach is to generate a set of segmentations by performing graph cuts based on a seed region and a learned affinity function. Then, the regions are ranked using structured learning based on various cues. Our experiments on the Berkeley Segmentation Data Set and Pascal VOC 2011 demonstrate our ability to find most objects within a small bag of proposed regions."

This requirement is \u201cartificial\u201d and may reduce the recognition accuracy for the images or sub-images of an arbitrary size/scale. In this work, we equip the networks with another pooling strategy, \u201cspatial pyramid pooling\u201d, to eliminate the above requirement. The new network structure, called SPP-net, can generate a fixed-length representation regardless of image size/scale. Pyramid pooling is also robust to object deformations. With these advantages, SPP-net should in general improve all CNN-based image classification methods. On the ImageNet 2012 dataset, we demonstrate that SPP-net boosts the accuracy of a variety of CNN architectures despite their different designs. On the Pascal VOC 2007 and Caltech101 datasets, SPP-net achieves state-of-the-art classification results using a single full-image representation and no fine-tuning. The power of SPP-net is also significant in object detection. Using SPP-net, we compute the feature maps from the entire image only once, and then pool features in arbitrary regions (sub-images) to generate fixed-length representations for training the detectors. This method avoids repeatedly computing the convolutional features. In processing test images, our method is 24-102 <inline-formula><tex-math>$\\times$</tex-math><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:type=\"simple\" xlink:href=\"he-ieq2-2389824.gif\"/> </alternatives></inline-formula> faster than the R-CNN method, while achieving better or comparable accuracy on Pascal VOC 2007. In ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC) 2014, our methods rank #2 in object detection and #3 in image classification among all 38 teams. This manuscript also introduces the improvement made for this competition."

Our analysis identifies serious design flaws of existing salient object benchmarks, called the dataset design bias, by over emphasising the stereotypical concepts of saliency. The dataset design bias does not only create the discomforting disconnection between fixations and salient object segmentation, but also misleads the algorithm designing. Based on our analysis, we propose a new high quality dataset that offers both fixation and salient object segmentation ground-truth. With fixations and salient object being presented simultaneously, we are able to bridge the gap between fixations and salient objects, and propose a novel method for salient object segmentation. Finally, we report significant benchmark progress on 3 existing datasets of segmenting salient objects."

We present a residual learning framework to ease the training of networks that are substantially deeper than those used previously. We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers - 8\u00d7 deeper than VGG nets [40] but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57% error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our extremely deep representations, we obtain a 28% relative improvement on the COCO object detection dataset. Deep residual nets are foundations of our submissions to ILSVRC & COCO 2015 competitions1, where we also won the 1st places on the tasks of ImageNet detection, ImageNet localization, COCO detection, and COCO segmentation."

Our scale and affine invariant detectors are based on the following recent results: (1) Interest points extracted with the Harris detector can be adapted to affine transformations and give repeatable results (geometrically stable). (2) The characteristic scale of a local structure is indicated by a local extremum over scale of normalized derivatives (the Laplacian). (3) The affine shape of a point neighborhood is estimated based on the second moment matrix.Our scale invariant detector computes a multi-scale representation for the Harris interest point detector and then selects points at which a local measure (the Laplacian) is maximal over scales. This provides a set of distinctive points which are invariant to scale, rotation and translation as well as robust to illumination changes and limited changes of viewpoint. The characteristic scale determines a scale invariant region for each point. We extend the scale invariant detector to affine invariance by estimating the affine shape of a point neighborhood. An iterative algorithm modifies location, scale and neighborhood of each point and converges to affine invariant points. This method can deal with significant affine transformations including large scale changes. The characteristic scale and the affine shape of neighborhood determine an affine invariant region for each point.We present a comparative evaluation of different detectors and show that our approach provides better results than existing methods. The performance of our detector is also confirmed by excellent matching results; the image is described by a set of scale/affine invariant descriptors computed on the regions associated with our points."

Even with this user supplied data, colorized images may appear unnatural as a result of limited user skill or inaccurate transfer of colors. To address these problems, we propose a colorization system that leverages the rich image content on the internet. As input, the user needs only to provide a semantic text label and segmentation cues for major foreground objects in the scene. With this information, images are downloaded from photo sharing websites and filtered to obtain suitable reference images that are reliable for color transfer to the given grayscale photo. Different image colorizations are generated from the various reference images, and a graphical user interface is provided to easily select the desired result. Our experiments and user study demonstrate the greater effectiveness of this system in comparison to previous techniques."

In this paper we explore novel pooling techniques that encode the second-order statistics of local descriptors inside a region. To achieve this effect, we introduce multiplicative second-order analogues of average and max-pooling that together with appropriate non-linearities lead to state-of-the-art performance on free-form region recognition, without any type of feature coding. Instead of coding, we found that enriching local descriptors with additional image information leads to large performance gains, especially in conjunction with the proposed pooling methodology. We show that second-order pooling over free-form regions produces results superior to those of the winning systems in the Pascal VOC 2011 semantic segmentation challenge, with models that are 20,000 times faster."

We propose a regional contrast based saliency extraction algorithm, which simultaneously evaluates global contrast differences and spatial coherence. The proposed algorithm is simple, efficient, and yields full resolution saliency maps. Our algorithm consistently outperformed existing saliency detection methods, yielding higher precision and better recall rates, when evaluated using one of the largest publicly available data sets. We also demonstrate how the extracted saliency map can be used to create high quality segmentation masks for subsequent image processing."

                "text": "Visual attention is a process that enables biological and machine vision systems to select the most relevant regions from a scene. Relevance is determined by two components: 1) top-down factors driven by task and 2) bottom-up factors that highlight image regions that are different from their surroundings. The latter are often referred to as \u201cvisual saliency.\u201d Modeling bottom-up visual saliency has been the subject of numerous research efforts during the past 20 years, with many successful applications in computer vision and robotics. Available models have been tested with different datasets (e.g., synthetic psychological search arrays, natural images or videos) using different evaluation scores (e.g., search slopes, comparison to human eye tracking) and parameter settings. This has made direct comparison of models difficult. Here, we perform an exhaustive comparison of 35 state-of-the-art saliency models over 54 challenging synthetic patterns, three natural image datasets, and two video datasets, using three evaluation scores. We find that although model rankings vary, some models consistently perform better. Analysis of datasets reveals that existing datasets are highly center-biased, which influences some of the evaluation scores. Computational complexity analysis shows that some models are very fast, yet yield competitive eye movement prediction accuracy. Different models often have common easy/difficult stimuli. Furthermore, several concerns in visual saliency modeling, eye movement datasets, and evaluation scores are discussed and insights for future work are provided. Our study allows one to assess the state-of-the-art, helps to organizing this rapidly growing field, and sets a unified comparison framework for gauging future efforts, similar to the PASCAL VOC challenge in the object recognition and detection domains."

Within this paper we examine the learning of the appearance model in Constrained Local Models (CLM) technique. We have two contributions: firstly we examine an approximate method for doing structured learning, which jointly learns all the appearances of the landmarks. Even though this method has no guarantee of optimality we find it performs better than training the appearance models independently. This also allows for efficiently online learning of a particular instance of a face. Secondly we use a binary approximation of our learnt model that when combined with binary features, leads to efficient inference at runtime using bitwise AND operations. We quantify the generalization performance of our approximate SO-CLM, by training the model parameters on a single dataset, and testing on a total of five unseen benchmarks. The speed at runtime is demonstrated on the ipad2 platform. Our results clearly show that our proposed system runs in real-time, yet still performs at state-of-the-art levels of accuracy."

However, how CNN best copes with multi-label images still remains an open problem, mainly due to the complex underlying object layouts and insufficient multi-label training images. In this work, we propose a flexible deep CNN infrastructure, called Hypotheses-CNN-Pooling (HCP), where an arbitrary number of object segment hypotheses are taken as the inputs, then a shared CNN is connected with each hypothesis, and finally the CNN output results from different hypotheses are aggregated with max pooling to produce the ultimate multi-label predictions. Some unique characteristics of this flexible deep CNN infrastructure include: 1) no ground-truth bounding box information is required for training; 2) the whole HCP infrastructure is robust to possibly noisy and/or redundant hypotheses; 3) the shared CNN is flexible and can be well pre-trained with a large-scale single-label image dataset, e.g., ImageNet; and 4) it may naturally output multi-label prediction results. Experimental results on Pascal VOC 2007 and VOC 2012 multi-label image datasets well demonstrate the superiority of the proposed HCP infrastructure over other state-of-the-arts. In particular, the mAP reaches 90.5% by HCP only and 93.2% after the fusion with our complementary result in [12] based on hand-crafted features on the VOC 2012 dataset."

Bridging this gap between how humans would like to access images versus their typical representation is the goal of image parsing, which involves assigning object and attribute labels to pixels. In this article we propose treating nouns as object labels and adjectives as visual attribute labels. This allows us to formulate the image parsing problem as one of jointly estimating per-pixel object and attribute labels from a set of training images. We propose an efficient (interactive time) solution. Using the extracted labels as handles, our system empowers a user to verbally refine the results. This enables hands-free parsing of an image into pixel-wise object/attribute labels that correspond to human semantics. Verbally selecting objects of interest enables a novel and natural interaction modality that can possibly be used to interact with new generation devices (e.g., smartphones, Google Glass, livingroom devices). We demonstrate our system on a large number of real-world images with varying complexity. To help understand the trade-offs compared to traditional mouse-based interactions, results are reported for both a large-scale quantitative evaluation and a user study."

This enables efficient learning methods for linear kernels to be applied to the non-linear intersection kernel, expanding the applicability of this model to much larger problems. In this paper we generalize this idea, and analyse a large family of additive kernels, called homogeneous, in a unified framework. The family includes the intersection, Hellinger's, and \u03c72 kernels commonly employed in computer vision. Using the framework we are able to: (i) provide explicit feature maps for all homogeneous additive kernels along with closed form expression for all common kernels; (ii) derive corresponding approximate finite-dimensional feature maps based on the Fourier sampling theorem; and (iii) quantify the extent of the approximation. We demonstrate that the approximations have indistinguishable performance from the full kernel on a number of standard datasets, yet greatly reduce the train/test times of SVM implementations. We show that the \u03c72 kernel, which has been found to yield the best performance in most applications, also has the most compact feature representation. Given these train/test advantages we are able to obtain a significant performance improvement over current state of the art results based on the intersection kernel."

We propose a novel method to decompose an image into large scale perceptually homogeneous elements for efficient salient region detection, using a soft image abstraction representation. By considering both appearance similarity and spatial distribution of image pixels, the proposed representation abstracts out unnecessary image details, allowing the assignment of comparable saliency values across similar regions, and producing perceptually accurate salient region detection. We evaluate our salient region detection approach on the largest publicly available dataset with pixel accurate annotations. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms 18 alternate methods, reducing the mean absolute error by 25.2% compared to the previous best result, while being computationally more efficient."

To accomplish this, we define handles to describe both local regions and image edges, and assign a weight for each handle based on an importance map for the source image. Inspired by conformal energy, which is widely used in geometry processing, we construct a novel quadratic distortion energy to measure the shape distortion for each handle. The resizing result is obtained by minimizing the weighted sum of the quadratic distortion energies of all handles. Compared to previous methods, our method allows distortion to be diffused better in all directions, and important image edges are well\u2010preserved. The method is efficient, and offers a closed form solution."

To generate the proposals, we identify critical level sets in geodesic distance transforms computed for seeds placed in the image. The seeds are placed by specially trained classifiers that are optimized to discover objects.

In this paper, we propose a feasible and fast approach to attention area detection in images based on contrast analysis. The main contributions are threefold: 1) a new saliency map generation method based on local contrast analysis is proposed; 2) by simulating human perception, a fuzzy growing method is used to extract attended areas or objects from the saliency map; and 3) a practicable framework for image attention analysis is presented, which provides three-level attention analysis, i.e., attended view, attended areas and attended points. This framework facilitates visual analysis tools or vision systems to automatically extract attentions from images in a manner like human perception. User study results indicate that the proposed approach is effective and practicable."

Objects with a similar shape are retrieved and segmented from online images matching the keywords, and deformed to correspond with the selected object. By matching the candidate object and adjusting manipulation parameters, our method appropriately modifies candidate objects and composites them into the scene. Supported manipulations include transferring texture, color and shape from the matched object to the target in a seamless manner. We demonstrate the versatility of our framework using several inputs of varying complexity, for object completion, augmentation, replacement and revealing.

Fast R-CNN builds on previous work to efficiently classify object proposals using deep convolutional networks. Compared to previous work, Fast R-CNN employs several innovations to improve training and testing speed while also increasing detection accuracy. Fast R-CNN trains the very deep VGG16 network 9x faster than R-CNN, is 213x faster at test-time, and achieves a higher mAP on PASCAL VOC 2012. Compared to SPPnet, Fast R-CNN trains VGG16 3x faster, tests 10x faster, and is more accurate.

By analyzing the log-spectrum of an input image, we extract the spectral residual of an image in spectral domain, and propose a fast method to construct the corresponding saliency map in spatial domain. We test this model on both natural pictures and artificial images such as psychological patterns. The result indicate fast and robust saliency detection of our method."

We move in a new, more general direction in this paper and ask the critical fundamental question: what is action, how is action different from motion, and in a given image or video where is the action? We study the philosophical and visual characteristics of action, which lead us to define actionness: intentional bodily movement of biological agents (people, animals). To solve the general problem, we propose the lattice conditional ordinal random field model that incorporates local evidence as well as neighboring order agreement. We implement the new model in the continuous domain and apply it to scoring actionness in both image and video datasets. Our experiments demonstrate not only that our new model can outperform the popular ranking SVM but also that indeed action is distinct from motion."

We introduce interactive images in the context of man-made environments wherein objects are simple and regular, share various non-local relations (e.g., coplanarity, parallelism, etc.), and are often repeated. Our interactive framework creates partial scene reconstructions based on cuboid-proxies with minimal user interaction. It subsequently allows a range of intuitive image edits mimicking real-world behavior, which are otherwise difficult to achieve. Effectively, the user simply provides high-level semantic hints, while our system ensures plausible operations by conforming to the extracted non-local relations. We demonstrate our system on a range of real-world images and validate the plausibility of the results using a user study."

In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for automatically computing the best views of 3D shapes based on their web images. Best view selection is generally an intuitive task of getting the most information of a 3D shape. The novelty of our approach is to directly explore human perception on observing 3D shapes from the relevant web images. Those images are captured from biased views of different people, thus sufficiently reflecting view choice when observing the 3D shapes. By collecting web images possibly captured from the similar views, the best view is selected as the one possessing the most web images. We experiment our method with the shapes in Princeton Shape Benchmark (PSB), as well make comparisons with traditional geometric descriptor based approaches. The results demonstrate that our method is not only robust but also able to produce more canonical views in accordance with human perception."

For a class of kernels we show that one can do this much more efficiently. In particular we show that one can build histogram intersection kernel SVMs (IKSVMs) with runtime complexity of the classifier logarithmic in the number of support vectors as opposed to linear for the standard approach. We further show that by precomputing auxiliary tables we can construct an approximate classifier with constant runtime and space requirements, independent of the number of support vectors, with negligible loss in classification accuracy on various tasks. This approximation also applies to 1 - chi2 and other kernels of similar form. We also introduce novel features based on a multi-level histograms of oriented edge energy and present experiments on various detection datasets. On the INRIA pedestrian dataset an approximate IKSVM classifier based on these features has the current best performance, with a miss rate 13% lower at 10-6 False Positive Per Window than the linear SVM detector of Dalal & Triggs. On the Daimler Chrysler pedestrian dataset IKSVM gives comparable accuracy to the best results (based on quadratic SVM), while being 15times faster. In these experiments our approximate IKSVM is up to 2000times faster than a standard implementation and requires 200times less memory. Finally we show that a 50times speedup is possible using approximate IKSVM based on spatial pyramid features on the Caltech 101 dataset with negligible loss of accuracy."

But exactly how such data can be harnessed and organized remains a critical problem. We introduce here a new database called \u201cImageNet\u201d, a large-scale ontology of images built upon the backbone of the WordNet structure. ImageNet aims to populate the majority of the 80,000 synsets of WordNet with an average of 500-1000 clean and full resolution images. This will result in tens of millions of annotated images organized by the semantic hierarchy of WordNet. This paper offers a detailed analysis of ImageNet in its current state: 12 subtrees with 5247 synsets and 3.2 million images in total. We show that ImageNet is much larger in scale and diversity and much more accurate than the current image datasets. Constructing such a large-scale database is a challenging task. We describe the data collection scheme with Amazon Mechanical Turk. Lastly, we illustrate the usefulness of ImageNet through three simple applications in object recognition, image classification and automatic object clustering. We hope that the scale, accuracy, diversity and hierarchical structure of ImageNet can offer unparalleled opportunities to researchers in the computer vision community and beyond."

Most of previous visual search systems adopt the framework of \u201dBag of Words\u201d, in which words indicate quantized codes of visual features. In this work, we propose a novel visual search system based on \u201dBag of Hash Bits\u201d (BoHB), in which each local feature is encoded to a very small number of hash bits, instead of quantized to visual words, and the whole image is represented as bag of hash bits. The proposed BoHB method offers unique benefits in solving the challenges associated with mobile visual search, e.g., low transmission cost, cheap memory and computation on the mobile side, etc. Moreover, our BoHB method leverages the distinct properties of hashing bits such as multi-table indexing, multiple bucket probing, bit reuse, and hamming distance based ranking to achieve efficient search over gigantic visual databases. The proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art mobile visual search methods like CHoG, and other (conventional desktop) visual search approaches like bag of words via vocabulary tree, or product quantization. The proposed BoHB approach is easy to implement on mobile devices, and general in the sense that it can be applied to different types of local features, hashing algorithms and image databases. We also incorporate a boundary feature in the reranking step to describe the object shapes, complementing the local features that are usually used to characterize the local details. The boundary feature can further filter out noisy results and improve the search performance, especially at the coarse category level. Extensive experiments over large-scale data sets up to 400k product images demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach."

This study addresses the question of how simple networks of neuron-like elements can account for a variety of phenomena associated with this shift of selective visual attention. Specifically, we propose the following: (1) A number of elementary features, such as color, orientation, direction of movement, disparity etc. are represented in parallel in different topographical maps, called the early representation. (2) There exists a selective mapping from the early topographic representation into a more central non-topographic representation, such that at any instant the central representation contains the properties of only a single location in the visual scene, the selected location. We suggest that this mapping is the principal expression of early selective visual attention. One function of selective attention is to fuse information from different maps into one coherent whole. (3) Certain selection rules determine which locations will be mapped into the central representation. The major rule, using the conspicuity of locations in the early representation, is implemented using a so-called Winner-Take-All network. Inhibiting the selected location in this network causes an automatic shift towards the next most conspicious location. Additional rules are proximity and similarity preferences. We discuss how these rules can be implemented in neuron-like networks and suggest a possible role for the extensive back-projection from the visual cortex to the LGN."

The composed picture is generated by seamlessly stitching several photographs in agreement with the sketch and text labels; these are found by searching the Internet. Although online image search generates many inappropriate results, our system is able to automatically select suitable photographs to generate a high quality composition, using a filtering scheme to exclude undesirable images. We also provide a novel image blending algorithm to allow seamless image composition. Each blending result is given a numeric score, allowing us to find an optimal combination of discovered images. Experimental results show the method is very successful; we also evaluate our system using the results from two user studies."

In a typical experiment, before the arrays were presented, subjects would be asked to report letters appearing in one color (targets, here black letters), and to disregard letters in the other color (nontargets, here white letters). The array would then be briefly flashed, and the subjects, without any opportunity for eye movements, would give their report. The display mimics our. usual cluttered visual environment: It contains one or more objects that are relevant to current behavior, along with others that are irrelevant. The first basic phenomenon is limited capacity for processing information. At any given time, only a small amount of the information available on the retina can be processed and used in the control of behavior. Subjectively, giving attention to any one target leaves less available for others. In Figure 1, the probability of reporting the target letter N is much lower with two accompa\u00ad nying targets (Figure la) than with none (Figure Ib). The second basic phenomenon is selectivity-the ability to filter out un\u00ad wanted information. Subjectively, one is aware of attended stimuli and largely unaware of unattended ones. Correspondingly, accuracy in identifying an attended stimulus may be independent of the number of nontargets in a display (Figure la vs Ie) (see Bundesen 1990, Duncan 1980)."

Our BiDirectional (BiDi) screen, capable of both image capture and display, is inspired by emerging LCDs that use embedded optical sensors to detect multiple points of contact. Our key contribution is to exploit the spatial light modulation capability of LCDs to allow lensless imaging without interfering with display functionality. We switch between a display mode showing traditional graphics and a capture mode in which the backlight is disabled and the LCD displays a pinhole array or an equivalent tiled-broadband code. A large-format image sensor is placed slightly behind the liquid crystal layer. Together, the image sensor and LCD form a mask-based light field camera, capturing an array of images equivalent to that produced by a camera array spanning the display surface. The recovered multi-view orthographic imagery is used to passively estimate the depth of scene points. Two motivating applications are described: a hybrid touch plus gesture interaction and a light-gun mode for interacting with external light-emitting widgets. We show a working prototype that simulates the image sensor with a camera and diffuser, allowing interaction up to 50 cm in front of a modified 20.1 inch LCD."

The posterior parietal cortex is crucial for the analysis of space, visual attention and movement. Neurons in one of its subdivisions, the lateral intraparietal area (LIP), have visual responses to stimuli appearing abruptly at particular retinal locations (their receptive fields). We have tested the responses of LIP neurons to stimuli that entered their receptive field by saccades. Neurons had little or no response to stimuli brought into their receptive field by saccades, unless the stimuli were behaviourally significant. We established behavioural significance in two ways: either by making a stable stimulus task-relevant, or by taking advantage of the attentional attraction of an abruptly appearing stimulus. Our results show that under ordinary circumstances the entire visual world is only weakly represented in LIP. The visual representation in LIP is sparse, with only the mostsalient or behaviourally relevant objects being strongly represented."

In this work, we present a novel approach for creating a fantastic collage artform, namely Arcimboldo-like collage, which represents an input image with multiple thematically-related cutouts from the filtered Internet images. Due to the massive data of Internet images, competent image cutouts can almost always be discovered to match the segmented components of the input image. The selected cutouts are purposefully arranged such that as a whole assembly, they can represent the input image with disguise in both shape and color; but separately, individual cutout is still recognizable as its own being. Experimental results and user study show that our algorithm can effectively produce the entertaining Arcimboldo-like collages."

We define a predicate for measuring the evidence for a boundary between two regions using a graph-based representation of the image. We then develop an efficient segmentation algorithm based on this predicate, and show that although this algorithm makes greedy decisions it produces segmentations that satisfy global properties. We apply the algorithm to image segmentation using two different kinds of local neighborhoods in constructing the graph, and illustrate the results with both real and synthetic images. The algorithm runs in time nearly linear in the number of graph edges and is also fast in practice. An important characteristic of the method is its ability to preserve detail in low-variability image regions while ignoring detail in high-variability regions."

We introduce interactive images in the context of man-made environments wherein objects are simple and regular, share various non-local relations (e.g., coplanarity, parallelism, etc.), and are often repeated. Our interactive framework creates partial scene reconstructions based on cuboid-proxies with minimal user interaction. It subsequently allows a range of intuitive image edits mimicking real-world behavior, which are otherwise difficult to achieve. Effectively, the user simply provides high-level semantic hints, while our system ensures plausible operations by conforming to the extracted non-local relations. We demonstrate our system on a range of real-world images and validate the plausibility of the results using a user study."

The creation process of paper architecture is often labor-intensive and highly skill-demanding, even with the aid of existing computer-aided design tools. We propose an automatic algorithm for generating paper architectures given a user-specified 3D model. The algorithm is grounded on geometric formulation of planar layout for paper architectures that can be popped-up in a rigid and stable manner, and sufficient conditions for a 3D surface to be popped-up from such a planar layout. Based on these conditions, our algorithm computes a class of paper architectures containing two sets of parallel patches that approximate the input geometry while guaranteed to be physically realizable. The method is demonstrated on a number of architectural examples, and physically engineered results are presented."

We introduce a regional contrast based salient object detection algorithm, which simultaneously evaluates global contrast differences and spatial weighted coherence scores. The proposed algorithm is simple, efficient, naturally multi-scale, and produces full-resolution, high-quality saliency maps. These saliency maps are further used to initialize a novel iterative version of GrabCut, namely SaliencyCut, for high quality unsupervised salient object segmentation. We extensively evaluated our algorithm using traditional salient object detection datasets, as well as a more challenging Internet image dataset. Our experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm consistently outperforms 15 existing salient object detection and segmentation methods, yielding higher precision and better recall rates. We also show that our algorithm can be used to efficiently extract salient object masks from Internet images, enabling effective sketch-based image retrieval (SBIR) via simple shape comparisons. Despite such noisy internet images, where the saliency regions are ambiguous, our saliency guided image retrieval achieves a superior retrieval rate compared with state-of-the-art SBIR methods, and additionally provides important target object region information."
