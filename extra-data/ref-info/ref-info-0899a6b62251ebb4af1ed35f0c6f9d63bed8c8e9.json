Estimation of ICA is usually performed by optimizing a 'contrast' function based on higher-order cumulants. It is shown how almost any error function can be used to construct a contrast function to perform the ICA estimation. In particular, this means that one can use contrast functions that are robust against outliers. As a practical method for finding the relevant extrema of such contrast functions, a fixed-point iteration scheme is then introduced. The resulting algorithms are quite simple and converge fast and reliably. These algorithms also enable estimation of the independent components one-by-one, using a simple deflation scheme."

In this paper, we use a combination of two different approaches for linear ICA: Comon's information-theoretic approach and the projection pursuit approach. Using maximum entropy approximations of differential entropy, we introduce a family of new contrast (objective) functions for ICA. These contrast functions enable both the estimation of the whole decomposition by minimizing mutual information, and estimation of individual independent components as projection pursuit directions. The statistical properties of the estimators based on such contrast functions are analyzed under the assumption of the linear mixture model, and it is shown how to choose contrast functions that are robust and/or of minimum variance. Finally, we introduce simple fixed-point algorithms for practical optimization of the contrast functions. These algorithms optimize the contrast functions very fast and reliably."

In this paper we approach the problem from the point of view of a single neuron. Two simple learning rules are presented as examples of a more general class of algorithms. The first rule learns to separate an independent component which has a negative kurtosis, and the second rule separates a component with a positive kurtosis. The learning rules are stochastic gradient descent that result in Hebbian learning with very simple constraint terms. The convergence of the learning rules can be rigorously proven without any unnecessary hypotheses on the distributions of independent components. Simulations confirm the validity of the algorithms."

By adequate adaptive preprocessing it can be supposed that the observed source mixture x is 'white'. Then a separating matrix H (such that y=Hx has independent components) can be assumed unitary. A new contrast function is defined whose maximum occurs when H is separating. Its (simple) form admits an associated adaptive algorithm. Two different algorithms are proposed to estimate H, either directly or through its equivalent product of Givens rotations. Computer simulations illustrate the contribution of the cross-cumulants on the convergence of the algorithms. In the three-sources case, they show that the performances are improved substantially.<<ETX>>"

This algorithm is based on higher order moments and has also been applied to deconvolving signal mixtures. In practical problems where the order of the convolving filter may be high, frequency domain approaches are known to provide a more computationally efficient method of deconvolution. In this paper, the authors introduce a complex recurrent network structure for performing blind deconvolution. The aim is to investigate the performance of this approach for separating unknown, convolved signals which may occur in a situation such as the well-known 'cocktail-party problem'.<<ETX>>"

The algorithm does not assume any knowledge of the input distributions, and is defined here for the zero-noise limit. Under these conditions, information maximization has extra properties not found in the linear case (Linsker 1989). The nonlinearities in the transfer function are able to pick up higher-order moments of the input distributions and perform something akin to true redundancy reduction between units in the output representation. This enables the network to separate statistically independent components in the inputs: a higher-order generalization of principal components analysis. We apply the network to the source separation (or cocktail party) problem, successfully separating unknown mixtures of up to 10 speakers. We also show that a variant on the network architecture is able to perform blind deconvolution (cancellation of unknown echoes and reverberation in a speech signal). Finally, we derive dependencies of information transfer on time delays. We suggest that information maximization provides a unifying framework for problems in \"blind\" signal processing."

We propose the use of an error function that merges both types of information and obtain the JADE T D algorithm. This way we combine the virtues of both ingredients: the TDSEP and the JADE algorithm. We investigate the performance and usefulness of the new algorithm in several experimental scenarios. A particularly interesting scenario is the robustness of blind separation in the presence of noise, where the measuring noise eeectively doubles the number of sources and therefore leads to large separation errors for blind separation algorithms. To still allow for separation in the presence of noise, we propose to use time delayed covariance matrices for the whitening step and for the estimation of the subsequent rotation step, accordingly, also delayed cumulant information is taken into account. This technique makes use of the fact that the autocorrelation function (ACF) of the measuring noise decays much faster than the auto-correlation function of the signals."

In this paper, the linear version of the ICA problem is approached from an information-theoretic viewpoint, using Comon's framework of minimizing mutual information of the components. Using maximum entropy approximations of diierential entropy, we introduce a family of new contrast (objective) functions for ICA, which can also be considered 1-D projection pursuit indexes. The statistical properties of the estimators based on such contrast functions are analyzed under the assumption of the linear mixture model. It is shown how to choose optimal contrast functions according to diierent criteria. Novel algorithms for maximizing the contrast functions are then introduced. Hebbian-like learning rules are shown to result from gradient descent methods. Finally, in order to speed up the convergence, a family of xed-point algorithms for maximization of the contrast functions is introduced."

A special (index-free) tensor formalism to express fourth-order multivariate statistics is proposed. A quadricovariance tensor which contains the fourth-order joint cumulants is defined. In this formalism, the quadricovariance tensor and its eigen-matrices are natural fourth-order generalizations of second-order covariance and eigenvectors, allowing direct extension of many standard second-order method to fourth-order. The idea of an eigen-matrix is then proposed as a solution to the blind source separation problem. The task is to separate a mixture of N independent non-Gaussian signals received on an array of sensors when no information is available about propagation conditions or array geometry (blind situation). This can be achieved only by resorting to higher-order information. Quadricovariance eigen-matrices give a direct solution to this problem.<<ETX>>"

Classically, documents and queries are represented as vectors of word counts. In its simplest form, relevance is defined to be the dot product between a document and a query vector-a measure of the number of common terms. A central difficulty in text retrieval is that the presence or absence of a word is not sufficient to determine relevance to a query. Linear dimensionality reduction has been proposed as a technique for extracting underlying structure from the document collection. In some domains (such as vision) dimensionality reduction reduces computational complexity. In text retrieval it is more often used to improve retrieval performance. We propose an alternative and novel technique that produces sparse representations constructed from sets of highly-related words. Documents and queries are represented by their distance to these sets, and relevance is measured by the number of common clusters. This technique significantly improves retrieval performance, is efficient to compute and shares properties with the optimal linear projection operator and the independent components of documents."

The second section of the screw shaft is in the form of a lower pitch thread for compressing the plastic material and transferring it to a longer, third section in the form of kneading discs, from which material passes through an outlet nozzle section to a cyclone separator where trapped gases and liquid may be withdrawn. The tubular housing is vented upstream of the feed hopper and a water inlet pipe is disposed adjacent to the second section of the screw shaft, downstream of the feed hopper. The outlet nozzle section is provided with pressure measuring and regulating means and a liquid level measuring and regulating device."

Compared to standard Latent Semantic Analysis which stems from linear algebra and performs a Singular Value Decomposition of co-occurrence tables, the proposed method is based on a mixture decomposition derived from a latent class model. This results in a more principled approach which has a solid foundation in statistics. In order to avoid overfitting, we propose a widely applicable generalization of maximum likelihood model fitting by tempered EM. Our approach yields substantial and consistent improvements over Latent Semantic Analysis in a number of experiments."
