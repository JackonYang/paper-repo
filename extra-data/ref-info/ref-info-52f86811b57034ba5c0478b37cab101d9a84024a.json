(2013) report agreement on thresholded subsets of the data."

In analogy to image search, we propose to frame sentence-based image annotation as the task of ranking a given pool of captions. We introduce a new benchmark collection for sentence-based image description and search, consisting of 8,000 images that are each paired with five different captions which provide clear descriptions of the salient entities and events. We introduce a number of systems that perform quite well on this task, even though they are only based on features that can be obtained with minimal supervision. Our results clearly indicate the importance of training on multiple captions per image, and of capturing syntactic (word order-based) and semantic features of these captions. We also perform an in-depth comparison of human and automatic evaluation metrics for this task, and propose strategies for collecting human judgments cheaply and on a very large scale, allowing us to augment our collection with additional relevance judgments of which captions describe which image. Our analysis shows that metrics that consider the ranked list of results for each query image or sentence are significantly more robust than metrics that are based on a single response per query. Moreover, our study suggests that the evaluation of ranking-based image description systems may be fully automated."

In turn, it can also help us in the quest to generate natural language that describes this world in a human manner. We present a simple yet effective approach to automatically compose image descriptions given computer vision based inputs and using web-scale n-grams. Unlike most previous work that summarizes or retrieves pre-existing text relevant to an image, our method composes sentences entirely from scratch. Experimental results indicate that it is viable to generate simple textual descriptions that are pertinent to the specific content of an image, while permitting creativity in the description -- making for more human-like annotations than previous approaches."

We present a system to automatically generate natural language descriptions from images that exploits both statistics gleaned from parsing large quantities of text data and recognition algorithms from computer vision. The system is very effective at producing relevant sentences for images. It also generates descriptions that are notably more true to the specific image content than previous work."

We test this hypothesis using a new data set of region-annotated images, associated with visual dependency representations and gold-standard descriptions. We describe two template-based description generation models that operate over visual dependency representations. In an image description task, we find that these models outperform approaches that rely on object proximity or corpus information to generate descriptions on both automatic measures and on human judgements."

More specifically, given a query image, we retrieve existing human-composed phrases used to describe visually similar images, then selectively combine those phrases to generate a novel description for the query image. We cast the generation process as constraint optimization problems, collectively incorporating multiple interconnected aspects of language composition for content planning, surface realization and discourse structure. Evaluation by human annotators indicates that our final system generates more semantically correct and linguistically appealing descriptions than two nontrivial baselines."

Results show that the generation system outperforms state-of-the-art systems, automatically generating some of the most natural image descriptions to date."

One contribution is our technique for the automatic collection of this new dataset \u2013 performing a huge number of Flickr queries and then filtering the noisy results down to 1 million images with associated visually relevant captions. Such a collection allows us to approach the extremely challenging problem of description generation using relatively simple non-parametric methods and produces surprisingly effective results. We also develop methods incorporating many state of the art, but fairly noisy, estimates of image content to produce even more pleasing results. Finally we introduce a new objective performance measure for image captioning."

The input are initial noisy estimates of the objects and scenes detected in the image using state of the art trained detectors. As predicting actions from still images directly is unreliable, we use a language model trained from the English Gigaword corpus to obtain their estimates; together with probabilities of co-located nouns, scenes and prepositions. We use these estimates as parameters on a HMM that models the sentence generation process, with hidden nodes as sentence components and image detections as the emissions. Experimental results show that our strategy of combining vision and language produces readable and descriptive sentences compared to naive strategies that use vision alone."

We review previous work on NLG evaluation and on validation of automatic metrics in NLP, and then present the results of two studies of how well some metrics which are popular in other areas of NLP (notably BLEU and ROUGE) correlate with human judgments in the domain of computer-generated weather forecasts. Our results suggest that, at least in this domain, metrics may provide a useful measure of language quality, although the evidence for this is not as strong as we would ideally like to see; however, they do not provide a useful measure of content quality. We also discuss a number of caveats which must be kept in mind when interpreting this and other validation studies."

Translation Error Rate (TER) measures the amount of editing that a human would have to perform to change a system output so it exactly matches a reference translation. We also compute a human-targeted TER (or HTER), where the minimum TER of the translation is computed against a human \u2018targeted reference\u2019 that preserves the meaning (provided by the reference translations) and is fluent, but is chosen to minimize the TER score for a particular system output. We show that: (1) The single-reference variant of TER correlates as well with human judgments of MT quality as the four-reference variant of BLEU; (2) The human-targeted HTER yields a 33% error-rate reduction and is shown to be very well correlated with human judgments; (3) The four-reference variant of TER and the single-reference variant of HTER yield higher correlations with human judgments than BLEU; (4) HTER yields higher correlations with human judgments than METEOR or its human-targeted variant (HMETEOR); and (5) The four-reference variant of TER correlates as well with a single human judgment as a second human judgment does, while HTER, HBLEU, and HMETEOR correlate significantly better with a human judgment than a second human judgment does."

Translation Edit Rate (TER) measures the amount of editing that a human would have to perform to change a system output so it exactly matches a reference translation. We show that the single-reference variant of TER correlates as well with human judgments of MT quality as the four-reference variant of BLEU. We also define a human-targeted TER (or HTER) and show that it yields higher correlations with human judgments than BLEU\u2014even when BLEU is given human-targeted references. Our results indicate that HTER correlates with human judgments better than HMETEOR and that the four-reference variants of TER and HTER correlate with human judgments as well as\u2014or better than\u2014a second human judgment does."

Tags of test images are predicted using a weighted nearest-neighbor model to exploit labeled training images. Neighbor weights are based on neighbor rank or distance. TagProp allows the integration of metric learning by directly maximizing the log-likelihood of the tag predictions in the training set. In this manner, we can optimally combine a collection of image similarity metrics that cover different aspects of image content, such as local shape descriptors, or global color histograms. We also introduce a word specific sigmoidal modulation of the weighted neighbor tag predictions to boost the recall of rare words. We investigate the performance of different variants of our model and compare to existing work. We present experimental results for three challenging data sets. On all three, TagProp makes a marked improvement as compared to the current state-of-the-art."

Longest common subsequence takes into account sentence level structure similarity naturally and identifies longest co-occurring in-sequence n-grams automatically. The second method relaxes strict n-gram matching to skip-bigram matching. Skip-bigram is any pair of words in their sentence order. Skip-bigram cooccurrence statistics measure the overlap of skip-bigrams between a candidate translation and a set of reference translations. The empirical results show that both methods correlate with human judgments very well in both adequacy and fluency."

Our system is able to represent highly variable object classes and achieves state-of-the-art results in the PASCAL object detection challenges. While deformable part models have become quite popular, their value had not been demonstrated on difficult benchmarks such as the PASCAL data sets. Our system relies on new methods for discriminative training with partially labeled data. We combine a margin-sensitive approach for data-mining hard negative examples with a formalism we call latent SVM. A latent SVM is a reformulation of MI--SVM in terms of latent variables. A latent SVM is semiconvex, and the training problem becomes convex once latent information is specified for the positive examples. This leads to an iterative training algorithm that alternates between fixing latent values for positive examples and optimizing the latent SVM objective function."

The procedure is based on a very low dimensional representation of the scene, that we term the Spatial Envelope. We propose a set of perceptual dimensions (naturalness, openness, roughness, expansion, ruggedness) that represent the dominant spatial structure of a scene. Then, we show that these dimensions may be reliably estimated using spectral and coarsely localized information. The model generates a multidimensional space in which scenes sharing membership in semantic categories (e.g., streets, highways, coasts) are projected closed together. The performance of the spatial envelope model shows that specific information about object shape or identity is not a requirement for scene categorization and that modeling a holistic representation of the scene informs about its probable semantic category."

However, the question of how to formally model contextual influences is still open. On the basis of a Bayesian framework, the authors present an original approach of attentional guidance by global scene context. The model comprises 2 parallel pathways; one pathway computes local features (saliency) and the other computes global (scene-centered) features. The contextual guidance model of attention combines bottom-up saliency, scene context, and top-down mechanisms at an early stage of visual processing and predicts the image regions likely to be fixated by human observers performing natural search tasks in real-world scenes."

To answer this question, he runs an experiment to evaluate the behavior of the two systems on held-out data. In this paper, we consider how to make such experiments more statistically reliable. We provide a systematic analysis of the effects of optimizer instability---an extraneous variable that is seldom controlled for---on experimental outcomes, and make recommendations for reporting results more accurately."
