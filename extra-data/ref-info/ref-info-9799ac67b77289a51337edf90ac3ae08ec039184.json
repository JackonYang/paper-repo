                "text": "A 2D Gabor filter can be realized as a sinusoidal plane wave of some frequency and orientation within a two dimensional Gaussian envelope. Its spatial extent, frequency and orientation preferences as well as bandwidths are easily controlled by the parameters used in generating the filters. However, there is an \u201cuncertainty relation\u201d associated with linear filters which limits the resolution simultaneously attainable in space and frequency. Daugman (1985) has determined that 2D Gabor filters are members of a class of functions achieving optimal joint resolution in the 2D space and 2D frequency domains. They have also been found to be a good model for two dimensional receptive fields of simple cells in the striate cortex (Jones 1985; Jones et al. 1985).The characteristic of optimal joint resolution in both space and frequency suggests that these filters are appropriate operators for tasks requiring simultaneous measurement in these domains. Texture discrimination is such a task. Computer application of a set of Gabor filters to a variety of textures found to be preattentively discriminable produces results in which differently textured regions are distinguished by firstorder differences in the values measured by the filters. This ability to reduce the statistical complexity distinguishing differently textured region as well as the sensitivity of these filters to certain types of local features suggest that Gabor functions can act as detectors of certain \u201ctexton\u201d types. The performance of the computer models suggests that cortical neurons with Gabor like receptive fields may be involved in preattentive texture discrimination."

Significant differences in the density, orientation, size, or contrast of line segments or other small features in an image have been shown to cause immediate perception of texture boundaries. However, the psychological theories, which are based on the perception of synthetic images composed of lines and symbols, neglect two important issues. First, how can textons be computed from grey-level images of natural scenes? And second, how, exactly, can texture boundaries be found? Our analysis of these two issues has led to an algorithm that is fully implemented and which successfully detects boundaries in natural images5. We propose that blobs computed by a centre-surround operator are useful as texture elements, and that a simple non-parametric statistic can be used to compare local distributions of blob attributes to locate texture boundaries. Although designed for natural images, our computation agrees with some psycho-physical findings, in particular, those of Adelson and Bergen (described in the preceding article6), which cast doubt on the hypothesis that line segment crossings or termination points are textons."

Theories have been developed to explain the discrimina-bility of such textures in terms of specific features within the micropatterns themselves. For example, Beck1,2 observed that a region filled with vertical Ts is readily distinguished from one filled with tilted Ts but not from one filled with vertical Ls. He attributed this to the different distribution of oriented line segments present in the former case but not in the latter. However, Bergen and Julesz3 found that a region of randomly oriented Xs segregated from one filled with randomly oriented Ls, in spite of the identical distribution of oriented line segments in the two cases. They suggested that this discrimination might be based on the density of such features as terminators, corners, and intersections within the patterns. We note here that simpler, lower-level mechanisms tuned for size may be sufficient to explain this discrimination. We tested this by varying the relative sizes of the Xs and the Ls; when they produce equal responses in size-tuned mechanisms they are hard to discriminate, and when they produce different size-tuned responses they are easy to discriminate."

Since second-order (dipole) statistics determine the autocorrelation functions and hence the power spectra, this observation also meant that in preattentive perception of texture the phase (position) spectra were ignored. In the last two decades many new classes of texture pairs with identical power spectra have been invented that were not effortlessly discriminable; however, recently (Caelli & Julesz 1978; Caelli et al. 1978; Julesz et al. 1978) several counterexamples were found. In these texture pairs with identical power spectra some local structures of 'quasi-collinearity', 'corner', 'closure' and 'granularity' yielded strong discrimination. These features can be regarded as the fundamental building blocks of form, that is, the essential nonlinearities of the preattentive perceptual system. Here, it will be shown that these counter-examples are not independent of each other, but can be described by two elementary units; bars (line segments) and their terminators. Furthermore, the preattentive texture perception system can count the number of terminators but ignores their positions."

The theory states that effortless visual texture discrimination may occur between two regions only if they differ in texton density, irrespective of the spatial relationships among textons. It is argued here that line-crossing and terminator textons have not been demonstrated to function independently of configurational differences between micropatterns. Four experiments tested whether line crossings and terminators actually elicit effortless discrimination independently of configurational differences. Subjects were required to detect a disparate textured region embedded in an unpredictable quandrant of a textural display. The textural displays were presented for brief durations, ranging from 67 to 167 msec, and followed by a random dot mask. In general, when configuration was controlled, micropatterns differing in terminators and line crossings elicited relatively poor discrimination. Ease of discrimination, as measured by the probability of a correct detection, was largely associated with differences in micropattern size (measured by the minimum enclosing circle). In addition, for certain texture pairs, ease of discrimination depended crucially upon which member of the pair formed the embedded region and which formed the background. This foregroundVbackground asymmetry was also related to size differences between micropatterns forming the textures. In many cases, performance improved at longer stimulus durations, although the rate of increase and absolute level of performance depended on the particular texture pair being tested. Qualitative differences in performance between naive subjects and a highly practiced subject were also observed."

The fundamental insight which makes compact coding possible is that the statistical complexity of images does not correspond to their resolution (number of resolvable states) if they contain nonrandom structure, coherence, or local auto-correlation. These are respects in which real images differ from random noise: they are optical projections of 3-D objects whose physical constitution and material unity ensure locally homogeneous image structure, whether such local correlations are as simple as luminance value, or a more subtle textural signature captured by some higher-order statistic. Except in the case of synthetic white noise, it is not true that each pixel in an image is statistically independent from its neighbors and from every other pixel; yet that is the default assumption in the standard image representations employed in video transmission channels or the data structures of storage devices. This statistical fact - that the entropy of the channel vastly exceeds the entropy of the signal - has long been recognized, but it has proven difficult to reduce channel bandwidth without loss of resolution. In practical terms, the consequence is that the video data rates (typically 8 bits for each one of several hundred thousand pixels in an image mosaic, resulting in information bandwidths in the tens of millions of bits per second) are far more costly informationally than they need to be, and moreover, no image structure more complex than a single pixel at a time is explicitly extracted or encoded."

In a scheme due to Gabor, an image is represented in terms of localized symmetrical and antisymmetrical elementary signals. Both measured receptive fields and measured spatial frequency tuning curves conform closely to the functional form of Gabor elementary signals. It is argued that the visual cortex representation corresponds closely to the Gabor scheme owing to its advantages in treating the subsequent problem of pattern recognition."

The accurate measurement of three dimensional position requires a camera calibration process as well as the determination of corresponding image points in two images. The accuracy of the three dimensional measurement depends upon the accuracy of the image matching solution. Since there are a variety of image matching techniques, the pattern recognition guidelines are reviewed which indicate that the optimum features are nonlinear, a posteriori probabilities of the measurements. These optimum features also maximize the trace of the between class scattermatrix normalized by the mixture scattermatrix. However, the theoretical guidelines do not indicate simple measurement methods for the optimum features. Therefore, some experimental examples are presented which illustrate some practical solutions to the problem."

This paper presents a model for the description of such local structure features based on the computation of local autocorrelations within the image. By means of this structure model a measure of structure dissimilarity is introduced. Experiments have been carried out to test a hypothesized relation between the detectability of a target pattern in a field of background patterns and the value of the structure dissimilarity measure. The experimental results show that it seems justified to relate, in a quantitative way, the detectability of the target pattern to the value of the structure dissimilarity measure."

If the stimuli are presented very briefly, eye movements are not possible. The time during which the after-image of the stimulus is available for inspection is terminated by presentation of a masking pattern. We show here that in these conditions a small pattern is easily detected against a background made up of many others, only if this target pattern differs from the background patterns in certain local features. In this case the detectability of the target is almost independent of the number of background elements, suggesting that a parallel process is operating. Detection of patterns not differing from their backgrounds in such features requires focal attention which is a serial process. The aperture of this attention is scaled to minimize the number of shifts of attention required."

This mechanism tends to enhance the apparent contrast of gratings at their boundaries, and Mach-band-type effects are demonstrated at the edge of a suprathreshold half-field grating. We studied the dependence of this effect on the grating parameters of spatial frequency and contrast. The grating spatial frequency must be above about 4 cycles per degree (cpd) for any effect to be seen. In the range 4\u201314 cpd, the type of effect seen depends on the contrast of the grating: At high contrasts, the effect is an enhancement of grating contrast near its border, whereas at near threshold contrasts, an opposite effect, edge contrast diminution, is seen. Finally, above about 14 cpd, enhancement is found down to threshold contrasts. The latter very-high-frequency effect may be due to a high-spatial-frequency limit of the visual channels available, with the smallest receptive-field summation area being in the order of 2.2\u2032. The near-threshold edge contrast diminution may derive from illumination lateral inhibition. In the intermediate range, however, the enhancement appears only at high contrast levels and therefore cannot be due to a linear mechanism. This enhancement seems to derive from lateral inhibition between neighboring spatial-frequency channels. A Craik-O\u2019Brien-Cornsweet type of visual illusion is demonstrated in the spatial-frequency grating contrast domain. The effect of lateral inhibition on the selectivity of spatial frequency channels is discussed. Lateral inhibition may cause a shift in the optimal spatial frequency of the channels by about 40% at high contrasts, making such gratings appear to have lower spatial frequencies. This shift may also be responsible for the phenomenon of contrast constancy."

The results agree with Julesz (1981a, b) who has reported evidence disproving his original conjecture of the importance of second-order statistics. Julesz (1981a, b) now hypothesizes textural segmentation to be a function of local features which he called textons. Textons are features that give textural segmentation when textures have identical second-order statistics. The two hypotheses are to date in complete agreement on the stimulus features producing textural segmentation, and the experiment reported is consistent with both."

Thus, elucidation of the spatiotemporal filtering characteristics of these mechanisms has become one of the major tasks of psychophysics. In general, of course, it is to be expected that complex interactions will occur between mechanisms responding to neighboring portions of the retinal image; and we know this to be true for the processing of movement and depth information. Fortunately, experimental paradigms have been developed which have enabled us to estimate mechanism characteristics at a lower level than that at which these interactions occur. This article will focus on two of these techniques and the resulting characterization of human spatiotemporal mechanisms."

As we increase the number (density) of these background lines, we find that detectability does not behave monotonically. Adding a small number of background lines decreases detectability but if adjacent line segments are permitted to fall in close range, a further increase of background lines improves performance which eventually reaches a constant level. This suggests that detection of feature differences involves a short-range process. The range of this process is about two degrees or twice the length of the line segments used. Thus texture-gradients between different elements are only formed if the distance between these elements is not much larger than the average element size."

Here a more complete version of the texton theory is presented, with emphasis on the critical distances within which the density of textons is determined by the preattentive system. Particularly some recent findings by Sagi and Julesz (1985a, b) influenced the current version of the texton theory. The stimuli are restricted to drawing composed of line segments that permit a precise definition of neighborhoods and distances to which the line segments and texture elements have to be confined in order to quality for preattentive texture discrimination. These critical distances and the aperture of focal attention are scaled by the average size of the texture elements. Furthermore, it is stressed that even when the stimuli are restricted to line segments, the blobs outlined by line segments behave like textons.
