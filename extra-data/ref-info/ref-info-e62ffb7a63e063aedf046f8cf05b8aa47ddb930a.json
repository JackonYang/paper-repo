                "text": "This paper addresses the problem of image segmentation and suggests that a number of interesting visual features can be specified as the boundaries of segments. It proposes a segmentation strategy that utilizes the local homogeneity of local image structure. Stable differential measurements are made via a variable-conductance diffusion process, sometimes called anisotropic diffusion. Anisotropic diffusion has been shown to preserve important image structure while reducing unwanted noise. \nA multi-scale approach to variable-conductance diffusion is described. This technique combines information at a range of scales and provides a means of obtaining precise boundaries of \"large-scale\" objects in the presence of noise. These ideas generalize to incorporate multi-valued images and higher-order geometric structure. The result is a framework for constructing image segmentations based on the homogeneity of a set of descriptors. When applied to local image geometry, this method offers a means of breaking images into geometric patches that have interesting visual features as boundaries. \nSeveral examples of this framework are presented. While the diffusion of intensity provides a means of detecting edges, the diffusion of first-order information produces ridges and valleys. A combination of first- and second-order information provides a means of detecting the \"middles\" as well as the edges of objects. A proof of the geometric invariance under orthogonal group transformations is given. These same methods generalize to include systems of frequency-sensitive diffusion processes. These systems are useful for characterizing patches based on texture. \nAn empirical investigation of these nonlinear diffusion processes shows they are stable in the presence of noise and offer distinct advantages over conventional linear smoothing. This analysis derives from a novel method for evaluating low-level computer-vision algorithms. The method uses ensembles of stochastically generated images to compute a set of statistical metrics which quantify the accuracy and reliability of a process. This evaluation offers a means of comparing different algorithms and exploring the space of free parameters associated with a single algorithm."

                "text": "This thesis, within the subfield of computer science known as computer vision, deals with the use of scale-space analysis in early low-level processing of visual information. The main contributions comprise the following five subjects: The formulation of a scale-space theory for discrete signals. Previously, the scale-space concept has been expressed for continuous signals only. We propose that the canonical way to construct a scale-space for discrete signals is by convolution with a kernel called the discrete analogue of the Gaussian kernel, or equivalently by solving a semi-discretized version of the diffusion equation. Both the one-dimensional and two-dimensional cases are covered. An extensive analysis of discrete smoothing kernels is carried out for one-dimensional signals and the discrete scale-space properties of the most common discretizations to the continuous theory are analysed. A representation, called the scale-space primal sketch, which gives a formal description of the hierarchical relations between structures at different levels of scale. It is aimed at making information in the scale-space representation explicit. We give a theory for its construction and an algorithm for computing it. A theory for extracting significant image structures and determining the scales of these structures from this representation in a solely bottom-up data-driven way. Examples demonstrating how such qualitative information extracted from the scale-space primal sketch can be used for guiding and simplifying other early visual processes. Applications are given to edge detection, histogram analysis and classification based on local features. Among other possible applications one can mention perceptual grouping, texture analysis, stereo matching, model matching and motion. A detailed theoretical analysis of the evolution properties of critical points and blobs in scale-space, comprising drift velocity estimates under scale-space smoothing, a classification of the possible types of generic events at bifurcation situations and estimates of how the number of local extrema in a signal can be expected to decrease as function of the scale parameter. For two-dimensional signals the generic bifurcation events are annihilations and creations of extremum-saddle point pairs. Interpreted in terms of blobs, these transitions correspond to annihilations, merges, splits and creations. Experiments on different types of real imagery demonstrate that the proposed theory gives perceptually intuitive results."

They can be applied for example in the output of the visual processes to reconstruct surfaces from sparse and noisy depth data, or to integrate early vision processes to label physical discontinuities. Drawbacks of MRFs models have been the computational complexity of the implementation and the difficulty in estimating the parameters of the model. This paper derives deterministic approximations to MRFs models. One of the considered models is shown to give in a natural way the graduate non convexity (GNC) algorithm. This model can be applied to smooth a field preserving its discontinuities. A new model is then proposed: it allows the gradient of the field to be enhanced at the discontinuities and smoothed elsewhere. All the theoretical results are obtained in the framework of the mean field theory, that is a well known statistical mechanics technique. A fast, parallel, and iterative algorithm to solve the deterministic equations of the two models is presented, together with experiments on synthetic and real images. The algorithm is applied to the problem of surface reconstruction is in the case of sparse data. A fast algorithm ismore\u00a0\u00bb also described that solves the problem of aligning the discontinuities of different visual models with intensity edges via integration.\u00ab\u00a0less"

In computer vision, a fundamental problem is to appropriately decompose the domain R of a function g (x,y) of two variables. This problem starts by describing the physical situation which produces images: assume that a three-dimensional world is observed by an eye or camera from some point P and that g1(rho) represents the intensity of the light in this world approaching the point sub 1 from a direction rho. If one has a lens at P focusing this light on a retina or a film-in both cases a plane domain R in which we may introduce coordinates x, y then let g(x,y) be the strength of the light signal striking R at a point with coordinates (x,y); g(x,y) is essentially the same as sub 1 (rho) -possibly after a simple transformation given by the geometry of the imaging syste. The function g(x,y) defined on the plane domain R will be called an image. What sort of function is g? The light reflected off the surfaces Si of various solid objects O sub i visible from P will strike the domain R in various open subsets R sub i. When one object O1 is partially in front of another object O2 as seen from P, but some of object O2 appears as the background to the sides of O1, then the open sets R1 and R2 will have a common boundary (the 'edge' of object O1 in the image defined on R) and one usually expects the image g(x,y) to be discontinuous along this boundary.

                "text": "Shape modeling is an important constituent of computer vision as well as computer graphics research. Shape models aid the tasks of object representation and recognition. This paper presents a new approach to shape modeling which retains some of the attractive features of existing methods and overcomes some of their limitations. The authors' techniques can be applied to model arbitrarily complex shapes, which include shapes with significant protrusions, and to situations where no a priori assumption about the object's topology is made. A single instance of the authors' model, when presented with an image having more than one object of interest, has the ability to split freely to represent each object. This method is based on the ideas developed by Osher and Sethian (1988) to model propagating solid/liquid interfaces with curvature-dependent speeds. The interface (front) is a closed, nonintersecting, hypersurface flowing along its gradient field with constant speed or a speed that depends on the curvature. It is moved by solving a \"Hamilton-Jacobi\" type equation written for a function in which the interface is a particular level set. A speed term synthesized from the image is used to stop the interface in the vicinity of object boundaries. The resulting equation of motion is solved by employing entropy-satisfying upwind finite difference schemes. The authors present a variety of ways of computing the evolving front, including narrow bands, reinitializations, and different stopping criteria. The efficacy of the scheme is demonstrated with numerical experiments on some synthesized images and some low contrast medical images. >"

The model overcomes some of the difficulties inherent in earlier global models, particularly their tendency to oversegment, and the lack of practical numerical algorithms for implementing them. The model consists of two coupled elliptic functionals, one for smoothing out the noise, and the other for boundary detection. The latter is obtained by regularizing the usual pointwise thresholding employed for boundary detection. The first variation of these functionals leads to coupled system of diffusion equations which are implemented by a simple finite difference scheme. The scheme may easily be converted into a parallel algorithm.<<ETX>>"

A hyperstack is a voxel-based multiscale data structure containing linkages between voxels at different scales. The scale-space is constructed by repeatedly applying a discrete convolution with a Gaussian kernel to the original input image. Between these levels of increasing scale we establish child-parent linkages according to a linkage scheme that is based on affection. In the resulting tree-like data structure roots are formed to indicate the most plausible locations in scale-space where objects (of different sizes) are actually defined by a single voxel. Tracing the linkages back from every root to the ground level produces a segmented image. The present paper deals with probabilistic linking, i.e., a set-up in which a child voxel can be linked to more than one parent voxel. The output of the thus constructed hyperstack -- a list of object probabilities per voxel -- can be directly related to the opacities used in volume renderers."

Some visual features can be characterized as boundaries between geometric patches. Geometric patches are defined as regions in an image where geometric descriptors vary slowly over the support of the region. The boundaries between these patches represent discontinuities in the higher-order geometry of the intensity surface. Reliable and accurate characterizations of local geometry can be difficult. This is because stable measurements of the differential structure of images are obtained only by averaging over a finite aperture. In this work, the scale of differential measurements is established by using an anisotropic diffusion process that generates piecewise constant approximations to geometric descriptions of images. The types of the geometric features as well as the definition of boundaries depend on the types of visual features that one wishes to measure."

(1) Certain structuring elements (convex) are scalable in that a sequence of repeated operations is equivalent to a single operation, but with a larger structuring element of the same shape. (2) To determine the outcome of the operation, it is sufficient to consider how the boundary is modified. (3) The modifications of the boundary are such that each point can be moved along the normal by a certain amount, which is dependent on the structuring element. Taken together, these observations, when the size of the structuring element shrinks to zero, assert that mathematical morphology operations with a convex structuring element are captured by a differential deformation of the boundary along the normal, governed by a Hamilton-Jacobi partial differential equation (PDE). A second theme is to show that mathematical morphology operations can be numerically implemented in a highly accurate fashion as the solution of these PDEs.<<ETX>>"

The simulations indicate how configural image properties trigger interactions among spatially organized contrastive, boundary segmentation, and filling-in processes to generate emergent percepts. They provide the first unified mechanistic explanation of this set of phenomena, a number of which have received no previous mechanistic explanation. Network interactions between a Boundary Contour (BC) System and a Feature Contour (FC) System comprise the model. The BC System consists of a hierarchy of contrast-sensitive and orientationally tuned interactions, leading to a boundary segmentation. On and off geniculate cells and simple and complex cortical cells are modeled. Output signals from the BC System segmentation generate compartmental boundaries within the FC System. Contrast-sensitive inputs to the FC System generate a lateral filling-in of activation within FC System compartments. The filling-in process is defined by a nonlinear diffusion mechanism. Simulated phenomena include network responses to stimulus distributions that involve combinations of luminance steps, gradients, cusps, and corners of various sizes. These images include impossible staircases, bull\u2019s-eyes, nested combinations of luminance profiles, and images viewed under nonuniform illumination conditions. Simulated phenomena include variants of brightness constancy, brightness contrast, brightness assimilation, the Craik-O\u2019Brien-Cornsweet effect, the Koffka-Benussi ring, the Kanizsa-Minguzzi anomalous brightness differentiation, the Hermann grid, and a Land Mondrian viewed under constant and gradient illumination that cannot be explained by retinex theory."

The image is described in terms of nested light and dark regions. This algorithm, successfully implemented in one, two, and three dimensions, can theoretically work with any number of dimensions. The interactive postprocessing developed technique selects regions from the descriptive tree for display in several ways: pointing to a branch of the image description tree, specifying by sliders the range of scale and/or intensity of all regions which should be displayed, and pointing (on the original image) to any pixel in the desired region.

The proposed Coupled-Membrane model applies the weak membrane approach to an image WI(\u03c3,\u03b8, x, y), derived from the power responses of a family of selfsimilar quadrature Gabor wavelets. While segmentation breaks are allowed in x and y only, coupling is introduced to in all 4 dimensions. The resulting spatial and spectral diffusion prevents minor variations in local textures from producing segmentation boundaries. Experiments showed that the model is adequate in segmenting a class of synthetic and natural texture images."

                "text": "Image segmentation is a process which identifies and labels objects in an image. The goals of this dissertation are to produce an algorithm for segmenting an image in the way that a front-end vision system does, using the local geometry induced by the intensity values of the image, to create multiscale representations of the objects that allow exploration of the details of the image via an interactive computer system, and to provide a formal geometric foundation for multiscale image analysis. The geometric concept of ridges is discussed. These structures are used to describe the shape properties of objects in an image. Various definitions are given for d-dimensional ridge structures of n-dimensional images. Ridges are used in conjunction with multiscale methods to segment an image. The output of the segmentation is a single tree and the objects in the image are represented as unions and differences of subtrees. The tree and image are used as input to a visualization tool which allows the user to explore the image interactively. A formal foundation for multiscale analysis is given which involves non-Euclidean geometry. Metric selection for scale space is naturally related to invariances required for a particular application. The anisotropic diffusion process for generating multiscale data is automatically determined by the metric. Moreover, the metric is used as an aid in developing fast, stable, and adaptive numerical algorithms for solving the nonlinear diffusion equations. This geometric foundation for multiscale analysis provides a natural set of tools for extracting information about objects in an image."

The method employs a technique of edge-affected diffusion, where blurring is limited by the presence of edges as measured at the scale of interest. By repeating such processing and measuring gradients at successively smaller scales one is able to trace a \"path\" through scale space which can preserve accurate information about boundaries of objects, and yet selectively remove objects that fall below a scale of interest. We compared this approach with the anisotropic diffusion technique described by Perona and Malik, which depends only on the local gradient of intensity of the processed image. We show some examples which indicate that this method could be useful for boundary detection in the presence of blurring and noise and which is also capable of performing grouping of distinct objects at various scales. This paper also examines the sensitivity of this process with respect to one\u2032s choice of parameters."

This theory describes adaptive processes which overcome limitations of the visual uptake process to synthesize informative visual representations of the external world. The brightness data include versions of the Craik-O\u2019Brien-Cornsweet effect and its exceptions, Bergstrom\u2019s demonstrations comparing the brightnesses of smoothly modulated and step-like luminance profiles, Hamada\u2019s demonstrations of nonclassical differences between the perception of luminance decrements and increments, Fechner\u2019s paradox, binocular brightness averaging, binocular brightness summation, binocular rivalry, and fading of stabilized images and ganzfelds. Familiar concepts such as spatial frequency analysis, Mach bands, and edge contrast are relevant but insufficient to explain the totality of these data. Two parallel contour-sensitive processes interact to generate the theory\u2019s brightness, color, and form explanations. A boundary-contour process is sensitive to the orientation and amount of contrast but not to the direction of contrast in scenic edges. It generates contours that form the boundaries of monocular perceptual domains. The spatial patterning of these contours is sensitive to the global configuration of scenic elements. A feature-contour process is insensitive to the orientation of contrast, but is sensitive to both the amount of contrast and to the direction of contrast in scenic edges. It triggers a diffusive filling-in reaction of featural quality within perceptual domains whose boundaries are dynamically defined by boundary contours. The boundary-contour system is hypothesized to include the hypercolumns in visual striate cortex. The feature-contour system is hypothesized to include the blobs in visual striate cortex. These preprocessed monocular activity patterns enter consciousness in the theory via a process of resonant binocular matching that is capable of selectively lifting whole monocular patterns into a binocular representation of form-and-color-in-depth. This binocular process is hypothesized to occur in area V4 of the visual pre striate cortex."

The fact that any image is a physical observable with an inner and outer scale bound, necessarily gives rise to a \u2018scale-space representation\u2019, in which a given image is represented by a one-dimensional family of images representing that image on various levels of inner spatial scale. An early vision system is completely ignorant of the geometry of its input. Its primary task is to establish this geometry at any available scale. The absence of geometrical knowledge poses additional constraints on the construction of a scale-space, notably linearity, spatial shift invariance and isotropy, thereby defining a complete hierarchical family of scaled partial differential operators: the Gaussian kernel (the lowest order, rescaling operator) and its linear partial derivatives. They enable local image analysis in a robust way, while at the same time capturing global features through the extra scale degree of freedom. The operations of scaling and differentiation cannot be separated. This framework permits us to construct in a systematic way multiscale, orthogonal differential invariants, i.e. true image descriptors that exhibit manifest invariance with respect to a change of cartesian coordinates. The scale-space operators closely resemble the receptive field profiles in the mammalian front-end visual system."

We show that ``edge focusing'', i.e., a coarse-to-fine tracking in a continuous manner, combines high positional accuracy with good noise-reduction. This is of vital interest in several applications. Junctions of different kinds are in this way restored with high precision, which is a basic requirement when performing (projective) geometric analysis of an image for the purpose of restoring the three-dimensional scene. Segmentation of a scene using geometric clues like parallelism, etc., is also facilitated by the algorithm, since unnecessary detail has been filtered away. There are indications that an extension of the focusing algorithm can classify edges, to some extent, into the categories diffuse and nondiffuse (for example diffuse illumination edges). The edge focusing algorithm contains two parameters, namely the coarseness of the resolution in the blurred image from where we start the focusing procedure, and a threshold on the gradient magnitude at this coarse level. The latter parameter seems less critical for the behavior of the algorithm and is not present in the focusing part, i.e., at finer resolutions. The step length of the scale parameter in the focusing scheme has been chosen so that edge elements do not move more than one pixel per focusing step."

The speed may be an arbitrary function of curvature, and the front can also be passively advected by an underlying flow. These algorithms approximate the equations of motion, which resemble Hamilton-Jacobi equations with parabolic right-hand-sides, by using techniques from the hyperbolic conservation laws. Non-oscillatory schemes of various orders of accuracy are used to solve the equations, providing methods that accurately capture the formation of sharp gradients and cusps in the moving fronts. The algorithms handle topological merging and breaking naturally, work in any number of space dimensions, and do not require that the moving surface be written as a function. The methods can be also used for more general Hamilton-Jacobitype problems. We demonstrate our algorithms by computing the solution to a variety of surface motion problems."

A number of necessary criteria are imposed on any candidate solution method. Path-based Gaussian smoothing techniques are applied to the curve to find zeros of curvature at varying levels of detail. The result is the ``generalized scale space'' image of a planar curve which is invariant under rotation, uniform scaling and translation of the curve. These properties make the scale space image suitable for matching. The matching algorithm is a modification of the uniform cost algorithm and finds the lowest cost match of contours in the scale space images. It is argued that this is preferable to matching in a so-called stable scale of the curve because no such scale may exist for a given curve. This technique is applied to register a Landsat satellite image of the Strait of Georgia, B.C. (manually corrected for skew) to a map containing the shorelines of an overlapping area."

It is not necessary to explicitly identify texels or make restrictive assumptions about the nature of the image texture like isotropy. We have developed two different algorithms for recovering surface orientation and shape based on the estimated affine transforms in a number of different directions. The first is a sample linear algorithm based on singular value decomposition. The second is based on nonlinear minimization of a least squares error criterion.

We propose a framework that unifies competing approaches to shape. The basis for our approach is an analysis of deformations of shape designed to induce a topology over shapes suitable to support object recognition. We show that deformations classify into constant motion and curvature motion, which intriguingly lead to conservation laws for shape. These conservation laws are nonlinear and lead to singularities. A notion of entropy for shape is developed which limits the singularities of shape to shocks. The formation of shocks and their classification under arbitrary deformations is the basis of our representation for shape. The space of deformations leads to a reaction-diffusion space for shape in which the formation of shocks is studied. This leads us to propose parts, protrusions, and bends as the computational elements fo shape. A notion of scale on these elements then naturally emerges, which is captured by the entropy scale-space. Any particular shape is finally described as the interaction between processes for computing parts, protrusions, and bends, the perceptual reality of which is illustrated via qualitative experiments."

Through regularization, they may be reformulated as well-posed variational principles whose solutions are computable. Standard regularization theory employs quadratic stabilizing functionals that impose global smoothness constraints on possible solutions. Discontinuities present serious difficulties to standard regularization, however, since their reconstruction requires a precise spatial control over the smoothing properties of stabilizers. This paper proposes a general class of controlled-continuity stabilizers which provide the necessary control over smoothness. These nonquadratic stabilizing functionals comprise multiple generalized spline kernels combined with (noncontinuous) continuity control functions. In the context of computational vision, they may be thought of as controlled-continuity constraints. These generic constraints are applicable to visual reconstruction problems that involve both continuous regions and discontinuities, for which global smoothness constraints fail."

The success of the approach depends on the definition of a comprehensive set of goals for the computation of edge points. These goals must be precise enough to delimit the desired behavior of the detector while making minimal assumptions about the form of the solution. We define detection and localization criteria for a class of edges, and present mathematical forms for these criteria as functionals on the operator impulse response. A third criterion is then added to ensure that the detector has only one response to a single edge. We use the criteria in numerical optimization to derive detectors for several common image features, including step edges. On specializing the analysis to step edges, we find that there is a natural uncertainty principle between detection and localization performance, which are the two main goals. With this principle we derive a single operator shape which is optimal at any scale. The optimal detector has a simple approximate implementation in which edges are marked at maxima in gradient magnitude of a Gaussian-smoothed image. We extend this simple detector using operators of several widths to cope with different signal-to-noise ratios in the image. We present a general method, called feature synthesis, for the fine-to-coarse integration of information from operators at different scales. Finally we show that step edge detector performance improves considerably as the operator point spread function is extended along the edge."

The principal benefit of this representation is that it greatly simplifies the problem of finding the correspondence between components in the description of two pictures. This representation technique is based on a new class of reversible transforms (the Difference of Low Pass or DOLP transform). A fast algorithm for computing the DOLP transform is then presented. This algorithm, called cascade convolution with expansion is based on the auto-convolution scaling property of Gaussian functions. Techniques are then described for constructing a structural description of an image from its Sampled DOLP transform. The symbols in this description are detected by detecting local peaks and ridges in each band-pass image, and among all of the band-pass image. This description has the form of a tree of peaks, with the peaks interconnected by chains of symbols from the ridges. The tree of peaks has a structure which can be matched despite changes in size, orientation, or position of the gray scale shape that is described."

It is also possible to build a self-similar steerable pyramid representation which may be considered to be a steerable wavelet transform.

A critical, intermediate goal of edge detection is the detection and characterization of significant intensity changes. This paper discusses this part of the edge detection problem. To characterize the types of intensity changes derivatives of different types, and possibly different scales, are needed. Thus, we consider this part of edge detection as a problem in numerical differentiation. We show that numerical differentiation of images is an ill-posed problem in the sense of Hadamard. Differentiation needs to be regularized by a regularizing filtering operation before differentiation. This shows that this part of edge detection consists of two steps, a filtering step and a differentiation step. Following this perspective, the paper discusses in detail the following theoretical aspects of edge detection. 1) The properties of different types of filters-with minimal uncertainty, with a bandpass spectrum, and with limited support-are derived. Minimal uncertainty filters optimize a tradeoff between computational efficiency and regularizing properties. 2) Relationships among several 2-D differential operators are established. In particular, we characterize the relation between the Laplacian and the second directional derivative along the gradient. Zero crossings of the Laplacian are not the only features computed in early vision. 3) Geometrical and topological properties of the zero crossings of differential operators are studied in terms of transversality and Morse theory."

A genuinely discrete scale-space theory is developed and its connection to the continuous scale-space theory is explained. Special attention is given to discretization effects, which occur when results from the continuous scale-space theory are to be implemented computationally. The 1D problem is solved completely in an axiomatic manner. For the 2D problem, the author discusses how the 2D discrete scale space should be constructed. The main results are as follows: the proper way to apply the scale-space theory to discrete signals and discrete images is by discretization of the diffusion equation, not the convolution integral; the discrete scale space obtained in this way can be described by convolution with the kernel, which is the discrete analog of the Gaussian kernel, a scale-space implementation based on the sampled Gaussian kernel might lead to undesirable effects and computational problems, especially at fine levels of scale; the 1D discrete smoothing transformations can be characterized exactly and a complete catalogue is given; all finite support 1D discrete smoothing transformations arise from repeated averaging over two adjacent elements (the limit case of such an averaging process is described); and the symmetric 1D discrete smoothing kernels are nonnegative and unimodal, in both the spatial and the frequency domain. >"

                "text": "Spivak's Comprehensive introduction takes as its theme the classical roots of contemporary differential geometry. Spivak explains his Main Premise (my term) as follows: \"in order for an introduction to differential geometry to expose the geometric aspect of the subject, an historical approach is necessary; there is no point in introducing the curvature tensor without explaining how it was invented and what it has to do with curvature\". His second premise concerns the manner in which the historical material should be presented: \"it is absurdly inefficient to eschew the modern language of manifolds, bundles, forms, etc., which was developed precisely in order to rigorize the concepts of classical differential geometry\". Here, Spivak is addressing \"a dilemma which confronts anyone intent on penetrating the mysteries of differential geometry\". On the one hand, the subject is an old one, dating, as we know it, from the works of Gauss and Riemann, and possessing a rich classical literature. On the other hand, the rigorous and systematic formulations in current use were established relatively recently, after topological techniques had been sufficiently well developed to provide a base for an abstract global theory; the coordinate-free geometric methods of E. Cartan were also a major source. Furthermore, the viewpoint of global structure theory now dominates the subject, whereas differential geometers were traditionally more concerned with the local study of geometric objects. Thus it is possible and not uncommon for a modern geometric education to leave the subject's classical origins obscure. Such an approach can offer the great advantages of elegance, efficiency, and direct access to the most active areas of modern research. At the same time, it may strike the student as being frustratingly incomplete. As Spivak remarks, \"ignorance of the roots of the subject has its price-no one denies that modern formulations are clear, elegant and precise; it's just that it's impossible to comprehend how any one ever thought of them.\" While Spivak's impulse to mediate between the past and the present is a natural one and is by no means unique, his undertaking is remarkable for its ambitious scope. Acting on its second premise, the Comprehensive introduction opens with an introduction to differentiable manifolds; the remaining four volumes are devoted to a geometric odyssey which starts with Gauss and Riemann, and ends with the Gauss-Bonnet-Chern Theorem and characteristic classes. A formidable assortment of topics is included along the way, in which we may distinguish several major historical themes: In the first place, the origins of fundamental geometric concepts are investigated carefully. As just one example, Riemannian sectional curvature is introduced by a translation and close exposition of the text of Riemann's remarkable paper, \u00dcber die Hypothesen, welche der Geometrie zu Grunde"

The change in total variation of the propagating front is shown to depend only ondF/dK only whereK changes sign. Analysis of the caseF(K)=1\u2212\u03b5K, where \u03b5 is a constant, shows that curvature plays a role similar to that of viscosity in Burgers equation. For \u03b5=0 and non-convex initial data, the curvature blows up, corners develop, and an entropy condition can be formulated to provide an explicit construction for a weak solution beyond the singularity. We then numerically show that the solution as \u03b5 goes to zero converges to the constructed weak solution. Numerical methods based on finite difference schemes for marker particles along the front are shown to be unstable in regions where the curvature builds. As a remedy, we show that front tracking based on volume of fluid techniques can be used together with the entropy condition to provide transition from the classical to weak solution."

In most situations, the mere gray value variations do not provide sufficient information in order to estimate such a displacement vector field. Supplementary constraints are necessary, for example the postulate that a displacement vector field varies smoothly as a function of the image position. Taken as a general requirement, this creates difficulties at gray value transitions which correspond to occluding contours. Nagel therefore introduced the ``oriented smoothness'' requirement which restricts variations of the displacement vector field only in directions with small or no variation of gray values. This contribution reports results of an investigation about how such an ``oriented smoothness'' constraint may be formulated and evaluated."

The properties of the operator which approximates a signal at a given resolution were studied. It is shown that the difference of information between the approximation of a signal at the resolutions 2/sup j+1/ and 2/sup j/ (where j is an integer) can be extracted by decomposing this signal on a wavelet orthonormal basis of L/sup 2/(R/sup n/), the vector space of measurable, square-integrable n-dimensional functions. In L/sup 2/(R), a wavelet orthonormal basis is a family of functions which is built by dilating and translating a unique function psi (x). This decomposition defines an orthogonal multiresolution representation called a wavelet representation. It is computed with a pyramidal algorithm based on convolutions with quadrature mirror filters. Wavelet representation lies between the spatial and Fourier domains. For images, the wavelet representation differentiates several spatial orientations. The application of this representation to data compression in image coding, texture discrimination and fractal analysis is discussed. >"

The general case of a distribution of light sources illuminating a Lambertian surface is considered. This involves original definitions of three types of edges, mainly the apparent contours, the grazing light edges and the shadow edges. The elevation of the shape is expressed in terms of viscosity solution of a first-order Hamilton-Jacobi equation with various boundary conditions on these edges. Various existence and uniqueness results are presented."

The geometric information content of the gradient of binocular disparity is analyzed for the general case of a fixating system with symmetric or asymmetric vergence, and with either known or unknown viewing geometry. A computationally inexpensive technique which exploits this analysis is proposed. This technique allows a local estimate of surface orientation to be computed directly from the local statistics of the left and right image brightness gradients, without iterations or search. The viability of the approach is demonstrated with experimental results for both synthetic and natural gray-level images."

These are determined in a natural way by convolution with Gaussian derivative operators. These \"fuzzy derivatives\" are calculated at any scale, and remove the problem of the ill-posed nature of numerical differentiation. However, noise is enhanced by the high-pass nature of differentiation, particularly at high order. On the other hand, the Gaussian-weighted averaging gives rise to noise reduction. This paper gives an analysis of the propagation of spatially uncorrelated as well as spatially correlated additive noise in scale space, when the noise is subjected to fuzzy derivative operators of any order. The propagation of noise variance is always substantially reduced when scale is increased, the effect being greater for higher order derivatives. The spatial blurring is always predominant, or, the representation of the noise and its derivatives is substantial only at the original (inner) scale. Expressions are derived for the propagation of noise in functions of derivatives, like the Laplacian and isophote curvature. All expressions are evaluated for a D-dimensional (image) data structure. Determining derivatives, even up to high order, combined with scale space, is a very robust and stable operation. The important conclusion is that the use of differential geometrical methods in scale space, particularly in noisy images, is justified."

The apparent changes in texture element properties can be analyzed to recover information about the physical layout of the scene. In practice it is difficult to identify texture elements, especially in images where the texture elements are partially occluded or are themselves textured at a finer scale. To solve this problem, it is necessary to integrate the extraction of texture elements with the recognition of scene layout. This paper presents a method for recovering the orientation of textured surfaces while simultaneously identifying texture elements. Candidate texture elements are constructed from overlapping circular regions of relatively uniform gray level. The uniform circular regions are found by convolving the image with Del sq G (Laplacian-of-Gaussian) masks over a range of scales, and comparing the convolution output to that expected for a circular disk of constant gray level. True texture elements are selected from the set of candidate texture elements by finding the planar surface that best predicts the properties of the candidate texture elements. A planar fit is evaluated by comparing the predicted texture-element areas to the actual areas of the candidate texture elements. The planar fit receiving support from the most regions is chosen as the correct interpretation."

If these ordinates are the values of a known analytic function F(x), then the problem of interpolation between these ordinates has an obvious and precise meaning: we are required to compute intermediate values F(x) to the same accuracy to which the ordinates are known. Undoubtedly, the most convenient tool for the solution of this problem is the polynomial central interpolation method. It uses the polynomial of degree k \u2014 1, interpolating k successive ordinates, as an approximation to F(x) only within a unit interval in x, centrally located with respect to its k defining ordinates. Assuming k fixed, successive approximating arcs for F(x) are thus obtained which present discontinuities on passing from one arc to the next if k is odd, or discontinuities in their first derivatives if k is even (see section 2.121). Actually these discontinuities are irrelevant in our present case of an analytic function F(x). Indeed, if the interpolated values obtained are sufficiently accurate, these discontinuities will be apparent only if we force the computation beyond the intrinsic accuracy of the y n."

It would be astonishing if such a structure did not profoundly modify the response patterns of fibres coming into it. In the cat's visual cortex, the receptive field arrangements of single cells suggest that there is indeed a degree of complexity far exceeding anything yet seen at lower levels in the visual system. In a previous paper we described receptive fields of single cortical cells, observing responses to spots of light shone on one or both retinas (Hubel & Wiesel, 1959). In the present work this method is used to examine receptive fields of a more complex type (Part I) and to make additional observations on binocular interaction (Part II). This approach is necessary in order to understand the behaviour of individual cells, but it fails to deal with the problem of the relationship of one cell to its neighbours. In the past, the technique of recording evoked slow waves has been used with great success in studies of functional anatomy. It was employed by Talbot & Marshall (1941) and by Thompson, Woolsey & Talbot (1950) for mapping out the visual cortex in the rabbit, cat, and monkey. Daniel & Whitteiidge (1959) have recently extended this work in the primate. Most of our present knowledge of retinotopic projections, binocular overlap, and the second visual area is based on these investigations. Yet the method of evoked potentials is valuable mainly for detecting behaviour common to large populations of neighbouring cells; it cannot differentiate functionally between areas of cortex smaller than about 1 mm2. To overcome this difficulty a method has in recent years been developed for studying cells separately or in small groups during long micro-electrode penetrations through nervous tissue. Responses are correlated with cell location by reconstructing the electrode tracks from histological material. These techniques have been applied to"

A class of equations is described for which the initial value problem is well-posed for rough initial data, for which one can give a description of the way a smooth solution becomes singular, and for which one can define generalized solutions, i.e., solutions which are smooth, except at a discrete set of times. The methods which are used in this paper are more geometrical than those of Part I. By comparing arbitrary solutions with certain special solutions, and by considering the way they intersect, we derive estimates for the curvature and the tangent, which allow one to study the initial value problem, and the way solutions become singular."

The representation differs from established techniques in that the code elements are localized in spatial frequency as well as in space. Pixel-to-pixel correlations are first removed by subtracting a lowpass filtered copy of the image from the image itself. The result is a net data compression since the difference, or error, image has low variance and entropy, and the low-pass filtered image may represented at reduced sample density. Further data compression is achieved by quantizing the difference image. These steps are then repeated to compress the low-pass image. Iteration of the process at appropriately expanded scales generates a pyramid data structure. The encoding process is equivalent to sampling the image with Laplacian operators of many scales. Thus, the code tends to enhance salient image features. A further advantage of the present code is that it is well suited for many image analysis tasks as well as for image compression. Fast algorithms are described for coding and decoding."

Various families of operators with special kinds of symmetries (such as translation, rotation, magnification) are explicitly constructed in 1-D, 2-D, and 3-D. A concept of 'order' is defined, and finite orthonormal bases of functions closely connected with the operators of various orders are constructed. Linear transformations between the various representations are considered. The method is based on two fundamental assumptions: a decrease of resolution should not introduce spurious detail, and the local operators should be self-similar under changes of resolution. These assumptions merely sum up the even more general need for homogeneity isotropy, scale invariance, and separability of independent dimensions of front-end processing in the absence of a priori information. >"

Using basic concepts from algebra, he examines the various properties of the groups. Analysis and topology are used wherever appropriate. The book also covers topics such as matrix algebras, semigroups, commutators, and spinors, which are of great importance in understanding the group-theoretic structure of quantum mechanics. Hermann Weyl was among the greatest mathematicians of the twentieth century. He made fundamental contributions to most branches of mathematics, but he is best remembered as one of the major developers of group theory, a powerful formal method for analyzing abstract and physical systems in which symmetry is present. In The Classical Groups, his most important book, Weyl provided a detailed introduction to the development of group theory, and he did it in a way that motivated and entertained his readers. Departing from most theoretical mathematics books of the time, he introduced historical events and people as well as theorems and proofs. One learned not only about the theory of invariants but also when and where they were originated, and by whom. He once said of his writing, \"My work always tried to unite the truth with the beautiful, but when I had to choose one or the other, I usually chose the beautiful.\" Weyl believed in the overall unity of mathematics and that it should be integrated into other fields. He had serious interest in modern physics, especially quantum mechanics, a field to which The Classical Groups has proved important, as it has to quantum chemistry and other fields. Among the five books Weyl published with Princeton, Algebraic Theory of Numbers inaugurated the Annals of Mathematics Studies book series, a crucial and enduring foundation of Princeton's mathematics list and the most distinguished book series in mathematics."

This representation is constructed by detecting peaks and ridges in the difference of lowpass (DOLP) transform. Descriptions of shapes which are encoded in this representation may be matched efficiently despite changes in size, orientation, or position. Motivations for a multiple resolution representation are presented first, followed by the definition of the DOLP transform. Techniques are then presented for encoding a symbolic structural description of forms from the DOLP transform. This process involves detecting local peaks and ridges in each bandpass image and in the entire three-dimensional space defined by the DOLP transform. Linking adjacent peaks in different bandpass images gives a multiple resolution tree which describes shape. Peaks which are local maxima in this tree provide landmarks for aligning, manipulating, and matching shapes. Detecting and linking the ridges in each DOLP bandpass image provides a graph which links peaks within a shape in a bandpass image and describes the positions of the boundaries of the shape at multiple resolutions. Detecting and linking the ridges in the DOLP three-space describes elongated forms and links the largest peaks in the tree. The principles for determining the correspondence between symbols in pairs of such descriptions are then described. Such correspondence matching is shown to be simplified by using the correspondence at lower resolutions to constrain the possible correspondence at higher resolutions."

Extensions of this technique support 3-D and multiecho magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), incorporating higher spatial and spectral dimensions. The procedure overcomes the major drawbacks of conventional filter methods, namely the blurring of object boundaries and the suppression of fine structural details. The simplicity of the filter algorithm permits an efficient implementation, even on small workstations. The efficient noise reduction and sharpening of object boundaries are demonstrated by applying this image processing technique to 2-D and 3-D spin echo and gradient echo MR data. The potential advantages for MRI, diagnosis, and computerized analysis are discussed in detail."

It presents those parts of the theory which are especially useful in calculations and stresses the representation of splines as linear combinations of B-splines. After two chapters summarizing polynomial approximation, a rigorous discussion of elementary spline theory is given involving linear, cubic and parabolic splines. The computational handling of piecewise polynomial functions (of one variable) of arbitrary order is the subject of chapters VII and VIII, while chapters IX, X, and XI are devoted to B-splines. The distances from splines with fixed and with variable knots is discussed in chapter XII. The remaining five chapters concern specific approximation methods, interpolation, smoothing and least-squares approximation, the solution of an ordinary differential equation by collocation, curve fitting, and surface fitting. The present text version differs from the original in several respects. The book is now typeset (in plain TeX), the Fortran programs now make use of Fortran 77 features. The figures have been redrawn with the aid of Matlab, various errors have been corrected, and many more formal statements have been provided with proofs. Further, all formal statements and equations have been numbered by the same numbering system, to make it easier to find any particular item. A major change has occured in Chapters IX-XI where the B-spline theory is now developed directly from the recurrence relations without recourse to divided differences. This has brought in knot insertion as a powerful tool for providing simple proofs concerning the shape-preserving properties of the B-spline series."

One of its key characteristics is that the scale used to measure object properties (and hence to represent the object) is proportional to the local size of the object. This allows it to separate fine-scale detail from larger-scale gross shape properties of the object in a manner dictated by the object itself. It works directly from image intensities and does not require a prior segmentation of the image or explicit determination of object boundaries. Fuzzy (non-binary) boundary measures are used to compute fuzzy medial measures, and axis points are identified as ridges in this fuzzy medial space. This paper presents some of the basic concepts of the Multiscale Medial Axis, describes its computation, and demonstrates some preliminary results of its application to medical images from a variety of imaging modalities."

The MFA mathematics are applied to three different objective function examples. In each case, MFA produces a minimization algorithm that is a type of graduated nonconvexity. When applied to the ;weak-membrane' objective, MFA results in an algorithm qualitatively identical to the published GNC algorithm. One of the examples, MFA applied to a piecewise-constant objective function, is then compared experimentally with the corresponding GNC weak-membrane algorithm. The mathematics of MFA are shown to provide a powerful and general tool for deriving optimization algorithms."

A second constraint is needed. A method for finding the optical flow pattern is presented which assumes that the apparent velocity of the brightness pattern varies smoothly almost everywhere in the image. An iterative implementation is shown which successfully computes the optical flow for a number of synthetic image sequences. The algorithm is robust in that it can handle image sequences that are quantized rather coarsely in space and time. It is also insensitive to quantization of brightness levels and additive noise. Examples are included where the assumption of smoothness is violated at singular points or along lines in the image."

In psychophysiology, multichannel models have been particularly successful in explaining some low-level processing in the visual cortex. The expansion of a function into several frequency channels provides a representation which is intermediate between a spatial and a Fourier representation. The author describes the mathematical properties of such decompositions and introduces the wavelet transform. He reviews the classical multiresolution pyramidal transforms developed in computer vision and shows how they relate to the decomposition of an image into a wavelet orthonormal basis. He discusses the properties of the zero crossings of multifrequency channels. Zero-crossing representations are particularly well adapted for pattern recognition in computer vision. >"

The proof assumes that the filtered signal can be represented as a polynomial of finite, albeit possibly high, order. The result applies to zero and level crossings of linear differential operators of Gaussian filters. In this case the signal is determined uniquely, modulus the null space of the linear operator. The theorem can be extended to two-dimensional functions. These results are reminiscent of Logan\u2019s theorem [ Bell Syst. Tech. J.56, 487 ( 1977)]. They imply that extrema of derivatives at different scales are a complete representation of a signal. They are especially relevant for computational vision in the case of the Laplacian operator acting on image intensities, and they suggest rigorous foundations for the primal sketch."

Core descriptions extracted from the same object using different imaging modalities display remarkable similarities despite noise and variations imposed by the imaging devices. Core based registration methods have been successfully employed in examples of 3D registration that would have caused boundary or contour based methods to fail. In this paper, we present an overview of the core, and describe its properties that make it a promising approach toward registration. Our current core-based method of registration is also presented. Results of the registration of 3D volumes from both a single imaging modality and from two different modalities are given."

This allows smoothing without shrinkage at the same time preserving all the scale-space properties. The representations are obtained deforming the curve via geometric heat flows while simultaneously magnifying the plane by a homethety which keeps the enclosed area constant. When the Euclidean geometric heat flow is used, the resulting representation is Euclidean invariant, and similarly it is affine invariant when the affine one is used. The flows are geometrically intrinsic to the curve, and exactly satisfy all the basic requirements of scale-space representations. In the case of the Euclidean heat flow, it is completely local as well. The same approach is used to define length preserving geometric flows. A similarity (scale) invariant geometric heat flow is studied as well in this work. >"

It is shown that the second derivative of the contrast function at the critical point is related to the classification of the associated edge as being phantom or authentic. The contrast of authentic edges decreases with filter scale, while the contrast of phantom edges are shown to increase with scale. As the filter scale increases, an authentic edge must either turn into a phantom edge or join with a phantom edge and vanish. The points in the scale space at which these events occur are seen to be singular points of the contrast function. Using ideas from singularity, or catastrophy theory, the scale map contours near these singular points are found to be either vertical or parabolic. >"

The central problem in structural pattern matching is to determine the correspondence between the symbols which comprise a model and symbols which describe a pattern. The difficulty of determining this correspondence depends critically on the representation that is used to describe patterns. This correspondence presents a probabilistic representation for structural models of pattern classes. Both pattern descriptions and models for pattern classes are based on symbols which represent grayscale information at multiple resolutions. A pattern description is given by a tree of symbols with attribute values. Structural models are represented by a tree of symbols with probabilistic attributes. The position and scale (resolution) of the symbols, as well as other ``features,'' are represented by these attributes. An algorithm is presented for determining the correspondence between symbols in a description of a pattern and symbols in a model of a pattern class. This algorithm uses the connectivity between symbols at different scales to constrain the search for correspondence. An interactive training program for learning models of pattern classes is described, and some conclusions from the work are presented."

The DOLP is a reversible transform which converts an image into a set of bandpass images. A DOLP transform is shown to require O(N2) multiplies and produce O(N log(N)) samples from an N sample image. When Gaussian low-pass filters are used, the result is a set of images which have been convolved with difference of Gaussian (DOG) filters from an exponential set of sizes. A fast computation technique based on ``resampling'' is described and shown to reduce the DOLP transform complexity to O(N log(N)) multiplies and O(N) storage locations. A second technique, ``cascaded convolution with expansion,'' is then defined and also shown to reduce the computational cost to O(N log(N)) multiplies. Combining these two techniques yields an algorithm for a DOLP transform that requires O(N) storage cells and requires O(N) multiplies."

We call the representation the Curvature Primal Sketch because of the close analogy to the primal sketch representation advocated by Marr for describing significant intensity changes. We define a set of primitive parameterized curvature discontinuities, and derive expressions for their convolutions with the first and second derivatives of a Gaussian. We describe an implemented algorithm that computes the Curvature Primal Sketch by matching the multiscale convolutions of a shape, and illustrate its performance on a set of tool shapes. Several applications of the representation are sketched."

Conductance values between pixels are controlled by statistical measurements made of the partial classification. Several iterations follow, interleaving partial labeling with diffusion steps until a convergence or stopping criterion is met. The method is suitable for performing diffusion within multi-valued images. It consistently controls relaxation parameters, even in the presence of noise.

Methods based on curvature extrema alone are likely to find three of the four of these shapes indistinguishable, while methods based on approaches such as shape templates may be oblivious to their similarity.

We introduce a smoothing criterion for the contour that optimizes the tradeoff between the complexity of the contour and proximity of the data points. We describe the computation of the contour representation, the computation of relevant properties of the contour, and the potential application of the representation and smoothing paradigm to contour interpretation and recognition."

The techniques were evaluated by assessing the radiometric variability of MR volume data and by comparing automated and manual procedures for measuring tissue volumes. Results showed (a) the homogeneity of the MR data and (b) that automated techniques were consistently superior to manual techniques. Both techniques, however, were affected by the complexity of the structure, with simpler structures (eg, the intracranial cavity) showing less variability and better spatial correlation of segmentation results between raters. Moreover, the automated techniques were completed for whole brain in a fraction of the time required to complete the equivalent segmentation manually. Additional evaluations included interrater reliability and an evaluation that included longitudinal measurement, in which one subject was imaged sequentially 24 times, with reliability computed from data collected by three raters over 1 year. Results showed good reliability for the automated segmentation procedures."

The first six sections are concerned with the probability distribution of I(t) and of its zeros and maxima. Sections 3.7 and 3.8 are concerned with the statistical properties of the envelope of I(t). Fluctuations of integrals involving I2(t) are discussed in section 3.9. The probability distribution of a sine wave plus a noise current is given in 3.10 and in 3.11 an alternative method of deriving the results of Part III is mentioned. Prof. Uhlenbeck has pointed out that much of the material in this Part is closely connected with the theory of Markoff processes. Also S. Chandrasekhar has written a review of a class of physical problems which is related, in a general way, to the present subject.22"

These descriptors can be constructed using the methods of invariant theory, which are briefly surveyed. A range of applications of invariant descriptors in 3D model-based vision is demonstrated. First, a model-based vision system that recognizes curved plane objects irrespective of their pose is demonstrated. Curves are not reduced to polyhedral approximations but are handled as objects in their own right. Models are generated directly from image data. Once objects have been recognized, their pose can be computed. Invariant descriptors for 3D objects with plane faces are described. All these ideas are demonstrated using images of real scenes. The stability of a range of invariant descriptors to measurement error is treated in detail. >"

For continuous signals, a scaling argument directly gives a natural unit for measuring scale-space lifetime in terms of the logarithm of the ordinary scale parameter. That approach is, however, not appropriate for discrete signals since an infinite lifetime would be assigned to structures existing in the original signal. It is shown how such an effective scale parameter can be defined to give consistent results for both discrete and continuous signals. The treatment is based on the assumption that the probability that a local extremum disappears during a short-scale interval should not vary with scale. As a tool for the analysis, estimates are given of how the density of local extrema can be expected to vary with scale in the scale-space representation of different random noise signals both in the continuous and discrete cases. >"

Such edges are called phantom or spurious. A method for classifying zero crossings as corresponding to authentic or phantom edges is presented. The contrast of an authentic edge is shown to increase and the contrast of phantom edges to decrease with a decrease in the filter scale. Thus, a phantom edge is truly a phantom in that the closer one examines it, the weaker it becomes. The results of applying the classification schemes described to synthetic and authentic signals in one and two dimensions are given. The significance of the phantom edges is examined with respect to their frequency and strength relative to the authentic edges, and it is seen that authentic edges are denser and stronger, on the average, than phantom edges. >"

The Bayesian approach is very attractive since: (i) it enables the assumptions used to be explicitly stated in the probability distributions, and (ii) it can be extended to deal with most other problems in early vision. Here, we consider the Markov random field formalism, a special case of the Bayesian approach, in which the probability distributions are specified by an energy function.We show that: (i) our discrete formulations for the energy function is closely related to the continuous formulation; (ii) by using the mean field (MF) theory approach, introduced by Geiger and Girosi [1991], several previous attempts to solve these energy functions are effectively equivalent; (iii) by varying the parameters of the energy functions we can obtain connections to nonlinear diffusion and minimal description length approaches to image segmentation; and (iv) simple modifications to the energy can give a direct relation to robust statistics or can encourage hysteresis and nonmaximum suppression."

For example, they do not specify the tangent direction or curvature of an edge or the locations of tangent discontinuities. In this paper, a method is presented for describing linked edge points at a range of scales by selecting intervals of the curve and scales of smoothing that are most likely to represent the underlying structure of the scene. This multiscale analysis of curves is complementary to any multiscale detection of the original edge points. A solution is presented for the problem of shrinkage of curves during Gaussian smoothing, which has been a significant impediment to the use of smoothing for practical curve description. The curve segmentation method is based on a measure of smoothness minimizing the third derivative of Gaussian convolution. The smoothness measure is used to identify discontinuities of curve tangents simultaneously with selecting the appropriate scale of smoothing. The averaging of point locations during smoothing provides for accurate subpixel curve localization. This curve-description method can be implemented efficiently and should prove practical for a wide range of applications including correspondence matching, perceptual grouping, and model-based recognition."
