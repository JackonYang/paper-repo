Towards this goal, we propose a novel deformable part-based model which exploits region-based segmentation algorithms that compute candidate object regions by bottom-up clustering followed by ranking of those regions. Our approach allows every detection hypothesis to select a segment (including void), and scores each box in the image using both the traditional HOG filters as well as a set of novel segmentation features. Thus our model ``blends'' between the detector and segmentation models. Since our features can be computed very efficiently given the segments, we maintain the same complexity as the original DPM. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in PASCAL VOC 2010, and show that when employing only a root filter our approach outperforms Dalal & Triggs detector on all classes, achieving 13% higher average AP. When employing the parts, we outperform the original DPM in $19$ out of $20$ classes, achieving an improvement of 8% AP. Furthermore, we outperform the previous state-of-the-art on VOC 2010 test by 4%."

This approach allows the weights of region and boundary features to adapt to the segmentation scale at which they are applied. The stages of the cascade are trained sequentially, with asymetric loss to maximize boundary recall. On six segmentation data sets, our algorithm achieves best performance under most region-quality measures, and does it with fewer segments than the prior work. Our algorithm is also highly competitive in a dense over segmentation (super pixel) regime under boundary-based measures."

Unlike competing approaches, SCALPEL uses a cascade of bottom-up segmentation models that is capable of learning to ignore boundaries early on, yet use them as a stopping criterion once the object has been mostly segmented. Furthermore, we show how such cascades can be learned efficiently. When paired with a novel method that generates better localized shape priors than our competitors, our method leads to a concise, accurate set of segmentation proposals, these proposals are more accurate on the PASCAL VOC2010 dataset than state-of-the-art methods that use re-ranking to filter much larger bags of proposals. The code for our algorithm is available online."

For this purpose, we propose a novel design for region-based object detectors that integrates efficiently top-down information from scanning-windows part models and global appearance cues. Our detectors produce class-specific scores for bottom-up regions, and then aggregate the votes of multiple overlapping candidates through pixel classification. We evaluate our approach on the PASCAL segmentation challenge, and report competitive performance with respect to current leading techniques. On VOC2010, our method obtains the best results in 6/20 categories and the highest performance on articulated objects."

The object hypotheses are represented as figure-ground segmentations, and are extracted automatically, without prior knowledge of the properties of individual object classes, by solving a sequence of Constrained Parametric Min-Cut problems (CPMC) on a regular image grid. In a subsequent step, we learn to rank the corresponding segments by training a continuous model to predict how likely they are to exhibit real-world regularities (expressed as putative overlap with ground truth) based on their mid-level region properties, then diversify the estimated overlap score using maximum marginal relevance measures. We show that this algorithm significantly outperforms the state of the art for low-level segmentation in the VOC 2009 and 2010 data sets. In our companion papers [1], [2], we show that the algorithm can be used, successfully, in a segmentation-based visual object category recognition pipeline. This architecture ranked first in the VOC2009 and VOC2010 image segmentation and labeling challenges."

We define a predicate for measuring the evidence for a boundary between two regions using a graph-based representation of the image. We then develop an efficient segmentation algorithm based on this predicate, and show that although this algorithm makes greedy decisions it produces segmentations that satisfy global properties. We apply the algorithm to image segmentation using two different kinds of local neighborhoods in constructing the graph, and illustrate the results with both real and synthetic images. The algorithm runs in time nearly linear in the number of graph edges and is also fast in practice. An important characteristic of the method is its ability to preserve detail in low-variability image regions while ignoring detail in high-variability regions."

Region features are appealing in this context because: (1) they encode shape and scale information of objects naturally; (2) they are only mildly affected by background clutter. Regions have not been popular as features due to their sensitivity to segmentation errors. In this paper, we start by producing a robust bag of overlaid regions for each image using Arbeldez et al., CVPR 2009. Each region is represented by a rich set of image cues (shape, color and texture). We then learn region weights using a max-margin framework. In detection and segmentation, we apply a generalized Hough voting scheme to generate hypotheses of object locations, scales and support, followed by a verification classifier and a constrained segmenter on each hypothesis. The proposed approach significantly outperforms the state of the art on the ETHZ shape database(87.1% average detection rate compared to Ferrari et al. 's 67.2%), and achieves competitive performance on the Caltech 101 database."

Our key objectives are completeness and diversity: Every object should have at least one good proposed region, and a diverse set should be top-ranked. Our approach is to generate a set of segmentations by performing graph cuts based on a seed region and a learned affinity function. Then, the regions are ranked using structured learning based on various cues. Our experiments on the Berkeley Segmentation Data Set and Pascal VOC 2011 demonstrate our ability to find most objects within a small bag of proposed regions."

We define generic ultrametric distances by integrating local contour cues along the regions boundaries and combining this information with region attributes.

But while much success has been reported in detecting several rectangular-shaped object classes (i.e. faces, cars, pedestrians), results have been much less impressive for more general types of objects. Several researchers have advocated the use of image segmentation as a way to get a better spatial support for objects. In this paper, our aim is to address this issue by studying the following two questions: 1) how important is good spatial support for recognition? 2) can segmentation provide better spatial support for objects? To answer the first, we compare recognition performance using ground-truth segmentation vs. bounding boxes. To answer the second, we use the multiple segmentation approach to evaluate how close can real segments approach the ground-truth for real objects, and at what cost. Our results demonstrate the importance of finding the right spatial support for objects, and the feasibility of doing so without excessive computational burden."

Patches of edges exhibit well-known forms of local structure, such as straight lines or T-junctions. In this paper we take advantage of the structure present in local image patches to learn both an accurate and computationally efficient edge detector. We formulate the problem of predicting local edge masks in a structured learning framework applied to random decision forests. Our novel approach to learning decision trees robustly maps the structured labels to a discrete space on which standard information gain measures may be evaluated. The result is an approach that obtains real time performance that is orders of magnitude faster than many competing state-of-the-art approaches, while also achieving state-of-the-art edge detection results on the BSDS500 Segmentation dataset and NYU Depth dataset. Finally, we show the potential of our approach as a general purpose edge detector by showing our learned edge models generalize well across datasets."

                "text": "Supervised datasets play a central role as standards against which to benchmark long-term progress in computer vision. Over the past decade, the PASCAL [2] and Berkeley segmentation datasets (BSDS) [3] have filled these roles for the object detection and image segmentation tasks, respectively. The type of annotation available for each dataset determines the particular visual subtasks to which it is applicable. Object bounding boxes can benchmark detection algorithms, but are of limited use for training or evaluating segmentation. Segmented objects are more widely useful, but more time-consuming to annotate. What visual tasks are most important and what level of annotation detail is appropriate? We present an alternative to thinking about dataset annotation in terms of a restricted set of visual tasks. Our key observation is that a hierarchical groundtruth representation, in the form of a doubly ordered region tree, allows one to subsume disparate aspects of image labeling into a single framework. Specifically, we capture a nearly complete description of any scene in terms of objects, parts, object-part containment, segmentation, and figure-ground or occlusion ordering. Figure 1 illustrates the type of detail our annotation model encompasses for a typical scene. Our unifying abstraction regards a scene as a set S = {R1,R2, ...,Rn} where each Ri \u2286 I is a region in the image I. In general, Ri \u2229R j may be nonempty. It then organizes regions {Ri} into a tree T . Let N(Ri) denote the node of T corresponding to region Ri. N(R j) is set to be the parent node of N(Ri) iff: (1) R j \u2283 Ri, (2) R j and Ri have an object-part relationship, and (3) @Rk : R j \u2283 Rk \u2283 Ri and R j, Rk, Ri have an objectpart-subpart relationship, respectively. If for Ri, no region R j satisfies all three conditions, then we set N(Ri) to be a child of the root node. Simply stated, T decomposes the the scene into a multilevel object-part hierarchy. We exploit one additional degree of freedom within T : the order O(\u00b7) in which nodes appear beneath a common parent encodes local occlusion relationships. Given sibling regions Ri and R j such that Ri\u2229R j 6= / 0, then Ri occludes R j if O(Ri) O(R j). If Ri \u2229R j = / 0, then they do not occlude one another and we disregard their relative ordering. Given T and O, preorder tree traversal uses the objectpart hierarchy to translate local occlusions into a global figure-ground ordering. It also recovers a groundtruth ultrametric contour map (UCM) [1] weighting visible boundaries by the structural importance (object, part, subpart) of the regions they enclose. Figure 2 shows a partial scene tree for a self-occluding object. Our full paper describes extensions for representing loops (shirt both behind and in front of arm). To mitigate the cost of creating rich groundtruth, we introduce a web-based annotation tool with a graphical interface for managing the region hierarchy. Our software eliminates tedious tracing of region boundaries through a dynamic paintbrush that snaps to the shape of underlying superpixels in a precomputed oversegmentation. Combined with a touch-up mode, it guides fast creation of pixel-perfect regions. Figure 2: Our model of a scene or object groups pixels into regions and maps regions to nodes in a tree. Parent-child links denote region containment and semantic object-part relationships. Relative ordering of sibling nodes resolves occlusion ambiguities.

To achieve this effect, we introduce multiplicative second-order analogues of average and max-pooling that together with appropriate non-linearities lead to state-of-the-art performance on free-form region recognition, without any type of feature coding. Instead of coding, we found that enriching local descriptors with additional image information leads to large performance gains, especially in conjunction with the proposed pooling methodology. We show that second-order pooling over free-form regions produces results superior to those of the winning systems in the Pascal VOC 2011 semantic segmentation challenge, with models that are 20,000 times faster."

This characteristic is in contrast to many existing works on bottom-up segmentation, which prematurely compress information into a single scale. The architecture is a standard extension of Normalized Cuts from an image plane to an image pyramid, with cross-scale constraints enforcing consistency in the solution while allowing emergence of coarse-to-fine detail. We observe that multiscale processing, in addition to improving segmentation quality, offers a route by which to speed computation. We make a significant algorithmic advance in the form of a custom multigrid eigensolver for constrained Angular Embedding problems possessing coarse-to-fine structure. Multiscale Normalized Cuts is a special case. Our solver builds atop recent results on randomized matrix approximation, using a novel interpolation operation to mold its computational strategy according to cross-scale constraints in the problem definition. Applying our solver to multiscale segmentation problems demonstrates speedup by more than an order of magnitude. This speedup is at the algorithmic level and carries over to any implementation target."

However, to enable the use of more expensive features and classifiers and thereby progress beyond the state-of-the-art, a selective search strategy is needed. Therefore, we adapt segmentation as a selective search by reconsidering segmentation: We propose to generate many approximate locations over few and precise object delineations because (1) an object whose location is never generated can not be recognised and (2) appearance and immediate nearby context are most effective for object recognition. Our method is class-independent and is shown to cover 96.7% of all objects in the Pascal VOC 2007 test set using only 1,536 locations per image. Our selective search enables the use of the more expensive bag-of-words method which we use to substantially improve the state-of-the-art by up to 8.5% for 8 out of 20 classes on the Pascal VOC 2010 detection challenge."

First, it surveys and structures the measures used to compare the segmentation results with a ground truth database, and proposes a new measure: the precision-recall for objects and parts. To compare the goodness of these measures, it defines three quantitative meta-measures involving six state of the art segmentation methods. The meta-measures consist in assuming some plausible hypotheses about the results and assessing how well each measure reflects these hypotheses. As a conclusion, this paper proposes the precision-recall curves for boundaries and for objects-and-parts as the tool of choice for the supervised evaluation of image segmentation.

We define generic ultrametric distances by integrating local contour cues along the regions boundaries and combining this information with region attributes.

At the core of contour detection technologies are a set of hand-designed gradient features, used by most approaches including the state-of-the-art Global Pb (gPb) operator. In this work, we show that contour detection accuracy can be significantly improved by computing Sparse Code Gradients (SCG), which measure contrast using patch representations automatically learned through sparse coding. We use K-SVD for dictionary learning and Orthogonal Matching Pursuit for computing sparse codes on oriented local neighborhoods, and apply multi-scale pooling and power transforms before classifying them with linear SVMs. By extracting rich representations from pixels and avoiding collapsing them prematurely, Sparse Code Gradients effectively learn how to measure local contrasts and find contours. We improve the F-measure metric on the BSDS500 benchmark to 0.74 (up from 0.71 of gPb contours). Moreover, our learning approach can easily adapt to novel sensor data such as Kinect-style RGB-D cameras: Sparse Code Gradients on depth maps and surface normals lead to promising contour detection using depth and depth+color, as verified on the NYU Depth Dataset."

After reviewing existing edge and gradient based descriptors, we show experimentally that grids of histograms of oriented gradient (HOG) descriptors significantly outperform existing feature sets for human detection. We study the influence of each stage of the computation on performance, concluding that fine-scale gradients, fine orientation binning, relatively coarse spatial binning, and high-quality local contrast normalization in overlapping descriptor blocks are all important for good results. The new approach gives near-perfect separation on the original MIT pedestrian database, so we introduce a more challenging dataset containing over 1800 annotated human images with a large range of pose variations and backgrounds."

Our system is able to represent highly variable object classes and achieves state-of-the-art results in the PASCAL object detection challenges. While deformable part models have become quite popular, their value had not been demonstrated on difficult benchmarks such as the PASCAL data sets. Our system relies on new methods for discriminative training with partially labeled data. We combine a margin-sensitive approach for data-mining hard negative examples with a formalism we call latent SVM. A latent SVM is a reformulation of MI--SVM in terms of latent variables. A latent SVM is semiconvex, and the training problem becomes convex once latent information is specified for the positive examples. This leads to an iterative training algorithm that alternates between fixing latent values for positive examples and optimizing the latent SVM objective function."

We define generic ultrametric distances by integrating local contour cues along the regions boundaries and combining this information with region attributes. Then, we evaluate quantitatively our results with respect to ground-truth segmentation data, proving that our system outperforms significantly two widely used hierarchical segmentation techniques, as well as the state of the art in local edge detection."
