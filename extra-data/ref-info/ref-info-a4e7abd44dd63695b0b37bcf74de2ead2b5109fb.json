The light distributions in images of bright vertical lines formed by a double passage through the eye optics were measured. On the assumption that the eye optics are reversible, the light distributions on the retina were computed by means of Fourier transforms. The results are also expressed in terms of the spatial frequency response functions for the eye. The effects of pupil size were examined. The best imagery was obtained with a 5-mm pupil. The results confirmed the earlier measurements on human eyes reported by Flamant. The more recent experiments on animal material by DeMott do not seem to be relevant to living human eyes."

It conveys more information about the characteristics of the system than does the specification of only the resolving power. This approach, widely applied to electrical systems, is strengthened by the formal identity of the transformation equations in diffraction theory between objects and images with those of Fourier analysis and synthesis (Hopkins, 1953). The method can also be applied to the response of a receiving layer, such as photographic film. When a sequence of optical and receiving systems is used in series, the total response of the whole system is deducible from those of its components, provided the principle of linearity holds. In a physical system when carrying out a sine-wave analysis, one determines the output magnitude for a constant input at various frequencies, but this is not readily feasible in the case of the visual system. Instead, one may reverse the procedure and measure the input required for a constant output, for example, a threshold response. In the present paper data will be presented of the application of such an approach to the retinal and central stages of the visual process, excluding the purely optical ones of the eye."

Light distributions were obtained for various pupil sizes and degrees of defocusing. Measurements were also obtained with bar and grating objects.To compute the line-spread function on the fundus, correction was made for the double passage of the light through the optical system of the eye on the assumption that the spread in angular measure is the same in both directions. The results may be considered to depict distributions which are possibly broader, but certainly not narrower, than the real distributions in the retinal image. The line-spread function on the fundus was determined to have a half-width at half-height of one minute of arc for an eye in best focus with a 3-mm pupil, and this suggests that the point-spread function has half-width 0.66 min of arc as an upper estimate."

Measurements were made in the dark-adapted eye. Thresholds were determined with each of eight selected color filters and also with Wratten neutral tint filters. Seven gratings were used which required visual acuities from 0.042 to 0.625. With gratings requiring a high order of visual acuity, minimum luminances for resolution of a grating are very nearly the same for all the color filters. As visual acuity requirements are decreased, however, luminance thresholds determined with red filters become higher relative to thresholds determined with other filters. Luminance thresholds with blue filters become lower relative to thresholds obtained with other filters. These results are interpreted to indicate that changes in the threshold criterion may result in changes in the character of visual function from rod function through mesopic function to cone function even though the eye remains dark-adapted. In situations where an individual is adapted to a visual field of low over-all luminance and must periodically, in short glimpses, read visual displays at higher levels of illumination, the appropriate specification of the relative effectiveness of illumination wavelengths will depend on the visual acuity required to read the display."

The analog has the form of a color television camera chain feeding electrical signals to a \u201ccomputer\u201d (the brain). Evaluation of characteristics is limited to elements preceding the computer, and particularly to the \u201cluminance channel\u201d of the color system.The primary photoelectric transfer characteristics n\u00af1=f(Er) of the receptors (rods and cones) are computed as a function of retinal illumination (Er) from threshold signal-to-noise ratios in the effective image area of point sources, disks, and other test objects. The effective image area, which is the convolution of the object area with the sampling area of the visual system, is determined from its Fourier spectrum. The constants of the transfer functions are established from the optical constants of the eye, its storage-time function, and the maximum transfer ratio of statistical units of the rod and cone systems. There is little room for variation of constants, if they are to remain in agreement with observed values."

In its earliest form it consisted of simple applications of the laws of reflection and refraction to geometrically simple systems. The analytical theory of the aberrations of axially symmetrical syste, s, on the other hand, has been in existance for a little more than a century. If one reflects that for the most part this comprises only the consequences of the application of Snell's law and elementary coordinate geometry to the very simple geometrical configuration of spherical surfaces with their centres in a straight line, it is remarkable that even here important work both continues and remains to be done."
