An innovative method (called \"CLAWS\") was recently developed by those working with the Lancaster-Oslo/Bergen Corpus of British English. This algorithm uses a systematic calculation based upon the probabilities of co-occurrence of particular tags. Its accuracy is high, but it is very slow, and it has been manually augmented in a number of ways. The effects upon accuracy of this manual augmentation are not individually known.The current paper presents an algorithm for disambiguation that is similar to CLAWS but that operates in linear rather than in exponential time and space, and which minimizes the unsystematic augments. Tests of the algorithm using the million words of the Brown Standard Corpus of English are reported; the overall accuracy is 96%. This algorithm can provide a fast and accurate front end to any parsing or natural language processing system for English."

In speech recognition, a language model is used to direct the hypothesis search for the sentence that was spoken. In fact, its probability assignments are a factor in evaluating the likelihood that any word string was uttered, and in ordering the word string hypotheses to be examined (1). Language models are also useful in text encoding for compression or transmission, in character recognition of printed or handwritten text, etc. Ideally, the probability assigned by a language model to any word should depend on the entire past sequence of words. However, it is practically impossible to implement such a dependence: 1) The probability estimate involved would have to be extracted from a giant sample of training text containing billions of words; 2) If the probabilities were extractable, sufficient space in computer memory could not be found to store them."

This paper describes a computational grammar coder which has been completely programmed and is oper~tional on Lhe IBM 7090. It is part of a complete syntactic annlysis system for which it accomplishes word-class coding, using a computational approach rather than the usual method of dictionary lookup. The resulting system is completely contained in less than 1~,000 computer words. It processes running English text on the IBM 7090 at a rate of more than 1250 words per minute. Since the system is not dependent on large dictionaries, it operates on any ordinary English text. In preliminary experiments with scientific text, the system correctly and unambiguously coded over 90 percent of the words in two samples of scientific writing. A fair proportion of the remaining ambiguity can be removed at higher levels of synvactic analysis, but the problem of structural ambiguity in natural languages is seen to be a critical one in the development of practical language processing systems."

The model has the advantage that a pre-tagged training corpus is not required. Words are represented by equivalence classes to reduce the number of parameters required and provide an essentially vocabulary-independent model. State chains are used to model selective higher-order conditioning in the model, which obviates the proliferation of parameters attendant in uniformly higher-order models. The structure of the state chains is based on both an analysis of errors and linguistic knowledge. Examples show how word dependency across phrases can be modeled."

They propose a model that administrators can employ that minimizes bias. In a similar vein, the next chapter, by Jeffery Braden and Sandra Fradd, suggests ways that administrators can anticipate difficulties and intervene before such referrals are necessary. William Tikunoff, in the eighth chapter, focuses on instructional leadership. He discusses the characteristics of an effective principal and targets specific areas, such as effective time management. The final chapter, by Beatrice Ward, addresses the greatest resource of any educational institution: the teachers. She describes the clinical approach to teacher development and how it can be implemented. Overall, this book fills a need for basic, factual information about legal requirements, program types, and effective instructional and leadership strategies with respect to the LEP population. Furthermore, it provides guidance on the complex issue of special education for LEP students, particularly the referral process. An additional chapter exploring different models for assessment and program design for these students would have provided depth and balance. Although there is necessarily some overlap between the chapters, it is reinforcing, not repetitive. In addition to being extremely useful to administrators, this book would be of value to school personnel such as psychologists, special education consultants, LEP consultants, instructors-in short, for anyone committed to the design and delivery of effective instructional programs for LEP students."
