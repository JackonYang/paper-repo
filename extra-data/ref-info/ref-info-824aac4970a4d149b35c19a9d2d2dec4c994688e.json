The indexing component is used to automatically generate semantic representations of images so that the image retrieval component can use this information to enable image retrieval. The man-machine communication of the image retrieval component is based on an iconical graphical query language to accomplish geographical query speciication for image access. Experiments have been carried out on three diierent sets of images from the following domains: MRI images of the chest, electronic schemas and topographic maps. The experiments show encouraging results especially for domains which have a high degree of formality in their pictorial expression, such as electronic schemas and topographic maps, and to a less extent for domains having a weak degree of formality such as MRI images of the chest."

Although several techniques have been developed, most have limited capabilities in dealing with relative spatial relations for multiple object images. We believe that multiple object image indexing is important for content-based indexing in many application domains. We propose a content-based indexing technique which is based on the theory of weighted center-of-mass. The index of an image is constructed by incorporating the center-of-mass of each individual object to calculate the center-of-mass of the overall image. This multiple object indexing scheme is further enhanced by incorporating existing indexing structure construction techniques, such as Jagadish''s multidimensional point representation, and Grosky''s feature index tree. An image with multiple objects can be retrieved by specifying the spatial relations among image objects, such as relative position, relative distance, and direction. The retrieval matching is based on a relative similarity measure. Furthermore, due to certain invariant properties of center-of-mass, different notions of image similarity with respect to scaling, translation, rotation, and mirrored image can be easily supported. The advantages of the proposed method are illustrated with an example of retrieving magnetic resonance images of patients'' chests within the medical image domain. The relationships to certain other indexing techniques are also addressed."

Using our standardized testbed in an exhaustive performance comparison, it turned out that the R*-tree clearly outperforms the existing R-tree variants. Guttman's linear and quadratic R-tree and Greene's variant of the R-tree. This superiority of the R*-tree holds for different types of queries and operations, such as map overlay, for both rectangles and multidimensional points in all experiments. From a practical point of view the R*-tree is very attractive because of the following two reasons 1 it efficiently supports point and spatial data at the same time and 2 its implementation cost is only slightly higher than that of other R-trees."

For these purpose, we have adopted the Munsell Renotation System in which color signals of tri-attributes of human color perception (Hue, Value and Chroma) and psychometrical color differences are defined. In the Munsell Renotation System, however, intertransformation between (RGB) data and corresponding color data is very cumbersome. Because the intertransformation depends on a look up table. This article presents a new method of mathematical transformation. The mathematical transformation is obtained by multiple regression analysis of 250 color samples, which are uniformly sampled from whole color ranges that a conventional NTSC color TV camera can present. The new method can transform (RGB) data to the data of the Munsell Renotation System far better than the conventional method given by the CIE(1976)L*a*b*."

Kass et al., proposed a variational technique; Amini used dynamic programming; and Williams and Shah introduced a fast, greedy algorithm. We combine the advantages of the latter two methods in a two-stage algorithm. The first stage is a greedy procedure that provides fast initial convergence. It is enhanced with a cost term that extends over a large number of points to avoid oscillations. The second stage, when accuracy becomes important, uses dynamic programming. This step is accelerated by the use of alternating search neighborhoods and by dropping stable points from the iterations. We have also added several features for user interaction. First, the user can define points of high confidence. Mathematically, this results in an extra cost term and, in that way, the robustness in difficult areas (e.g., noisy edges, sharp corners) is improved. We also give the user the possibility of incremental contour tracking, thus providing feedback on the refinement process. The algorithm has been tested on numerous photographic clip art images and extensive tests on medical images are in progress."

They manifest various deficiencies in particular for multikey access to highly dynamic files. We study the dynamic aspects of file structures that treat all keys symmetrically, that is, file structures which avoid the distinction between primary and secondary keys. We start from a bitmap approach and treat the problem of file design as one of data compression of a large sparse matrix. This leads to the notions of a grid partition of the search space and of a grid directory, which are the keys to a dynamic file structure called the grid file. This file system adapts gracefully to its contents under insertions and deletions, and thus achieves an upper bound of two disk accesses for single record retrieval; it also handles range queries and partially specified queries efficiently. We discuss in detail the design decisions that led to the grid file, present simulation results of its behavior, and compare it to other multikey access file structures."

                "text": "Toward the development of an object recognition and positioning system, able to deal with arbitrary shaped objects in cluttered environments, methods for matching two arbitrarily shaped regions of different objects are introduced, and how to efficiently compute the coordinate transformation which makes two matching regions coincide is shown. In both cases, matching and positioning, the results are invariant with respect to viewer coordinate system, and these techniques apply to both 2-D and 3-D problems, under either Euclidean or affine coordinate transformations. The 3-D Euclidean case is useful for the recognition and positioning of solid objects from range data, and the 2-D affine case for the recognition and positioning of solid objects from projections, e.g., from curves in a single image, and in motion estimation. The matching of arbitrarily shaped regions is done by computing for each region a vector of centered moments. These vectors are viewpoint-dependent, but the dependence on the viewpoint is algebraic and well known. This paper presents a new family of computationally efficient algorithms based on matrix computations, for the evaluation of both Euclidean and affine algebraic moment invariants of data sets. The use of algebraic moment invariants greatly reduces the computation required for the matching and, hence, initial object recognition. The approach to determining and computing these moment invariants is different than those used by the vision community previously. The method for computing the coordinate transformation which makes the two matching regions coincide provides an estimate of object position. The estimation of the matching transformation is based on the same matrix computation techniques introduced for the computation of invariants. It involves simple manipulations of the moment vectors. It neither requires costly iterative methods, nor going back to the data set. These geometric invariant methods appear to be very important for dealing with the situation of a large number of different possible objects in the presence of occlusion and clutter, and the approach to computing these moment invariants is different than those used by the vision community previously."

However, all of these require that the ranges in the different dimensions be specified independently. In other words, only rectangular regions can be specified and searched for. Similarly, nonpoint objects can be indexed only in terms of their bounding rectangles. However, polyhedral search regions and polyhedral bounding rectangles can often provide a much greater selectivity in the search. It is shown how to use multiattribute search structures for polyhedral regions by mapping polyhedral regions into rectangular regions of a higher dimension. In particular, the P-tree (polyhedral tree) is introduced and shown to be an effective multiattribute index structure.<<ETX>>"
