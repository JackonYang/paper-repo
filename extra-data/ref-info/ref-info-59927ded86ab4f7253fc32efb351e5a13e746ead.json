More specifically, given a query image, we retrieve existing human-composed phrases used to describe visually similar images, then selectively combine those phrases to generate a novel description for the query image. We cast the generation process as constraint optimization problems, collectively incorporating multiple interconnected aspects of language composition for content planning, surface realization and discourse structure. Evaluation by human annotators indicates that our final system generates more semantically correct and linguistically appealing descriptions than two nontrivial baselines."

In turn, it can also help us in the quest to generate natural language that describes this world in a human manner. We present a simple yet effective approach to automatically compose image descriptions given computer vision based inputs and using web-scale n-grams. Unlike most previous work that summarizes or retrieves pre-existing text relevant to an image, our method composes sentences entirely from scratch. Experimental results indicate that it is viable to generate simple textual descriptions that are pertinent to the specific content of an image, while permitting creativity in the description -- making for more human-like annotations than previous approaches."

However, the potential benefits of such data are yet to be fully realized due to the complexity and noise in the alignment between image content and text. We address this challenge with contributions in two folds: first, we introduce the new task of image caption generalization, formulated as visually-guided sentence compression, and present an efficient algorithm based on dynamic beam search with dependency-based constraints. Second, we release a new large-scale corpus with 1 million image-caption pairs achieving tighter content alignment between images and text. Evaluation results show the intrinsic quality of the generalized captions and the extrinsic utility of the new imagetext parallel corpus with respect to a concrete application of image caption transfer."

The first part, content planning, smooths the output of computer vision-based detection and recognition algorithms with statistics mined from large pools of visually descriptive text to determine the best content words to use to describe an image. The second step, surface realization, chooses words to construct natural language sentences based on the predicted content and general statistics from natural language. We present multiple approaches for the surface realization step and evaluate each using automatic measures of similarity to human generated reference descriptions. We also collect forced choice human evaluations between descriptions from the proposed generation system and descriptions from competing approaches. The proposed system is very effective at producing relevant sentences for images. It also generates descriptions that are notably more true to the specific image content than previous work."

Examples include video and image retrieval as well as the development of tools that aid visually impaired individuals to access pictorial information. Our approach leverages the vast resource of pictures available on the web and the fact that many of them are captioned and colocated with thematically related documents. Our model learns to create captions from a database of news articles, the pictures embedded in them, and their captions, and consists of two stages. Content selection identifies what the image and accompanying article are about, whereas surface realization determines how to verbalize the chosen content. We approximate content selection with a probabilistic image annotation model that suggests keywords for an image. The model postulates that images and their textual descriptions are generated by a shared set of latent variables (topics) and is trained on a weakly labeled dataset (which treats the captions and associated news articles as image labels). Inspired by recent work in summarization, we propose extractive and abstractive surface realization models. Experimental results show that it is viable to generate captions that are pertinent to the specific content of an image and its associated article, while permitting creativity in the description. Indeed, the output of our abstractive model compares favorably to handwritten captions and is often superior to extractive methods."

                "text": "In this paper, we present an image parsing to text description (I2T) framework that generates text descriptions of image and video content based on image understanding. The proposed I2T framework follows three steps: 1) input images (or video frames) are decomposed into their constituent visual patterns by an image parsing engine, in a spirit similar to parsing sentences in natural language; 2) the image parsing results are converted into semantic representation in the form of Web ontology language (OWL), which enables seamless integration with general knowledge bases; and 3) a text generation engine converts the results from previous steps into semantically meaningful, human readable, and query-able text reports. The centerpiece of the I2T framework is an and-or graph (AoG) visual knowledge representation, which provides a graphical representation serving as prior knowledge for representing diverse visual patterns and provides top-down hypotheses during the image parsing. The AoG embodies vocabularies of visual elements including primitives, parts, objects, scenes as well as a stochastic image grammar that specifies syntactic relations (i.e., compositional) and semantic relations (e.g., categorical, spatial, temporal, and functional) between these visual elements. Therefore, the AoG is a unified model of both categorical and symbolic representations of visual knowledge. The proposed I2T framework has two objectives. First, we use semiautomatic method to parse images from the Internet in order to build an AoG for visual knowledge representation. Our goal is to make the parsing process more and more automatic using the learned AoG model. Second, we use automatic methods to parse image/video in specific domains and generate text reports that are useful for real-world applications. In the case studies at the end of this paper, we demonstrate two automatic I2T systems: a maritime and urban scene video surveillance system and a real-time automatic driving scene understanding system."

Only a small fraction of local features within any given image are associated with a particular caption word, and captions may contain irrelevant words not associated with any image object. We propose a novel algorithm that uses the repetition of feature neighborhoods across training images and a measure of correspondence with caption words to learn meaningful feature configurations (representing named objects). We also introduce a graph-based appearance model that captures some of the structure of an object by encoding the spatial relationships among the local visual features. In an iterative procedure, we use language (the words) to drive a perceptual grouping process that assembles an appearance model for a named object. Results of applying our method to three data sets in a variety of conditions demonstrate that, from complex, cluttered, real-world scenes with noisy captions, we can learn both the names and appearances of objects, resulting in a set of models invariant to translation, scale, orientation, occlusion, and minor changes in viewpoint or articulation. These named models, in turn, are used to automatically annotate new, uncaptioned images, thereby facilitating keyword-based image retrieval."

Rather, they create new sentences that are grammatical, that cohere with one another, and that capture the most salient pieces of information in the original document. Given that large collections of text/abstract pairs are available online, it is now possible to envision algorithms that are trained to mimic this process. In this paper, we focus on sentence compression, a simpler version of this larger challenge. We aim to achieve two goals simultaneously:our compressions should be grammatical, and they should retain the most important pieces of information. These two goals can conflict. We devise both noisy-channel and decision-tree approaches to the problem, and we evaluate results against manual compressions and a simple baseline."

However, the sentence vectors of previous models cannot accurately represent visually grounded meaning. We introduce the DT-RNN model which uses dependency trees to embed sentences into a vector space in order to retrieve images that are described by those sentences. Unlike previous RNN-based models which use constituency trees, DT-RNNs naturally focus on the action and agents in a sentence. They are better able to abstract from the details of word order and syntactic expression. DT-RNNs outperform other recursive and recurrent neural networks, kernelized CCA and a bag-of-words baseline on the tasks of finding an image that fits a sentence description and vice versa. They also give more similar representations to sentences that describe the same image."

We describe a system that can compute a score linking an image to a sentence. This score can be used to attach a descriptive sentence to a given image, or to obtain images that illustrate a given sentence. The score is obtained by comparing an estimate of meaning obtained from the image to one obtained from the sentence. Each estimate of meaning comes from a discriminative procedure that is learned us-ingdata. We evaluate on a novel dataset consisting of human-annotated images. While our underlying estimate of meaning is impoverished, it is sufficient to produce very good quantitative results, evaluated with a novel score that can account for synecdoche."

Previous approaches have represented images as unstructured bags of regions, which makes it difficult to accurately predict meaningful relationships between regions. In this paper, we introduce visual dependency representations to capture the relationships between the objects in an image, and hypothesize that this representation can improve image description. We test this hypothesis using a new data set of region-annotated images, associated with visual dependency representations and gold-standard descriptions. We describe two template-based description generation models that operate over visual dependency representations. In an image description task, we find that these models outperform approaches that rely on object proximity or corpus information to generate descriptions on both automatic measures and on human judgements."

Previous work relies on supervised visual recognition systems to determine the content of images. These systems require massive amounts of hand-labeled data for training, so the number of visual classes that can be recognized is typically very small. We argue that these approaches place unrealistic limits on the kinds of images that can be captioned, and are unlikely to produce captions which reflect human interpretations. We present a framework for image caption generation that does not rely on visual recognition systems, which we have implemented on a dataset of online shopping images and product descriptions. We propose future work to improve this method, and extensions for other domains of images and natural text."

Unlike previous methods, our approach can annotate arbitrary videos without requiring the expensive collection and annotation of a similar training video corpus.

The input are initial noisy estimates of the objects and scenes detected in the image using state of the art trained detectors. As predicting actions from still images directly is unreliable, we use a language model trained from the English Gigaword corpus to obtain their estimates; together with probabilities of co-located nouns, scenes and prepositions. We use these estimates as parameters on a HMM that models the sentence generation process, with hidden nodes as sentence components and image detections as the emissions. Experimental results show that our strategy of combining vision and language produces readable and descriptive sentences compared to naive strategies that use vision alone."

The potential benefit from this source is made more significant due to the enormous amount of language data easily available today. We present a system to automatically generate natural language descriptions from images that exploits both statistics gleaned from parsing large quantities of text data and recognition algorithms from computer vision. The system is very effective at producing relevant sentences for images. It also generates descriptions that are notably more true to the specific image content than previous work."

The evaluation of computer-generated text is a notoriously difficult problem, however, the quality of image descriptions has typically been measured using unigram BLEU and human judgements. The focus of this paper is to determine the correlation of automatic measures with human judgements for this task. We estimate the correlation of unigram and Smoothed BLEU, TER, ROUGE-SU4, and Meteor against human judgements on two data sets. The main finding is that unigram BLEU has a weak correlation, and Meteor has the strongest correlation with human judgements."

We use the trained model to annotate test images without corresponding text. We capture visual properties such as color, texture, shape, and orientation by computing low-level image features, and measure the contribution of each type of visual feature towards the accuracy of the model.

We address this problem and present a method to automatically build a compression corpus with hundreds of thousands of instances on which deletion-based algorithms can be trained. In our corpus, the syntactic trees of the compressions are subtrees of their uncompressed counterparts, and hence supervised systems which require a structural alignment between the input and output can be successfully trained. We also extend an existing unsupervised compression method with a learning module. The new system uses structured prediction to learn from lexical, syntactic and other features. An evaluation with human raters shows that the presented data harvesting method indeed produces a parallel corpus of high quality. Also, the supervised system trained on this corpus gets high scores both from human raters and in an automatic evaluation setting, significantly outperforming a strong baseline."

In order to scale the use of these describable visual attributes to a large number of categories, especially those not well studied by psychologists or linguists, it will be necessary to find alternative techniques for identifying attribute vocabularies and for learning to recognize attributes without hand labeled training data. We demonstrate that it is possible to accomplish both these tasks automatically by mining text and image data sampled from the Internet. The proposed approach also characterizes attributes according to their visual representation: global or local, and type: color, texture, or shape. This work focuses on discovering attributes and their visual appearance, and is as agnostic as possible about the textual description."

Major difficulty in transforming video images into textual descriptions is how to bridge a semantic gap between them, which is also known as inverse Hollywood problem. In general, the concepts of events or actions of human can be classified by semantic primitives. By associating these concepts with the semantic features extracted from video images, appropriate syntactic components such as verbs, objects, etc. are determined and then translated into natural language sentences. We also demonstrate the performance of the proposed method by several experiments."

We aim to separate visual text---descriptions of what is being seen---from non-visual text in natural images and their descriptions. To do so, we first concretely define what it means to be visual, annotate visual text and then develop algorithms to automatically classify noun phrases as visual or non-visual. We find that using text alone, we are able to achieve high accuracies at this task, and that incorporating features derived from computer vision algorithms improves performance. Finally, we show that we can reliably mine visual nouns and adjectives from large corpora and that we can use these effectively in the classification task."

We present a new corpus that is suited to our task and a discriminative tree-to-tree transduction model that can naturally account for structural and lexical mismatches. The model incorporates a novel grammar extraction method, uses a language model for coherent output, and can be easily tuned to a wide range of compression specific loss functions."

Examples of these constraints include the type of arguments a relation can take, and the mutual activity of different relations. etc. We develop a linear programing formulation for this problem and evaluate it in the context of simultaneously learning named entities and relations. Our approach allows us to efficiently incorporate domain and task specific constraints at decision time, resulting in significant improvements in the accuracy and the \"human-like\" quality of the inferences."

We explore the use of Amazon's Mechanical Turk system, a significantly cheaper and faster method for collecting annotations from a broad base of paid non-expert contributors over the Web. We investigate five tasks: affect recognition, word similarity, recognizing textual entailment, event temporal ordering, and word sense disambiguation. For all five, we show high agreement between Mechanical Turk non-expert annotations and existing gold standard labels provided by expert labelers. For the task of affect recognition, we also show that using non-expert labels for training machine learning algorithms can be as effective as using gold standard annotations from experts. We propose a technique for bias correction that significantly improves annotation quality on two tasks. We conclude that many large labeling tasks can be effectively designed and carried out in this method at a fraction of the usual expense."

Unlike prior computer-vision approaches that learn from videos with verb labels or images with noun labels, our labels are sentences containing nouns, verbs, prepositions, adjectives, and adverbs. The correspondence between words and concepts in the video is learned in an unsupervised fashion, even when the video depicts simultaneous events described by multiple sentences or when different aspects of a single event are described with multiple sentences. The learned word meanings can be subsequently used to automatically generate description of new video."

However, scene understanding research has been constrained by the limited scope of currently-used databases which do not capture the full variety of scene categories. Whereas standard databases for object categorization contain hundreds of different classes of objects, the largest available dataset of scene categories contains only 15 classes. In this paper we propose the extensive Scene UNderstanding (SUN) database that contains 899 categories and 130,519 images. We use 397 well-sampled categories to evaluate numerous state-of-the-art algorithms for scene recognition and establish new bounds of performance. We measure human scene classification performance on the SUN database and compare this with computational methods. Additionally, we study a finer-grained scene representation to detect scenes embedded inside of larger scenes."

Such natural textures arise from spatial variation of two surface attributes: (1) reflectance and (2) surface normal. In this paper, we provide a unified model to address both these aspects of natural texture. The main idea is to construct a vocabulary of prototype tiny surface patches with associated local geometric and photometric properties. We call these 3D textons. Examples might be ridges, grooves, spots or stripes or combinations thereof Associated with each texton is an appearance vector, which characterizes the local irradiance distribution, represented as a set of linear Gaussian derivative filter outputs, under different lighting and viewing conditions. Given a large collection of images of different materials, a clustering approach is used to acquire a small (on the order of 100) 3D texton vocabulary. Given a few (1 to 4) images of any material, it can be characterized using these textons. We demonstrate the application of this representation for recognition of the material viewed under novel lighting and viewing conditions."

Indeed, its performance of 86.36% (LP/LR F1) is better than that of early lexicalized PCFG models, and surprisingly close to the current state-of-the-art. This result has potential uses beyond establishing a strong lower bound on the maximum possible accuracy of unlexicalized models: an unlexicalized PCFG is much more compact, easier to replicate, and easier to interpret than more complex lexical models, and the parsing algorithms are simpler, more widely understood, of lower asymptotic complexity, and easier to optimize."

Our experimental evaluation shows that ranking based algorithms do not outperform a one-vs-rest strategy and that the gap between the different algorithms reduces in case of high-dimensional data. We also show that for one-vs-rest, learning through cross-validation the optimal degree of imbalance between the positive and the negative samples can have a significant impact. Furthermore, early stopping can be used as an effective regularization strategy when training with stochastic gradient algorithms. Following these \"good practices\", we were able to improve the state-of-the-art on a large subset of 10K classes and 9M of images of lmageNet from 16.7% accuracy to 19.1%."

Our system is able to represent highly variable object classes and achieves state-of-the-art results in the PASCAL object detection challenges. While deformable part models have become quite popular, their value had not been demonstrated on difficult benchmarks such as the PASCAL data sets. Our system relies on new methods for discriminative training with partially labeled data. We combine a margin-sensitive approach for data-mining hard negative examples with a formalism we call latent SVM. A latent SVM is a reformulation of MI--SVM in terms of latent variables. A latent SVM is semiconvex, and the training problem becomes convex once latent information is specified for the positive examples. This leads to an iterative training algorithm that alternates between fixing latent values for positive examples and optimizing the latent SVM objective function."

In particular, humans can recognize tens of thousands of object classes and scenes. No computer vision algorithm today has been tested at this scale. This paper presents a study of large scale categorization including a series of challenging experiments on classification with more than 10, 000 image classes. We find that a) computational issues become crucial in algorithm design; b) conventional wisdom from a couple of hundred image categories on relative performance of different classifiers does not necessarily hold when the number of categories increases; c) there is a surprisingly strong relationship between the structure of WordNet (developed for studying language) and the difficulty of visual categorization; d) classification can be improved by exploiting the semantic hierarchy. Toward the future goal of developing automatic vision algorithms to recognize tens of thousands or even millions of image categories, we make a series of observations and arguments about dataset scale, category density, and image hierarchy."

On the test data, we achieved top-1 and top-5 error rates of 37.5% and 17.0%, respectively, which is considerably better than the previous state-of-the-art. The neural network, which has 60 million parameters and 650,000 neurons, consists of five convolutional layers, some of which are followed by max-pooling layers, and three fully connected layers with a final 1000-way softmax. To make training faster, we used non-saturating neurons and a very efficient GPU implementation of the convolution operation. To reduce overfitting in the fully connected layers we employed a recently developed regularization method called \"dropout\" that proved to be very effective. We also entered a variant of this model in the ILSVRC-2012 competition and achieved a winning top-5 test error rate of 15.3%, compared to 26.2% achieved by the second-best entry."

After reviewing existing edge and gradient based descriptors, we show experimentally that grids of histograms of oriented gradient (HOG) descriptors significantly outperform existing feature sets for human detection. We study the influence of each stage of the computation on performance, concluding that fine-scale gradients, fine orientation binning, relatively coarse spatial binning, and high-quality local contrast normalization in overlapping descriptor blocks are all important for good results. The new approach gives near-perfect separation on the original MIT pedestrian database, so we introduce a more challenging dataset containing over 1800 annotated human images with a large range of pose variations and backgrounds."

In this work, we study the problem of optimizing accuracy-specificity trade-offs in large scale recognition, motivated by the observation that object categories form a semantic hierarchy consisting of many levels of abstraction. A classifier can select the appropriate level, trading off specificity for accuracy in case of uncertainty. By optimizing this trade-off, we obtain classifiers that try to be as specific as possible while guaranteeing an arbitrarily high accuracy. We formulate the problem as maximizing information gain while ensuring a fixed, arbitrarily small error rate with a semantic hierarchy. We propose the Dual Accuracy Reward Trade-off Search (DARTS) algorithm and prove that, under practical conditions, it converges to an optimal solution. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm on datasets ranging from 65 to over 10,000 categories."
