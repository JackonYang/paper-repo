Since second-order (dipole) statistics determine the autocorrelation functions and hence the power spectra, this observation also meant that in preattentive perception of texture the phase (position) spectra were ignored. In the last two decades many new classes of texture pairs with identical power spectra have been invented that were not effortlessly discriminable; however, recently (Caelli & Julesz 1978; Caelli et al. 1978; Julesz et al. 1978) several counterexamples were found. In these texture pairs with identical power spectra some local structures of 'quasi-collinearity', 'corner', 'closure' and 'granularity' yielded strong discrimination. These features can be regarded as the fundamental building blocks of form, that is, the essential nonlinearities of the preattentive perceptual system. Here, it will be shown that these counter-examples are not independent of each other, but can be described by two elementary units; bars (line segments) and their terminators. Furthermore, the preattentive texture perception system can count the number of terminators but ignores their positions."

Such texture pairs could not be discriminated from each other by the human visual system without scrutiny. Unfortunately, Markov processes are inherently one-dimensional while the general processes underlying visual texture discrimination are two-dimensional. Here three new methods are introduced that generate two-dimensional non-Markovian textures with different third-order but identical first- and second-order statistics. All three methods generate texture pairs that cannot be discriminated from each other. The lack of texture discrimination is the more astonishing since the individual elements that form the texture pair are clearly perceived as being very different. However, a counterexample was found that yields discrimination although the texture pair has approximately identical second-order statistics. This case can be explained by assuming that early feature extractors do some preprocessing. These new demonstrations give support to a model of texture discrimination in which the stimulus is first analyzed by local feature extractors that can detect only simple features such as dots and edges of given sizes and orientations. Then the outputs of these simple extractors are evaluated by a global processor that can compute only second- or first-order statistics (that is can compare at most two such outputs)."

Stochastic methods are developed for the generation of pairs of synthetic texture fields possessing multiple gray levels, significant spatial correlation, and joint moments or probability densities of controllable form. Results of several visual discrimination experiments with these computer generated texture fields are then presented. It is demonstrated, for the stochastic models investigated, that humans cannot effortlessly discriminate between pairs of spatially correlated texture fields with differing third-order probability densities when their lower order densities are pairwise equal. This is a further verification of Julesz's conjecture. Also, it is shown that human observers are sensitive to relatively small changes in the spatial autocorrelation function. Examples are presented of discriminable texture fields with identical means, variances, autocorrelation functions, and third-order nearest neighbor moments."

                "text": "In the central nervous system the visual pathway from retina to striate cortex provides an opportunity to observe and compare single unit responses at several distinct levels. Patterns of light stimuli most effective in influencing units at one level may no longer be the most effective at the next. From differences in responses at successive stages in the pathway one may hope to gain some understanding of the part each stage plays in visual perception. By shining small spots of light on the light-adapted cat retina Kuffler (1953) showed that ganglion cells have concentric receptive fields, with an 'on' centre and an 'off ' periphery, or vice versa. The 'on' and 'off' areas within a receptive field were found to be mutually antagonistic, and a spot restricted to the centre of the field was more effective than one covering the whole receptive field (Barlow, FitzHugh & Kuffler, 1957). In the freely moving lightadapted cat it was found that the great majority of cortical cells studied gave little or no response to light stimuli covering most of the animal's visual field, whereas small spots shone in a restricted retinal region often evoked brisk responses (Hubel, 1959). A moving spot of light often produced stronger responses than a stationary one, and sometimes a moving spot gave more activation for one direction than for the opposite. The present investigation, made in acute preparations, includes a study of receptive fields of cells in the cat's striate cortex. Receptive fields of the cells considered in this paper were divided into separate excitatory and inhibitory ('on' and 'off') areas. In this respect they resembled retinal ganglion-cell receptive fields. However, the shape and arrangement of excitatory and inhibitory areas differed strikingly from the concentric pattern found in retinal ganglion cells. An attempt was made to correlate responses to moving stimuli"

                "text": "THE DISCHARGES carried in the optic nerve fibers contain all the information which the central nervous system receives from the retina. A correct interpretation of discharge patterns therefore constitutes an important step in the analysis of visual events. Further, investigations of nervous activity arising in the eye reveal many aspects of the functional organization of the neural elements within the retina itself. Following studies of discharges in the optic nerve of the eel\u2019s eye by Adrian and Matthews (2,3), Hartline and his colleagues described the discharge pattern in the eye of the Limulus in a series of important and lucid papers (for a summary see 20). In the Limulus the relationship between the stimulus to the primary receptor cell and the nerve discharges proved relatively simple, apparently because the connection between sense cell and nerve fiber was a direct one. Thus, when stimulation is confined to one receptor the discharge in a single Limulus nerve fiber will provide a good indication of excitatory events which take place as a result of photochemical processes. Discharges last for the duration of illumination and their frequency is a measure of stimulus strength. Lately, however, it was shown by Hartline et al. (22) that inhibitory interactions may be revealed when several receptors are excited. On the whole, the Limulus preparation shows many features which are similar to other simple sense organs, for instance, stretch receptors. In the latter, however, instead of photochemical events, stretch-deformation acts as the adequate stimulus on sensory terminals and is translated into a characteristic discharge pattern. The discharge from the cold-blooded vertebrate retina (mainly frogs) proved much more complex. Hartline found three main types when recording from single optic nerve fibers: (i) \u201con\u201d discharges, similar to those in the Limulus, firing for the duration of the light stimulus, (ii) \u201coff\u201d discharges appearing when a light stimulus was withdrawn, and (iii) \u2018con-off\u201d discharges, a combination of the former two, with activity confined mainly to onset and cessation of illumination. The mammalian discharge patterns were studied in a number of species by Granit and his co-workers in the course of their extensive work on the physiology of the visual system (summaries in 13, 15). On the whole, they did not observe any fundamental differences between frog and mammalian discharge types (see later)."
