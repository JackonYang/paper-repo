The limits of applicability of the algorithms are also traced by making the optical degradations more and more severe until the algorithms no longer succeed in their task.

Our approach is sequential testing which is coarse-to-fine in both in the exploration of poses and the representation of objects. All the tests are binary and indicate the presence or absence of loose spatial arrangements of oriented edge fragments. Starting from training examples, we recursively find larger and larger arrangements which are \u201cdecomposable,\u201d which implies the probability of an arrangement appearing on an object decays slowly with its size. Detection means finding a sufficient number of arrangements of each size along a decreasing sequence of pose cells. At the beginning, the tests are simple and universal, accommodating many poses simultaneously, but the false alarm rate is relatively high. Eventually, the tests are more discriminating, but also more complex and dedicated to specific poses. As a result, the spatial distribution of processing is highly skewed and detection is rapid, but at the expense of (isolated) false alarms which, presumably, could be eliminated with localized, more intensive, processing."

Our approach is related to recent work in active vision on \"where to look next\" and motivated by the \"divide-and-conquer\" strategy of parlour games. We choose \"tests\" (matched filters for short road segments) one at a time in order to remove as much uncertainty as possible about the \"true hypothesis\" (road position) given the results of the previous tests. The tests are chosen online based on a statistical model for the joint distribution of tests and hypotheses. The problem of minimizing uncertainty (measured by entropy) is formulated in simple and explicit analytical terms. At each iteration new image data are examined and a new entropy minimization problem is solved (exactly), resulting in a new image location to inspect, and so forth. We report experiments using panchromatic SPOT satellite imagery with a ground resolution of ten meters."

The algorithm utilizes the soft assign for the correspondence and the thin-plate spline for the non-rigid mapping. Embedded within a deterministic annealing framework, the algorithm can automatically reject a fraction of the points as outliers. Experiments on both 2D synthetic point-sets with varying degrees of deformation, noise and outliers, and on real 3D sulcal point-sets (extracted from brain MRI) demonstrate the robustness of the algorithm."

We demonstrate that there is a phase transition at a critical value of the order parameter; below this phase transition, it is impossible to detect the road by any algorithm. We derive closely related order parameters which determine the time and memory complexity of search and the accuracy of the solution using the n* search strategy. Our approach can be applied to other vision problems, and we briefly summarize the results when the model uses the \"wrong prior\".

                "text": "Many vision problems involve the detection of the boundary of an object, like a hand, or the tracking of a one-dimensional structure, such as a road in an aerial photograph. These problems can be formulated in terms of Bayesian probability theory and hence expressed as optimization problems on trees or graphs. The twenty questions, or minimum entropy, algorithm has recently been developed by Geman and Jedynak (1994) as a highly effective, and intuitive, tree search algorithm for road tracking. In this paper we analyse this algorithm to understand how it compares to existing algorithms used for vision, and related, optimization problems. First we show that it is a special case of the focus of attention planning strategy used on causal graphs, or Bayes nets, [18]. We then show its relations to standard methods, already successfully applied to vision optimization problems, such as dynamic programming, decision trees, the A* algorithm used in artificial intelligence [22] and the, closely related, Dijkstra algorithm of computer science [4]. These comparisons show that twenty questions is often equivalent to an algorithm, which we call A+, which tries to explore the most probable paths first. We show that A+ is a greedy, and suboptimal, variant of A*. This suggests that A+ and twenty questions will be faster than A* and Dijkstra for certain problems but they may occasionally converge to the wrong answer. However, the fact that A+ and twenty questions maintain a probabilistic estimate of how well they are doing may give warning of faulty convergence and also allow intelligent pruning to speed up the search."

This work is distinguished by three key contributions. The first is the introduction of a new image representation called the \"integral image\" which allows the features used by our detector to be computed very quickly. The second is a learning algorithm, based on AdaBoost, which selects a small number of critical visual features from a larger set and yields extremely efficient classifiers. The third contribution is a method for combining increasingly more complex classifiers in a \"cascade\" which allows background regions of the image to be quickly discarded while spending more computation on promising object-like regions. The cascade can be viewed as an object specific focus-of-attention mechanism which unlike previous approaches provides statistical guarantees that discarded regions are unlikely to contain the object of interest. In the domain of face detection the system yields detection rates comparable to the best previous systems. Used in real-time applications, the detector runs at 15 frames per second without resorting to image differencing or skin color detection."

Our work builds on recent results by Yedidia, Freeman, and Weiss (2000), who showed that the fixed points of BP and GBP algorithms correspond to extrema of the Bethe and Kikuchi free energies, respectively. We obtain two algorithms by applying CCCP to the Bethe and Kikuchi free energies, respectively (CCCP is a procedure, introduced here, for obtaining discrete iterative algorithms by decomposing a cost function into a concave and a convex part). We implement our CCCP algorithms on two- and three-dimensional spin glasses and compare their results to BP and GBP. Our simulations show that the CCCP algorithms are stable and converge very quickly (the speed of CCCP is similar to that of BP and GBP). Unlike CCCP, BP will often not converge for these problems (GBP usually, but not always, converges). The results found by CCCP applied to the Bethe or Kikuchi free energies are equivalent, or slightly better than, those found by BP or GBP, respectively (when BP and GBP converge). Note that for these, and other problems, BP and GBP give very accurate results (see Yedidia et al., 2000), and failure to converge is their major error mode. Finally, we point out that our algorithms have a large range of inference and learning applications."

The most dramatic instance of this is the near Shannon-limit performance of \"Turbo Codes\" -- codes whose decoding algorithm is equivalent to loopy belief propagation in a chain-structured Bayesian network. \n \nIn this paper we ask: is there something special about the error-correcting code context, or does loopy propagation work as an approximate inference scheme in a more general setting? We compare the marginals computed using loopy propagation to the exact ones in four Bayesian network architectures, including two real-world networks: ALARM and QMR. We find that the loopy beliefs often converge and when they do, they give a good approximation to the correct marginals. However, on the QMR network, the loopy beliefs oscillated and had no obvious relationship to the correct posteriors. We present some initial investigations into the cause of these oscillations, and show that some simple methods of preventing them lead to the wrong results."

Our experiments show that our system is very successful in analyzing cluttered scenes. The system architecture goes beyond classical neural networks by making extensive use of flexible links between units, as proposed in the dynamic link architecture.

Firstly, it realizes traditional \"hypothesis-and-test\" methods through well-balanced Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) dynamics, thus it achieves robust and globally optimal solutions. Secondly, it utilizes data-driven (bottom-up) methods in computer vision, such as Hough transform and data clustering, to design effective transition probabilities for Markov chain dynamics. This drastically improves the effectiveness of traditional MCMC algorithms in terms of two standard metrics: \"burn-in\" period and \"mixing\" rate. The article proceeds in three steps. Firstly, we analyze the structures of the solution space /spl Omega/ for object recognition. /spl Omega/ is decomposed into a large number of subspaces of varying dimensions in a hierarchy. Secondly, we use data-driven techniques to compute importance proposal probabilities in these spaces, each expressed in a non-parametric form using weighted samples or particles. Thirdly, Markov chains are designed to travel in such heterogeneous structured solution space, with both jump and diffusion dynamics. We use possibly the simplest objects-the \"/spl Psi/-world\" as an example to illustrate the concepts, and we briefly present results on an application of traffic sign detection."

Beliefpropagation(BP)wasonlysupposedtowork for tree-likenetworksbutworks surprisinglywell in many applicationsinvolving networkswith loops,includingturbo codes.However, therehasbeenlittle understandingof thealgorithmor thenatureof thesolutionsit findsfor generalgraphs. We show that BP canonly converge to a stationarypoint of an approximatefree energy, known astheBethefreeenergy in statisticalphysics.This resultcharacterizes BP fixed-pointsand makes connectionswith variationalapproachesto approximate inference. More importantly, our analysislets us build on the progressmadein statistical physicssinceBethe\u2019 s approximationwasintroducedin 1935.Kikuchi andothershave shown how to constructmoreaccuratefree energy approximations,of which Bethe\u2019 s approximationis the simplest. Exploiting the insightsfrom our analysis,we derive generalizedbeliefpropagation(GBP)versionsof theseKikuchi approximations. These new messagepassingalgorithmscanbesignificantlymoreaccuratethanordinaryBP, at anadjustableincreasein complexity. We illustratesucha new GBPalgorithmon a grid Markov network andshow thatit givesmuchmoreaccuratemarginalprobabilities thanthosefoundusingordinaryBP.

Local edge cues, implemented by filters, provide information about the likely positions of edges which can be used as input to higher-level models. Different edge cues can be evaluated by the statistical effectiveness of their corresponding filters evaluated on a dataset of 100 presegmented images. We use information theoretic measures to determine the effectiveness of a variety of different edge detectors working at multiple scales on black and white and color images. Our results give quantitative measures for the advantages of multi-level processing, for the use of chromaticity in addition to greyscale, and for the relative effectiveness of different detectors."

The author provides a coherent explication of probability as a language for reasoning with partial belief and offers a unifying perspective on other AI approaches to uncertainty, such as the Dempster-Shafer formalism, truth maintenance systems, and nonmonotonic logic. The author distinguishes syntactic and semantic approaches to uncertainty\u0097and offers techniques, based on belief networks, that provide a mechanism for making semantics-based systems operational. Specifically, network-propagation techniques serve as a mechanism for combining the theoretical coherence of probability theory with modern demands of reasoning-systems technology: modular declarative inputs, conceptually meaningful inferences, and parallel distributed computation. Application areas include diagnosis, forecasting, image interpretation, multi-sensor fusion, decision support systems, plan recognition, planning, speech recognition\u0097in short, almost every task requiring that conclusions be drawn from uncertain clues and incomplete information. \nProbabilistic Reasoning in Intelligent Systems will be of special interest to scholars and researchers in AI, decision theory, statistics, logic, philosophy, cognitive psychology, and the management sciences. Professionals in the areas of knowledge-based systems, operations research, engineering, and statistics will find theoretical and computational tools of immediate practical use. The book can also be used as an excellent text for graduate-level courses in AI, operations research, or applied probability."
