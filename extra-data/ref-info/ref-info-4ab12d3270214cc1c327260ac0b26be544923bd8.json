However, there usually is time to train the system, which we would show to be very useful. Assuming that several registered images of the target object are available, we developed a keypoint-based approach that is effective in this context by formulating wide-baseline matching of keypoints extracted from the input images to those found in the model images as a classification problem. This shifts much of the computational burden to a training phase, without sacrificing recognition performance. As a result, the resulting algorithm is robust, accurate, and fast-enough for frame-rate performance. This reduction in runtime computational complexity is our first contribution. Our second contribution is to show that, in this context, a simple and fast keypoint detector suffices to support detection and tracking even under large perspective and scale variations. While earlier methods require a detector that can be expected to produce very repeatable results, in general, which usually is very time-consuming, we simply find the most repeatable object keypoints for the specific target object during the training phase. We have incorporated these ideas into a real-time system that detects planar, nonplanar, and deformable objects. It then estimates the pose of the rigid ones and the deformations of the others"

Specifically, our goal is to devise a statistical model that simultaneously answers two questions: 1) is there a human in the image? and, if so, 2) what is a low-dimensional representation of her pose? We investigate models that can be learned in an unsupervised manner on unlabeled images of human poses, and provide information that can be used to match the pose of a new image to the ones present in the training set. Starting from a set of descriptors recently proposed for human detection, we apply the Latent Dirichlet Allocation framework to model the statistics of these features, and use the resulting model to answer the above questions. We show how our model can efficiently describe the space of images of humans with their pose, by providing an effective representation of poses for tasks such as classification and matching, while performing remarkably well in human/non human decision problems, thus enabling its use for human detection. We validate the model with extensive quantitative experiments and comparisons with other approaches on human detection and pose matching."

We exploit both appearance and motion information by defining suitable features of an image and its temporal neighbors, and learning a regression map to the parameters of a model of the human body using boosting techniques. Our algorithm can be viewed as a fast initialization step for human body trackers, or as a tracker itself. We extend gradient boosting techniques to learn a multi-dimensional map from (rotated and scaled) Haar features to the entire set of joint angles representing the full body pose. We test our approach by learning a map from image patches to body joint angles from synchronized video and motion capture walking data. We show how our technique enables learning an efficient real-time pose estimator, validated on publicly available datasets."

Unlike other related state of the art techniques which focus on either segmentation or pose estimation individually, our approach tackles these two tasks together. Normally, when optimizing for pose, it is traditional to use some fixed set of features, e.g. edges or chamfer maps. In contrast, our novel approach consists of optimizing a cost function based on a Markov Random Field (MRF). This has the advantage that we can use all the information in the image: edges, background and foreground appearances, as well as the prior information on the shape and pose of the subject and combine them in a Bayesian framework. Previously, optimizing such a cost function would have been computationally infeasible. However, our recent research in dynamic graph cuts allows this to be done much more efficiently than before. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on challenging motion sequences. Note that although we target the human pose inference problem in the paper, our method is completely generic and can be used to segment and infer the pose of any specified rigid, deformable or articulated object."

These features are focused on local regions of the image and are built from low-level gradient information that discriminates between pedestrian and non-pedestrian classes. Using Ad-aBoost, these shapelet features are created as a combination of oriented gradient responses. To train the final classifier, we use AdaBoost for a second time to select a subset of our learned shapelets. By first focusing locally on smaller feature sets, our algorithm attempts to harvest more useful information than by examining all the low-level features together. We present quantitative results demonstrating the effectiveness of our algorithm. In particular, we obtain an error rate 14 percentage points lower (at 10-6 FPPW) than the previous state of the art detector of Dalal and Triggs on the INRIA dataset."

Our approach requires neither an explicit body model nor prior labeling of body parts in the image. Instead, it recovers pose by direct nonlinear regression against shape descriptor vectors extracted automatically from image silhouettes. For robustness against local silhouette segmentation errors, silhouette shape is encoded by histogram-of-shape-contexts descriptors. We evaluate several different regression methods: ridge regression, relevance vector machine (RVM) regression, and support vector machine (SVM) regression over both linear and kernel bases. The RVMs provide much sparser regressors without compromising performance, and kernel bases give a small but worthwhile improvement in performance. The loss of depth and limb labeling information often makes the recovery of 3D pose from single silhouettes ambiguous. To handle this, the method is embedded in a novel regressive tracking framework, using dynamics from the previous state estimate together with a learned regression value to disambiguate the pose. We show that the resulting system tracks long sequences stably. For realism and good generalization over a wide range of viewpoints, we train the regressors on images resynthesized from real human motion capture data. The method is demonstrated for several representations of full body pose, both quantitatively on independent but similar test data and qualitatively on real image sequences. Mean angular errors of 4-6/spl deg/ are obtained for a variety of walking motions."

In order to address the problem of pose ambiguity, a one-to-many mapping from image features to state space is learned using a set of relevance vector machines, extended to handle multivariate outputs. The image features are Hausdorff matching scores obtained by matching different shape templates to the image, where the multivariate relevance vector machines (MVRVM) select a sparse set of these templates. We demonstrate that these Hausdorff features reduce the estimation error in clutter compared to shape-context histograms. The method is applied to the pose estimation problem from a single input frame, and is embedded within a probabilistic tracking framework to include temporal information. We apply the algorithm to 3D hand tracking and full human body tracking."

To this end we combine three ingredients: (i) shape and appearance representations that support spatial pyramid matching over a region of interest. This generalizes the representation of Lazebnik et al., (2006) from an image to a region of interest (ROI), and from appearance (visual words) alone to appearance and local shape (edge distributions); (ii) automatic selection of the regions of interest in training. This provides a method of inhibiting background clutter and adding invariance to the object instance 's position; and (iii) the use of random forests (and random ferns) as a multi-way classifier. The advantage of such classifiers (over multi-way SVM for example) is the ease of training and testing. Results are reported for classification of the Caltech-101 and Caltech-256 data sets. We compare the performance of the random forest/ferns classifier with a benchmark multi-way SVM classifier. It is shown that selecting the ROI adds about 5% to the performance and, together with the other improvements, the result is about a 10% improvement over the state of the art for Caltech-256."

Probabilistic mechanisms are attractive because they handle fusion of information, especially temporal fusion, in a principled manner. Exemplars are selected representatives of raw training data, used here to represent probabilistic mixture distributions of object configurations. Their use avoids tedious hand-construction of object models, and problems with changes of topology.Using exemplars in place of a parameterized model poses several challenges, addressed here with what we call the \u201cMetric Mixture\u201d (M2) approach, which has a number of attractions. Principally, it provides alternatives to standard learning algorithms by allowing the use of metrics that are not embedded in a vector space. Secondly, it uses a noise model that is learned from training data. Lastly, it eliminates any need for an assumption of probabilistic pixelwise independence.Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the M2 model in two domains: tracking walking people using \u201cchamfer\u201d distances on binary edge images, and tracking mouth movements by means of a shuffle distance."

No feature correspondence is needed among exemplars, just a suitable pairwise similarity measure. The approach uses a template tree to efficiently represent and match the variety of shape exemplars. The tree is generated offline by a bottom-up clustering approach using stochastic optimization. Online matching involves a simultaneous coarse-to-fine approach over the template tree and over the transformation parameters. The main contribution of this paper is a Bayesian model to estimate the a posteriori probability of the object class, after a certain match at a node of the tree. This model takes into account object scale and saliency and allows for a principled setting of the matching thresholds such that unpromising paths in the tree traversal process are eliminated early on. The proposed approach was tested in a variety of application domains. Here, results are presented on one of the more challenging domains: real-time pedestrian detection from a moving vehicle. A significant speed-up is obtained when comparing the proposed probabilistic matching approach with a manually tuned nonprobabilistic variant, both utilizing the same template tree structure."

We use a detection style algorithm that scans a detector over two consecutive frames of a video sequence. The detector is trained (using AdaBoost) to take advantage of both motion and appearance information to detect a walking person. Past approaches have built detectors based on motion information or detectors based on appearance information, but ours is the first to combine both sources of information in a single detector. The implementation described runs at about 4 frames/second, detects pedestrians at very small scales (as small as 20 \u00d7 15 pixels), and has a very low false positive rate.Our approach builds on the detection work of Viola and Jones. Novel contributions of this paper include: (i) development of a representation of image motion which is extremely efficient, and (ii) implementation of a state of the art pedestrian detection system which operates on low resolution images under difficult conditions (such as rain and snow)."

The complexity induced by the high degrees of freedom of the articulated hand challenges many visual tracking techniques. For example, the particle filtering technique is plagued by the demanding requirement of a huge number of particles and the phenomenon of particle degeneracy. This paper presents a novel approach to tracking the articulated hand in video by learning and integrating natural hand motion priors. To cope with the finger articulation, this paper proposes a powerful sequential Monte Carlo tracking algorithm based on importance sampling techniques, where the importance function is based on an initial manifold model of the articulation configuration space learned from motion-captured data. In addition, this paper presents a divide-and-conquer strategy that decouples the hand poses and finger articulations and integrates them in an iterative framework to reduce the complexity of the problem. Our experiments show that this approach is effective and efficient for tracking the articulated hand. This approach can be extended to track other articulated targets."

                "text": "We explore a new approach to shape recognition based on a virtually infinite family of binary features (queries) of the image data, designed to accommodate prior information about shape invariance and regularity. Each query corresponds to a spatial arrangement of several local topographic codes (or tags), which are in themselves too primitive and common to be informative about shape. All the discriminating power derives from relative angles and distances among the tags. The important attributes of the queries are a natural partial ordering corresponding to increasing structure and complexity; semi-invariance, meaning that most shapes of a given class will answer the same way to two queries that are successive in the ordering; and stability, since the queries are not based on distinguished points and substructures. No classifier based on the full feature set can be evaluated, and it is impossible to determine a priori which arrangements are informative. Our approach is to select informative features and build tree classifiers at the same time by inductive learning. In effect, each tree provides an approximation to the full posterior where the features chosen depend on the branch that is traversed. Due to the number and nature of the queries, standard decision tree construction based on a fixed-length feature vector is not feasible. Instead we entertain only a small random sample of queries at each node, constrain their complexity to increase with tree depth, and grow multiple trees. The terminal nodes are labeled by estimates of the corresponding posterior distribution over shape classes. An image is classified by sending it down every tree and aggregating the resulting distributions. The method is applied to classifying handwritten digits and synthetic linear and nonlinear deformations of three hundred symbols. State-of-the-art error rates are achieved on the National Institute of Standards and Technology database of digits. The principal goal of the experiments on symbols is to analyze invariance, generalization error and related issues, and a comparison with artificial neural networks methods is presented in this context.

                "text": "While research on articulated human motion and pose estimation has progressed rapidly in the last few years, there has been no systematic quantitative evaluation of competing methods to establish the current state of the art. Current algorithms make many different choices about how to model the human body, how to exploit image evidence and how to approach the inference problem. We argue that there is a need for common datasets that allow fair comparison between different methods and their design choices. Until recently gathering ground-truth data for evaluation of results (especially in 3D) was challenging. In this report we present a novel dataset obtained using a unique setup for capturing synchronized video and ground-truth 3D motion. Data was captured simultaneously using a calibrated marker-based motion capture system and multiple high-speed video capture systems. The video and motion capture streams were synchronized in software using a direct optimization method. The resulting HumanEvaI dataset contains multiple subjects performing a set of predefined actions with a number of repetitions. On the order of 50,000 frames of synchronized motion capture and video was collected at 60 Hz with an additional 37,000 frames of pure motion capture data. The data is partitioned into training, validation, and testing sub-sets. A standard set of error metrics is defined that can be used for evaluation of both 2D and 3D pose estimation and tracking algorithms. Support software and an on-line evaluation system for quantifying results using the test data is being made available to the community. This report provides an overview of the dataset and evaluation metrics and provides pointers into the dataset for additional details. It is our hope that HumanEva-I will become a standard dataset for the evaluation of articulated human motion and pose estimation."

We demonstrate our approach in the case of people walking against cluttered backgrounds and filmed using a moving camera, which precludes the use of simple background subtraction techniques. In this case, the easy-to-detect posture is the one that occurs at the end of each step when people have their legs furthest apart."

For complex and high-dimensional problems such as pose estimation, the number of required examples and the computational complexity rapidly become prohibitively high. We introduce a new algorithm that learns a set of hashing functions that efficiently index examples relevant to a particular estimation task. Our algorithm extends locality-sensitive hashing, a recently developed method to find approximate neighbors in time sublinear in the number of examples. This method depends critically on the choice of hash functions that are optimally relevant to a particular estimation problem. Experiments demonstrate that the resulting algorithm, which we call parameter-sensitive hashing, can rapidly and accurately estimate the articulated pose of human figures from a large database of example images."

We present a new generative model to represent shape deformations according to view and body configuration changes on a two dimensional manifold. We model the two continuous states by a product space (different configurations times different views) embedded on a conceptual two dimensional torus manifold. We learn a nonlinear mapping between torus manifold embedding and visual input (silhouettes) using empirical kernel mapping. Since every view and body pose has a corresponding embedding point on the torus manifold, inferring view and body pose from a given image becomes estimating the embedding point from a given input. As the shape varies in different people even in the same view and body pose, we extend our model to be adaptive to different people by decomposing person dependent style factors. Experimental results with real data as well as synthetic data show simultaneous estimation of view and body configuration from given silhouettes from unknown people"

The features used in our system are HoGs of variable-size blocks that capture salient features of humans automatically. Using AdaBoost for feature selection, we identify the appropriate set of blocks, from a large set of possible blocks. In our system, we use the integral image representation and a rejection cascade which significantly speed up the computation. For a 320 \u00d7 280 image, the system can process 5 to 30 frames per second depending on the density in which we scan the image, while maintaining an accuracy level similar to existing methods."

The basic approach is to store a number of exemplar 2D views of the human body in a variety of different configurations and viewpoints with respect to the camera. On each of these stored views, the locations of the body joints (left elbow, right knee, etc.) are manually marked and labeled for future use. The input image is then matched to each stored view, using the technique of shape context matching in conjunction with a kinematic chain-based deformation model. Assuming that there is a stored view sufficiently similar in configuration and pose, the correspondence process would succeed. The locations of the body joints are then transferred from the exemplar view to the test shape. Given the 2D joint locations, the 3D body configuration and pose are then estimated using an existing algorithm. We can apply this technique to video by treating each frame independently - tracking just becomes repeated recognition. We present results on a variety of data sets"

We propose a tree-based representation of the distribution, where the leaves define a partition of the state space with piecewise constant density. The advantage of this representation is that regions with low probability mass can be rapidly discarded in a hierarchical search, and the distribution can be approximated to arbitrary precision. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the technique by using it for tracking 3D articulated and nonrigid motion in front of cluttered background. More specifically, we are interested in estimating the joint angles, position and orientation of a 3D hand model in order to drive an avatar."

The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund & R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference, ***, 148\u2013156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting.
