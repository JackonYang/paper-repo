The key computational unit of a deep network is a linear projection followed by a point-wise non-linearity, which is typically a logistic function. In this work, we show that we can improve generalization and make training of deep networks faster and simpler by substituting the logistic units with rectified linear units. These units are linear when their input is positive and zero otherwise. In a supervised setting, we can successfully train very deep nets from random initialization on a large vocabulary speech recognition task achieving lower word error rates than using a logistic network with the same topology. Similarly in an unsupervised setting, we show how we can learn sparse features that can be useful for discriminative tasks. All our experiments are executed in a distributed environment using several hundred machines and several hundred hours of speech data."

Deep neural nets have also achieved excellent results on various computer vision tasks using a random \u201cdropout\u201d procedure that drastically improves generalization error by randomly omitting a fraction of the hidden units in all layers. Since dropout helps avoid over-fitting, it has also been successful on a small-scale phone recognition task using larger neural nets. However, training deep neural net acoustic models for large vocabulary speech recognition takes a very long time and dropout is likely to only increase training time. Neural networks with rectified linear unit (ReLU) non-linearities have been highly successful for computer vision tasks and proved faster to train than standard sigmoid units, sometimes also improving discriminative performance. In this work, we show on a 50-hour English Broadcast News task that modified deep neural networks using ReLUs trained with dropout during frame level training provide an 4.2% relative improvement over a DNN trained with sigmoid units, and a 14.4% relative improvement over a strong GMM/HMM system. We were able to obtain our results with minimal human hyper-parameter tuning using publicly available Bayesian optimization code."

An alternati ve way to evaluate the fit is to use a feedforward neural network that takes several frames of coefficients a s input and produces posterior probabilities over HMM states as output. Deep neural networks with many hidden layers, that are trained using new methods have been shown to outperform Gaussian mixture models on a variety of speech rec ognition benchmarks, sometimes by a large margin.

In this paper, we argue that the improved accuracy achieved by the DNNs is the result of their ability to extract discriminative internal representations that are robust to the many sources of variability in speech signals. We show that these representations become increasingly insensitive to small perturbations in the input with increasing network depth, which leads to better speech recognition performance with deeper networks. We also show that DNNs cannot extrapolate to test samples that are substantially different from the training examples. If the training data are sufficiently representative, however, internal features learned by the DNN are relatively stable with respect to speaker differences, bandwidth differences, and environment distortion. This enables DNN-based recognizers to perform as well or better than state-of-the-art systems based on GMMs or shallow networks without the need for explicit model adaptation or feature normalization."

We describe a pre-trained deep neural network hidden Markov model (DNN-HMM) hybrid architecture that trains the DNN to produce a distribution over senones (tied triphone states) as its output. The deep belief network pre-training algorithm is a robust and often helpful way to initialize deep neural networks generatively that can aid in optimization and reduce generalization error. We illustrate the key components of our model, describe the procedure for applying CD-DNN-HMMs to LVSR, and analyze the effects of various modeling choices on performance. Experiments on a challenging business search dataset demonstrate that CD-DNN-HMMs can significantly outperform the conventional context-dependent Gaussian mixture model (GMM)-HMMs, with an absolute sentence accuracy improvement of 5.8% and 9.2% (or relative error reduction of 16.0% and 23.2%) over the CD-GMM-HMMs trained using the minimum phone error rate (MPE) and maximum-likelihood (ML) criteria, respectively."

We describe a distributed neural network training algorithm, based on Hessianfree optimization, that scales to deep networks and large data sets. For the sMBR criterion, this training algorithm is faster than stochastic gradient descent by a factor of 5.5 and yields a 4.4% relative improvement in word error rate on a 50-hour broadcast news task. Distributed Hessian-free sMBR training yields relative reductions in word error rate of 7\u201313% over cross-entropy training with stochastic gradient descent on two larger tasks: Switchboard and DARPA RATS noisy Levantine Arabic.

These results expose a trade-off between efficient learning by gradient descent and latching on information for long periods.

On the test data, we achieved top-1 and top-5 error rates of 37.5% and 17.0%, respectively, which is considerably better than the previous state-of-the-art. The neural network, which has 60 million parameters and 650,000 neurons, consists of five convolutional layers, some of which are followed by max-pooling layers, and three fully connected layers with a final 1000-way softmax. To make training faster, we used non-saturating neurons and a very efficient GPU implementation of the convolution operation. To reduce overfitting in the fully connected layers we employed a recently developed regularization method called \"dropout\" that proved to be very effective. We also entered a variant of this model in the ILSVRC-2012 competition and achieved a winning top-5 test error rate of 15.3%, compared to 26.2% achieved by the second-best entry."

                "text": "Sequence-discriminative training of deep neural networks (DNNs) is investigated on a standard 300 hour American En- glish conversational telephone speech task. Different sequence- discriminative criteria \u2014 maximum mutual information (MMI), minimum phone error (MPE), state-level minimum Bayes risk (sMBR), and boosted MMI \u2014 are compared. Two different heuristics are investigated to improve the performance of the DNNs trained using sequence-based criteria \u2014 lattices are re- generated after the first iteration of training; and, for MMI and BMMI, the frames where the numerator and denominator hy- potheses are disjoint are removed from the gradient compu- tation. Starting from a competitive DNN baseline trained us- ing cross-entropy, different sequence-discriminative criteria are shown to lower word error rates by 7-9% relative, on aver- age. Little difference is noticed between the different sequence- based criteria that are investigated. The experiments are done using the open-source Kaldi toolkit, which makes it possible for the wider community to reproduce these results.

In particular, sparse coding has emerged as a strong alternative to traditional VQ approaches and has been shown to achieve consistently higher performance on benchmark datasets. Both approaches can be split into a training phase, where the system learns a dictionary of basis functions, and an encoding phase, where the dictionary is used to extract features from new inputs. In this work, we investigate the reasons for the success of sparse coding over VQ by decoupling these phases, allowing us to separate out the contributions of training and encoding in a controlled way. Through extensive experiments on CIFAR, NORB and Caltech 101 datasets, we compare several training and encoding schemes, including sparse coding and a form of VQ with a soft threshold activation function. Our results show not only that we can use fast VQ algorithms for training, but that we can just as well use randomly chosen exemplars from the training set. Rather than spend resources on training, we find it is more important to choose a good encoder\u2014which can often be a simple feed forward non-linearity. Our results include state-of-the-art performance on both CIFAR and NORB."

However, the term `sparse' has been used in two different ways - firstly to describe codes in which few neurons are active at any time (`population sparseness'), and secondly to describe codes in which each neuron's lifetime response distribution has high kurtosis (`lifetime sparseness'). Although these ideas are related, they are not identical, and the most common measure of lifetime sparseness - the kurtosis of the lifetime response distributions of the neurons - provides no information about population sparseness. We have measured the population sparseness and lifetime kurtosis of several biologically inspired coding schemes. We used three measures of population sparseness (population kurtosis, Treves-Rolls sparseness and `activity sparseness'), and found them to be in close agreement with one another. However, we also measured the lifetime kurtosis of the cells in each code. We found that lifetime kurtosis is uncorrelated with population sparseness for the codes we used. Lifetime kurtosis is not, therefore, a useful measure of the population sparseness of a code. Moreover, the Gabor-like codes, which are often assumed to have high population sparseness (since they have high lifetime kurtosis), actually turned out to have rather low population sparseness. Surprisingly, principal components filters produced the codes with the highest population sparseness."

They connect the statistical structure of natural images with the statistical structure of the coding used in V1. The O&F model has created particular interest because the basis functions it produces resemble the receptive fields of simple cells. We evaluate these models in terms of their sparseness and dispersal, both of which have been suggested as desirable for efficient visual coding. However, both attributes have been defined ambiguously in the literature, and we have been obliged to formulate specific definitions in order to allow any comparison between models at all. We find that both attributes are strongly affected by any preprocessing (eg spectral pseudo-whitening or a logarithmic transformation) which is often applied to images before they are analysed by PCA or the O&F model. We also find that measures of sparseness are affected by the size of the filters\u2014PCA filters with small receptive fields appear sparser than PCA filters with larger spatial extent. Finally, normalisation of the means and variances of filters influences measures of dispersal. It is necessary to control for all of these factors before making any comparisons between different models. Having taken these factors into account, we find that the code produced by the O&F model is somewhat sparser than the code produced by PCA. However, the difference is rather smaller than might have been expected, and a measure of dispersal is required to distinguish clearly between the two models."
