Significant differences in the density, orientation, size, or contrast of line segments or other small features in an image have been shown to cause immediate perception of texture boundaries. However, the psychological theories, which are based on the perception of synthetic images composed of lines and symbols, neglect two important issues. First, how can textons be computed from grey-level images of natural scenes? And second, how, exactly, can texture boundaries be found? Our analysis of these two issues has led to an algorithm that is fully implemented and which successfully detects boundaries in natural images5. We propose that blobs computed by a centre-surround operator are useful as texture elements, and that a simple non-parametric statistic can be used to compare local distributions of blob attributes to locate texture boundaries. Although designed for natural images, our computation agrees with some psycho-physical findings, in particular, those of Adelson and Bergen (described in the preceding article6), which cast doubt on the hypothesis that line segment crossings or termination points are textons."

If the stimuli are presented very briefly, eye movements are not possible. The time during which the after-image of the stimulus is available for inspection is terminated by presentation of a masking pattern. We show here that in these conditions a small pattern is easily detected against a background made up of many others, only if this target pattern differs from the background patterns in certain local features. In this case the detectability of the target is almost independent of the number of background elements, suggesting that a parallel process is operating. Detection of patterns not differing from their backgrounds in such features requires focal attention which is a serial process. The aperture of this attention is scaled to minimize the number of shifts of attention required."
