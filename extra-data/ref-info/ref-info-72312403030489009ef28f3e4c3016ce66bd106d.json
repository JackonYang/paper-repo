The optimization consists of minimizing the expected risk for a weight function which is preassigned to measure the consequences of system decisions As an alternative minimization of the error rate for a given rejection rate is used as the critenon. The optimum recogition is thus obtained. The optimum system consists of a conditional-probability densisities computer; character channels, one for each character; a rejection channel; and a comparison network. Its precise structure and and ultimate performance depend essentially upon the signals and noise structure. Explicit examples for an additive Gaussian noise and a ``cosine'' noise are presented. Finally, an error-free recognition system and a possible criterion to measure the character style and deteriortation are presented."

In statistical recognition systems, pattern information is stored in the machine in the form of pattern characteristics with statistics relating the characteristics to the patterns. If the number of characteristics a system can process is limited, and if the system designer, while able to conceive of a large number of relevant characteristics, does not know which are the most important, then an experimental selection of these characteristics is required. As tools, the designer may have at his disposal a large computer, a large sample of the patterns to be recognized, and a set of programs to measure the characteristics. Thus, he can compare certain statistics relating the patterns to the characteristics. The problem is: what statistics should he calculate in order to select the best characteristics? Assuming the characteristics to be independent in their effect on the decision, this paper examines the notion of a single number statistic for each characteristic which would have certain desirable properties related to the \"goodness\" of the characteristic. It is shown that, in general, no such statistic exists. However, a statistic is proposed which, while not having these properties in general, at least has them in a wide range of situations. An experimental study of the validity of this choice is reported together with the design of a letter recognition system. Using a sample of 15 complete 62 symbol alphabets, 13 characteristics were selected. The resulting system recognized correctly 81.9% of the letters presented to it."

In essence, this method involves maximizing the cross-correlation value between the unknown character and a set of average characters, there being one average character for each allowed character class. An average character is represented by a two-dimensional function. The value of this function at a point is the probability of occurrence of a mark at that point for the character class represented by the average character. Negative weights are given to areas of low probability in each average character to improve discriminability. The simulation results indicate that this method is applicable to the recognition of machine printing, and perhaps to the recognition of constrained hand printing.

The receptor makes certain measurements on the unknown pattern to be recognized; the categorizer determines from these measurements the particular allowable pattern class to which the unknown pattern belongs. This paper is concerned with the study of a particular class of categorizers, the linear decision function. The optimum linear decision function is the best linear approximation to the optimum decision function in the following sense: 1) \"Optimum\" is taken to mean minimum loss (which includes minimum error systems). 2) \"Linear\" is taken to mean that each pair of pattern classes is separated by one and only one hyperplane in the measurement space. This class of categorizers is of practical interest for two reasons: 1) It can be empirically designed without making any assumptions whatsoever about either the distribution of the receptor measurements or the a priori probabilities of occurrence of the pattern classes, providing an appropriate pattern source is available. 2) Its implementation is quite simple and inexpensive. Various properties of linear decision functions are discussed. One such property is that a linear decision function is guaranteed to perform at least as well as a minimum distance categorizer. Procedures are then developed for the estimation (or design) of the optimum linear decision function based upon an appropriate sampling from the pattern classes to be categorized."

A computer can do, in a sense, only what it is told to do. But even when we do not know how to solve a certain problem, we may program a machine (computer) to Search through some large space of solution attempts. Unfortunately, this usually leads to an enormously inefficient process. With Pattern-Recognition techniques, efficiency can often be improved, by restricting the application of the machine's methods to appropriate problems. Pattern-Recognition, together with Learning, can be used to exploit generalizations based on accumulated experience, further reducing search. By analyzing the situation, using Planning methods, we may obtain a fundamental improvement by replacing the given search with a much smaller, more appropriate exploration. To manage broad classes of problems, machines will need to construct models of their environments, using some scheme for Induction. Wherever appropriate, the discussion is supported by extensive citation of the literature and by descriptions of a few of the most successful heuristic (problem-solving) programs constructed to date."

We have divided this area into categories and cross-indexed the references accordingly. Large bibliographies, without some classification facility, are next to useless. This particular field is still young, but there are already many instances in which workers have wasted much time in rediscovering (for better for for worse) schemes already reported. In the last year or two this problem has become worse, and in such a situation just about any information is better than none."
