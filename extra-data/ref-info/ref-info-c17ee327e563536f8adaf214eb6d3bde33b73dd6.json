Examples of the content we use include color, texture, and shape of image objects and regions. Potential applications include medical (`Give me other images that contain a tumor with a texture like this one'), photo-journalism (`Give me images that have blue at the top and red at the bottom'), and many others in art, fashion, cataloging, retailing, and industry. Key issues include derivation and computation of attributes of images and objects that provide useful query functionality, retrieval methods based on similarity as opposed to exact match, query by image example or user drawn image, the user interfaces, query refinement and navigation, high dimensional database indexing, and automatic and semi-automatic database population. We currently have a prototype system written in X/Motif and C running on an RS/6000 that allows a variety of queries, and a test database of over 1000 images and 1000 objects populated from commercially available photo clip art images. In this paper we present the main algorithms for color texture, shape and sketch query that we use, show example query results, and discuss future directions."

How, then, can it be possible to build a tool for indexing into a large database of, say, thousands of images, which works effectively in `interactive time' on affordable hardware? One important optimization is to take advantage of interaction with the user to find out what types of variation are expected in the database, and to rely on the user to discriminate between similar-looking objects. Another is to create appropriate data structures off-line to speed on-line searches. We are building a tool, called FINDIT, for locating the image of an object from within a large number of images of scenes which may contain the object. The user outlines an object in an image that he wants to find in the database, and specifies the constraints on the transformations of the object that are expected to occur. The program acts as a filter to quickly reduce the possible number of candidates to a number small enough to be perused by the user. FINDIT chooses an appropriate search algorithm depending on the selection of constraints by the user."

Examples of the content we use include color, texture, and shape of image objects and regions. Potential applications include medical (\\Give me other images that contain a tumor with a texture like this one\"), photo-journalism (\\Give me images that have blue at the top and red at the bottom\"), and many others in art, fashion, cataloging, retailing, and industry. We describe a set of novel features and similarity measures allowing query by color, texture, and shape of image object. We demonstrate the e ectiveness of the QBIC system with normalized precision and recall experiments on test databases containing over 1000 images and 1000 objects populated from commercially available photo clip art images, and of images of airplane silhouettes. We also consider the e cient indexing of these features, speci cally addressing two problems: (a) for our feature vectors, the desired distance function is not Euclidean, and/or (b) the vectors have high dimensionality. We propose novel, general solutions to both problems by allowing some \\false alarms\" (\\false hits\", or \\false positives\") but no false dismissals. For the rst problem, we introduce a new theorem that makes indexing possible by bounding the non-Euclidean, full cross-term quadratic distance expression with a simple Euclidean distance. For the second, we illustrate how orthogonal transforms, such as the Karhunen Loeve transform, can help reduce the dimensionality, without introducing false dismissals. The resulting QBIC system o ers high quality of output, and signi cant speedup over straightforward indexing alternatives. The system is implemented in X/Motif and C running on an RS/6000.

These tools differ from those used in standard image databases in that they make direct use of the image content rather than relying on annotations. Direct search on image content is made possible by use of semantics-preserving image compression, which reduces images to a small set of perceptually-significant coefficients. We describe three Photobook tools in particular: one that allows search based on grey-level appearance, one that uses 2D shape, and a third that allows search based on textural properties."

In the index we store the cumulative color histograms. The L1-, L2-, L(infinity )-distance between two cumulative color histograms can be used to define a similarity measure of these two color distributions. We show that this method produces slightly better results than color histogram methods, but it is significantly more robust with respect to the quantization parameter of the histograms. The second technique is an example of a new approach to color indexing. Instead of storing the complete color distributions, the index contains only their dominant features. We implement this approach by storing the first three moments of each color channel of an image in the index, i.e., for a HSV image we store only 9 floating point numbers per image. The similarity function which is used for the retrieval is a weighted sum of the absolute differences between corresponding moments. Our tests clearly demonstrate that a retrieval based on this technique produces better results and runs faster than the histogram-based methods."

Digital's relational database software product DEC Rdb supports the storing and indexing of multimedia objects-text, still frame images, compound documents, audio, video, and any binary large object. After evaluating the existing DEC Rdb version 3.1 for its ability to insert, fetch, and process multimedia data, software designers decided to modify many parts of Rdb and to use write-once optical disks configured in standalone drive or jukebox configurations. Enhancements were made to the buffer manager and page allocation algorithms, thus reducing wasted disk space. Performance and capacity field tests indicate that DEC Rdb can sustain a 200-kilobyte-per-second SQL fetch throughput and a 57.7-kilobyteper-second SQL/Services fetch throughput, insert and fetch a 2-gigabyte object, and build a 50-gigabyte database."
