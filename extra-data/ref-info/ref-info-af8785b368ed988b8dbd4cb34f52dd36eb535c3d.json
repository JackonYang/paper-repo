Here, we concentrated on training of a committee of generalized, compact and powerful base DCNNs. A support vector machine (SVM) is used to combine the outputs of individual DCNNs. The main novelty of the present study is introduction of supervised layerwise training of DCNN architecture in document classification tasks for better initialization of weights of individual DCNNs. Each DCNN of the committee is trained for a specific part or the whole document. Also, here we used the principle of generalized stacking for combining the normalized outputs of all the members of the DCNN committee. The proposed document classification strategy has been tested on the well-known Tobacco3482 document image dataset. Results of our experimentations show that the proposed strategy involving a considerably smaller network architecture can produce comparable document classification accuracies in competition with the state-of-the-art architectures making it more suitable for use in comparatively low configuration mobile devices."

In object and scene analysis, deep neural nets are capable of learning a hierarchical chain of abstraction from pixel inputs to concise and descriptive representations. The current work explores this capacity in the realm of document analysis, and confirms that this representation strategy is superior to a variety of popular handcrafted alternatives. Extensive experiments show that (i) features extracted from CNNs are robust to compression, (ii) CNNs trained on non-document images transfer well to document analysis tasks, and (iii) enforcing region-specific feature-learning is unnecessary given sufficient training data. This work also makes available a new labelled subset of the IIT-CDIP collection, containing 400,000 document images across 16 categories."

Existing approaches, such as the DeepDoc-Classifier, apply standard Convolutional Network architectures with transfer learning from the object recognition domain. The contribution of the paper is threefold: First, it investigates recently introduced very deep neural network architectures (GoogLeNet, VGG, ResNet) using transfer learning (from real images). Second, it proposes transfer learning from a huge set of document images, i.e. 400; 000 documents. Third, it analyzes the impact of the amount of training data (document images) and other parameters to the classification abilities. We use two datasets, the Tobacco-3482 and the large-scale RVL-CDIP dataset. We achieve an accuracy of 91:13% for the Tobacco-3482 dataset while earlier approaches reach only 77:6%. Thus, a relative error reduction of more than 60% is achieved. For the large dataset RVL-CDIP, an accuracy of 90:97% is achieved, corresponding to a relative error reduction of 11:5%."

We question whether this is appropriate and conduct a large empirical study to find what aspects of CNNs most affect performance on document images. Among other results, we exceed the state-of-the-art on the RVL-CDIP dataset by using shear transform data augmentation and an architecture designed for a larger input image. Additionally, we analyze the learned features and find evidence that CNNs trained on RVL-CDIP learn region-specific layout features."

In production environments, it is crucial to perform accurate and (time-)efficient training. Existing deep learning approaches for classifying documents do not meet these requirements, as they require much time for training and fine-tuning the deep architectures. Motivated from Computer Vision, we propose a two-stage approach. The first stage trains a deep network that works as feature extractor and in the second stage, Extreme Learning Machines (ELMs) are used for classification. The proposed approach outperforms all previously reported structural and deep learning based methods with a final accuracy of 83.24% on Tobacco-3482 dataset, leading to a relative error reduction of 25% when compared to a previous Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based approach (DeepDocClassifier). More importantly, the training time of the ELM is only 1.176 seconds and the overall prediction time for 2,482 images is 3.066 seconds. As such, this novel approach makes deep learning-based document classification suitable for large-scale real-time applications."

Previous approaches rely on hand-crafted features for capturing structural information. In contrast, we propose to learn features from raw image pixels using CNN. The use of CNN is motivated by the the hierarchical nature of document layout. Equipped with rectified linear units and trained with dropout, our CNN performs well even when document layouts present large inner-class variations. Experiments on public challenging datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach."

On the test data, we achieved top-1 and top-5 error rates of 37.5% and 17.0%, respectively, which is considerably better than the previous state-of-the-art. The neural network, which has 60 million parameters and 650,000 neurons, consists of five convolutional layers, some of which are followed by max-pooling layers, and three fully connected layers with a final 1000-way softmax. To make training faster, we used non-saturating neurons and a very efficient GPU implementation of the convolution operation. To reduce overfitting in the fully connected layers we employed a recently developed regularization method called \"dropout\" that proved to be very effective. We also entered a variant of this model in the ILSVRC-2012 competition and achieved a winning top-5 test error rate of 15.3%, compared to 26.2% achieved by the second-best entry."

We propose a comprehensive experimental study that compares three types of visual document image representations: (1) traditional so-called shallow features, such as the RunLength and the Fisher-Vector descriptors, (2) deep features based on Convolutional Neural Networks, and (3) features extracted from hybrid architectures that take inspiration from the two previous ones. \nWe evaluate these features in several tasks (i.e. classification, clustering, and retrieval) and in different setups (e.g. domain transfer) using several public and in-house datasets. Our results show that deep features generally outperform other types of features when there is no domain shift and the new task is closely related to the one used to train the model. However, when a large domain or task shift is present, the Fisher-Vector shallow features generalize better and often obtain the best results."

Our main contribution is a thorough evaluation of networks of increasing depth using an architecture with very small (3x3) convolution filters, which shows that a significant improvement on the prior-art configurations can be achieved by pushing the depth to 16-19 weight layers. These findings were the basis of our ImageNet Challenge 2014 submission, where our team secured the first and the second places in the localisation and classification tracks respectively. We also show that our representations generalise well to other datasets, where they achieve state-of-the-art results. We have made our two best-performing ConvNet models publicly available to facilitate further research on the use of deep visual representations in computer vision."

Given an appropriate network architecture, gradient-based learning algorithms can be used to synthesize a complex decision surface that can classify high-dimensional patterns, such as handwritten characters, with minimal preprocessing. This paper reviews various methods applied to handwritten character recognition and compares them on a standard handwritten digit recognition task. Convolutional neural networks, which are specifically designed to deal with the variability of 2D shapes, are shown to outperform all other techniques. Real-life document recognition systems are composed of multiple modules including field extraction, segmentation recognition, and language modeling. A new learning paradigm, called graph transformer networks (GTN), allows such multimodule systems to be trained globally using gradient-based methods so as to minimize an overall performance measure. Two systems for online handwriting recognition are described. Experiments demonstrate the advantage of global training, and the flexibility of graph transformer networks. A graph transformer network for reading a bank cheque is also described. It uses convolutional neural network character recognizers combined with global training techniques to provide record accuracy on business and personal cheques. It is deployed commercially and reads several million cheques per day."

The main hallmark of this architecture is the improved utilization of the computing resources inside the network. By a carefully crafted design, we increased the depth and width of the network while keeping the computational budget constant. To optimize quality, the architectural decisions were based on the Hebbian principle and the intuition of multi-scale processing. One particular incarnation used in our submission for ILSVRC14 is called GoogLeNet, a 22 layers deep network, the quality of which is assessed in the context of classification and detection."

Since speech signals exhibit both of these properties, CNNs are a more effective model for speech compared to Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). In this paper, we explore applying CNNs to large vocabulary speech tasks. First, we determine the appropriate architecture to make CNNs effective compared to DNNs for LVCSR tasks. Specifically, we focus on how many convolutional layers are needed, what is the optimal number of hidden units, what is the best pooling strategy, and the best input feature type for CNNs. We then explore the behavior of neural network features extracted from CNNs on a variety of LVCSR tasks, comparing CNNs to DNNs and GMMs. We find that CNNs offer between a 13-30% relative improvement over GMMs, and a 4-12% relative improvement over DNNs, on a 400-hr Broadcast News and 300-hr Switchboard task."

The layout is described by means of a hierarchical description, the modified X-Y tree, that is derived from the classical X-Y tree segmentation algorithm taking into account cuts along lines in addition to cuts along white spaces between blocks. In order to reduce problems due to noise and the skew of the input image, the modified X-Y tree is built on top of regions extracted by a commercial OCR package. The tree is afterwards coded into a fixed-size representation that takes into account occurrences of tree patterns in the tree representing the page. Lastly, this feature vector is fed to an artificial neural network that is trained to classify document images. The system is applied to the classification of documents belonging to digital libraries. Examples of classes taken into account are \"title page\", \"index\" and \"regular page\". Many tests have been carried out on a data set of more than 600 pages from an online digital library. These tests allowed us to conclude that the use of modified X-Y trees is advantageous with respect to the classical X-Y decomposition for this classification task."

There is great diversity in document image classifiers: they differ in the problems they solve, in the use of training data to construct class models, and in the choice of document features and classification algorithms. We survey this diverse literature using three components: the problem statement, the classifier architecture, and performance evaluation. This brings to light important issues in designing a document classifier, including the definition of document classes, the choice of document features and feature representation, and the choice of classification algorithm and learning mechanism. We emphasize techniques that classify single-page typeset document images without using OCR results. Developing a general, adaptable, high-performance classifier is challenging due to the great variety of documents, the diverse criteria used to define document classes, and the ambiguity that arises due to ill-defined or fuzzy document classes."

In this paper, the problem is formulated in the framework of concept learning and each category corresponds to the set of image documents with similar physical structure. We propose a solution based on two algorithmic ideas. First, we obtain a structured representation of images based on labeled XY-trees (this representation informs the learner about important relationships between image subconstituents). Second, we propose a probabilistic architecture that extends hidden Markov models for learning probability distributions defined on spaces of labeled trees. Finally, a successful application of this method to the categorization of commercial invoices is presented."

However, in many real-world applications, this assumption may not hold. For example, we sometimes have a classification task in one domain of interest, but we only have sufficient training data in another domain of interest, where the latter data may be in a different feature space or follow a different data distribution. In such cases, knowledge transfer, if done successfully, would greatly improve the performance of learning by avoiding much expensive data-labeling efforts. In recent years, transfer learning has emerged as a new learning framework to address this problem. This survey focuses on categorizing and reviewing the current progress on transfer learning for classification, regression, and clustering problems. In this survey, we discuss the relationship between transfer learning and other related machine learning techniques such as domain adaptation, multitask learning and sample selection bias, as well as covariate shift. We also explore some potential future issues in transfer learning research."

The layout of a document contains a significant amount of information that can be used to classify it by type in the absence of domain-specific models. Our approach to classification is based on \u201cvisual similarity\u201d of layout structure and is implemented by building a supervised classifier, given examples of each class. We use image features such as percentages of text and non-text (graphics, images, tables, and rulings) content regions, column structures, relative point sizes of fonts, density of content area, and statistics of features of connected components which can be derived without class knowledge. In order to obtain class labels for training samples, we conducted a study where subjects ranked document pages with respect to their resemblance to representative page images. Class labels can also be assigned based on known document types, or can be defined by the user. We implemented our classification scheme using decision tree classifiers and self-organizing maps."

Large networks are also slow to use, making it difficult to deal with overfitting by combining the predictions of many different large neural nets at test time. Dropout is a technique for addressing this problem. The key idea is to randomly drop units (along with their connections) from the neural network during training. This prevents units from co-adapting too much. During training, dropout samples from an exponential number of different \"thinned\" networks. At test time, it is easy to approximate the effect of averaging the predictions of all these thinned networks by simply using a single unthinned network that has smaller weights. This significantly reduces overfitting and gives major improvements over other regularization methods. We show that dropout improves the performance of neural networks on supervised learning tasks in vision, speech recognition, document classification and computational biology, obtaining state-of-the-art results on many benchmark data sets."

However, an extensive and systematic evaluation of the various approaches has not been done yet. In order to investigate different text representations for document classification, we have developed a tool which transforms documents into feature-value representations that are suitable for standard learning algorithms. In this paper, we investigate seven document representations for German texts based on n-grams and single words. We compare their effectiveness in classifying OCR texts and the corresponding correct ASCII texts in two domains: business letters and abstracts of technical reports.

The methods are useful for visual similarity based document retrieval as well as fast algorithms for initial document type classification without OCR. A novel feature set called interval encoding is introduced to capture elements of spatial layout. This feature set encodes region layout information in fixed-length vectors by capturing structural characteristics of the image. These fixed-length vectors are then compared to each other through a Manhattan distance computation for fast page layout comparison. The paper describes experiments and results to rank-order a set of document pages in terms of their layout similarity to a test document. We also demonstrate the usefulness of the features derived from interval coding in a hidden Markov model based page layout classification system that is trainable and extendible. The methods described in the paper can be used in various document retrieval tasks including visual similarity based retrieval, categorization and information extraction."

The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm."

But exactly how such data can be harnessed and organized remains a critical problem. We introduce here a new database called \u201cImageNet\u201d, a large-scale ontology of images built upon the backbone of the WordNet structure. ImageNet aims to populate the majority of the 80,000 synsets of WordNet with an average of 500-1000 clean and full resolution images. This will result in tens of millions of annotated images organized by the semantic hierarchy of WordNet. This paper offers a detailed analysis of ImageNet in its current state: 12 subtrees with 5247 synsets and 3.2 million images in total. We show that ImageNet is much larger in scale and diversity and much more accurate than the current image datasets. Constructing such a large-scale database is a challenging task. We describe the data collection scheme with Amazon Mechanical Turk. Lastly, we illustrate the usefulness of ImageNet through three simple applications in object recognition, image classification and automatic object clustering. We hope that the scale, accuracy, diversity and hierarchical structure of ImageNet can offer unparalleled opportunities to researchers in the computer vision community and beyond."

The low level information based on a pyramidal decomposition of the document image is used by the kNN and the MLP classifiers, while the high level information represents the form content with a hierarchical structure used by the new structural classifier. Experimental results are presented. Some strategies of classifier co-operation are proposed."

This system, named STRETCH (STorage and RETrieval by Content of imaged documents), is based on an Archiving and Retrieval Engine, which overcomes the bottleneck of document profiling bypassing some limitations of existing pre-defined indexing schemes. The engine exploits a structured document representation and can activate appropriate methods to characterise and automatically index heterogeneous documents with variable layout. The originality of STRETCH lies principally in the possibility for unskilled users to define the indexes relevant to the document domains of their interest by simply presenting visual examples and applying reliable automatic information extraction methods (document classification, flexible reading strategies) to index the documents automatically, thus creating archives as desired. STRETCH offers ease of use and application programming and the ability to dynamically adapt to new types of documents. The system has been tested in two applications in particular, one concerning passive invoices and the other bank documents. In these applications, several classes of documents are involved. The indexing strategy first automatically classifies the document, thus avoiding pre-sorting, then locates and reads the information pertaining to the specific document class. Experimental results are encouraging overall; in particular, document classification results fulfill the requirements of high-volume application. Integration into production lines is under execution."

The system is composed of two main modules: the central indexer (extraction and weighting of indexing terms) and the classifier (classification of business letters into given types). The system employs several knowledge sources including a letter database, word frequency statistics for German, lists of message type specific words, morphological knowledge as well as the underlying document structure. As output, the system evaluates a set of weighted hypotheses about the type of the actual letter. Classification of documents allow the automatic distribution or archiving of letters and is also an excellent starting point for higher-level document analysis.1"

Instead of top-down determination of the discriminating attributes, the system inspects a finite set of document instances that are presented to a learner in a bottom-up position. The learner itself figures out local similarities, rates them with respect to the overall structure, and determines the best structural match of two instances (neighborhood). The entire decision tree is grown step by step deducing subtrees by forming generalizations from a neighborhood. Consequently, heuristics are learned for structurally discriminating documents during subsequent classification.<<ETX>>"
