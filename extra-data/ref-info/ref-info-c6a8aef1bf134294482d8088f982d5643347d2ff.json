This setup has hardly been studied in computer vision research, but it is the rule rather than the exception, because the world contains tens of thousands of different object classes and for only a very few of them image, collections have been formed and annotated with suitable class labels. In this paper, we tackle the problem by introducing attribute-based classification. It performs object detection based on a human-specified high-level description of the target objects instead of training images. The description consists of arbitrary semantic attributes, like shape, color or even geographic information. Because such properties transcend the specific learning task at hand, they can be pre-learned, e.g. from image datasets unrelated to the current task. Afterwards, new classes can be detected based on their attribute representation, without the need for a new training phase. In order to evaluate our method and to facilitate research in this area, we have assembled a new large-scale dataset, \u201cAnimals with Attributes\u201d, of over 30,000 animal images that match the 50 classes in Osherson's classic table of how strongly humans associate 85 semantic attributes with animal classes. Our experiments show that by using an attribute layer it is indeed possible to build a learning object detection system that does not require any training images of the target classes."

In this setting, a novel object is explained solely in terms of a small set of exemplar objects to which it is visually similar. Inspired by the work of Frome et al., we learn separate distance functions for each exemplar; however, our distances are interpretable on an absolute scale and can be thresholded to detect the presence of an object. Our exemplars are represented as image regions and the learned distances capture the relative importance of shape, color, texture, and position features for that region. We use the distance functions to detect and segment objects in novel images by associating the bottom-up segments obtained from multiple image segmentations with the exemplar regions. We evaluate the detection and segmentation performance of our algorithm on real-world outdoor scenes from the LabelMe (B. Russel, et al., 2007) dataset and also show some promising qualitative image parsing results."

Attributes are visual qualities of objects, such as 'red', 'striped', or 'spotted'. The model sees attributes as patterns of image segments, repeatedly sharing some characteristic properties. These can be any combination of appearance, shape, or the layout of segments within the pattern. Moreover, attributes with general appearance are taken into account, such as the pattern of alternation of any two colors which is characteristic for stripes. To enable learning from unsegmented training images, the model is learnt discriminatively, by optimizing a likelihood ratio. \n \nAs demonstrated in the experimental evaluation, our model can learn in a weakly supervised setting and encompasses a broad range of attributes. We show that attributes can be learnt starting from a text query to Google image search, and can then be used to recognize the attribute and determine its spatial extent in novel real-world images."

The alphabet itself is learnt incrementally during this process. The resulting representation consists of a set of category-specific descriptors\u2014basic shape features are represented by boundary-fragments, and appearance is represented by patches\u2014where each descriptor in combination with centroid vectors for possible object centroids (geometry) forms an alphabet entry. Our experimental results highlight several qualities of this novel representation. First, we demonstrate the power of purely shape-based representation with excellent categorization and detection results using a Boundary-Fragment-Model (BFM), and investigate the capabilities of such a model to handle changes in scale and viewpoint, as well as intra- and inter-class variability. Second, we show that incremental learning of a BFM for many categories leads to a sub-linear growth of visual alphabet entries by sharing of shape features, while this generalization over categories at the same time often improves categorization performance (over independently learning the categories). Finally, the combination of basic shape and appearance (boundary-fragments and patches) features can further improve results. Certain feature types are preferred by certain categories, and for some categories we achieve the lowest error rates that have been reported so far."

When labeled data is scarce it may be beneficial to use unlabeled data to learn an image representation that is low-dimensional, but nevertheless captures the information required to discriminate between image categories. This paper describes a method for learning representations from large quantities of unlabeled images which have associated captions; the goal is to improve learning in future image classification problems. Experiments show that our method significantly outperforms (1) a fully-supervised baseline model, (2) a model that ignores the captions and learns a visual representation by performing PCA on the unlabeled images alone and (3) a model that uses the output of word classifiers trained using captions and unlabeled data. Our current work concentrates on captions as the source of meta-data, but more generally other types of meta-data could be used."

Objects are modeled as flexible constellations of parts. A probabilistic representation is used for all aspects of the object: shape, appearance, occlusion and relative scale. An entropy-based feature detector is used to select regions and their scale within the image. In learning the parameters of the scale-invariant object model are estimated. This is done using expectation-maximization in a maximum-likelihood setting. In recognition, this model is used in a Bayesian manner to classify images. The flexible nature of the model is demonstrated by excellent results over a range of datasets including geometrically constrained classes (e.g. faces, cars) and flexible objects (such as animals)."

Tying our past experiences to our present interactions with the environment, they enable us to recognize and understand new objects and events. Concepts are also relevant to understanding domains such as social situations, personality types, and even artistic styles. Yet like other phenomenologically simple cognitive processes such as walking or understanding speech, concept formation and use are maddeningly complex. Research since the 1970s and the decline of the \"classical view\" of concepts have greatly illuminated the psychology of concepts. But persistent theoretical disputes have sometimes obscured this progress. The Big Book of Concepts goes beyond those disputes to reveal the advances that have been made, focusing on the major empirical discoveries. By reviewing and evaluating research on diverse topics such as category learning, word meaning, conceptual development in infants and children, and the basic level of categorization, the book develops a much broader range of criteria than is usual for evaluating theories of concepts."

Our system achieves a two-fold improvement in average precision over the best performance in the 2006 PASCAL person detection challenge. It also outperforms the best results in the 2007 challenge in ten out of twenty categories. The system relies heavily on deformable parts. While deformable part models have become quite popular, their value had not been demonstrated on difficult benchmarks such as the PASCAL challenge. Our system also relies heavily on new methods for discriminative training. We combine a margin-sensitive approach for data mining hard negative examples with a formalism we call latent SVM. A latent SVM, like a hidden CRF, leads to a non-convex training problem. However, a latent SVM is semi-convex and the training problem becomes convex once latent information is specified for the positive examples. We believe that our training methods will eventually make possible the effective use of more latent information such as hierarchical (grammar) models and models involving latent three dimensional pose."

The object is represented by a set of viewpoint invariant region descriptors so that recognition can proceed successfully despite changes in viewpoint, illumination and partial occlusion. The temporal continuity of the video within a shot is used to track the regions in order to reject unstable regions and reduce the effects of noise in the descriptors. The analogy with text retrieval is in the implementation where matches on descriptors are pre-computed (using vector quantization), and inverted file systems and document rankings are used. The result is that retrieved is immediate, returning a ranked list of key frames/shots in the manner of Google. The method is illustrated for matching in two full length feature films."

We study the influence of each stage of the computation on performance, concluding that fine-scale gradients, fine orientation binning, relatively coarse spatial binning, and high-quality local contrast normalization in overlapping descriptor blocks are all important for good results. The new approach gives near-perfect separation on the original MIT pedestrian database, so we introduce a more challenging dataset containing over 1800 annotated human images with a large range of pose variations and backgrounds."

We compare two implementations of the method quantitatively on a visually diverse database of natural scenes.

It does this by learning tasks in parallel while using a shared representation; what is learned for each task can help other tasks be learned better. This paper reviews prior work on MTL, presents new evidence that MTL in backprop nets discovers task relatedness without the need of supervisory signals, and presents new results for MTL with k-nearest neighbor and kernel regression. In this paper we demonstrate multitask learning in three domains. We explain how multitask learning works, and show that there are many opportunities for multitask learning in real domains. We present an algorithm and results for multitask learning with case-based methods like k-nearest neighbor and kernel regression, and sketch an algorithm for multitask learning in decision trees. Because multitask learning works, can be applied to many different kinds of domains, and can be used with different learning algorithms, we conjecture there will be many opportunities for its use on real-world problems."

Although a number of semi-supervised methods have been proposed, their effectiveness on NLP tasks is not always clear. This paper presents a novel semi-supervised method that employs a learning paradigm which we call structural learning. The idea is to find \"what good classifiers are like\" by learning from thousands of automatically generated auxiliary classification problems on unlabeled data. By doing so, the common predictive structure shared by the multiple classification problems can be discovered, which can then be used to improve performance on the target problem. The method produces performance higher than the previous best results on CoNLL'00 syntactic chunking and CoNLL'03 named entity chunking (English and German)."

Focusing on logistic regression, we show that using L1 regularization of the parameters, the sample complexity (i.e., the number of training examples required to learn \"well,\") grows only logarithmically in the number of irrelevant features. This logarithmic rate matches the best known bounds for feature selection, and indicates that L1 regularized logistic regression can be effective even if there are exponentially many irrelevant features as there are training examples. We also give a lower-bound showing that any rotationally invariant algorithm---including logistic regression with L2 regularization, SVMs, and neural networks trained by backpropagation---has a worst case sample complexity that grows at least linearly in the number of irrelevant features."

A statistical approach is developed where textures are modelled by the joint probability distribution of filter responses. This distribution is represented by the frequency histogram of filter response cluster centres (textons). Recognition proceeds from single, uncalibrated images and the novelty here is that rotationally invariant filters are used and the filter response space is low dimensional.Classification performance is compared with the filter banks and methods of Leung and Malik [IJCV, 2001], Schmid [CVPR, 2001] and Cula and Dana [IJCV, 2004] and it is demonstrated that superior performance is achieved here. Classification results are presented for all 61 materials in the Columbia-Utrecht texture database.We also discuss the effects of various parameters on our classification algorithm--such as the choice of filter bank and rotational invariance, the size of the texton dictionary as well as the number of training images used. Finally, we present a method of reliably measuring relative orientation co-occurrence statistics in a rotationally invariant manner, and discuss whether incorporating such information can enhance the classifier\u2019s performance."

This is advantageous because one could use large amounts of labelled avatar data in combination with a smaller amount of labelled human data to spot a large number of words in human data. Transfer learning is possible because we represent blocks of video with novel intermediate discriminative features based on splits of the data. By constructing the same splits in avatar and human data and clustering appropriately, our features are both discriminative and semantically similar: across signers similar features imply similar words. We demonstrate transfer learning in two scenarios: from avatar to a frontally viewed human signer and from an avatar to human signer in a 3/4 view."
