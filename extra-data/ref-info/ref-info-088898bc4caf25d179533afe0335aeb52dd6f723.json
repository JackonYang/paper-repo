The image sequence can be decomposed into a set of overlapping layers, where each layer's motion is described by a smooth flow field. The discontinuities in the description are then attributed to object opacities rather than to the flow itself, mirroring the structure of the scene. A set of techniques is devised for segmenting images into coherently moving regions using affine motion analysis and clustering techniques. It is possible to decompose an image into a set of layers along with information about occlusion and depth ordering. The techniques are applied to a flower garden sequence. The scene can be analyzed into four layers, and, the entire 30-frame sequence can be represented with a single image of each layer, along with associated motion parameters.<<ETX>>"

In order to achieve significantly lower bit rates, it will be necessary to devise encoding schemes that involve mid-level and high-level computer vision. Model-based systems have been described, but these are usually restricted to some special class of images such as head-and-shoulders sequences. We propose to use mid-level vision concepts to achieve a decomposition that can be applied to a wider domain of image material. In particular, we describe a coding scheme based on a set of overlapping layers. The layers, which are ordered in depth and move over one another, are composited in a manner similar to traditional `cel' animation. The decomposition (the vision problem) is challenging, but we have attained promising results on simple sequences. Once the decomposition has been achieved, the synthesis is straightforward."

This assumption fails in a number of common situations. The authors propose an alternative formulation in which there may be two distinct patterns undergoing coherent motion within a given local analysis region. They then present an algorithm for the analysis of two-component motion. They also demonstrate that the algorithm provides precise motion estimates for a set of elementary two-motion configurations, and show that it is robust in the presence of noise.<<ETX>>"

Higher compression, however, can be achieved by object-based image sequence representation. In an object-based representation scheme, the image sequence is decomposed into objects on the basis of motion, texture, structure, etc. By efficiently encoding these arbitrarily shaped objects, significantly lower bit rates can be achieved. We propose an object coding method which separately encodes the intensity and shape of objects. A compact description of the shape is obtained by using a contour encoding algorithm, while efficient transform coding techniques are used to compress the intensity. We describe three such techniques: smooth filling, cosine filling, and region dependent transform coding. We compare these methods with the KLT. Thesis Supervisor: E. H.

                "text": "In order to transmit a video signal over a limited bandwidth channel many techniques have been developed which can reduce the quantity of data required to represent moving image sequences. Almost all current coders use techniques based on reducing the statistical redundancy of the signal and psychophysically less significant details. Such coders are relatively successful for coding signals at bandwidths of 1 Megabit/second and higher but below this level purely signal based techniques become much less robust. This thesis will attempt to use an analysis of the structure of the image, the components from which it is composed, in order to gain greater image compression. The input material is examined and divided into elements representing the background, the actors and any other significant independent objects. The background image is stored as a model at the receiver and animated according to estimates of the motion in the original scene. Actors and other foreground objects are segmented out of the scene, compressed and transmitted using conventional signal based methods. This technique typically leads to reductions in bandwidth of greater than 70%. In addition, enabling the computer to distinguish the components of the picture allows for forms of post-shoot modifications of the picture not possible with conventionally represented signals.

In order to achieve bit rates of 64kBit/s and less in seems inevitable to subsample the input scene in time. Therefore the reciever will have to perform a spatio-temporal interpolation of the transmitted key-frames in order to reconstruct the missing in-between images. To do this properly, further information about the moving parts of the scene, derived by scene analysis, has to be transmitted. The segmentation procedure as well as the interpolation procedure are presented."

This scheme decreases additional information to encode block shapes by limiting all of them to quadrilaterals. Moreover smoothing filter is introduced for the purpose of reducing approximation errors particularly at block boundaries. After determining and encoding block shapes, this scheme transmits a mean value of each block by DPCM and reproduces the interpolation image at both coder and decoder. Then, the interpolation residual signals are selectively encoded by the mean separated KLT whose orthonormal basis-functions are derived individually for each block from the isotropic model for autocorrelation functions of images. Simulation results indicate that this scheme has superiority over square-block-based coding scheme in both coding efficiency and image quality."

Traditional stochastic relaxation techniques for minimizing such functions prove inappropriate for the task.

Pixel gray levels and the presence and orientation of edges are viewed as states of atoms or molecules in a lattice-like physical system. The assignment of an energy function in the physical system determines its Gibbs distribution. Because of the Gibbs distribution, Markov random field (MRF) equivalence, this assignment also determines an MRF image model. The energy function is a more convenient and natural mechanism for embodying picture attributes than are the local characteristics of the MRF. For a range of degradation mechanisms, including blurring, nonlinear deformations, and multiplicative or additive noise, the posterior distribution is an MRF with a structure akin to the image model. By the analogy, the posterior distribution defines another (imaginary) physical system. Gradual temperature reduction in the physical system isolates low energy states (``annealing''), or what is the same thing, the most probable states under the Gibbs distribution. The analogous operation under the posterior distribution yields the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the image given the degraded observations. The result is a highly parallel ``relaxation'' algorithm for MAP estimation. We establish convergence properties of the algorithm and we experiment with some simple pictures, for which good restorations are obtained at low signal-to-noise ratios."

The estimation of dynamical facial muscle contractions from video sequences of expressive human faces is considered. An estimation technique that uses deformable contour models (snakes) to track the nonrigid motions of facial features in video images is developed.

Compared to conventional methods which represent the motion of scene objects by translational displacements of blocks, the new method can cope with a wider range of motions since is allows for rotation and deformation of the triangular patches. In the block- based motion compensation, a simple local minimization algorithm (i.e., block matching) is applied to obtain the displacement vector of each block. However, it is inappropriate to apply this algorithm in the triangle-based motion compensation because of the complicated linkage between the deformation of the triangular patches and the displacement of the grid points (vertices of triangles). Consequently, the primary issue is to find an optimal way to estimate motion of the grid points. In this paper, we present a new motion estimation algorithm called hexagonal matching which iteratively refines the estimated displacement vectors. Simulation results show that the motion estimation algorithm produces less prediction error than the previously proposed triangle-based method or the block-based method. We also propose another algorithm with similar function but less computational complexity."

This framework can handle flow discontinuities at motion boundaries as well as flow multiplicities due to transparency of objects in a unified manner. The constraint equations are formulated by a composition of homogeneously parametrized differential operators on the space-time image. Fitting algorithms for the constraints which result in eigensystem analyses are described. To determine the number of flows, the authors use the margin energy, a measure of goodness of fit which is the difference between the first and the second lower eigenenergy of the eigensystem. They also hypothesize a criterion for multiplicity. The measure and the criterion are derived from the analogy of quantum mechanics. It is demonstrated that the margin energy can determine the transparency and discontinuities of the flow field as regions of more than one flow.<<ETX>>"

These lead to algorithms and parallel analog circuits that can solve \u2018ill-posed problems\u2019 and which are suggestive of neural equivalents in the brain."
