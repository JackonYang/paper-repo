This bag of keypoints method is based on vector quantization of affine invariant descriptors of image patches. We propose and compare two alternative implementations using different classifiers: Naive Bayes and SVM. The main advantages of the method are that it is simple, computationally efficient and intrinsically invariant. We present results for classifying nine semantic visual categories and comment on results obtained by Fergus et al using a different method on the same data set. We obtain excellent results as well for multi class categorization as for object detection. A thorough evaluation clearly demonstrates that our method is robust to background clutter and produces good categorization accuracy even without exploiting geometric information."

The procedure is based on a very low dimensional representation of the scene, that we term the Spatial Envelope. We propose a set of perceptual dimensions (naturalness, openness, roughness, expansion, ruggedness) that represent the dominant spatial structure of a scene. Then, we show that these dimensions may be reliably estimated using spectral and coarsely localized information. The model generates a multidimensional space in which scenes sharing membership in semantic categories (e.g., streets, highways, coasts) are projected closed together. The performance of the spatial envelope model shows that specific information about object shape or identity is not a requirement for scene categorization and that modeling a holistic representation of the scene informs about its probable semantic category."

This paper presents a large-scale evaluation of an approach that represents images as distributions (signatures or histograms) of features extracted from a sparse set of keypoint locations and learns a Support Vector Machine classifier with kernels based on two effective measures for comparing distributions, the Earth Mover's Distance and the chi-square distance. We first evaluate the performance of our approach with different keypoint detectors and descriptors, as well as different kernels and classifiers. We then conduct a comparative evaluation with several state-of-the-art recognition methods on four texture and five object databases. On most of these databases, our implementation exceeds the best reported results and achieves comparable performance on the rest. Finally, we investigate the influence of background correlations on recognition performance via extensive tests on the PASCAL database, for which ground-truth object localization information is available. Our experiments demonstrate that image representations based on distributions of local features are surprisingly effective for classification of texture and object images under challenging real-world conditions, including significant intra-class variations and substantial background clutter."

Textures are represented using a part dictionary found by quantizing the appearance of scale- or affine- invariant keypoints. Object classes are represented using a dictionary of composite semi-local parts, or groups of neighboring keypoints with stable and distinctive appearance and geometric layout. A discriminative maximum entropy framework is used to learn the posterior distribution of the class label given the occurrences of parts from the dictionary in the training set. Experiments on two texture and two object databases demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework for visual classification."

Our formulation provides answers to three open questions:(l) whether the invariant local features are suitable for scene (rather than object) classification; (2) whether unsupennsed latent space models can be used for feature extraction in the classification task; and (3) whether the latent space formulation can discover visual co-occurrence patterns, motivating novel approaches for image organization and segmentation. Using a 9500-image dataset, our approach is validated on each of these issues. First, we show with extensive experiments on binary and multi-class scene classification tasks, that a bag-of-visterm representation, derived from local invariant descriptors, consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. Second, we show that probabilistic latent semantic analysis (PLSA) generates a compact scene representation, discriminative for accurate classification, and significantly more robust when less training data are available. Third, we have exploited the ability of PLSA to automatically extract visually meaningful aspects, to propose new algorithms for aspect-based image ranking and context-sensitive image segmentation."

This article presents a technique where appearances of objects are represented by the joint statistics of such local neighborhood operators. As such, this represents a new class of appearance based techniques for computer vision. Based on joint statistics, the paper develops techniques for the identification of multiple objects at arbitrary positions and orientations in a cluttered scene. Experiments show that these techniques can identify over 100 objects in the presence of major occlusions. Most remarkably, the techniques have low complexity and therefore run in real-time."

We demonstrate that performance is improved by computing features on subblocks, classifying these subblocks, and then combining these results in a way reminiscent of stacking. State of the art single-feature methods are shown to result in about 75-86% performance, while the new method results in 90.3% correct classification, when evaluated on a diverse database of over 1300 consumer images provided by Kodak."

We achieve this using a model developed in the statistical text literature: probabilistic latent semantic analysis (pLSA). In text analysis, this is used to discover topics in a corpus using the bag-of-words document representation. Here we treat object categories as topics, so that an image containing instances of several categories is modeled as a mixture of topics. The model is applied to images by using a visual analogue of a word, formed by vector quantizing SIFT-like region descriptors. The topic discovery approach successfully translates to the visual domain: for a small set of objects, we show that both the object categories and their approximate spatial layout are found without supervision. Performance of this unsupervised method is compared to the supervised approach of Fergus et al. (2003) on a set of unseen images containing only one object per image. We also extend the bag-of-words vocabulary to include 'doublets' which encode spatially local co-occurring regions. It is demonstrated that this extended vocabulary gives a cleaner image segmentation. Finally, the classification and segmentation methods are applied to a set of images containing multiple objects per image. These results demonstrate that we can successfully build object class models from an unsupervised analysis of images."

This algorithm sets up correspondence as an integer quadratic programming problem, where the cost function has terms based on similarity of corresponding geometric blur point descriptors as well as the geometric distortion between pairs of corresponding feature points. The algorithm handles outliers, and thus enables matching of exemplars to query images in the presence of occlusion and clutter. Given the correspondences, we estimate an aligning transform, typically a regularized thin plate spline, resulting in a dense correspondence between the two shapes. Object recognition is then handled in a nearest neighbor framework where the distance between exemplar and query is the matching cost between corresponding points. We show results on two datasets. One is the Caltech 101 dataset (Fei-Fei, Fergus and Perona), an extremely challenging dataset with large intraclass variation. Our approach yields a 48% correct classification rate, compared to Fei-Fei et al 's 16%. We also show results for localizing frontal and profile faces that are comparable to special purpose approaches tuned to faces."

Kernel-based classification methods can learn complex decision boundaries, but a kernel over unordered set inputs must somehow solve for correspondences \u2013 generally a computationally expensive task that becomes impractical for large set sizes. We present a new fast kernel function which maps unordered feature sets to multi-resolution histograms and computes a weighted histogram intersection in this space. This \u201cpyramid match\u201d computation is linear in the number of features, and it implicitly finds correspondences based on the finest resolution histogram cell where a matched pair first appears. Since the kernel does not penalize the presence of extra features, it is robust to clutter. We show the kernel function is positive-definite, making it valid for use in learning algorithms whose optimal solutions are guaranteed only for Mercer kernels. We demonstrate our algorithm on object recognition tasks and show it to be accurate and dramatically faster than current approaches."

Kernel-based classification methods can learn complex decision boundaries, but a kernel over unordered set inputs must somehow solve for correspondences epsivnerally a computationally expensive task that becomes impractical for large set sizes. We present a new fast kernel function which maps unordered feature sets to multi-resolution histograms and computes a weighted histogram intersection in this space. This \"pyramid match\" computation is linear in the number of features, and it implicitly finds correspondences based on the finest resolution histogram cell where a matched pair first appears. Since the kernel does not penalize the presence of extra features, it is robust to clutter. We show the kernel function is positive-definite, making it valid for use in learning algorithms whose optimal solutions are guaranteed only for Mercer kernels. We demonstrate our algorithm on object recognition tasks and show it to be accurate and dramatically faster than current approaches"

This approach is quite flexible, and permits recognition based on color, texture, and particularly shape, in a homogeneous framework. While nearest neighbor classifiers are natural in this setting, they suffer from the problem of high variance (in bias-variance decomposition) in the case of limited sampling. Alternatively, one could use support vector machines but they involve time-consuming optimization and computation of pairwise distances. We propose a hybrid of these two methods which deals naturally with the multiclass setting, has reasonable computational complexity both in training and at run time, and yields excellent results in practice. The basic idea is to find close neighbors to a query sample and train a local support vector machine that preserves the distance function on the collection of neighbors. Our method can be applied to large, multiclass data sets for which it outperforms nearest neighbor and support vector machines, and remains efficient when the problem becomes intractable for support vector machines. A wide variety of distance functions can be used and our experiments show state-of-the-art performance on a number of benchmark data sets for shape and texture classification (MNIST, USPS, CUReT) and object recognition (Caltech- 101). On Caltech-101 we achieved a correct classification rate of 59.05%(\u00b10.56%) at 15 training images per class, and 66.23%(\u00b10.48%) at 30 training images."

Objects are modeled as flexible constellations of parts. A probabilistic representation is used for all aspects of the object: shape, appearance, occlusion and relative scale. An entropy-based feature detector is used to select regions and their scale within the image. In learning the parameters of the scale-invariant object model are estimated. This is done using expectation-maximization in a maximum-likelihood setting. In recognition, this model is used in a Bayesian manner to classify images. The flexible nature of the model is demonstrated by excellent results over a range of datasets including geometrically constrained classes (e.g. faces, cars) and flexible objects (such as animals)."

A single image histogram, however, suffers from the inability to encode spatial image variation. An obvious way to extend this feature is to compute the histograms of multiple resolutions of an image to form a multiresolution histogram. The multiresolution histogram shares many desirable properties with the plain histogram, including that they are both fast to compute, space efficient, invariant to rigid motions, and robust to noise. In addition, the multiresolution histogram directly encodes spatial information. We describe a simple yet novel matching algorithm based on the multiresolution histogram that uses the differences between histograms of consecutive image resolutions. We evaluate it against five widely used image features. We show that with our simple feature we achieve or exceed the performance obtained with more complicated features. Further, we show our algorithm to be the most efficient and robust."

A computer vision system has been developed that performs object recognition using features with similar properties. Invariance to image translation, scale and rotation is achieved by first selecting stable key points in scale space and performing feature detection only at these locations. The features measure local image gradients in a manner modeled on the response of complex cells in primary visual cortex, and thereby obtain partial invariance to illumination, affine change, and other local distortions. The features are used as input to a nearest-neighbor indexing method and Hough transform that identify candidate object matches. Final verification of each match is achieved by finding a best-fit solution for the unknown model parameters and integrating the features consistent with these parameter values. This verification procedure provides a model for the serial process of attention in human vision that integrates features belonging to a single object. Experimental results show that this approach can achieve rapid and robust object recognition in cluttered partially-occluded images."

The results of this measure are compared with humans analyzing seven \"teaser\" images to test its effectiveness for finding perceptually dominant orientations. The use of low-level orientation is then applied to a \"quick search\" problem important in image database applications. Since both pigeons and humans are able to perform coarse classification of certain kinds of scenes, e.g., city from country, without taking time or brain-power to solve the image understanding problem, the authors conjecture that the collective behavior of low-level textural features such as orientation may be doing most of the work. The authors demonstrate a simple test of global multiscale orientation for quickly searching a database of vacation photos for likely \"city/suburb\" shots. The orientation features achieve agreement with human classification in 91 out of 98 of the scenes."

                "text": "In this paper we describe the first stage of a new learning system for object detection and recognition. For our system we propose Boosting (5) as the underlying learning technique. This allows the use of very diverse sets of visual features in the learning process within a com- mon framework: Boosting \u2014 together with a weak hypotheses finder \u2014 may choose very inhomogeneous features as most relevant for combina- tion into a final hypothesis. As another advantage the weak hypotheses finder may search the weak hypotheses space without explicit calculation of all available hypotheses, reducing computation time. This contrasts the related work of Agarwal and Roth (1) where Winnow was used as learning algorithm and all weak hypotheses were calculated explicitly. In our first empirical evaluation we use four types of local descriptors: two basic ones consisting of a set of grayvalues and intensity moments and two high level descriptors: moment invariants (8) and SIFTs (12). The descriptors are calculated from local patches detected by an inter- est point operator. The weak hypotheses finder selects one of the local patches and one type of local descriptor and efficiently searches for the most discriminative similarity threshold. This differs from other work on Boosting for object recognition where simple rectangular hypotheses (22) or complex classifiers (20) have been used. In relatively simple images, where the objects are prominent, our approach yields results comparable to the state-of-the-art (3). But we also obtain very good results on more complex images, where the objects are located in arbitrary positions, poses, and scales in the images. These results indicate that our flexible approach, which also allows the inclusion of features from segmented re- gions and even spatial relationships, leads us a significant step towards generic object recognition."

We present a context-based vision system for place and object recognition. The goal is to identify familiar locations (e.g., office 610, conference room 941, main street), to categorize new environments (office, corridor, street) and to use that information to provide contextual priors for object recognition (e.g., tables are more likely in an office than a street). We present a low-dimensional global image representation that provides relevant information for place recognition and categorization, and show how such contextual information introduces strong priors that simplify object recognition. We have trained the system to recognize over 60 locations (indoors and outdoors) and to suggest the presence and locations of more than 20 different object types. The algorithm has been integrated into a mobile system that provides realtime feedback to the user."

To achieve this aim, new kinds of vision algorithms need to be developed which run in real time and subserve the robot's goals. Two fundamental goals are determining the location of a known object. Color can be successfully used for both tasks.This article demonstrates that color histograms of multicolored objects provide a robust, efficient cue for indexing into a large database of models. It shows that color histograms are stable object representations in the presence of occlusion and over change in view, and that they can differentiate among a large number of objects. For solving the identification problem, it introduces a technique calledHistogram Intersection, which matches model and image histograms and a fast incremental version of Histogram Intersection, which allows real-time indexing into a large database of stored models. For solving the location problem it introduces an algorithm calledHistogram Backprojection, which performs this task efficiently in crowded scenes."

Support vector machines have been established as powerful learning algorithms with good generalization capabilities. We combine these two approaches and propose a general kernel method for recognition with local features. We show that the proposed kernel satisfies the Mercer condition and that it is, suitable for many established local feature frameworks. Large-scale recognition results are presented on three different databases, which demonstrate that SVMs with the proposed kernel perform better than standard matching techniques on local features. In addition, experiments on noisy and occluded images show that local feature representations significantly outperform global approaches."

The topology is restricted to resolutions up to the extent of the local region of interest (ROI). Although the ROI's may contain many pixels, there is no spatial order on the pixels within the ROI, the only information preserved is the histogram of pixel values within the ROI's. This can be considered as an extreme case of a textel (texture element) image: The histogram is the limit of texture where the spatial order has been completely disregarded. We argue that locally orderless images are ubiquitous in perception and the visual arts. Formally, the orderless images are most aptly described by three mutually intertwined scale spaces. The scale parameters correspond to the pixellation (\u201cinner scale\u201d), the extent of the ROI's (\u201couter scale\u201d) and the resolution in the histogram (\u201ctonal scale\u201d). We describe how to construct locally orderless images, how to render them, and how to use them in a variety of local and global image processing operations."

In contrast to the latter method which stems from linear algebra and performs a Singular Value Decomposition of co-occurrence tables, the proposed technique uses a generative latent class model to perform a probabilistic mixture decomposition. This results in a more principled approach with a solid foundation in statistical inference. More precisely, we propose to make use of a temperature controlled version of the Expectation Maximization algorithm for model fitting, which has shown excellent performance in practice. Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis has many applications, most prominently in information retrieval, natural language processing, machine learning from text, and in related areas. The paper presents perplexity results for different types of text and linguistic data collections and discusses an application in automated document indexing. The experiments indicate substantial and consistent improvements of the probabilistic method over standard Latent Semantic Analysis."

Such data, when combined with anatomical and physiological knowledge, seriously constrains current models of visual processing. In particular, it suggests that a lot of processing can be achieved using a single feed-forward pass through the visual system, and that each processing layer probably has no more than around 10 ms before the next stage has to respond. In this time, few neurons will have generated more than one spike, ruling out most conventional rate coding models. We have been exploring the possibility of using the fact that strongly activated neurons tend to fire early and that information can be encoded in the order in which a population of cells fire. These ideas have been tested using SpikeNet, a computer program that simulates the activity of very large networks of asynchronously firing neurons. The results have been extremely promising, and we have been able to develop artificial visual systems capable of processing complex natural scenes in real time using standard computer hardware (see http://www.spikenet-technology.com)."

The roughness at the micro scale is modeled as a uniform, isotropically scattering, Lambertian surface. At the macro scale the roughness is modeled by way of a distribution of spherical concavities. These pits influence the BRDF via vignetting, cast shadow, interreflection and interposition, causing it to differ markedly from Lambertian. Pitted surfaces show strong backward scattering (so called \u201copposition effect\u201d). When we assume that the macro scale can be resolved, the radiance histogram and the spatial structure of the textons of the textured surface (at the mega scale) can be calculated. This is the main advantage of the model over previous ones: One can do exact (numerical) calculations for a surface geometry that is physically realizable."
