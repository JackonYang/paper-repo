Several critical functions have been investigated and the technical approaches are discussed. The first is the segmentation and classification of digitized printed documents into regions of text and images. A nonlinear, run-length smoothing algorithm has been used for this purpose. By using the regular features of text lines, a linear adaptive classification scheme discriminates text regions from others. The second technique studied is an adaptive approach to the recognition of the hundreds of font styles and sizes that can occur on printed documents. A preclassifier is constructed during the input process and used to speed up a well-known pattern-matching method for clustering characters from an arbitrary print source into a small sample of prototypes. Experimental results are included."

The principal parts of the algorithm are the generation of connected components and the application of the Hough transform in order to group components into logical character strings that can then be separated from the graphics. The algorithm outputs two images, one containing text strings and the other graphics. These images can then be processed by suitable character recognition and graphics recognition systems. The performance of the algorithm, both in terms of its effectiveness and computational efficiency, was evaluated using several test images and showed superior performance compared to other techniques. >"

The system combines several techniques in order to improve the overall recognition rate. Thinning and shape extraction are performed directly on a graph of the run-length encoding of a binary image. The resulting strokes and other shapes are mapped, using a shape-clustering approach, into binary features which are then fed into a statistical Bayesian classifier. Large-scale trials have shown better than 97 percent top choice correct performance on mixtures of six dissimilar fonts, and over 99 percent on most single fonts, over a range of point sizes. Certain remaining confusion classes are disambiguated through contour analysis, and characters suspected of being merged are broken and reclassified. Finally, layout and linguistic context are applied. The results are illustrated by sample pages."

                "text": "A low-cost optical character recognition (OCR) system can be realized by means of a document scanner connected to a CPU through an interface. The interface performs elementary image processing functions, such as noise filtering and thresholding of the video image from the scanner. The processor receives a binary image of the document, formats the image into individual character patterns, and classifies the patterns one-by-one. A CPU implementation is highly flexible and avoids much of the development and manufacturing costs for special-purpose, parallel circuitry typically used in commercial OCR. A processor-based recognition system has been investigated for reading documents printed in fixed-pitch conventional type fonts, such as occur in routine office typing. Novel, efficient methods for tracking a print line, resolving it into individual character patterns, detecting underscores, and eliminating noise have been devised. A previously developed classification technique, based on decision trees, has been extended in order to improve reading accuracy in an environment of considerable character variation, including the possibility that documents in the same font style may be produced using quite different print technologies. The system has been tested on typical office documents, and also on artificial stress documents, obtained from a variety of typewriters."

Problems in such a procedure are the detection and correction of the inclination of a document, separation of contact characters, the merge of disconnected characters, and extraction of a letterhead. This paper describes the results of studies on such problems. The document considered is the English text image, containing binary figures and a letterhead. The basic idea is as follows. Connected regions are obtained by directional propagation and shrinking to merge figures. Then: (1) a thinning process is performed to detect the inclination angle of the input text; (2) the sizes of the connected regions and their relative locations are examined to extract the letterhead. Estimation of pitch is performed and statistical data about individual characters are used to separate contact characters or merge disconnected characters. The experiment was made for 10 and 12 pitch printed characters, and the correct extraction rate was 100 percent for individual characters, and 94.6 percent for a letterhead. Thus it was verified that the proposed method is useful in extracting the character region."
