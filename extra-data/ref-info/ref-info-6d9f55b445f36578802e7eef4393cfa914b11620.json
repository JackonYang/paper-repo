We incorporate statistical natural language processing in order to deal with free text. We demonstrate the current system on a difficult dataset, namely 10000 images of work from the Fine Arts Museum of San Francisco. The images include line drawings, paintings, and pictures of sculpture and ceramics. Many of the images have associated free text which varies greatly from physical description to interpretation and mood. We use WordNet to provide semantic grouping information and to help disambiguate word senses, as well as emphasize the hierarchical nature of semantic relationships. This allows us to impose a natural structure on the image collection that reflects semantics to a considerable degree. Our method produces a joint probability distribution for words and picture elements. We demonstrate that this distribution can be used: (a) to provide illustrations for given captions, and (b) to generate words for images outside the training set. Results from this annotation process yield a quantitative study of our method. Finally, the annotation process can be seen as a form of object recognizer that has been learned through a partially supervised process."

We adopt two processes in the method, one is a process to uniformly divide each image into sub-images with key words, and the other is a process to carry out vector quantization of the sub-images. These processes lead to results which show that each sub-image can be correlated to a set of words each of which is selected from words assigned to whole images. Original aspects of the method are, (1) all words assigned to a whole image are inherited to each divided sub-image, (2) the voting probability of each word for a set of divided images is estimated by the result of a vector quantization of the feature vector of sub-images. Some experiments show the e ectiveness of the proposed method."

In this thesis, we will examine one framework of learning from ambiguous examples known as Multiple-Instance learning. Each example is a bag, consisting of any number of instances. A bag is labeled negative if all instances in it are negative. A bag is labeled positive if at least one instance in it is positive. Because the instances themselves are not labeled, each positive bag is an ambiguous example. We would like to learn a concept which will correctly classify unseen bags. \nWe have developed a measure called Diverse Density and algorithms for learning from multiple-instance examples. We have applied these techniques to problems in drug design, stock prediction, and image database retrieval. These serve as examples of how to translate the ambiguity in the application domain into bags, as well as successful examples of applying Diverse Density techniques.

We define a concept of word-by-word alignment between such pairs of sentences. For any given pair of such sentences each of our models assigns a probability to each of the possible word-by-word alignments. We give an algorithm for seeking the most probable of these alignments. Although the algorithm is suboptimal, the alignment thus obtained accounts well for the word-by-word relationships in the pair of sentences. We have a great deal of data in French and English from the proceedings of the Canadian Parliament. Accordingly, we have restricted our work to these two languages; but we feel that because our algorithms have minimal linguistic content they would work well on other pairs of languages. We also feel, again because of the minimal linguistic content of our algorithms, that it is reasonable to argue that word-by-word alignments are inherent in any sufficiently large bilingual corpus."

The development of digital image processing technologies has bred a brigade of content-based indexing and retrieval methods available for applications. What the users need and in what kinds of environments different indexing and retrieval methods are relevant, has remained an area of less intensive research work.This article presents the results of a field study concentrating on journalists as users of a digital newspaper photo archive. The expressed photo needs, applied selection criteria and observed searching behaviours in journalists' daily work were contrasted with the indexing practices applied by the archivists. The results showed that the journalists achieved satisfactory results when trivial query terms were available, e.g. when photos of named persons were needed. Browsing was the main searching strategy applied by the journalists, but the system did not support browsing well. The access problems faced by the users in particular photo needs are discussed in detail. The paper concludes by discussing the potential approaches in developing both the concept-based and content-based indexing methods as well as the user interfaces in photo retrieval systems."

Rather than focusing on local features and their consistencies in the image data, our approach aims at extracting the global impression of an image. We treat image segmentation as a graph partitioning problem and propose a novel global criterion, the normalized cut, for segmenting the graph. The normalized cut criterion measures both the total dissimilarity between the different groups as well as the total similarity within the groups. We show that an efficient computational technique based on a generalized eigenvalue problem can be used to optimize this criterion. We have applied this approach to segmenting static images and found results very encouraging."

Users learn techniques that have proven to be useful by first-hand experience and a wide range of mathematical methods. A CD-ROM with every copy of the text contains source code for programming practice, color images, and illustrative movies. Comprehensive and up-to-date, this book includes essential topics that either reflect practical significance or are of theoretical importance. Topics are discussed in substantial and increasing depth. Application surveys describe numerous important application areas such as image based rendering and digital libraries. Many important algorithms broken down and illustrated in pseudo code. Appropriate for use by engineers as a comprehensive reference to the computer vision enterprise."
