                "text": "This paper proposes the use of maximum entropy techniques for text classification. Maximum entropy is a probability distribution estimation technique widely used for a variety of natural language tasks, such as language modeling, part-of-speech tagging, and text segmentation. The underlying principle of maximum entropy is that without external knowledge, one should prefer distributions that are uniform. Constraints on the distribution, derived from labeled training data, inform the technique where to be minimally non-uniform. The maximum entropy formulation has a unique solution which can be found by the improved iterative scaling algorithm. In this paper, maximum entropy is used for text classification by estimating the conditional distribution of the class variable given the document. In experiments on several text datasets we compare accuracy to naive Bayes and show that maximum entropy is sometimes significantly better, but also sometimes worse. Much future work remains, but the results indicate that maximum entropy is a promising technique for text classification."

Some use a multi-variate Bernoulli model, that is, a Bayesian Network with no dependencies between words and binary word features (e.g. Larkey and Croft 1996; Koller and Sahami 1997). Others use a multinomial model, that is, a uni-gram language model with integer word counts (e.g. Lewis and Gale 1994; Mitchell 1997). This paper aims to clarify the confusion by describing the differences and details of these two models, and by empirically comparing their classification performance on five text corpora. We find that the multi-variate Bernoulli performs well with small vocabulary sizes, but that the multinomial performs usually performs even better at larger vocabulary sizes--providing on average a 27% reduction in error over the multi-variate Bernoulli model at any vocabulary size."

A phrase has a positive semantic orientation when it has good associations (e.g., \"subtle nuances\") and a negative semantic orientation when it has bad associations (e.g., \"very cavalier\"). In this paper, the semantic orientation of a phrase is calculated as the mutual information between the given phrase and the word \"excellent\" minus the mutual information between the given phrase and the word \"poor\". A review is classified as recommended if the average semantic orientation of its phrases is positive. The algorithm achieves an average accuracy of 74% when evaluated on 410 reviews from Epinions, sampled from four different domains (reviews of automobiles, banks, movies, and travel destinations). The accuracy ranges from 84% for automobile reviews to 66% for movie reviews."

Despite the fact that this type of problem is well understood, there are many issues to be considered in designing an SVM learner. In particular, for large learning tasks with many training examples on the shelf optimization techniques for general quadratic programs quickly become intractable in their memory and time requirements. SVM light is an implementation of an SVM learner which addresses the problem of large tasks.

The learning paradigm builds increasingly complex fields by allowing potential functions, or features, that are supported by increasingly large subgraphs. Each feature has a weight that is trained by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the model and the empirical distribution of the training data. A greedy algorithm determines how features are incrementally added to the field and an iterative scaling algorithm is used to estimate the optimal values of the weights. The random field models and techniques introduced in this paper differ from those common to much of the computer vision literature in that the underlying random fields are non-Markovian and have a large number of parameters that must be estimated. Relations to other learning approaches, including decision trees, are given. As a demonstration of the method, we describe its application to the problem of automatic word classification in natural language processing."

A positive semantic orientation implies desirability (e.g., \"honest\", \"intrepid\") and a negative semantic orientation implies undesirability (e.g., \"disturbing\", \"superfluous\"). This paper introduces a simple algorithm for unsupervised learning of semantic orientation from extremely large corpora. The method involves issuing queries to a Web search engine and using pointwise mutual information to analyse the results. The algorithm is empirically evaluated using a training corpus of approximately one hundred billion words \u0097 the subset of the Web that is indexed by the chosen search engine. Tested with 3,596 words (1,614 positive and 1,982 negative), the algorithm attains an accuracy of 80%. The 3,596 test words include adjectives, adverbs, nouns, and verbs. The accuracy is comparable with the results achieved by Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown (1997), using a complex four-stage supervised learning algorithm that is restricted to determining the semantic orientation of adjectives."

Several smoothing methods for ME models have been proposed to address this problem, but previous results do not make it clear how these smoothing methods compare with smoothing methods for other types of related models. In this work, we survey previous work in ME smoothing and compare the performance of several of these algorithms with conventional techniques for smoothing n-gram language models. Because of the mature body of research in n-gram model smoothing and the close connection between ME and conventional n-gram models, this domain is well-suited to gauge the performance of ME smoothing methods. Over a large number of data sets, we find that fuzzy ME smoothing performs as well as or better than all other algorithms under consideration. We contrast this method with previous n-gram smoothing methods to explain its superior performance."

Empirical results showing that it performs surprisingly well in many domains containing clear attribute dependences suggest that the answer to this question may be positive. This article shows that, although the Bayesian classifier's probability estimates are only optimal under quadratic loss if the independence assumption holds, the classifier itself can be optimal under zero-one loss (misclassification rate) even when this assumption is violated by a wide margin. The region of quadratic-loss optimality of the Bayesian classifier is in fact a second-order infinitesimal fraction of the region of zero-one optimality. This implies that the Bayesian classifier has a much greater range of applicability than previously thought. For example, in this article it is shown to be optimal for learning conjunctions and disjunctions, even though they violate the independence assumption. Further, studies in artificial domains show that it will often outperform more powerful classifiers for common training set sizes and numbers of attributes, even if its bias is a priori much less appropriate to the domain. This article's results also imply that detecting attribute dependence is not necessarily the best way to extend the Bayesian classifier, and this is also verified empirically."

Conditional random fields offer several advantages over hidden Markov models and stochastic grammars for such tasks, including the ability to relax strong independence assumptions made in those models. Conditional random fields also avoid a fundamental limitation of maximum entropy Markov models (MEMMs) and other discriminative Markov models based on directed graphical models, which can be biased towards states with few successor states. We present iterative parameter estimation algorithms for conditional random fields and compare the performance of the resulting models to HMMs and MEMMs on synthetic and natural-language data."

                "text": "The GRACE evaluation program aims at applying the Evaluation Paradigm to the evaluation of Part-of-Speech taggers for French. An interesting by-product of GRACE is the production of validated language resources necessary for the evaluation. After a brief recall of the origins and the nature of the Evaluation Paradigm, we show how it relates to other national and international initiatives. We then present the now ending GRACE evaluation campaign and describe its four main components (corpus building, tagging procedure, lexicon building, evaluation procedure), as well as its internal organization. 1. The Evaluation Paradigm The Evaluation Paradigm has been proposed as a mean to foster development in research and technology in the field of language engineering. Up to now, it has been mostly used in the United States in the framework of the ARPA and NIST projects on automatic processing of spoken and written language. The paradigm is based on a two step process: first, create textual or voice data in the form of raw corpora, tagged corpora or lexica, which are then distributed to main actors in the field of language engineering for the realization of natural language processing tools. These tools address problems like disambiguation, natural language database query, message understanding, automatic translation, dictation, dialog, character recognition, etc.; then, test and compare systems on similar data. The results of the tests and the discussions (within specific workshops, for example) triggered by their publication and comparison constitute a good basis for the evaluation of the pros and cons of the various methods. The resulting synergy is a dynamizing factor for the field of Language Engineering. The Linguistic Data Consortium (whose function is to collect language related data and to organize their distribution) is a typical illustration of positive consequences of programs implementing the Evaluation Paradigm. The GRACE evaluation program is meant to be an implementation of the Evaluation Paradigm in the field of morpho-syntactic tagging. As such it corresponds to an evaluation campaign of Part-Of-Speech taggers for French organized within an automated quantitative black-box evaluation framework. 2. The GRACE evaluation program Started upon the initiative of Joseph Mariani (LIMSI) and Robert Martin (INaLF), GRACE (Grammars and Resources for Analyzers of Corpora and their Evaluation) was part of the French program: \u201cCognition, Communication Intelligente et Ing\u00e9nierie des Langues\u201d (Cognition, Intelligent Communication and Language Engineering), jointly promoted by the Engineering Sciences and Human Sciences departments of the CNRS (National Center for Scientific Research). The GRACE program was intended to run over a four year period (1994-1997) and was planed in two phases: a first phase dedicated to Part-of-Speech taggers, and a second phase concerned with work on syntactic analyzers, but which has been abandoned. The first year was devoted to the setting up of a coordination committee in charge of running the project and a reflection committee. The responsibility of the reflection committee formed with a pannel of experts from various domains, is to define the evaluation protocol, to specify the reference tagset and lexicon, to decide which data will be made available to the participants, and to organize the workshop for the presentation of the final results. The third entity of the GRACE organization regroups all the participants. They come both from public institutions and industrial corporations. Only participants with fully operational systems were allowed to take part in the evaluation. Furthermore, only the participants which have agreed to describe how their system works (at least during a workshop whose attendance would be restricted to the sole participants) were authorized to take part in the workshop concluding the evaluation campaign. 20 participants, from both academia and industry, registered at the beginning of the project. During the project, this number slightly decreased. 17 took part in the dry-run and 13 in the final test the results of which will be published at the beginning of fall \u201998. 3. Defining the Evaluation Procedure For the definition and the organization of the GRACE evaluation campaign, we build upon the work done in previous evaluation programs, in particular the evaluation campaigns which have been conducted in the United States, especially in the scope of ARPA Human Language Technology program. Namely: the MUC (MUC-1, MUC-2, MUC-3 ( Sundheim 1991), MUC-4 ( MUC 1992)) conferences, aiming at the evaluation of message understanding systems ; TIPSTER, concerning the evaluation of automated information extraction systems from raw text data; the TREC ( Harman 1993; Harman 1994) conferences, concerning the evaluation Information Retrieval systems operating on textual databases; ParsEval and SemEval, which find their origin in Ezra Black\u2019s work ( Black 1991; Black 1993; Black 1994) on the evaluation of syntactic analyzers done within the scope of an ACL working group. GRACE also looked at the \u201cMorpholympics\u201d competition ( Hauser 1994a; Hauser 1994b), which was organized in spring 1994 at Erlangen University in Germany for the evaluation of German morphological analyzers. MUC and TREC use task oriented black-box evaluation schemes requiring no knowledge of the internal processes or theoretical underpinning of the systems being tested, while ParsEval and SemEval (some of which will be part of MUC-6) are approaches which attempt to evaluate systems at the module level by using a benchmark method based on a reference corpus annotated with syntactic structures agreed upon by a panel of experts. An additional list of evaluation methods for linguistic software (lingware) now in use in the industry was found in Marc Cavazza\u2019s report (in French) for the French Ministry of Education and Research ( Cavazza 1994). An other extensive overview of evaluation programs for Natural Language Processing systems is provided in ( Sparck Jones and Galliers 1996). Similarly to the evaluation campaigns organized in the United-States, GRACE was divided into four phases: 1. training phase (\u201cphase d\u2019entra\u0131\u0302nement\u201d): distribution of the training data (the training corpus) to the participants for the initial set up of their systems; 2. dry-run phase (\u201cphase d\u2019essais\u201d): distribution of a first set of data (the dry-run corpus) to the participants for a first real-size test of the evaluation protocol; the task used in the MUC evaluation campagns was for the systems to fill in predefined frames from texts relating US Navy man\u0153uvres (MUC-1 and MUC-2) or terrorism acts (MUC-3 and MUC-4) 3. test phase (\u201cphase de test\u201d): distributionof the \u201creal\u201d evaluation data (the test corpus) to the participants and realization of the evaluation; 4. adjudication phase (\u201cphase d\u2019adjudication\u201d): validation with the participants of the results of the evaluation; this phase leads to the organization of a workshop where all the participants present their methods and their systems and discuss the results of the evaluation. According to the task-oriented approach chosen in GRACE, the evaluation procedure was based on a automated comparison, on a common corpus of literary and journalistic texts, of the PoS produced by various tagging systems against PoS manually validated by an expert (tagging is therefore the task selected for evaluation). In addition, as the evaluation procedure has to be applicable for the simultaneous evaluation of several systems (that may very well use various tagging procedures \u2013statistical, rule-based, ...), the definition of the evaluation metrics cannot rely on any presupposition about the internal characteristics of the tagging methods. It has therefore to be exclusively defined in terms of the outputs produced by the systems (pure \u201cblack-box\u201d approach), which, in the case of tagging, can be minimally represented as sequences of pairs the elements of which are the word token and its tag (or tag list). Such an output is considered to be \u201cminimal\u201d for the tagging task because several taggers also produce some additional information in addition to the simple tags (e.g. lemmas). In GRACE, we decided to not take into account such additional information (for example, no evaluation of the eventual lemmatization provided by the systems was performed) and restrict ourselves to the tagging task, defined as aiming at associating one unique tag to each token (and not for instance a partially disambiguiated list of tags, which would have required a much more complex metrics for comparing the systems). However, even with such a minimalistic definition for the tagging task, the actual definition of a working evaluation metrics did require from the GRACE steering committee to take several decision about various crucial issues: how to compare systems that do not operate on the same tokens (i.e. use different segmentation procedures)? How to take into account the processing of compound forms? how to compare systems that do not use the same tagsets ? how to weighten in the evaluation the different components that build up any realistic tagging system? In particular, how to evaluate the influence of the capacity of a tagger to handle unknown words ? How to evaluate the influence of the quality of the lexical information available? Build upon the evaluation scheme initially proposed by Martin Rajman in (Adda et al.(1995)) and then adapted and extended by the GRACE committees, the evaluation procedure used in GRACE is characterized by the following aspects: Dealing with varying tokenizations The problem of the differences in the variations of text segmentation between the hand-tagged reference material and the text returned by the participants is a central issue for tagger evaluation. Indeed, Not to leave a complete freedom to the participant about the tokenizing algorithm (and the lexicon) used to segment the data, they had to "

We identify document genre is an important factor in retrieving useful documents and focus on the novel document genre dimension of subjectivity. We investigate three approaches to automatically classifying documents by genre: traditional bag of words techniques, part-of-speech statistics, and hand-crafted shallow linguistic features. We are particularly interested in domain transfer: how well the learned classifiers generalize from the training corpus to a new document corpus. Our experiments demonstrate that the part-of-speech approach is better than traditional bag of words techniques, particularly in the domain transfer conditions."
