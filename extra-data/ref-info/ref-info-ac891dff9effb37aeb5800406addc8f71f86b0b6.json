It contains some of the author's own research and many of the proofs are new. It dispenses with most of the customary transform apparatus, and the chapter on Brownian motion emphasizes topics which haven't had much textbook coverage, such as square variation, the reflection principle, and the invariance principle. The chapter on diffusion shows how to obtain the process from Brownian by changing time. (Author)"

To realize the above we shall use stochastic relaxation. Since our generator space is now a continuum it is necessary to justify it rigorously in this new context; it will be done in Section 2. To actually implement such Monte Carlo simulations requires careful planning to avoid unacceptable CPU-time requirement. At first glance it may appear that the continuum-based model used here should require much less computing than the lattice-based ones earlier in for example Besag (1986), Geman-Geman (1984), Grenander (1984), Ripley (1986): after all, the number of sites, n, which in the lattice models is of the order 104 106 , need only be a few hundred, or even less, for the shape model."

We find that in the limitt \u2192 + \u221e, a nonstationary Markov chain may exhibit \u201cphase transitions.\u201d Nonstationary Markov chains in general, and the annealing algorithm in particular, lead to biased estimators for the expectation values of the process. We compute the leading terms in the bias and the variance of the sample-means estimator. We find that the annealing algorithm converges if the temperatureT(t) goes to zero no faster thanC/log(t/t0) ast\u2192+\u221e, with a computable constantC andt0 the initial time.

Ross. This is a lively text that covers the basic ideas of probability theory including those needed in statistics. Theoretical concepts are introduced via interesting concrete examples. In 394 I will begin my lectures with the basics of probability theory in Chapter 2. However, your first assignment is to review Chapter 1, which treats elementary counting methods. They are used in applications in Chapter 2. I expect to cover Chapters 2-5 plus portions of 6 and 7. You are encouraged to read ahead. In lectures I will not be able to cover every topic and example in Ross, and conversely, I may cover some topics/examples in lectures that are not treated in Ross. You will be responsible for all material in my lectures, assigned reading, and homework, including supplementary handouts if any."
