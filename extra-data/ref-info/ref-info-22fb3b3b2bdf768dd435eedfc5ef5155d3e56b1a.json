The problem can be reduced to a manageable size by restricting attention to a specific {\\em domain}, which is a corpus of texts together with a predefined set of {\\em concepts} that are of interest to that domain. Two widely different domains are used to illustrate this domain-specific approach. One domain is a collection of Wall Street Journal articles in which the target concept is management succession events: identifying persons moving into corporate management positions or moving out. A second domain is a collection of hospital discharge summaries in which the target concepts are various classes of diagnosis or symptom. The goal of an information extraction system is to identify references to the concept of interest for a particular domain. A key knowledge source for this purpose is a set of text analysis rules based on the vocabulary, semantic classes, and writing style peculiar to the domain. This thesis presents CRYSTAL, an implemented system that automatically induces domain-specific text analysis rules from training examples. CRYSTAL learns rules that approach the performance of hand-coded rules, are robust in the face of noise and inadequate features, and require only a modest amount of training data. CRYSTAL belongs to a class of machine learning algorithms called covering algorithms, and presents a novel control strategy with time and space complexities that are independent of the number of features. CRYSTAL navigates efficiently through an extremely large space of possible rules. CRYSTAL also demonstrates that expressive rule representation is essential for high performance, robust text analysis rules. While simple rules are adequate to capture the most salient regularities in the training data, high performance can only be achieved when rules are expressive enough to reflect the subtlety and variability of unrestricted natural language."

The major goal of this tool is to facilitate the construction of a large knowledge base of semantic patterns. The system acquires semantic patterns from texts with a small amount of user interaction. It acquires new phrasal patterns from the input text, maps each element of the pattern to a meaning frame, generalizes the acquired pattern, and merges it into the current knowledge base. Interaction with the user is introduced at some decision points, where the ambiguity cannot be resolved automatically without other pieces of predefined knowledge. The acquisition process is described in detail, and a preliminary experimental result is discussed.<<ETX>>"

This knowledge engineering bottleneck makes knowledge-based NLP systems impractical for real-world applications because they cannot be easily scaled up or ported to new domains. In response to this problem, we developed a system called AutoSlog that automatically builds a domain-specific dictionary of concepts for extracting information from text. Using AutoSlog, we constructed a dictionary for the domain of terrorist event descriptions in only 5 person-hours. We then compared the AutoSlog dictionary with a hand-crafted dictionary that was built by two highly skilled graduate students and required approximately 1500 person-hours of effort. We evaluated the two dictionaries using two blind test sets of 100 texts each. Overall, the AutoSlog dictionary achieved 98% of the performance of the hand-crafted dictionary. On the first test set, the AutoSlog dictionary obtained 96.3% of the performance of the hand-crafted dictionary. On the second test set, the overall scores were virtually indistinguishable with the AutoSlog dictionary achieving 99.7% of the performance of the handcrafted dictionary."

This paper investigates reducing annotation cost by sample selection. In this approach, the learner examines many unlabeled examples and selects for labeling only those that are most informative at each stage of training. In this way it is possible to avoid redundantly annotating examples that contribute little new information. The paper first analyzes the issues that need to be addressed when constructing a sample selection algorithm, arguing for the attractiveness of committee-based selection methods. We then focus on selection for training probabilistic classifiers, which are commonly applied to problems in statistical natural language processing. We report experimental results of applying a specific type of committee-based selection during training of a stochastic part-of-speech tagger, and demonstrate substantially improved learning rates over complete training using all of the text."

For the Named Entity task, SRA adapted a subset of NameTag's capabilities to the MUC-6 specification. For the Template Element task, SRA fed the full results of NameTag into HASTEN, which performed additional processing to extract and generate the organization and person templates. For the Scenario Template task, SRA fed NameTag's results into HASTEN, which used its full extraction capabilities to extract and generate the management succession templates. Figure 1 illustrates the contribution of each system to the MUC-6 tasks. Due to the relative complexity of the scenario template task, this paper will focus on HASTEN and the experimental results for scenario extraction, and will provide brief descriptions of NameTag and the other tasks."

We propose an extension of the feature-vector representation that allows the value of a feature to be a set of strings; for instance, to represent a small white and black dog with the nominal features size and species and the set-valued feature color, one might use a feature vector with size=small, species=canis-familiaris and color-{white, black}. Since we make no assumptions about the number of possible set elements, this extension of the traditional feature-vector representation is closely connected to Blum's \"infinite attribute\" representation. We argue that many decision tree and rule learning algorithms can be easily extended to set-valued features. We also show by example that many real-world learning problems can be efficiently and naturally represented with set-valued features; in particular, text categorization problems and problems that arise in propositionalizing first-order representations lend themselves to set-valued features."

This book is a complete guide to the C4.5 system as implemented in C for the UNIX environment. It contains a comprehensive guide to the system's use , the source code (about 8,800 lines), and implementation notes. The source code and sample datasets are also available on a 3.5-inch floppy diskette for a Sun workstation. \n \nC4.5 starts with large sets of cases belonging to known classes. The cases, described by any mixture of nominal and numeric properties, are scrutinized for patterns that allow the classes to be reliably discriminated. These patterns are then expressed as models, in the form of decision trees or sets of if-then rules, that can be used to classify new cases, with emphasis on making the models understandable as well as accurate. The system has been applied successfully to tasks involving tens of thousands of cases described by hundreds of properties. The book starts from simple core learning methods and shows how they can be elaborated and extended to deal with typical problems such as missing data and over hitting. Advantages and disadvantages of the C4.5 approach are discussed and illustrated with several case studies. \n \nThis book and software should be of interest to developers of classification-based intelligent systems and to students in machine learning and expert systems courses."

In this paper we regard learning as the phenomenon of knowledge acquisition in the absence of explicit programming. We give a precise methodology for studying this phenomenon from a computational viewpoint. It consists of choosing an appropriate information gathering mechanism, the learning protocol, and exploring the class of concepts that can be learnt using it in a reasonable (polynomial) number of steps. We find that inherent algorithmic complexity appears to set serious limits to the range of concepts that can be so learnt. The methodology and results suggest concrete principles for designing realistic learning systems."

In some situations, active learning is provably more powerful than learning from examples alone, giving better generalization for a fixed number of training examples.In this article, we consider the problem of learning a binary concept in the absence of noise. We describe a formalism for active concept learning calledselective sampling and show how it may be approximately implemented by a neural network. In selective sampling, a learner receives distribution information from the environment and queries an oracle on parts of the domain it considers \u201cuseful.\u201d We test our implementation, called anSG-network, on three domains and observe significant improvement in generalization."

Numerous sources contain information that can be classified as semi-structured. At present, however, the only way to access the information is by browsing individual pages. We cannot query web documents in a database-like fashion based on their underlying structure. However, we can provide database-like querying for semi-structured WWW sources by building wrappers around these sources. We present an approach for semi-automatically generating such wrappers. The key idea is to exploit the formatting information in pages from the source to hypothesize the underlying structure of a page. From this structure the system generates a wrapper that facilitates querying of a source and possibly integrating it with other sources. We demonstrate the ease with which we are able to build wrappers for a number of internet sources in different domains using our implemented wrapper generation toolkit."
