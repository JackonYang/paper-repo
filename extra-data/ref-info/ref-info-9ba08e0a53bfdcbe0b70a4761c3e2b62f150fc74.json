This paper presents a generalization of these algorithms to certain denumerable\u2010state, hidden Markov processes. This algorithm permits automatic training of the stochastic analog of an arbitrary context free grammar. In particular, in contrast to many grammatical inference methods, the new algorithm allows the grammar to have an arbitrary degree of ambiguity. Since natural language is often syntactically ambiguous, it is necessary for the grammatical inference algorithm to allow for this ambiguity. Furthermore, allowing ambiguity in the grammar allows errors in the recognition process to be explicitly modeled in the grammar rather than added as an extra component."

The preprocessors facilitate grammar development. The syntactic analysis module consists of an error correcting maximum likelihood Cocke-Younger-Kasami parser and a context-free covering grammar. The parsar determines the sentence of maximum likelihood accepted by the grammar with respect to a word log likelihood matrix supplied b the acoustic/phonetic component of the speech recognition system. The effectiveness of this type of syntactic analysis was tested in a simulation using a 1040 word vocabulary. Results and error correcting examples are given.<<ETX>>"

In speech recognition, a language model is used to direct the hypothesis search for the sentence that was spoken. In fact, its probability assignments are a factor in evaluating the likelihood that any word string was uttered, and in ordering the word string hypotheses to be examined (1). Language models are also useful in text encoding for compression or transmission, in character recognition of printed or handwritten text, etc. Ideally, the probability assigned by a language model to any word should depend on the entire past sequence of words. However, it is practically impossible to implement such a dependence: 1) The probability estimate involved would have to be extracted from a giant sample of training text containing billions of words; 2) If the probabilities were extractable, sufficient space in computer memory could not be found to store them."

Central to this progress has been the development and application of mathematical methods that permit modeling the speech signal as a complex code with several coexisting levels of structure. The most successful of these are \"template matching,\" stochastic modeling, and probabilistic parsing. The manifestation of common themes such as dynamic programming and finite-state descriptions accentuates a superficial likeness amongst the methods which is often mistaken for the deeper similarity arising from their shared Bayesian foundation. In this paper, we outline the mathematical bases of these methods, invariant metrics, hidden Markov chains, and formal grammars, respectively. We then recount and briefly interpret the results of experiments in speech recognition to which the various methods were applied. Since these mathematical principles seem to bear little resemblance to traditional linguistic characterizations of speech, the success of the experiments is occasionally attributed, even by their authors, merely to excellent engineering. We conclude by speculating that, quite to the contrary, these methods actually constitute a powerful theory of speech that can be reconciled with and elucidate conventional linguistic theories while being used to build truly competent mechanical speech recognizers."

First we give a concise review of the literature with emphasis on the Baum-Welch algorithm. This is followed by a detailed discussion of three issues not treated in the literature: alternatives to the Baum-Welch algorithm; critical facets of the implementation of the algorithms, with emphasis on their numerical properties; and behavior of Markov models on certain artificial but realistic problems. Special attention is given to a particular class of Markov models, which we call \u201cleft-to-right\u201d models. This class of models is especially appropriate for isolated word recognition. The results of the application of these methods to an isolated word, speaker-independent speech recognition experiment are given in a companion paper."

We find that no finite-state Markov process that produces symbols with transition from state to state can serve as an English grammar. Furthermore, the particular subclass of such processes that produce n -order statistical approximations to English do not come closer, with increasing n , to matching the output of an English grammar. We formalize-the notions of \"phrase structure\" and show that this gives us a method for describing language which is essentially more powerful, though still representable as a rather elementary type of finite-state process. Nevertheless, it is successful only when limited to a small subset of simple sentences. We study the formal properties of a set of grammatical transformations that carry sentences with phrase structure into new sentences with derived phrase structure, showing that transformational grammars are processes of the same elementary type as phrase-structure grammars; that the grammar of English is materially simplified if phrase structure description is limited to a kernel of simple sentences from which all other sentences are constructed by repeated transformations; and that this view of linguistic structure gives a certain insight into the use and understanding of language."

Despite its large vocabulary, the Tangora recognizer requires only about 20 minutes of speech from each new user for training purposes. The accuracy of the system and its ease of training are largely attributable to the use of hidden Markov models in its acoustic match component. An automatic technique for constructing Markov word models is described and results are included of experiments with speaker-dependent and speaker-independent models on several isolated-word recognition tasks.<<ETX>>"

The algorithm to be developed is essentially identical to one presented by Vintsyuk [1] and later by Bridle and Brown [2] ; but the notation and the presentation have been clarified. The derivation used for optimally time synchronizing a test pattern, consisting of a sequence of connected words, is straightforward and simple in comparison with other approaches decomposing the pattern matching problem into several levels. The approach presented relies basically on parameterizing the time warping path by a single index and on exploiting certain path constraints both in the word interior and at the word boundaries. The resulting algorithm turns out to be significantly more efficient than those proposed by Sakoe [3] as well as Myers and Rabiner [4], while providing the same accuracy in estimating the best possible matching string. Its most important feature is that the computational expenditure per word is independent of the number of words in the input string. Thus, it is well suited for recognizing comparatively long word sequences and for real-time operation. Furthermore, there is no need to specify the maximum number of words in the input string. The practical implementation of the algorithm is discussed; it requires no heuristic rules and no overhead. The algorithm can be modified to deal with syntactic constraints in terms of a finite state syntax."

Using multiple codebooks of various linear-predictive-coding (LPC) parameters and discrete hidden Markov models (HMMs) the authors obtain a speaker-independent phone recognition accuracy of 58.8-73.8% on the TIMIT database, depending on the type of acoustic and language models used. In comparison, the performance of expert spectrogram readers is only 69% without use of higher level knowledge. The authors introduce the co-occurrence smoothing algorithm, which enables accurate recognition even with very limited training data. Since the results were evaluated on a standard database, they can be used as benchmarks to evaluate future systems. >"

                "text": "Many signals can be modeled as probabilistic functions of Markov chains in which the observed signal is a random vector whose probability density function (pdf) depends on the current state of an underlying Markov chain. Such models are called Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and are useful representations for speech signals in terms of some convenient observations (e.g., cepstral coefficients or pseudolog area ratios). One method of estimating parameters of HMMs is the well-known Baum-Welch reestimation method. For continuous pdf's, the method was known to work only for elliptically symmetric densities. We have recently shown that the method can be generalized to handle mixtures of elliptically symmetric pdf's. Any continuous pdf can be approximated to any desired accuracy by such mixtures, in particular, by mixtures of multivariate Gaussian pdf's. To effectively make use of this method of parameter estimation, it is necessary to understand how it is affected by the amount of training data available, the number of states in the Markov chain, the dimensionality of the signal, etc. To study these issues, Markov chains and random vector generators were simulated to generate training sequences from \u201ctoy\u201d models. The model parameters were estimated from these training sequences and compared to the \u201ctrue\u201d parameters by means of an appropriate distance measure. The results of several such experiments show the strong sensitivity of the method to some (but not all) of the model parameters. A procedure for getting good initial parameter estimates is, therefore, of considerable importance."

                "text": "A vector quantizer is a system for mapping a sequence of continuous or discrete vectors into a digital sequence suitable for communication over or storage in a digital channel. The goal of such a system is data compression: to reduce the bit rate so as to minimize communication channel capacity or digital storage memory requirements while maintaining the necessary fidelity of the data. The mapping for each vector may or may not have memory in the sense of depending on past actions of the coder, just as in well established scalar techniques such as PCM, which has no memory, and predictive quantization, which does. Even though information theory implies that one can always obtain better performance by coding vectors instead of scalars, scalar quantizers have remained by far the most common data compression system because of their simplicity and good performance when the communication rate is sufficiently large. In addition, relatively few design techniques have existed for vector quantizers. During the past few years several design algorithms have been developed for a variety of vector quantizers and the performance of these codes has been studied for speech waveforms, speech linear predictive parameter vectors, images, and several simulated random processes. It is the purpose of this article to survey some of these design techniques and their applications."

The basis of this book is the material contained in the first six chapters of our earlier work, The Design and Analysis of Computer Algorithms. We have expanded that coverage and have added material on algorithms for external storage and memory management. As a consequence, this book should be suitable as a text for a first course on data structures and algorithms. The only prerequisite we assume is familiarity with some high-level programming language such as Pascal."

To a considerable extent the continuous case can be obtained through a limiting process from the discrete case by dividing the continuum of messages and signals into a large but finite number of small regions and calculating the various parameters involved on a discrete basis. As the size of the regions is decreased these parameters in general approach as limits the proper values for the continuous case. There are, however, a few new effects that appear and also a general change of emphasis in the direction of specialization of the general results to particular cases."
