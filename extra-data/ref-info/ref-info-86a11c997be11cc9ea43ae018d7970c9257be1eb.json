Meanwhile, a de-skewed document allows a more compact representation of its components, particularly text objects, such as words, lines, and paragraphs, where they can be represented by their rectilinear bounding boxes. This simplified representation leads to more efficient, robust, as well as simpler algorithms for document image analysis including optical character recognition (OCR). This paper presents a new method for automatic detection of skew in a document image using mathematical morphology. The proposed algorithm is extremely fast as well as independent of script forms."

This paper describes a general solution for detecting tables based on computing an optimal partitioning of a document into some number of tables. A dynamic programming algorithm is given to solve the resulting optimization problem. This high-level framework is independent of any particular table quality measure and independent of the document medium. Moreover, it does not rely on the presence of ruling lines or other table delimiters. We also present table quality measures based on white space correlation and vertical connected component analysis. These measures can be applied equally well to ASCII text and scanned images. We report on some preliminary experiments using this method to detect tables in both ASCII text and scanned images, yielding promising results. We present detailed evaluation of these results using three different criteria which by themselves pose interesting research questions."

To deal with tables that lack all or most of the graphic marks, one must focus on the regularities of the text elements alone. We propose such a method, based on a multi-level analysis of the layout of text components on a page. A general graph representation of the relative positions of blocks of text is exploited."

Each cell of a table is arranged regularly in two dimensions and is represented by a row-column pair. Even in the absence of ruled lines, its coordinates are explicitly found. Thus, it is assumed that an arrangement of textblocks defines the table structure, which is an arrangement of rows and columns, and ruled lines make clear their relationship. This process is composed of two procedures: the expansion of cell bounding boxes and the assignment of row-column numbers to each edge. It is shown that the method can be applied to partially ruled tables with some experimental results.<<ETX>>"

However, these approaches are applicable to only the same kind of documents because they are based on the paradigm that specifies the structure definition information in advance so as to be able to analyze a particular class of documents intelligently. In this paper, the authors propose a method to recognize the layout structures of multi-kinds of table-form document images. For this purpose, the authors introduce a classification tree to manage the relationships among different classes of layout structures. The authors' recognition system has two modes: layout knowledge acquisition and layout structure recognition. In the layout knowledge acquisition mode, table-form document images are distinguished according to this. Classification tree and then the structure description trees which specify the logical structures of table-form documents are generated automatically. While, in the layout structure recognition mode, individual item fields in the table-form document images are extracted and classified successfully by searching the classification tree and interpreting the structure description tree. >"

The cells include several character lines, and our system can convert a table of unknown complex structure into an HTML file.

The resulting T-Recs system takes word bounding box information as input, and outputs the corresponding logical text block units. Starting with an arbitrary word as block seed the algorithm recursively expands this block to all words that interleave with their vertical neighbors. Since even smallest gaps of table columns prevent their words from mutual interleaving, this initial segmentation is able to identify and isolate such columns. In order to deal with some inherent segmentation errors caused by isolated lines, overhanging words, or cells spawning more than one column, a series of postprocessing steps is added. These steps benefit form a very simple distinction between type 1 and type 2 blocks: type 1 blocks are those of at most one word per line, all others are of type 2. This distinction allows the selective application of heuristics to each group of blocks. The conjoint decomposition of column blocks into subsets of table cells leads to the final block segmentation of a homogeneous abstraction level. These segments serve the final layout analysis which identifies table environments and cells that are stretching over several rows and/or columns."

DLs promise to offer more people access to larger document collections, and at far greater speed, than physical libraries can. But DLs also tend, for many reasons, to serve poorly, or even to omit entirely, many types of non-digital human-legible media, such as originally printed and handwritten documents. These media, in their original physical (undigitized) form, are readily - if not always quickly - legible, searchable, and browseable, whereas in the form of document images accessed through DLs they often lose many of their original advantages while of course lacking many advantages of symbolically encoded information. The author explores these issues and illustrates them with brief case studies arising from his experience as a DIA researcher in collaboration with several DL projects in the US. Difficult open DIA technical problems in DL applications are identified in the contrasting advantages of paper and digital displays, at every stage of capture, early processing, recognition, analysis, presentation, retrieval, and in personal and interactive applications. These support the conclusion that the international DIA R & D community is urgently needed (because uniquely qualified) to provide new technology to help rescue from neglect - even, in many cases, eventual oblivion - the world's vast culturally irreplaceable legacy paper document collections."

The procedure is very simple, utilizing only the zerothand the first-order cumulative moments of the gray-level histogram. It is straightforward to extend the method to multithreshold problems. Several experimental results are also presented to support the validity of the method."

Observations perform feature measurements and data lookup, transformations alter or restructure data, and inferences generate and test hypotheses.

Features used for the classification are relative to the text orientation and to its character morphology. Eight classes are extracted among numeric, alphabetic, vertical, horizontal, capitals, etc. Classifiers are multi-layered perceptrons considering firstly global features and refining the classification at each step by looking for more precise features. The recognition rate of the classifiers for 3. 500 cells issued from 19 forms is about 91%."

CyberMagazin'e, which is now under design, can offer all users the same access style currently and generally used by the public when obtaining information from printed materials. In this paper, at first, the architecture of CyberMagazine software is outlined. Theoretical frameworks for managing and manipulating multimedia data and integrating any other related issues in order to implement CyberMagazine are also discussed. Through these issues, it will be possible to orient the system design toward the specifications of multimedia document storage and retrieval. This paper also illustrates the philosophy behind its research and development for capturing an electronic library in the context of library works and multimedia technology. Our approach will also provide a potential for increasing applications such as electronic current awareness services, \"off-the-shelf' document services, automated SOl (Selected Dissemination of Information) services, and more."
