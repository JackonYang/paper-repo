                "text": "This thesis describes a new technique for the representation of three-dimensional objects that is applicable to automation tasks such as recognition and assembly. The primary objective of this representation scheme is to reduce a 3D model into a canonic 2D model that can be used to determine object identity, orientation and location in 3D space. The reduction in dimensionality is based on the notion of factoring the space of all possible perspective projections of an object into a set of characteristic views, where each such view defines a family of projections which are topologically identical. Each characteristic view may be associated with one or more stable positions of the object. A linear transformation is then developed that allows mapping some member of the set of characteristic views to any arbitrary projection of the object to determine orientation and location of the object in 3D space. This transformation is used both for identification and for determining the stable position of the CV into which the arbitrary projection can be transformed. \nA line and junction labeling scheme is developed that is used for classifying the characteristic views into a hierarchy, based on the degeneracy of the projection. The labeling constraints are used at a later stage for guiding the search for matching two line structures. \nThe problem of matching and correlating points between the characteristic view and an arbitrary projection is accomplished in two stages. In the first stage the gray-level image is reduced into a binary image describing the object line-structure. The line-structure is chain-encoded, labeled and the junctions classified. In the second stage a stage-space technique is used for matching silhouettes of the extracted line-structure to the stored characteristic-views. The semantics associated with the lines and junctions are used to prune the search space. Once the silhouettes are matched, one proceeds to determine the transformation that best maps the projection to the stored characteristic view. The transformation is then used for verifying other junction and line labels in the extracted line structure."

The method is used to locate complex industrial parts that may contain several occurrences of local features, such as holes and corners. The matching process utilizes clusters of mutually consistent features to hypothesize objects and also uses templates of objects to verify these hypotheses. The technique is fast because it concentrates on key features that are automatically se lected on the basis of a detailed analysis of computer- aided design (CAD) models of the objects. The automatic analysis applies general-purpose routines for building and analyzing representations of clusters of local features that could be used in procedures to select features for other lo cational strategies. These routines include algorithms for computing the rotational and mirror symmetries of objects in terms of their local features."

If the features are not uniquely characterized by their local appearances, as is often the case in programmable assembly, the matching technique must base its decisions on the relative structure of the features. In this paper we describe a technique that uses the relative positions and orientations of the features to determine the correspondence between features of an object model and features observed in a picture. A graph is constructed in which maximal cliques (i.e., completely connected subgraphs) represent mutually consistent assignments of model features to observed features. The technique is a robust, general-purpose way to match structures. However, in practical applications its use is restricted to moderately sized graphs because the algorithm that locates maximal cliques is apparently exponential. For tasks that require the analysis of large graphs a few techniques are presented to reformulate them so that smaller graphs are sufficient."

The objects are modeled as polyhedra having up to six degrees of freedom relative to the sensors. We show that inconsistent hypotheses about pairings between sensed points and object surfaces can be discarded efficiently by using local constraints on distances between faces, angles between face normals, and angles (relative to the surface normals) of vectors between sensed points. We show by simu lation and by mathematical bounds that the number of hy potheses consistent with these constraints is small. We also show how to recover the position and orientation of the object from the sensory data. The algorithm's performance on data obtained from a triangulation range sensor is illustrated."

Examples are primarily from the domain of manufacturing and design of discrete goods, but the results reported here have wider significance. Mathematical definitions can formalize many of our intuitions about three-dimensional (3-D) objects and operations on them. Representation-free (mathematical) models and functions allow formal properties to be defined for characterizing geometric representations. Three common representation schemes for 3-D objects are described briefly, along with some of their formal and informal properties. A rigorous, as opposed to ad hoc, approach to modeling has several advantages. Broadly, the conceptual complications and ambiguities which are endemic to ad hoc problem statements and solutions may be avoided by appealing to a precise mathematical semantics. Mathematical rigor is mandatory in applications such as automatic manufacturing in which correctness must be guaranteed and consistency and validity maintained."

Compliant motions are quite difficult for humans to specify, however. Furthermore, robot programs are quite sensitive to details of geometry and to error characteristics and must, therefore, be constructed anew for each task. These factors motivate the search for automatic synthesis tools for robot program ming, especially for compliant motion. This paper describes a formal approach to the synthesis of compliant-motion strategies from geometric descriptions of assembly operations and explicit estimates of errors in sensing and control. A key aspect of the approach is that it provides criteriafor correct ness of compliant-motion strategies."
