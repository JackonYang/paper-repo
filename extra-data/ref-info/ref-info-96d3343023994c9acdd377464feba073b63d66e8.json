Computer vision and deep learning have been suggested as a first solution to classify documents based on their visual appearance. However, achieving the fine-grained classification that is required in real-world setting cannot be achieved by visual analysis alone. Often, the relevant information is in the actual text content of the document. We design a multimodal neural network that is able to learn from word embeddings, computed on text extracted by OCR, and from the image. We show that this approach boosts pure image accuracy by 3% on Tobacco3482 and RVL-CDIP augmented by our new QS-OCR text dataset (this https URL), even without clean text information."

The BoVW is widely used within the computer vision community for scene classification or object recognition but few applications for the classification of entire document images have been submitted. While previous attempts have been showing disappointing results by combining visual and textual features with the Borda-count technique, we're proposing here a combination through learning approach. Experiments conducted on a 1925 document image industrial database reveal that this fusion scheme significantly improves the classification performances. Our concluding contribution deals with the choosing and tuning of the BoW and/or BoVW techniques in an industrial context."

However, many of these approaches rely on parameters and architectures designed for classifying natural images, which differ from document images. We question whether this is appropriate and conduct a large empirical study to find what aspects of CNNs most affect performance on document images. Among other results, we exceed the state-of-the-art on the RVL-CDIP dataset by using shear transform data augmentation and an architecture designed for a larger input image. Additionally, we analyze the learned features and find evidence that CNNs trained on RVL-CDIP learn region-specific layout features."

In object and scene analysis, deep neural nets are capable of learning a hierarchical chain of abstraction from pixel inputs to concise and descriptive representations. The current work explores this capacity in the realm of document analysis, and confirms that this representation strategy is superior to a variety of popular handcrafted alternatives. Extensive experiments show that (i) features extracted from CNNs are robust to compression, (ii) CNNs trained on non-document images transfer well to document analysis tasks, and (iii) enforcing region-specific feature-learning is unnecessary given sufficient training data. This work also makes available a new labelled subset of the IIT-CDIP collection, containing 400,000 document images across 16 categories."

By noisy, we mean any text obtained through an extraction process (affected by errors) from media other than digital texts (e.g., transcriptions of speech recordings extracted with a recognition system). The performance of a categorization system over the clean and noisy (word error rate between /spl sim/ 10 and /spl sim/ 50 percent) versions of the same documents is compared. The noisy texts are obtained through handwriting recognition and simulation of optical character recognition. The results show that the performance loss is acceptable for recall values up to 60-70 percent depending on the noise sources. New measures of the extraction process performance, allowing a better explanation of the categorization results, are proposed."

Especially in the domain of text analytics, it has a significant impact as data cleaning forms a very large part of the data processing cycle. Noisy unstructured text is common in informal settings such as on-line chat, SMS, email, newsgroups and blogs, automatically transcribed text from speech, and automatically recognized text from printed or handwritten material. Gigabytes of such data is being generated everyday on the Internet, in contact centers, and on mobile phones. Researchers have looked at various text mining issues such as pre-processing and cleaning noisy text, information extraction, rule learning, and classification for noisy text. This paper focuses on the issues faced by automatic text classifiers in analyzing noisy documents coming from various sources. The goal of this paper is to bring out and study the effect of different kinds of noise on automatic text classification. Does the nature of such text warrant moving beyond traditional text classification techniques? We present detailed experimental results with simulated noise on the Reuters- 21578 and 20-newsgroups benchmark datasets. We present interesting results on real-life noisy datasets from various CRM domains."

On the test data, we achieved top-1 and top-5 error rates of 37.5% and 17.0%, respectively, which is considerably better than the previous state-of-the-art. The neural network, which has 60 million parameters and 650,000 neurons, consists of five convolutional layers, some of which are followed by max-pooling layers, and three fully connected layers with a final 1000-way softmax. To make training faster, we used non-saturating neurons and a very efficient GPU implementation of the convolution operation. To reduce overfitting in the fully connected layers we employed a recently developed regularization method called \"dropout\" that proved to be very effective. We also entered a variant of this model in the ILSVRC-2012 competition and achieved a winning top-5 test error rate of 15.3%, compared to 26.2% achieved by the second-best entry."

This package focuses on bringing machine learning to non-specialists using a general-purpose high-level language. Emphasis is put on ease of use, performance, documentation, and API consistency. It has minimal dependencies and is distributed under the simplified BSD license, encouraging its use in both academic and commercial settings. Source code, binaries, and documentation can be downloaded from http://scikit-learn.sourceforge.net."
