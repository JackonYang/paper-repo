The algorithms we propose make use of typical characteristics of text in videos in order to enhance segmentation and, consequently, recognition performance. As a result, we get segmented characters from video pictures. These can be parsed by any OCR software. The recognition results of multiple instances of the same character throughout subsequent frames are combined to enhance recognition result and to compute the final output. We have tested our segmentation algorithms in a series of experiments with video clips recorded from television and achieved good segmentation results."

In digital video libraries, such captions represent a highly condensed form of key information on the contents of the video. In this paper we propose a scheme to automatically detect the presence of captions embedded in video frames. The proposed method operates on reduced image sequences which are efficiently reconstructed from compressed MPEG video and thus does not require full frame decompression. The detection, extraction and analysis of embedded captions help to capture the highlights of visual contents in video documents for better organization of video, to present succinctly the important messages embedded in the images, and to facilitate browsing, searching and retrieval of relevant clips."

The purpose of this paper is to construct a multimedia database of TV news images based on telop character recognition. The first step is to detect telop frames and to segment the characters by differentiating the telop frames based on the fact that character regions have high brightness and the character edges are clear. The second step is the telop character recognition. It is performed by a subspace method using direction histogram features. The third step is indexing by extracting noun words after morphological analysis of the recognized telop characters. These noun words correspond with key words and are given to TV news articles as their indices. Finally TV news articles are classified into 10 topics such as politics, economics, culture, amusements, sports and so on based on the extracted indices. We employed an index-topic table to classify the articles using indices. The telop character recognition rate was 65.7% and the article classification rate was 67.3%."

Scene images are segmented into regions by an image segmentation method based on adaptive thresholding. Character candidate regions are detected by observing gray-level differences between adjacent regions. To ensure extraction of multisegment characters as well as single-segment characters, character pattern candidates are obtained by associating the detected regions according to their positions and gray levels. A character recognition process selects patterns with high similarities by calculating the similarities between character pattern candidates and the standard patterns in a dictionary and then comparing the similarities to the thresholds. A relaxational approach to determine character patterns updates the similarities by evaluating the interactions between categories of patterns, and finally character patterns and their recognition results are obtained. Highly promising experimental results have been obtained using the method on 100 images involving characters of different sizes and formats under uncontrolled lighting. >"
