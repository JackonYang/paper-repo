In this paper we describe a general solution to the problem of recognizing the structure of a detected table region. First hierarchial clustering is used to identify columns and then spatial and lexical criteria to classify headers. We also address the problem of evaluating table structure recognition. Our model is based on a directed acyclic attribute graph, or table DAG. We describe a new paradigm, 'random graph probing,' for comparing the results returned by the recognition system and the representation created during ground-truthing. Probing is in fact a general concept that could be applied to other document recognition tasks and perhaps even other computer vision problems as well."

A precise definition of \"tabularity\" remains elusive because some bureaucratic forms, multicolumn text layouts, and schematic drawings share many characteristics of tables. There are significant differences between typeset tables, electronic files designed for display of tables, and tables in symbolic form intended for information retrieval. Although most research to date has addressed the extraction of low-level geometric information from scanned raster images of paper tables, the recent trend toward the analysis of tables in electronic form may pave the way to a higherl evel of table understanding. \n \nRecent research on table composition and table analysis has improved ourunde rstanding of the distinction between the logical and physical structures of tables, and has led to improved formalisms for modeling tables. The present study indicates that progress on half-a-dozen specific research issues would open the door to using existing paper and electronic tables for database update, tabular browsing, structured information retrieval through graphical and audio interfaces, multimedia table editing, and platform-independent display. \n \nAlthough tables are not a conventional format for conveying the primary content of technical papers, here we attempt to subdue our natural garrulity by adopting this genre to communicate what we have to say about tables entirely in tabular form."

Changing the target language may involve simultaneous changes in symbol sets, typefaces, sizes of text, page layouts, linguistic contexts, and imaging defects. The strategy has been to isolate the effects of these sources of variation within separate, independent engineering subsystems. In this way, it has been possible to construct, with a minimum of manual effort, classifiers for arbitrary combinations of symbols, typefaces, sizes, and imaging defects. An attempt has been made to rid the algorithms of all language-specific rules, relying instead on automatic learning from examples and generalized table-driven methods. For some tasks it has been feasible to avoid language dependency altogether. Linguistic context can be exploited through data-directed filtering algorithms in a uniform and modular manner, so that preexisting tools developed by computational linguistics can readily be applied. These principles are illustrated by trials on English, Swedish, Tibetan, and special technical texts. >"

A generic model is designed to support the different stages of tabular composition, including the editing of logical structure, the specification of layout structure, and the formatting of concrete tables. The model separates table's logical structure from its layout structure, which consists of tabular topology and typographic style. The notion of an abstract table, which describes the logical relationships among tabular items, is formally defined and a set of logical operations is proposed to manipulate tables based on these logical relationships. An abstract table can be visualized through a layout structure specified by a set of topological rules, which determine the relative placement of tabular items in two dimensions, and a set of style rules, which determine the final appearance of different items. The absolute placement of a concrete table can be automatically generated by applying a layout specification to an abstract line. An NP-complete problem arises in the formatting process that uses automatic line breaking and determines the physical dimension of a table to satisfy user-specified size constraints. An algorithm has been designed to solve the formatting problem in polynomial time for typical tables. Based on the tabular model, a prototype tabular composition system has been implemented in a UNIX, X Windows environment. This prototype provides an interactive interface to edit the logical structure, the topology and the styles of tables. It allows us to manipulate tables based on the logical relationships tabular items, regardless of where the items are placed in the layout structure, and capable of presenting a table in different topologies and styles so that we can select a high-quality layout structure."
