The argument repeatedly goes from the particular to the general, in that if there are general theories then they must apply to special cases. Two such special cases, formalised as the \u201cCox axioms \u201c, lead to the well-known fact that Bayesian probability theory is the only consistent language of inference. Further cases, formalised as the axioms of maximum entropy, show that the prior probability distribution for any positive, additive distribution must be monotonic in the entropy. Finally, a quantified special case shows that this monotonic function must be the exponential, leaving only a single dimensional scaling factor to be determined a posteriori. Many types of distribution, including probability distributions themselves, are positive and additive, so the entropy exponential is very general."

Using a communication-theory model for the process of image formation, we find that the most likely object has a maximum entropy and is represented by a restoring formula that is positive and not band limited. The derivation is an adaptation to optics of a formulation by Jaynes for unbiased estimates of positive probability functions. The restoring formula is tested, via computer simulation, upon noisy images of objects consisting of random impulses. These are found to be well restored, with resolution often exceeding the Rayleigh limit and with a complete absence of spurious detail. The proviso is that the noise in each image input must not exceed about 40% of the signal image. The restoring method is applied to experimental data consisting of line spectra. Results are consistent with those of the computer simulations."

It has a privileged position as the only consistent method for combining different data into a single image. It has been used most spectacularly in radio astronomical interferometry, where it deals routinely with images of up to a million pixels, and high dynamic range. We also give examples of optical deconvolutions and tomographic reconstructions to illustrate the generality of application and the quality of maximum entropy images. Some types of data, a such as Fourier intensitites, are inadepquate in themselves to produce a good image. The maximum entropy method allows us to incorporate extra, Prior knowledge about the object being imaged, and we give examples of this technique being used in specectroscopy. The nonlinearities inherent in the a state-of-the-art example of `blind' deconvolution in which an unknown object is blurred with an unknown point-spread-function: maximum entropy can recover both."

Pixel gray levels and the presence and orientation of edges are viewed as states of atoms or molecules in a lattice-like physical system. The assignment of an energy function in the physical system determines its Gibbs distribution. Because of the Gibbs distribution, Markov random field (MRF) equivalence, this assignment also determines an MRF image model. The energy function is a more convenient and natural mechanism for embodying picture attributes than are the local characteristics of the MRF. For a range of degradation mechanisms, including blurring, nonlinear deformations, and multiplicative or additive noise, the posterior distribution is an MRF with a structure akin to the image model. By the analogy, the posterior distribution defines another (imaginary) physical system. Gradual temperature reduction in the physical system isolates low energy states (``annealing''), or what is the same thing, the most probable states under the Gibbs distribution. The analogous operation under the posterior distribution yields the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the image given the degraded observations. The result is a highly parallel ``relaxation'' algorithm for MAP estimation. We establish convergence properties of the algorithm and we experiment with some simple pictures, for which good restorations are obtained at low signal-to-noise ratios."

Asymptotic analyses are presented for a selection of practical optimizing methods applied to a model deconvolution problem. These methods include the discrepancy principle, cross-validation and maximum likelihood. The relationship between optimality and regularity is emphasized. New bounds on the constants appearing in asymptotic estimates are presented."
