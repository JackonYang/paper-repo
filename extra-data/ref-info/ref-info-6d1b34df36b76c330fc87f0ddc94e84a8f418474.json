The approach provides a means for controlling and reducing quantizing noise in the coding. Each sub-band is quantized with an accuracy (bit allocation) based upon perceptual criteria. As a result, the quality of the coded signal is improved over that obtained from a single full-band coding of the total spectrum. In one implementation, the individual sub-bands are low-pass translated before coding. In another, \u201cinteger-band\u201d sampling is employed to alias the signal in an advantageous way before coding. Other possibilities extend to complex demodulation of the sub-bands, and to representing the sub-band signals in terms of envelopes and phase-derivatives. In all techniques, adaptive quantization is used for the coding, and a parsimonious allocation of bits is made across the bands. Computer simulations are made to demonstrate the signal qualities obtained for codings at 16 and 9.6 kb/s."

A frequency dmnain interpretation of the interpolation process, through which it is clear that interpolation is fundamentally a linear filtering process, is presented, An examination of the relative merits of finite duration impulse response (FIR) and infinite duration impulse response (IIR) digital filters as interpolation filters indicates that FIR filters are generally to be preferred for interpolation. It is shown that linear interpolation and classical polynomial interpolation correspond to the use of the FIR interpolation filter. The use of classical interpolation methods in signal processing applications is illustrated by a discussion of FIR interpolation filters derived from the Lagrange interpolation formula. The limitations of these filters lead us to a consideration of optimum FIR filters for interpolation that can be designed using linear programming techniques. Examples are presented to illustrate the significant improvements that are obtained using the optimum filters."
