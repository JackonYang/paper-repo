The algorithm is trainable for any given document image population and is capable of detecting words on a document image simultaneously. We describe an experimental protocol to train and evaluate our word segmentation algorithm based on a set of layout ground-truthed document images. We also discussed a method to compare two sets of word bounding boxes-one from the ground truth and the other from the output of the word segmentation algorithm, and compute the numbers of miss, false, correct splitting, merging and spurious detections. The experimental results demonstrate that under the optimal algorithm parameter settings, the correct word detection percentage is about 95% on both the training and testing image populations. If this includes the splitting and merging detections, the detection percentage is about 99.4%."

In this dissertation, we present a unified document image structure extraction algorithm that is probability based, where the probabilities are estimated from an extensive training set of various kinds of measurements of distances between the terminal and non-terminal entities with which the algorithm works. The off-line probabilities estimated in the training then drive all decisions in the on-line segmentation module. An iterative, relaxation-like method is used to find the partitioning solution that maximizes the joint probability. This approach can be uniformly apply to the construction of the document hierarchy at any level. We have implemented a text line segmentation algorithm and a text block extraction algorithm using this framework. Another example is the development of a system that detects and recognizes special symbols (Greek letters, mathematical symbols, etc.) on technical document pages, that are not handled by the current Optical Character Recognition (OCR) systems. \nA large quantity of ground-truth data, varying in quality, is required in order to give an accurate measurement of the performance of an algorithm under different conditions. \nWe have constructed the University of Washington English Document Image Database-III, which contains 1600 scanned scientific/technical document image pages that come with manually edited ground-truth of entity bounding boxes and properties. Based on the ground-truth data, we can evaluate the performance of document analysis algorithms and build statistical models to characterize various types of document image structures. In this dissertation, we present a set of quantitative performance metrics for each kind of information a document image analysis technique infers. The text line and text block extraction algorithms were trained and evaluated on the UW-III database using a cross-validation method. The text line extraction algorithm identifies and segments 99.76% of text lines correctly, while the preliminary result of the text block extraction shows 91% accuracy."

For languages like English one can assume, to a first approximation, that word boundaries are given by whitespace or punctuation. In various Asian languages, including Chinese, on the other hand, whitespace is never used to delimit words, so one must resort to lexical information to \"reconstruct\" the word-boundary information. In this paper we present a stochastic finite-state model wherein the basic workhorse is the weighted finite-state transducer. The model segments Chinese text into dictionary entries and words derived by various productive lexical processes, and---since the primary intended application of this model is to text-to-speech synthesis---provides pronunciations for these words. We evaluate the system's performance by comparing its segmentation \"judgments\" with the judgements of a pool of human segmenters, and the system is shown to perform quite well."

This is achieved by exploiting a small number of nearly universal typesetting and layout conventions. The system does not require prior knowledge of page orientation (module 90/spl deg/), and copes well with nonzero skew and shear angles (within 10/spl deg/). Also it locates blocks of text without reliance on detailed a priori layout models, and in spite of unknown or mixed horizontal and vertical text-line orientations. Within blocks, it infers text-line orientation and isolates lines, without knowledge of the language, symbol set, text sizes, or the number of text lines. Segmentation into words and symbols, and determination of reading order, normally require some knowledge of the language: this is held to minimum by relying on shape-driven algorithms. The underlying algorithms are based on Fourier theory, digital signal processing, computational geometry, and statistical decision theory. Most of the computation occurs within algorithms that possess unambiguous semantics (that is, heuristics are kept to a minimum). The effectiveness of the method on English, Japanese, Hebrew, Thai, and Korean documents is discussed.<<ETX>>"

After a brief survey of font recognition issues, we present the advantages of a font software support in the design of recognition systems. Concrete algorithms are proposed in the subtopics of a posteriori font recognition, monofont Optical Character Recognition (OCR), and word segmentation. The reported experiments and results indicate that there are still substantial benefits to expect from the design of typographyaware analyzers."

However, an arithmetic coding scheme is a fractional-bit compression algorithm which is known to be time consuming. In this article, we change the direction to study how to cascade the word segmentation model with a faster alternative, the integral-bit compression algorithm. It is shown that the cascaded algorithm is more suitable for practical usage. Among several word-based integral-bit compression algorithms, WLZSSHUF achieves the best compression results. Not only can it achieve a comparable compression ratio with a PPM compressor, COMP-2, it demonstrates a faster compression and decompression speed. In the last part of this article, the relation between the accuracy of the word segmentation model (match ratio) and the performance of the compression algorithm (compression ratio) are analyzed. By varying the match ratio, it was discovered that the growth rate of the compression ratio is content-dependent and close to linear. The results of our study will help the practitioners of information retrieval to design word-based compression algorithms for Chinese. This is particularly useful to multilingual digital libraries in which a massive volume of data is often involved."
