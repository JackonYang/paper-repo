Logical labels have to be attributed to text blocks composing the layout structure. Our study is based on physical characteristics having a visual aspect: typographic, geometric and/or topologic attributes. Our objective is to map a low level logical structure, which consists of a set of logical labels, on the extracted layout structure components. We have to build a model that allows this mapping. However, the documents we consider have various layout and logical structures, thus, we chose to perform this task by supervised learning on the basis of a set of training documents. This allows us to define a generic method to solve this problem, without imposing any constraint on document structure. We propose a probabilistic model represented by a Bayesian Network (BN), which is a graphical model used in our problem as a classifier. A prototype has been implemented, and applied to tables of contents in periodicals."

                "text": "Recent work in supervised learning has shown that a surprisingly simple Bayesian classifier with strong assumptions of independence among features, called naive Bayes, is competitive with state-of-the-art classifiers such as C4.5. This fact raises the question of whether a classifier with less restrictive assumptions can perform even better. In this paper we evaluate approaches for inducing classifiers from data, based on the theory of learning Bayesian networks. These networks are factored representations of probability distributions that generalize the naive Bayesian classifier and explicitly represent statements about independence. Among these approaches we single out a method we call Tree Augmented Naive Bayes (TAN), which outperforms naive Bayes, yet at the same time maintains the computational simplicity (no search involved) and robustness that characterize naive Bayes. We experimentally tested these approaches, using problems from the University of California at Irvine repository, and compared them to C4.5, naive Bayes, and wrapper methods for feature selection."

This assumption is necessary to guarantee that the networks that are created by the genetic algorithms are legal Bayesian network structures.

A prototype is used for the electronic consulting of scientific papers in a digital library system named Calliope. This method operates on a roughly structured ASCII file, produced by OCR. The recognition approach operates by text labelling without using any a priori model. Labelling is based on part-of-speech tagging (PoS) which is initiated by a primary labelling of text components using some specific dictionaries. Significant tags are first grouped into homogeneous classes according to their grammar categories and then reduced in canonical forms corresponding to article fields: \u201ctitle\u201d and \u201cauthors\u201d. Non-labelled tokens are integrated in one or another field by either applying PoS correction rules or using a structure model generated from well-detected articles. The designed prototype operates very well on different ToC layouts and character recognition qualities. Without manual intervention, a 96.3% rate of correct segmentation was obtained on 38 journals, including 2,020 articles, accompanied by a 93.0% rate of correct field extraction."

The second part of the paper describes a rough logical structure by analyzing the typography, aiming to extract relevant information about the logical layout by combining information about colors, typography, and the physical structural layout for use by an automatic document indexation system. Character prototypes were automatically extracted by grouping characters which have the same binary patterns. We suggest using this character-grouping method to extract typographical information and recognize different font styles and sizes used in the document."

Nous avons developpe une approche hybride (structurelle et probabiliste) combinant un reseau bayesien classifieur et un automate probabiliste integres dans une representation arborescente hierarchique de la structure logique. Nous avons procede par apprentissage supervise, et dans ce cadre, nous avons utilise la programmation genetique. Nous avons experimente notre approche sur des sommaires de revues et de periodiques et les resultats obtenus peuvent etre qualifies de satisfaisants.

Potential applications include computer-assisted hypothesis testing, automated scientific discovery, and automated construction of probabilistic expert systems. We extend the basic method to handle missing data and hidden (latent) variables. We show how to perform probabilistic inference by averaging over the inferences of multiple belief networks. Results are presented of a preliminary evaluation of an algorithm for constructing a belief network from a database of cases. Finally, we relate the methods in this paper to previous work, and we discuss open problems."
