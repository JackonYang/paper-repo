TINA integrates key ideas from context free grammars, Augmented Transition Networks (ATN's), and the unification concept. TINA provides a seamless interface between syntactic and semantic analysis, and also produces a highly constraining probabilistic language model to improve recognition performance. An initial set of context-free rewrite rules provided by hand is first converted to a network structure. Probability assignments on all arcs in the network are obtained automatically from a set of example sentences. The parser uses a stack decoding search strategy, with a top-down control flow, and includes a feature-passing mechanism to deal with long-distance movement, agreement, and semantic constraints. TINA provides an automatic sentence generation capability that has been effective for identifying overgeneralization problems as well as in producing a word-pair language model for a recognizer. The parser is currently integrated with MIT's SUMMIT recognizer for use in two application domains, with the parser screening recognizer outputs either at the sentential level or to filter partial theories during the active search process."

In this paper, I describe SPATTER, a statistical parser based on decision-tree learning techniques which constructs a complete parse for every sentence and achieves accuracy rates far better than any published result. This work is based on the following premises: (1) grammars are too complex and detailed to develop manually for most interesting domains; (2) parsing models must rely heavily on lexical and contextual information to analyze sentences accurately; and (3) existing n-gram modeling techniques are inadequate for parsing models. In experiments comparing SPATTER with IBM's computer manuals parser, SPATTER significantly outperforms the grammar-based parser. Evaluating SPATTER against the Penn Treebank Wall Street Journal corpus using the PARSEVAL measures, SPATTER achieves 86% precision, 86% recall, and 1.3 crossing brackets per sentence for sentences of 40 words or less, and 91% precision, 90% recall, and 0.5 crossing brackets for sentences between 10 and 20 words in length."

In contrast, BBN's PLUM system (Probabilistic Language Understanding Model) was developed as part of a DARPA-funded research effort on integrating probabilistic language models with more traditional linguistic techniques. Our research and development goals are\u2022 more rapid development of new applications,\u2022 the ability to train (and re-train) systems based on user markings of correct and incorrect output,\u2022 more accurate selection among interpretations when more than one is found, and\u2022 more robust partial interpretation when no complete interpretation can be found."

They begin with improved modeling of the grammar statistics, based on a combination of the backing-off technique and zero-frequency techniques. These are extended to be more amenable to the particular system considered here. The resulting technique is greatly simplified, more robust, and gives improved recognition performance over either of the previous techniques. The authors also consider the problem of robustness of a model based on a small training corpus by grouping words into obvious semantic classes. This significantly improves the robustness of the resulting statistical grammar. A technique that allows the estimation of a high-order model on modest computation resources is also presented. This makes it possible to run a 4-gram statistical model of a 50-million word corpus on a workstation of only modest capability and cost. Finally, the authors discuss results from applying a 2-gram statistical language model integrated in the HMM (hidden Markov model) search, obtaining a list of the N-best recognition results, and rescoring this list with a higher-order statistical model.<<ETX>>"

Tests were conducted using the Wall Street Journal-based Continuous Speech Recognition (WSJ-CSR) corpus and the Air Travel Information System (ATIS) corpus collected by the Multi-site ATIS Data COllection Working (MADCOW) Group. The WSJ-CSR tests consist of tests of large vocabulary (lexicons of 5,000 to more than 20,000 words) continuous speech recognition systems. The ATIS tests consist of tests of (1) ATIS-domain spontaneous speech (lexicons typically less than 2,000 words), (2) natural language understanding, and (3) spoken language understanding. These tests were reported on and discussed in detail at the Spoken Language Systems Technology Workshop held at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, January 20-22, 1993."

Probabilities (a) and (b) are computed incrementally in a single left-to-right pass over the input. Our algorithm compares favorably to standard bottom-up parsing methods for SCFGs in that it works efficiently on sparse grammars by making use of Earley's top-down control structure. It can process any context-free rule format without conversion to some normal form, and combines computations for (a) through (d) in a single algorithm. Finally, the algorithm has simple extensions for processing partially bracketed inputs, and for finding partial parses and their likelihoods on ungrammatical inputs."
