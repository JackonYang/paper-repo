A genuinely discrete scale-space theory is developed and its connection to the continuous scale-space theory is explained. Special attention is given to discretization effects, which occur when results from the continuous scale-space theory are to be implemented computationally. The 1D problem is solved completely in an axiomatic manner. For the 2D problem, the author discusses how the 2D discrete scale space should be constructed. The main results are as follows: the proper way to apply the scale-space theory to discrete signals and discrete images is by discretization of the diffusion equation, not the convolution integral; the discrete scale space obtained in this way can be described by convolution with the kernel, which is the discrete analog of the Gaussian kernel, a scale-space implementation based on the sampled Gaussian kernel might lead to undesirable effects and computational problems, especially at fine levels of scale; the 1D discrete smoothing transformations can be characterized exactly and a complete catalogue is given; all finite support 1D discrete smoothing transformations arise from repeated averaging over two adjacent elements (the limit case of such an averaging process is described); and the symmetric 1D discrete smoothing kernels are nonnegative and unimodal, in both the spatial and the frequency domain. >"

We denote a one-dimensional kernel a scale-space kernel if it reduces the number of local extrema and discuss which discrete kernels are possible scale-space kernels. Unimodality and positivity properties are shown to hold for such kernels as well as their Fourier transforms. An explicit expression characterizing all discrete scale-space kernels is given.We propose that there is only one reasonable way to define a scale-space family of images L(x; t) for a one-dimensional discrete signal f(x) namely by convolution with the family of discrete kernels T(n; t) = e^(-t) I_nt(t) where I_n is the modified Bessel function of order n.With this representation, comprising a continuous scale parameter, we are no longer restricted to specific predetermined levels of scale. Further, T(n; t) appears naturally in the solution of a discretized version of the heat equation, both in one and two dimensions.The family T(n; t) (t >= 0) is the only one-parameter family of discrete symmetric shift-invariant kernels satisfying both necessary scale-space requirements and the semigroup property T(n; s) * T(n; t) = T(n; s+t). Similar arguments applied in the continuous case uniquely lead to the family of Gaussian kernels.The commonly adapted technique with a sampled Gaussian produces undesirable effects. It is shown that scale-space violations might occur in the family of functions generated by convolution with the sampled Gaussian kernel. The result exemplifies that properties derived in the continuous case might be violated after discretization.A discussion about the numerical implementation is performed and an algorithm generating the filter coefficients is supplied."

The representation gives a qualitative description of the image structure that allows for detection of stable scales and regions of interest in a solely bottom-up data-driven way. In other words, it generates coarse segmentation cues and can be hence seen as preceding further processing, which can then be properly tuned. The authors argue that once such information is available many other processing tasks can become much simpler. Experiments on real imagery demonstrate that the proposed theory gives perceptually intuitive results.<<ETX>>"

In contrast to conventional scale-space approaches, this method omits any smoothing or blurring and performs grouping operations on symbolic shape tokens residing in a scale-space blackboard data structure. Two types of grouping operation are introduced: (1) fine-to-coarse aggregation of primitive-edge tokens builds coarser-scale edge maps from finer-scale information; and (2) pairwise grouping of symmetrically placed primitive edges gives rise to a primitive partial region token denoting curved-contour, primitive-corner, and bar events. The resulting collection of tokens makes the fundamental edge and region components of a shape's geometry available to later symbolic processes, leading to shape recognition or other tasks.<<ETX>>"

                "text": "An introduction is given to a theory of early visual information processing. The theory has been implemented, and examples are given of images at various stages of analysis. It is argued that the first step of consequence is to compute a primitive but rich description of the grey-level changes present in an image. The description is expressed in a vocabulary of kinds of intensity change (EDGE, SHADING-EDGE, EXTENDED-EDGE, LINE, BLOB etc.). Modifying parameters are bound to the elements in the description, specifying their POSITION, ORIENTATION, TERMINATION points, CONTRAST, SIZE and FUZZINESS. This description is obtained from the intensity array by fixed techniques, and it is called the primal sketch. For most images, the primal sketch is large and unwieldy. The second important step in visual information processing is to group its contents in a way that is appropriate for later recognition. From our ability to interpret drawings with little semantic content, one may infer the presence in our perceptual equipment of symbolic processes that can define \"place-tokens\" in an image in various ways, and can group them according to certain rules. Homomorphic techniques fail to account for many of these grouping phenomena, whose explanations require mechanisms of construction rather than mechanisms of detection. The necessary grouping of elements in the primal sketch may be achieved by a mechanism that has available the processes inferred from above, together with the ability to select items by first order discriminations acting on the elements' parameters. Only occasionally do these mechanisms use downward-flowing information about the contents of the particular image being processed. It is argued that \"non-attentive\" vision is in practice implemented by these grouping operations and first order discriminations acting on the primal sketch. The class of computations so obtained differs slightly from the class of second order operations on the intensity array. The extraction of a form from the primal sketch using these techniques amounts to the separation of figure from ground. It is concluded that most of the separation can be carried out by using techniques that do not depend upon the particular image in question. Therefore, figure-ground separation can normally precede the description of the shape of the extracted form. Up to this point, higher-level knowledge and purpose are brought to bear on only a few of the decisions taken during the processing. This relegates the widespread use of downward-flowing information to a later stage than is found in current machine-vision programs, and implies that such knowledge should influence the control of, rather than interfering with, the actual data-processing that is taking place lower down."

It is shown that the second derivative of the contrast function at the critical point is related to the classification of the associated edge as being phantom or authentic. The contrast of authentic edges decreases with filter scale, while the contrast of phantom edges are shown to increase with scale. As the filter scale increases, an authentic edge must either turn into a phantom edge or join with a phantom edge and vanish. The points in the scale space at which these events occur are seen to be singular points of the contrast function. Using ideas from singularity, or catastrophy theory, the scale map contours near these singular points are found to be either vertical or parabolic. >"

(1) Intensity changes, which occur in a natural image over a wide range of scales, are detected separately at different scales. An appropriate filter for this purpose at a given scale is found to be the second derivative of a Gaussian, and it is shown that, provided some simple conditions are satisfied, these primary filters need not be orientation-dependent. Thus, intensity changes at a given scale are best detected by finding the zero values of \u22072G(x, y)* I(x, y) for image I, where G(x, y) is a two-dimensional Gaussian distribution and \u22072 is the Laplacian. The intensity changes thus discovered in each of the channels are then represented by oriented primitives called zero-crossing segments, and evidence is given that this representation is complete. (2) Intensity changes in images arise from surface discontinuities or from reflectance or illumination boundaries, and these all have the property that they are spatially localized. Because of this, the zero-crossing segments from the different channels are not independent, and rules are deduced for combining them into a description of the image. This description is called the raw primal sketch. The theory explains several basic psychophysical findings, and the operation of forming oriented zero-crossing segments from the output of centre-surround \u22072G filters acting on the image forms the basis for a physiological model of simple cells (see Marr & Ullman 1979)."

The goal is to relate the results of this analysis to the structure of the picture, which is determined by the physics of the image generation process. Candidates for contour points are the maximal magnitudes of the gray-value gradient for different scales in the direction of the gradient. Based on the output of such a bank of gradient filters, a procedure is proposed to select automatically a suitable scale, and with that, the size of the right convolution kernel. The application of poorly adapted filters, which make the exact localization of gray-value corners or T-, X-, and Y-junctions more difficult, is thus avoided. Possible gaps at such junctions are discussed for images of real scenes, and possibilities for the closure of some of these gaps are demonstrated when the extrema of the magnitudes of the gray-value gradients are used. >"

For any given curve Gamma , the process of generating the ordered sequence of curves ( Gamma /sub sigma / mod sigma >or=0) is the evolution of Gamma . It is shown that the normalized arc length parameter of a curve is, in general, not the normalized arch length parameter of a convolved version of that curve. A novel method of computing the curvature scale space image reparametrizes each convolved curve by its normalized arc length parameter. Zeros of curvature are then expressed in that new parametrization. The result is the renormalized curvature scale-space image and is more suitable for matching curves similar in shape. Scaling properties of planar curves and the curvature scale space image are also investigated. It is shown that no new curvature zero-crossings are created at the higher scales of the curvature scale space image of a planar curve in C/sub 1/ if the curve remains in C/sub 1/ during evolution. Several results are presented on the preservation of various properties of planar curves under the evolution process.<<ETX>>"

It involves a) the representation of the image by a structure that captures essential image information and then b) the definition of a hierarchy of components of that structure by the order of annihilation of those components as the image is continuously simplified by lowering the scale. The information-capturing \"essential structure\" is chosen so that image regions are associated with each structure component during the image simplification. To guarantee image simplification, successive Gaussian blurring is chosen as the means of scale lowering. We argue that an essential structure that describes shape in both the spatial and intensity dimensions will produce an image description most likely to be useful for computer or human specification of image objects. In particular, we suggest that the intensity axis of symmetry (IAS) satisfies all desirable criteria for an essential structure. With such shape-based essential structures the approach of image description via annihilation under image simplification becomes a very attractive paradigm."

The technique involves generating a multiscale description of a histogram by convolving it with a series of Gaussians of gradually increasing width (standard deviation), and marking the location and direction of the sign change of zero-crossings in the second derivative. The resulting description, or fingerprint, is interpreted by relating pairs of zero-crossings to modes in the histogram where each mode or component is modeled by a normal distribution. Zero-crossings provide information from which estimates of the mixture parameters are computed. These initial estimates are subsequently refined using an iterative maximum likelihood estimation technique. Varying the scale or resolution of the analysis allows the number of components used in approximating the histogram to be controlled."

The result, in two or three dimensions, is a figure\u00bfrather than boundary\u00bforiented shape description that has natural segments and is insensitive to noise in the object description. The general approach of hierarchy production by following a feature through successive resolution reduction will be presented, as will methods of resolution reduction and computer implementation.

It can be approximated by a piecewise straight curve composed of edgels, i.e., short, linear edge-elements, each characterized by a direction and a position. The approach to edgel-detection here, is to fit a series of one-dimensional surfaces to each window (kernel of the operator) and accept the surface-description which is adequate in the least squares sense and has the fewest parameters. (A one-dimensional surface is one which is constant along some direction.) The tanh is an adequate basis for the stepedge and its combinations are adequate for the roofedge and the line-edge. The proposed method of step-edgel detection is robust with respect to noise; for (step-size/\u00bfnoise) \u00bf 2.5, it has subpixel position localization (\u00bfposition < \u00bf) and an angular localization better than 10\u00b0; further, it is designed to be insensitive to smooth shading. These results are demonstrated by some simple analysis, statistical data, and edgelimages. Also included is a comparison of performance on a real image, with a typical operator (Difference-of-Gaussians). The results indicate that the proposed operator is superior with respect to detection, localization, and resolution."

The representation differs from established techniques in that the code elements are localized in spatial frequency as well as in space. Pixel-to-pixel correlations are first removed by subtracting a lowpass filtered copy of the image from the image itself. The result is a net data compression since the difference, or error, image has low variance and entropy, and the low-pass filtered image may represented at reduced sample density. Further data compression is achieved by quantizing the difference image. These steps are then repeated to compress the low-pass image. Iteration of the process at appropriately expanded scales generates a pyramid data structure. The encoding process is equivalent to sampling the image with Laplacian operators of many scales. Thus, the code tends to enhance salient image features. A further advantage of the present code is that it is well suited for many image analysis tasks as well as for image compression. Fast algorithms are described for coding and decoding."

These regions can provide the basis for scene analysis (including shape-parameter calculation) or surface-based, shaded-graphics display. The algorithm creates a tree structure for image description by defining a linking relationship between pixels in successively blurred versions of the initial image. The image is described in terms of nested light and dark regions. This algorithm, successfully implemented in one, two, and three dimensions, can theoretically work with any number of dimensions. The interactive postprocessing developed technique selects regions from the descriptive tree for display in several ways: pointing to a branch of the image description tree, specifying by sliders the range of scale and/or intensity of all regions which should be displayed, and pointing (on the original image) to any pixel in the desired region. The algorithm has been applied to approximately 15 computer tomography (CT) images of the abdomen. >"

The success of the approach depends on the definition of a comprehensive set of goals for the computation of edge points. These goals must be precise enough to delimit the desired behavior of the detector while making minimal assumptions about the form of the solution. We define detection and localization criteria for a class of edges, and present mathematical forms for these criteria as functionals on the operator impulse response. A third criterion is then added to ensure that the detector has only one response to a single edge. We use the criteria in numerical optimization to derive detectors for several common image features, including step edges. On specializing the analysis to step edges, we find that there is a natural uncertainty principle between detection and localization performance, which are the two main goals. With this principle we derive a single operator shape which is optimal at any scale. The optimal detector has a simple approximate implementation in which edges are marked at maxima in gradient magnitude of a Gaussian-smoothed image. We extend this simple detector using operators of several widths to cope with different signal-to-noise ratios in the image. We present a general method, called feature synthesis, for the fine-to-coarse integration of information from operators at different scales. Finally we show that step edge detector performance improves considerably as the operator point spread function is extended along the edge."

Through regularization, they may be reformulated as well-posed variational principles whose solutions are computable. Standard regularization theory employs quadratic stabilizing functionals that impose global smoothness constraints on possible solutions. Discontinuities present serious difficulties to standard regularization, however, since their reconstruction requires a precise spatial control over the smoothing properties of stabilizers. This paper proposes a general class of controlled-continuity stabilizers which provide the necessary control over smoothness. These nonquadratic stabilizing functionals comprise multiple generalized spline kernels combined with (noncontinuous) continuity control functions. In the context of computational vision, they may be thought of as controlled-continuity constraints. These generic constraints are applicable to visual reconstruction problems that involve both continuous regions and discontinuities, for which global smoothness constraints fail."

Support for this idea comes from three sources: the obvious utility of intrinsic characteristics for higher-level scene analysis; the apparent ability of humans to determine these characteristics, regardless of viewing conditions or familiarity with the scene; and a theoretical argument that such a description is obtainable, by a noncognitive and nonpurposive process, at least, for simple scene domains. The central problem in recovering intrinsic scene characteristics is that the information is confounded in the original light-intensity image: a single intensity value encodes all the characteristics of the corresponding scene point. Recovery depends on exploiting constraints, derived from assumptions about the nature of the scene and the physics of the imaging process."

Even the best edge operators can not reliably detect these two-dimensional features. This contribution proposes a solution to the two-dimensional problem. In this paper, I address the following: \u2022 'L'-junction detection. Previous attempts, relying on the second differentials of the image surface have essentially measured image curvature. Recently Harris [Harris 87] implemented a 'corner' detector that is based only on first differentials. I provide a mathematical proof to explain how this algorithm estimates image curvature. Although this algorithm will isolate image 'L'junctions, its performance cannot be predicted for T'-junctions and other higher order image structures. \u2022 Instead, an image representation is proposed that exploits the richness of the local differential geometrical 'topography ' of the intensity surface. Theoretical and experimental results are presented which demonstrate how idealised instances of two-dimensional surface features such as junctions can be characterised by the differential geometry of a simple facet model. \u2022 Preliminary results are very encouraging. Current studies are concerned with the extension to real data. I am investigating statistical noise models to provide a measure of 'confidence' in the geometric labelling. The richness and sparseness of a two-dimensional structure can be exploited in many high-level vision processes. I intend to use my representation to explore some of these fields in future work."

If these ordinates are the values of a known analytic function F(x), then the problem of interpolation between these ordinates has an obvious and precise meaning: we are required to compute intermediate values F(x) to the same accuracy to which the ordinates are known. Undoubtedly, the most convenient tool for the solution of this problem is the polynomial central interpolation method. It uses the polynomial of degree k \u2014 1, interpolating k successive ordinates, as an approximation to F(x) only within a unit interval in x, centrally located with respect to its k defining ordinates. Assuming k fixed, successive approximating arcs for F(x) are thus obtained which present discontinuities on passing from one arc to the next if k is odd, or discontinuities in their first derivatives if k is even (see section 2.121). Actually these discontinuities are irrelevant in our present case of an analytic function F(x). Indeed, if the interpolated values obtained are sufficiently accurate, these discontinuities will be apparent only if we force the computation beyond the intrinsic accuracy of the y n."

This representation is constructed by detecting peaks and ridges in the difference of lowpass (DOLP) transform. Descriptions of shapes which are encoded in this representation may be matched efficiently despite changes in size, orientation, or position. Motivations for a multiple resolution representation are presented first, followed by the definition of the DOLP transform. Techniques are then presented for encoding a symbolic structural description of forms from the DOLP transform. This process involves detecting local peaks and ridges in each bandpass image and in the entire three-dimensional space defined by the DOLP transform. Linking adjacent peaks in different bandpass images gives a multiple resolution tree which describes shape. Peaks which are local maxima in this tree provide landmarks for aligning, manipulating, and matching shapes. Detecting and linking the ridges in each DOLP bandpass image provides a graph which links peaks within a shape in a bandpass image and describes the positions of the boundaries of the shape at multiple resolutions. Detecting and linking the ridges in the DOLP three-space describes elongated forms and links the largest peaks in the tree. The principles for determining the correspondence between symbols in pairs of such descriptions are then described. Such correspondence matching is shown to be simplified by using the correspondence at lower resolutions to constrain the possible correspondence at higher resolutions."

The apparent changes in texture element properties can be analyzed to recover information about the physical layout of the scene. In practice it is difficult to identify texture elements, especially in images where the texture elements are partially occluded or are themselves textured at a finer scale. To solve this problem, it is necessary to integrate the extraction of texture elements with the recognition of scene layout. This paper presents a method for recovering the orientation of textured surfaces while simultaneously identifying texture elements. Candidate texture elements are constructed from overlapping circular regions of relatively uniform gray level. The uniform circular regions are found by convolving the image with Del sq G (Laplacian-of-Gaussian) masks over a range of scales, and comparing the convolution output to that expected for a circular disk of constant gray level. True texture elements are selected from the set of candidate texture elements by finding the planar surface that best predicts the properties of the candidate texture elements. A planar fit is evaluated by comparing the predicted texture-element areas to the actual areas of the candidate texture elements. The planar fit receiving support from the most regions is chosen as the correct interpretation."

A critical, intermediate goal of edge detection is the detection and characterization of significant intensity changes. This paper discusses this part of the edge detection problem. To characterize the types of intensity changes derivatives of different types, and possibly different scales, are needed. Thus, we consider this part of edge detection as a problem in numerical differentiation. We show that numerical differentiation of images is an ill-posed problem in the sense of Hadamard. Differentiation needs to be regularized by a regularizing filtering operation before differentiation. This shows that this part of edge detection consists of two steps, a filtering step and a differentiation step. Following this perspective, the paper discusses in detail the following theoretical aspects of edge detection. 1) The properties of different types of filters-with minimal uncertainty, with a bandpass spectrum, and with limited support-are derived. Minimal uncertainty filters optimize a tradeoff between computational efficiency and regularizing properties. 2) Relationships among several 2-D differential operators are established. In particular, we characterize the relation between the Laplacian and the second directional derivative along the gradient. Zero crossings of the Laplacian are not the only features computed in early vision. 3) Geometrical and topological properties of the zero crossings of differential operators are studied in terms of transversality and Morse theory."

The authors present steps towards this goal by considering the inference of surfaces from three-dimensional images. Only smooth surfaces are considered and the focus is on the coupled problems of inferring the trace points (the points through which the surface passes) and estimating the associated differential structure given by the principal curvature and direction fields over the estimated smooth surfaces. Computation of these fields is based on determining an atlas of local charts or parameterizations at estimated surface points. Algorithm robustness and the stability of results are essential for analyzing real images; to this end, the authors present a functional minimization algorithm utilizing overlapping local charts to refine surface points and curvature estimates, and develop an implementation as an iterative constraint satisfaction procedure based on local surface smoothness properties. Examples of the recovery of local structure are presented for synthetic images degraded by noise and for clinical magnetic resonance images. >"

We show that the condition number of such a stiffness matrix behaves like O((log \u03ba)2) where \u03ba is the condition number of the stiffness matrix with respect to a nodal basis. In the case of a triangulation with uniform mesh sizeh this means that the stiffness matrix with respect to a hierarchical basis of the finite element space has a condition number behaving like\n$$O\\left( {\\left( {\\log \\frac{1}{h}} \\right)^2 } \\right)$$\n instead of\n$$O\\left( {\\left( {\\frac{1}{h}} \\right)^2 } \\right)$$\n for a nodal basis. The proofs of our theorems do not need any regularity properties of neither the continuous problem nor its discretization. Especially we do not need the quasiuniformity of the employed triangulations. As the representation of a finite element function with respect to a hierarchical basis can be converted very easily and quickly to its representation with respect to a nodal basis, our results mean that the method of conjugate gradients needs onlyO(log n) steps andO(n log n) computer operations to reduce the energy norm of the error by a given factor if one uses hierarchical bases or related preconditioning procedures. Heren denotes the dimension of the finite element space and of the discrete linear problem to be solved."

The DOLP is a reversible transform which converts an image into a set of bandpass images. A DOLP transform is shown to require O(N2) multiplies and produce O(N log(N)) samples from an N sample image. When Gaussian low-pass filters are used, the result is a set of images which have been convolved with difference of Gaussian (DOG) filters from an exponential set of sizes. A fast computation technique based on ``resampling'' is described and shown to reduce the DOLP transform complexity to O(N log(N)) multiplies and O(N) storage locations. A second technique, ``cascaded convolution with expansion,'' is then defined and also shown to reduce the computational cost to O(N log(N)) multiplies. Combining these two techniques yields an algorithm for a DOLP transform that requires O(N) storage cells and requires O(N) multiplies."

The central problem in structural pattern matching is to determine the correspondence between the symbols which comprise a model and symbols which describe a pattern. The difficulty of determining this correspondence depends critically on the representation that is used to describe patterns. This correspondence presents a probabilistic representation for structural models of pattern classes. Both pattern descriptions and models for pattern classes are based on symbols which represent grayscale information at multiple resolutions. A pattern description is given by a tree of symbols with attribute values. Structural models are represented by a tree of symbols with probabilistic attributes. The position and scale (resolution) of the symbols, as well as other ``features,'' are represented by these attributes. An algorithm is presented for determining the correspondence between symbols in a description of a pattern and symbols in a model of a pattern class. This algorithm uses the connectivity between symbols at different scales to constrain the search for correspondence. An interactive training program for learning models of pattern classes is described, and some conclusions from the work are presented."

This technique is applied to register a Landsat aerial image of an area (corrected for skew) to a map containing the shorelines of the same area. The shorelines are extracted from the Landsat image by forming a histogram of the gray-level distribution of pixels in the image and finding the land and water peaks in that histogram. The value at the trough between the two peaks is then used to threshold the image. Contours of dark regions in the resulting binary image are taken to be the shorelines. The Uniform Cost algorithm is used to find the least cost matches of the \"scale-space images\" of shorelines extracted from the Landsat image and those in the map giving priority to matches at higher levels of scale. A subset of those matches which are consistent are chosen to estimate the parameters of an affine transformation from the image to the map using a least squares method."

These features, called \u201ctextons\u201d, are elongated blobs (e.g., rectangles, ellipses, or line segments) with specific properties, including color, angular orientation, width, length, binocular and movement disparity, and flicker rate. The ends-of-lines (terminators) and crossings of line segments are also textons. Only differences in the textons or in their density (or number) can be preattentively detected while the positional relationship between neighboring textons passes unnoticed. This kind of positional information is the essence of form perception, and can be extracted only by a time-consuming and spatially restricted process that we call \u201cfocal attention\u201d. The aperture of focal attention can be very narrow, even restricted to a minute portion of the fovea, and shifting its locus requires about 50 ms. Thus preattentive vision serves as an \u201cearly warning system\u201d by pointing out those loci of texton differences that should be attended to. According to this theory, at any given instant the visual information intake is relatively modest."

                "text": "Multiresolution representations are very effective for analyzing the information in images. In this dissertation we develop such a representation for general purpose low-level processing in computer vision. We first study the properties of the operator which approximates a signal at a finite resolution. We show that the difference of information between the approximation of a signal at the resolutions 2$\\sp{j+1}$ and 2$\\sp{j}$ can be extracted by decomposing this signal on a wavelet orthonormal basis of ${\\bf L}({\\bf R}\\sp{n}$). In ${\\bf L}\\sp2({\\bf R})$, a wavelet orthonormal basis is a family of functions $\\left\\lbrack\\sqrt{2\\sp{j}}\\ \\psi(2\\sp{j}x+n)\\right\\rbrack\\sb{(j,n)\\in{\\rm Z}\\sp2}$, which is built by dilating and translating a unique function $\\psi(x)$, called a wavelet. This decomposition defines an orthogonal multiresolution representation called a wavelet representation. It is computed with a pyramidal algorithm of complexity n log(n). We study the application of this signal representation to data compression in image coding, texture discrimination and fractal analysis. The multiresolution approach to wavelets enables us to characterize the functions $\\psi(x) \\in {\\bf L}\\sp2({\\bf R})$ which generate an orthonormal basis. \nThe inconvenience of a linear multiresolution decomposition is that it does not provide a signal representation which translates when the signal translates. It is therefore difficult to develop pattern recognition algorithms from such representations. In the second part of the dissertation we introduce a nonlinear multiscale transform which translates when the signal is translated. This representation is based upon the zero-crossings and local energies of a multiscale transform called the dyadic wavelet transform. We experimentally show that this representation is complete and that we can reconstruct the original signal with an iterative algorithm. We study the mathematical properties of this decomposition and show that it is well adapted to computer vision. To illustrate the efficiency of this Energy Zero-Crossings representation, we have developed a coarse to find matching algorithm on stereo epipolar scan lines. While we stress the applications towards computer vision, wavelets are useful to analyze other types of signal such as speech and seismic-waves."

                "text": "Abstract The general problem of visual search can be shown to be computationally intractable in a formal, complexity-theoretic sense, yet visual search is extensively involved in everyday perception, and biological systems manage to perform it remarkably well. Complexity level analysis may resolve this contradiction. Visual search can be reshaped into tractability through approximations and by optimizing the resources devoted to visual processing. Architectural constraints can be derived using the minimum cost principle to rule out a large class of potential solutions. The evidence speaks strongly against bottom-up approaches to vision. In particular, the constraints suggest an attentional mechanism that exploits knowledge of the specific problem being solved. This analysis of visual search performance in terms of attentional influences on visual information processing and complexity satisfaction allows a large body of neurophysiological and psychological evidence to be tied together."

In the same paper of 1930 the author showed that (1) is certainly variationdiminishing if the matrix A does not possess two minors of equal orders and of opposite signs; also the converse holds to a certain extent: If (1) is variation-diminishing, then A cannot have two minors of equal orders and of opposite signs, provided the rank of A is = n. The necessary and sufficient conditions in order that (1) be variation-diminishing were found in 1933 by Th. Motzkin 3). Since they will be used in this paper we state them here as follows: Let r be the rank of A then A should not have two minors of equal orders and of opposite signs if their common order is < r, while if their common order is = r then again they should never be of opposite signs if they belong to the same combination of r columns of A."

Frequently employed generating kernels are compared to the optimal kernel that assures minimal information loss after the resolution reduction, i.e., the one corresponding to an ideal low pass filter.

The amount of computation required for generation of the image pyramid can be reduced significantly by employing half-band filters as components of the optimal kernel. Image pyramids generated by the optimal kernel show a better command of details than the ones generated by a simple 4 \u00d7 4 averaging, or a computationally equivalent kernel."

This paradigm considers vision as a general recognition problem (recognition of objects, patterns or situations). To demonstrate the usefulness of the framework, the design of the Medusa of CVL is described. It is noted that this machine can perform complex visual tasks without reconstructing the world. If it is provided with intentions, knowledge of the environment, and planning capabilities, it can perform highly sophisticated navigational tasks. It is explained why the traditional structure from motion problem cannot be solved in some cases and why there is reason to be pessimistic about the optimal performance of a structure from motion module. New directions for future research on this problem in the recovery paradigm, e.g., research on stability or robustness, are suggested.<<ETX>>"

Thus, elucidation of the spatiotemporal filtering characteristics of these mechanisms has become one of the major tasks of psychophysics. In general, of course, it is to be expected that complex interactions will occur between mechanisms responding to neighboring portions of the retinal image; and we know this to be true for the processing of movement and depth information. Fortunately, experimental paradigms have been developed which have enabled us to estimate mechanism characteristics at a lower level than that at which these interactions occur. This article will focus on two of these techniques and the resulting characterization of human spatiotemporal mechanisms."

Fluctuations of integrals involving I2(t) are discussed in section 3.9. The probability distribution of a sine wave plus a noise current is given in 3.10 and in 3.11 an alternative method of deriving the results of Part III is mentioned. Prof. Uhlenbeck has pointed out that much of the material in this Part is closely connected with the theory of Markoff processes. Also S. Chandrasekhar has written a review of a class of physical problems which is related, in a general way, to the present subject.22"

We describe a \"parts\" representation that is fairly general purpose, despite having only a small number of parameters. Having this expressive power captured by a small number of parameters allows us to approach the problem of recovering an object's part structure by use of minimal length encoding. We present several examples of recovering part structure using various types of range imagery to show that the recovery procedure is robust."

This theorem is often quoted but relatively little understood in the engineering literature. In this tutorial paper we prove the Szegio theorem for the special case of finite-order Toeplitz matrices.

This evaluation led to the conclusion that Haralick's method performed the best, and the \u00bf2G operator performed the worst. The implementation of the \u00bf2G operator, on which this evaluation was based, differed significantly from that used by Marr and Hildreth. Evaluation of the performance of the Marr-Hildreth implementation of the \u00bf2G operator on similar images shows that this edge detection method in fact performs comparably to the Prewitt and Haralick operators."

A computer has been programmed to drive the cart through cluttered indoor and outdoor spaces, gaining its knowledge of the world entirely from images broadcast by the onboard TV system. The cart uses several kinds of stereo to locate objects around it in 3D and to deduce its own motion. It plans an obstacle avoiding path to a desired destination on the basis of a model built with this information. The plan changes as the cart perceives new obstacles on its journey. The system is reliable for short runs, but slow. The cart moves one meter every ten to fifteen minutes, in lurches. After rolling a meter it stops, takes some pictures and thinks about them for a long time. Then it plans a new path, executes a little of it, and pauses again. The program has successfully driven the cart through several 20 meter indoor courses (each taking about five hours) complex enough to necessitate three or four avoiding swerves. A less successful outdoor run, in which the cart skirted two obstacles but collided with a third, was also done. Harsh lighting (very bright surfaces next to very dark shadows) giving poor pictures and movement of shadows during the cart's creeping progress were major reasons for the poorer outdoor performance. The action portions of these runs were filmed by computer controlled cameras. (Author)"

The method is applicable to any linear optical element with variable focusing strength along the reference orbit. Results for the vertical and horizontal focal lengths agree with previous calculations for a zero gradient magnet and an added correction to the dispersion is found for this case. A correction to the fringe field gradient peculiar to a combined-function magnet with strong edge focusing is also found. The influence of edge focusing on the tunes and chromaticities of the NSLS rings is described. The improved chromaticity calculation for the booster was of particular interest since this ring has bending magnets with poletips shaped to achieve small positive chromaticities."
