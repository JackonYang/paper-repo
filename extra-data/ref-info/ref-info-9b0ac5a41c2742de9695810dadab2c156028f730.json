We have attempted to uncouple sources of variation in the input - irnaging defects, page layouts, sizes of text, symbol sets, font styles, linguistic contexts, and transliteration encodings - so that each can be managed by an independent subsystem. In pursuit of this goal, new algorithms have been required. For example. page layout analysis is virtually language-independent due to the use of a global-to-local strategy; but this demanded unusually fast and accurate algorithms for skew- and shear-correction and for analysis of the structure of white space. To permit arbitrary combinations of symbol sets, font styles, and image defect distributions for specialized classifiers, we developed a hybrid structuraVstatistica1 recognition technology, trained by examples generated by a pseudo-random image defect model. Character segmentation is driven by classifier confidence scores, with the result that language-specific rules are rarely needed. Linguistic context, such as provided by dictionaries, is exploited by a series of data-directed filtering algorithms in a uniform and modular manner."

Although carefully proofread, the books were poorly printed and posed a severe challenge to conventional page-layout analysis and character-recognition methods. An experimental page-reader system performed strictly top-down layout analysis for identification of columns, lines, words, and characters. This proceeded rapidly and reliably thanks to a recently developed skew-estimation technique. Resegmentation of broken, touching, and dirty characters was handled in an efficient and integrated manner by a heuristic search operating on isolated words. By analyzing the syntax of game descriptions and applying the rules of chess, the error rate was reduced by a factor of 30 from what was achievable through shape analysis alone. Several computer vision systems integration issues suggested by this experience are discussed. >"

The structure of the background (white space) is analyzed, assisted by an enumeration of all maximal white rectangles. For this enumeration, the most computationally expensive step, an algorithm has been developed that, aside from a sort, achieves an expected runtime linear in the number of black connected components. The crucial engineering decision is the specification of a partial order on white rectangles to express domain-specific knowledge of preferred shapes and sizes. This order determines a sequence of partial covers of the background, and thus, a sequence of nested page segmentations. In experimental trials on Manhattan layouts, good segmentations often occur early in this sequence, using a simple and uniform shape-direction rule. This is a global-to-local strategy, which for some tasks is superior to strategies currently emphasized in the literature, including bottom-up and top-down.<<ETX>>"

The system combines several techniques in order to improve the overall recognition rate. Thinning and shape extraction are performed directly on a graph of the run-length encoding of a binary image. The resulting strokes and other shapes are mapped, using a shape-clustering approach, into binary features which are then fed into a statistical Bayesian classifier. Large-scale trials have shown better than 97 percent top choice correct performance on mixtures of six dissimilar fonts, and over 99 percent on most single fonts, over a range of point sizes. Certain remaining confusion classes are disambiguated through contour analysis, and characters suspected of being merged are broken and reclassified. Finally, layout and linguistic context are applied. The results are illustrated by sample pages."

The character segmentation phase extracts characters from a text line. Connected components in a text line image may have to be segmented or combined to form recognizable characters. For example, the character \u2018i\u2019 is formed by combining two components. Touching characters are segmented to identify each character. Segmenting touching characters is an open problem, whose solution would advance the field. Touching characters have several candidates for their break position, which are then confirmed by recursive segmentation and recognition, and finally by the determination of the linguistic context. There are several possible candidates at each stage. For example, several candidates for the break position of touching characters are nominated. Any segmented area might possibly fit several alternative characters. Therefore, an efficient resolution of ambiguity at each stage is significantly critical and indispensable for practical text reading. The authors\u2019 approach is based on knowledge about character composition (e.g. an \u2018m\u2019 is like a combination of an \u2018r\u2019 and an \u2018n\u2019), as well as knowledge about omni-fonts. Knowledge about character composition compresses the number of recursive segmentation and recognition."
