                "text": "Many successful models for scene or object recognition transform low-level descriptors (such as Gabor filter responses, or SIFT descriptors) into richer representations of intermediate complexity. This process can often be broken down into two steps: (1) a coding step, which performs a pointwise transformation of the descriptors into a representation better adapted to the task, and (2) a pooling step, which summarizes the coded features over larger neighborhoods. Several combinations of coding and pooling schemes have been proposed in the literature. The goal of this paper is threefold. We seek to establish the relative importance of each step of mid-level feature extraction through a comprehensive cross evaluation of several types of coding modules (hard and soft vector quantization, sparse coding) and pooling schemes (by taking the average, or the maximum), which obtains state-of-the-art performance or better on several recognition benchmarks. We show how to improve the best performing coding scheme by learning a supervised discriminative dictionary for sparse coding. We provide theoretical and empirical insight into the remarkable performance of max pooling. By teasing apart components shared by modern mid-level feature extractors, our approach aims to facilitate the design of better recognition architectures."

Pooling is used to achieve invariance to image transformations, more compact representations, and better robustness to noise and clutter. Several papers have shown that the details of the pooling operation can greatly influence the performance, but studies have so far been purely empirical. In this paper, we show that the reasons underlying the performance of various pooling methods are obscured by several confounding factors, such as the link between the sample cardinality in a spatial pool and the resolution at which low-level features have been extracted. We provide a detailed theoretical analysis of max pooling and average pooling, and give extensive empirical comparisons for object recognition tasks."

We first propose a simple yet efficient way of aggregating local image descriptors into a vector of limited dimension, which can be viewed as a simplification of the Fisher kernel representation. We then show how to jointly optimize the dimension reduction and the indexing algorithm, so that it best preserves the quality of vector comparison. The evaluation shows that our approach significantly outperforms the state of the art: the search accuracy is comparable to the bag-of-features approach for an image representation that fits in 20 bytes. Searching a 10 million image dataset takes about 50ms."

This approach is quite flexible, and permits recognition based on color, texture, and particularly shape, in a homogeneous framework. While nearest neighbor classifiers are natural in this setting, they suffer from the problem of high variance (in bias-variance decomposition) in the case of limited sampling. Alternatively, one could use support vector machines but they involve time-consuming optimization and computation of pairwise distances. We propose a hybrid of these two methods which deals naturally with the multiclass setting, has reasonable computational complexity both in training and at run time, and yields excellent results in practice. The basic idea is to find close neighbors to a query sample and train a local support vector machine that preserves the distance function on the collection of neighbors. Our method can be applied to large, multiclass data sets for which it outperforms nearest neighbor and support vector machines, and remains efficient when the problem becomes intractable for support vector machines. A wide variety of distance functions can be used and our experiments show state-of-the-art performance on a number of benchmark data sets for shape and texture classification (MNIST, USPS, CUReT) and object recognition (Caltech- 101). On Caltech-101 we achieved a correct classification rate of 59.05%(\u00b10.56%) at 15 training images per class, and 66.23%(\u00b10.48%) at 30 training images."

Most systems use only one stage of feature extraction in which the filters are hard-wired, or two stages where the filters in one or both stages are learned in supervised or unsupervised mode. This paper addresses three questions: 1. How does the non-linearities that follow the filter banks influence the recognition accuracy? 2. does learning the filter banks in an unsupervised or supervised manner improve the performance over random filters or hardwired filters? 3. Is there any advantage to using an architecture with two stages of feature extraction, rather than one? We show that using non-linearities that include rectification and local contrast normalization is the single most important ingredient for good accuracy on object recognition benchmarks. We show that two stages of feature extraction yield better accuracy than one. Most surprisingly, we show that a two-stage system with random filters can yield almost 63% recognition rate on Caltech-101, provided that the proper non-linearities and pooling layers are used. Finally, we show that with supervised refinement, the system achieves state-of-the-art performance on NORB dataset (5.6%) and unsupervised pre-training followed by supervised refinement produces good accuracy on Caltech-101 (\u226b 65%), and the lowest known error rate on the undistorted, unprocessed MNIST dataset (0.53%)."

Kernel-based classification methods can learn complex decision boundaries, but a kernel over unordered set inputs must somehow solve for correspondences \u2013 generally a computationally expensive task that becomes impractical for large set sizes. We present a new fast kernel function which maps unordered feature sets to multi-resolution histograms and computes a weighted histogram intersection in this space. This \u201cpyramid match\u201d computation is linear in the number of features, and it implicitly finds correspondences based on the finest resolution histogram cell where a matched pair first appears. Since the kernel does not penalize the presence of extra features, it is robust to clutter. We show the kernel function is positive-definite, making it valid for use in learning algorithms whose optimal solutions are guaranteed only for Mercer kernels. We demonstrate our algorithm on object recognition tasks and show it to be accurate and dramatically faster than current approaches."

This technique works by partitioning the image into increasingly fine sub-regions and computing histograms of local features found inside each sub-region. The resulting \"spatial pyramid\" is a simple and computationally efficient extension of an orderless bag-of-features image representation, and it shows significantly improved performance on challenging scene categorization tasks. Specifically, our proposed method exceeds the state of the art on the Caltech-101 database and achieves high accuracy on a large database of fifteen natural scene categories. The spatial pyramid framework also offers insights into the success of several recently proposed image descriptions, including Torralba\u2019s \"gist\" and Lowe\u2019s SIFT descriptors."

However, in the feature quantization process of sparse coding, some similar local features may be quantized into different visual words of the codebook due to the sensitiveness of quantization. In this paper, to alleviate the impact of this problem, we propose a Laplacian sparse coding method, which will exploit the dependence among the local features. Specifically, we propose to use histogram intersection based kNN method to construct a Laplacian matrix, which can well characterize the similarity of local features. In addition, we incorporate this Laplacian matrix into the objective function of sparse coding to preserve the consistence in sparse representation of similar local features. Comprehensive experimental results show that our method achieves or outperforms existing state-of-the-art results, and exhibits excellent performance on Scene 15 data set."

Kernel-based classification methods can learn complex decision boundaries, but a kernel over unordered set inputs must somehow solve for correspondences epsivnerally a computationally expensive task that becomes impractical for large set sizes. We present a new fast kernel function which maps unordered feature sets to multi-resolution histograms and computes a weighted histogram intersection in this space. This \"pyramid match\" computation is linear in the number of features, and it implicitly finds correspondences based on the finest resolution histogram cell where a matched pair first appears. Since the kernel does not penalize the presence of extra features, it is robust to clutter. We show the kernel function is positive-definite, making it valid for use in learning algorithms whose optimal solutions are guaranteed only for Mercer kernels. We demonstrate our algorithm on object recognition tasks and show it to be accurate and dramatically faster than current approaches"

Despite its popularity, these nonlinear SVMs have a complexity O(n2 ~ n3) in training and O(n) in testing, where n is the training size, implying that it is nontrivial to scaleup the algorithms to handle more than thousands of training images. In this paper we develop an extension of the SPM method, by generalizing vector quantization to sparse coding followed by multi-scale spatial max pooling, and propose a linear SPM kernel based on SIFT sparse codes. This new approach remarkably reduces the complexity of SVMs to O(n) in training and a constant in testing. In a number of image categorization experiments, we find that, in terms of classification accuracy, the suggested linear SPM based on sparse coding of SIFT descriptors always significantly outperforms the linear SPM kernel on histograms, and is even better than the nonlinear SPM kernels, leading to state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks by using a single type of descriptors."

This paper presents a simple but effective coding scheme called Locality-constrained Linear Coding (LLC) in place of the VQ coding in traditional SPM. LLC utilizes the locality constraints to project each descriptor into its local-coordinate system, and the projected coordinates are integrated by max pooling to generate the final representation. With linear classifier, the proposed approach performs remarkably better than the traditional nonlinear SPM, achieving state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks. Compared with the sparse coding strategy [22], the objective function used by LLC has an analytical solution. In addition, the paper proposes a fast approximated LLC method by first performing a K-nearest-neighbor search and then solving a constrained least square fitting problem, bearing computational complexity of O(M + K2). Hence even with very large codebooks, our system can still process multiple frames per second. This efficiency significantly adds to the practical values of LLC for real applications."

While this is a necessity in order to generalize beyond a given set of training images, it is also a very difficult problem due to the high variability of visual appearance within each class. In the last years substantial performance gains on challenging benchmark datasets have been reported in the literature. This progress can be attributed to two developments: the design of highly discriminative and robust image features and the combination of multiple complementary features based on different aspects such as shape, color or texture. In this paper we study several models that aim at learning the correct weighting of different features from training data. These include multiple kernel learning as well as simple baseline methods. Furthermore we derive ensemble methods inspired by Boosting which are easily extendable to several multiclass setting. All methods are thoroughly evaluated on object classification datasets using a multitude of feature descriptors. The key results are that even very simple baseline methods, that are orders of magnitude faster than learning techniques are highly competitive with multiple kernel learning. Furthermore the Boosting type methods are found to produce consistently better results in all experiments. We provide insight of when combination methods can be expected to work and how the benefit of complementary features can be exploited most efficiently."

After reviewing existing edge and gradient based descriptors, we show experimentally that grids of histograms of oriented gradient (HOG) descriptors significantly outperform existing feature sets for human detection. We study the influence of each stage of the computation on performance, concluding that fine-scale gradients, fine orientation binning, relatively coarse spatial binning, and high-quality local contrast normalization in overlapping descriptor blocks are all important for good results. The new approach gives near-perfect separation on the original MIT pedestrian database, so we introduce a more challenging dataset containing over 1800 annotated human images with a large range of pose variations and backgrounds."

The object is represented by a set of viewpoint invariant region descriptors so that recognition can proceed successfully despite changes in viewpoint, illumination and partial occlusion. The temporal continuity of the video within a shot is used to track the regions in order to reject unstable regions and reduce the effects of noise in the descriptors. The analogy with text retrieval is in the implementation where matches on descriptors are pre-computed (using vector quantization), and inverted file systems and document rankings are used. The result is that retrieved is immediate, returning a ranked list of key frames/shots in the manner of Google. The method is illustrated for matching in two full length feature films."

However, systems that perform well on particular datasets typically have one or more limitations such as a failure to generalize across visual tasks (e.g., requiring a face detector or extensive retuning of parameters), insufficient translation invariance, inability to cope with partial views and occlusion, or significant performance degradation as the number of classes is increased. Here we attempt to overcome these challenges using a model that combines sequential visual attention using fixations with sparse coding. The model's biologically-inspired filters are acquired using unsupervised learning applied to natural image patches. Using only a single feature type, our approach achieves 78.5% accuracy on Caltech-101 and 75.2% on the 102 Flowers dataset when trained on 30 instances per class and it achieves 92.7% accuracy on the AR Face database with 1 training instance per person. The same features and parameters are used across these datasets to illustrate its robust performance."

Unlike conventional image-to-image or region-to-region matching algorithms, our method finds corresponding points in an \u201casymmetric\u201d manner, matching features within each region of a segmented image to a second unsegmented image. We develop a dynamic programming solution to efficiently identify corresponding points for each region, so as to maximize both geometric consistency and appearance similarity. The final matching score between two images is determined by the union of corresponding points obtained from each region-to-image match. Our encoding for the geometric constraints makes the algorithm flexible when matching objects exhibiting non-rigid deformations or intra-class appearance variation. We demonstrate our image matching approach applied to object category recognition, and show on the Caltech-256 and 101 datasets that it outperforms existing image matching measures by 10\u223c20% in nearest-neighbor recognition tests."

On the other hand, explicitly exploiting the self-similarities of natural images has led to the successful non-local means approach to image restoration. We propose simultaneous sparse coding as a framework for combining these two approaches in a natural manner. This is achieved by jointly decomposing groups of similar signals on subsets of the learned dictionary. Experimental results in image denoising and demosaicking tasks with synthetic and real noise show that the proposed method outperforms the state of the art, making it possible to effectively restore raw images from digital cameras at a reasonable speed and memory cost."

First, each image is encoded as an ensemble of orderless bag of features, and then a global Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) learned from all images is used to randomly distribute each feature into one Gaussian component by a multinomial trial. The parameters of the multinomial distribution are defined by the posteriors of the feature on all the Gaussian components. Finally, the normalized means of the features distributed in every Gaussian component are concatenated to form a supervector, which is a compact representation for each scene image. We prove that these super-vectors observe the standard normal distribution. Our experiments on scene categorization tasks using this vector representation show significantly improved performance compared with the bag-of-features representation."

The original Caltech-101 [1] was collected by choosing a set of object categories, downloading examples from Google Images and then manually screening out all images that did not fit the category. Caltech-256 is collected in a similar manner with several improvements: a) the number of categories is more than doubled, b) the minimum number of images in any category is increased from 31 to 80, c) artifacts due to image rotation are avoided and d) a new and larger clutter category is introduced for testing background rejection. We suggest several testing paradigms to measure classification performance, then benchmark the dataset using two simple metrics as well as a state-of-the-art spatial pyramid matching [2] algorithm. Finally we use the clutter category to train an interest detector which rejects uninformative background regions."

Here we describe locally linear embedding (LLE), an unsupervised learning algorithm that computes low dimensional, neighborhood preserving embeddings of high dimensional data. The data, assumed to be sampled from an underlying manifold, are mapped into a single global coordinate system of lower dimensionality. The mapping is derived from the symmetries of locally linear reconstructions, and the actual computation of the embedding reduces to a sparse eigenvalue problem. Notably, the optimizations in LLE---though capable of generating highly nonlinear embeddings---are simple to implement, and they do not involve local minima. In this paper, we describe the implementation of the algorithm in detail and discuss several extensions that enhance its performance. We present results of the algorithm applied to data sampled from known manifolds, as well as to collections of images of faces, lips, and handwritten digits. These examples are used to provide extensive illustrations of the algorithm's performance---both successes and failures---and to relate the algorithm to previous and ongoing work in nonlinear dimensionality reduction."

The codebook model describes an image as a bag of discrete visual words selected from a vocabulary, where the frequency distributions of visual words in an image allow classification. One inherent component of the codebook model is the assignment of discrete visual words to continuous image features. Despite the clear mismatch of this hard assignment with the nature of continuous features, the approach has been successfully applied for some years. In this paper, we investigate four types of soft assignment of visual words to image features. We demonstrate that explicitly modeling visual word assignment ambiguity improves classification performance compared to the hard assignment of the traditional codebook model. The traditional codebook model is compared against our method for five well-known data sets: 15 natural scenes, Caltech-101, Caltech-256, and Pascal VOC 2007/2008. We demonstrate that large codebook vocabulary sizes completely deteriorate the performance of the traditional model, whereas the proposed model performs consistently. Moreover, we show that our method profits in high-dimensional feature spaces and reaps higher benefits when increasing the number of image categories."

By introducing an intermediate representation \u201cgroup\u201d between images and object categories, GS-MKL attempts to find appropriate kernel combination for each group to get a finer depiction of object categories. For each category, images within a group share a set of kernel weights while images from different groups may employ distinct sets of kernel weights. In GS-MKL, such group-sensitive kernel combinations together with the multi-kernels based classifier are optimized in a joint manner to seek a trade-off between capturing the diversity and keeping the invariance for each category. Extensive experiments show that our proposed GS-MKL method has achieved encouraging performance over three challenging datasets."

Recognition of a category can therefore be made easier by detecting its constituent subcategories and combing these detection results. Given a set of training images, each labeled by an object category contained in it, we present an approach to learning: (1) Taxonomy defined by recursive sharing of subcategories by multiple image categories; (2) Subcategory relevance as the degree of evidence a subcategory offers for the presence of its parent; (3) Likelihood that the image contains a subcategory; and (4) Prior that a subcategory occurs. The images are represented as points in a feature space spanned by confidences in the occurrences of the subcategories. The subcategory relevances are estimated as weights, necessary to rescale the corresponding axes of the feature space so that the images with the same label are closer to each other than to those with different labels. When a new image is encountered, the learned taxonomy, relevances, likelihoods, and priors are used by a linear classifier to categorize the image. On the challenging Caltech-256 dataset, the proposed approach significantly outperforms the best categorizations reported. This result is significant in that it not only demonstrates the advantages of exploiting subcategory taxonomy for recognition, but also suggests that a feature space spanned by part properties, instead of direct object properties, allows for linear separation of image classes."

Empirical studies show that mapping the data into a significantly higher-dimensional space with sparse coding can lead to superior classification performance. However, computationally it is challenging to learn a set of highly over-complete dictionary bases and to encode the test data with the learned bases. In this paper, we describe a mixture sparse coding model that can produce high-dimensional sparse representations very efficiently. Besides the computational advantage, the model effectively encourages data that are similar to each other to enjoy similar sparse representations. What's more, the proposed model can be regarded as an approximation to the recently proposed local coordinate coding (LCC), which states that sparse coding can approximately learn the nonlinear manifold of the sensory data in a locally linear manner. Therefore, the feature learned by the mixture sparse coding model works pretty well with linear classifiers. We apply the proposed model to PASCAL VOC 2007 and 2009 datasets for the classification task, both achieving state-of-the-art performances."

The topology is restricted to resolutions up to the extent of the local region of interest (ROI). Although the ROI's may contain many pixels, there is no spatial order on the pixels within the ROI, the only information preserved is the histogram of pixel values within the ROI's. This can be considered as an extreme case of a textel (texture element) image: The histogram is the limit of texture where the spatial order has been completely disregarded. We argue that locally orderless images are ubiquitous in perception and the visual arts. Formally, the orderless images are most aptly described by three mutually intertwined scale spaces. The scale parameters correspond to the pixellation (\u201cinner scale\u201d), the extent of the ROI's (\u201couter scale\u201d) and the resolution in the histogram (\u201ctonal scale\u201d). We describe how to construct locally orderless images, how to render them, and how to use them in a variety of local and global image processing operations."

However, the large performance gap between these two families of approaches rendered NN-based image classifiers useless. We claim that the effectiveness of non-parametric NN-based image classification has been considerably undervalued. We argue that two practices commonly used in image classification methods, have led to the inferior performance of NN-based image classifiers: (i) Quantization of local image descriptors (used to generate \"bags-of-words \", codebooks). (ii) Computation of 'image-to-image' distance, instead of 'image-to-class' distance. We propose a trivial NN-based classifier - NBNN, (Naive-Bayes nearest-neighbor), which employs NN- distances in the space of the local image descriptors (and not in the space of images). NBNN computes direct 'image- to-class' distances without descriptor quantization. We further show that under the Naive-Bayes assumption, the theoretically optimal image classifier can be accurately approximated by NBNN. Although NBNN is extremely simple, efficient, and requires no learning/training phase, its performance ranks among the top leading learning-based image classifiers. Empirical comparisons are shown on several challenging databases (Caltech-101 ,Caltech-256 and Graz-01)."

Many unsupervised methods are based on reconstructing the input from the representation, while constraining the representation to have certain desirable properties (e.g. low dimension, sparsity, etc). Others are based on approximating density by stochastically reconstructing the input from the representation. We describe a novel and efficient algorithm to learn sparse representations, and compare it theoretically and experimentally with a similar machine trained probabilistically, namely a Restricted Boltzmann Machine. We propose a simple criterion to compare and select different unsupervised machines based on the trade-off between the reconstruction error and the information content of the representation. We demonstrate this method by extracting features from a dataset of handwritten numerals, and from a dataset of natural image patches. We show that by stacking multiple levels of such machines and by training sequentially, high-order dependencies between the input observed variables can be captured."

The learned bases provide a set of anchor points to form a local coordinate system, such that each data point x on the manifold can be locally approximated by a linear combination of its nearby anchor points, and the linear weights become its local coordinate coding. We show that a high dimensional nonlinear function can be approximated by a global linear function with respect to this coding scheme, and the approximation quality is ensured by the locality of such coding. The method turns a difficult nonlinear learning problem into a simple global linear learning problem, which overcomes some drawbacks of traditional local learning methods."

Convolutional Neural Networks, that are specifically designed to deal with the variability of 2D shapes, are shown to outperform all other techniques. Real-life document recognition systems are composed of multiple modules including field extraction, segmentation, recognition, and language modeling. A new learning paradigm, called Graph Transformer Networks (GTN), allows such multi-module systems to be trained globally using Gradient-Based methods so as to minimize an overall performance measure. Two systems for on-line handwriting recognition are described. Experiments demonstrate the advantage of global training, and the flexibility of Graph Transformer Networks.

The algorithm directly maximizes a stochastic variant of the leave-one-out KNN score on the training set. It can also learn a low-dimensional linear embedding of labeled data that can be used for data visualization and fast classification. Unlike other methods, our classification model is non-parametric, making no assumptions about the shape of the class distributions or the boundaries between them. The performance of the method is demonstrated on several data sets, both for metric learning and linear dimensionality reduction."

However, finding sparse codes remains a very difficult computational problem. In this paper, we present efficient sparse coding algorithms that are based on iteratively solving two convex optimization problems: an L1-regularized least squares problem and an L2-constrained least squares problem. We propose novel algorithms to solve both of these optimization problems. Our algorithms result in a significant speedup for sparse coding, allowing us to learn larger sparse codes than possible with previously described algorithms. We apply these algorithms to natural images and demonstrate that the inferred sparse codes exhibit end-stopping and non-classical receptive field surround suppression and, therefore, may provide a partial explanation for these two phenomena in V1 neurons."

Secondly, we propose to represent the facial images by a Locality Preserving Sparse Coding (LPSC) algorithm, which is more effective than the regular sparse coding algorithm for face representation. We conducted a set of extensive experiments on both 2D and 3D face recognition, in which the encouraging results showed that the proposed scheme is more effective than the regular face recognition solutions."

We process blocks within the image in a sliding manner and utilize the block-matching concept by searching for blocks which are similar to the currently processed one. The matched blocks are stacked together to form a 3D array and due to the similarity between them, the data in the array exhibit high level of correlation. We exploit this correlation by applying a 3D decorrelating unitary transform and effectively attenuate the noise by shrinkage of the transform coefficients. The subsequent inverse 3D transform yields estimates of all matched blocks. After repeating this procedure for all image blocks in sliding manner, the final estimate is computed as weighed average of all overlapping blockestimates. A fast and efficient algorithm implementing the proposed approach is developed. The experimental results show that the proposed method delivers state-of-art denoising performance, both in terms of objective criteria and visual quality."

It would be astonishing if such a structure did not profoundly modify the response patterns of fibres coming into it. In the cat's visual cortex, the receptive field arrangements of single cells suggest that there is indeed a degree of complexity far exceeding anything yet seen at lower levels in the visual system. In a previous paper we described receptive fields of single cortical cells, observing responses to spots of light shone on one or both retinas (Hubel & Wiesel, 1959). In the present work this method is used to examine receptive fields of a more complex type (Part I) and to make additional observations on binocular interaction (Part II). This approach is necessary in order to understand the behaviour of individual cells, but it fails to deal with the problem of the relationship of one cell to its neighbours. In the past, the technique of recording evoked slow waves has been used with great success in studies of functional anatomy. It was employed by Talbot & Marshall (1941) and by Thompson, Woolsey & Talbot (1950) for mapping out the visual cortex in the rabbit, cat, and monkey. Daniel & Whitteiidge (1959) have recently extended this work in the primate. Most of our present knowledge of retinotopic projections, binocular overlap, and the second visual area is based on these investigations. Yet the method of evoked potentials is valuable mainly for detecting behaviour common to large populations of neighbouring cells; it cannot differentiate functionally between areas of cortex smaller than about 1 mm2. To overcome this difficulty a method has in recent years been developed for studying cells separately or in small groups during long micro-electrode penetrations through nervous tissue. Responses are correlated with cell location by reconstructing the electrode tracks from histological material. These techniques have been applied to"

The roughness at the micro scale is modeled as a uniform, isotropically scattering, Lambertian surface. At the macro scale the roughness is modeled by way of a distribution of spherical concavities. These pits influence the BRDF via vignetting, cast shadow, interreflection and interposition, causing it to differ markedly from Lambertian. Pitted surfaces show strong backward scattering (so called \u201copposition effect\u201d). When we assume that the macro scale can be resolved, the radiance histogram and the spatial structure of the textons of the textured surface (at the mega scale) can be calculated. This is the main advantage of the model over previous ones: One can do exact (numerical) calculations for a surface geometry that is physically realizable."
