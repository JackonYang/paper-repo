The nonwords were constructed to be pronounceable and orthographically regular. All displays were tachistoscopically presented without pre- or postexposure masking fields. The mean proportions of correct choices were.749 for letters,.735 for words, and.671 for nonwords, with the latter proportion being significantly smaller than those for the other conditions. The relatively high performance for letters was attributed to the absence of masking fields in the present study, since masks have been shown to interfere more with letter processing than word processing in similar studies. The superiority of words over regular nonwords was used as evidence to support the hypothesis that the perceptual unit in reading can be at least as large as a four-letter word."

                "text": "Mental states correspond to physical changes in the brain. The object of this paper is to inquire into the time needed to bring about changes in the brain, and thus to determine the rapidity of thought. When waves in the luminiferous ether of a particular length strike the retina a red light is seen, but a certain time passes after the waves have struck the retina before the light is seen: (1) It takes time for the light waves to work on the retina, and generate in the cells a nervous impulse corresponding to the nature of the light; (2) it takes time for the nervous impulse to be conveyed along the optic nerve to the brain; (3) it takes time for the nervous impulse to be conveyed through the brain to the visual centre; and (4) it takes time for the nervous impulse to bring about changes in the visual centre corresponding to its own nature, and consequently to the nature of the external stimulus. When these changes are brought about a red light is seen. It does not take any time for a sensation or perception to arise after the proper changes in the brain have been brought about. The sensation of a red light is a state of consciousness corresponding to a certain condition of the brain. The chemical changes in a galvanic battery take time, but after they are brought about, no additional time is needed to produce the electric current. The current is the product of chemical changes in the battery, but at the same time the immediate representative of these changes; and the relation is so far analogous between states of consciousness and changes in the brain. Again, as it takes time to see a light, so it takes time to make a motion. Changes in the brain, the origin and nature of which we do not understand (physiologically they are part of the continuous life of the brain, mentally they are often given in continuous life of the brain, mentally they are often given in consciousness as a will-impulse), excite the centre for the coordination of motions. The impulse there developed is conveyed through the brain (and it may be spinal cord) to a motor nerve, and along the nerve to the muscle, which is contracted in accordance with the will-impulse. We have here in the reverse direction the same four periods as in the case of a stimulus giving rise to a sensation. In each case there is the latent period in the sense-organ or muscle, the centripetal or centrifugal time in the nerve, the centripetal or centrifugal time in the brain, and the time of growing energy in the sensory or motor centre. Besides these [p. 221] two classes of processes, the one centripetal, the other centrifugal, there are centrimanent cerebral operations, some of which are given in consciousness, and make up the mental life of thought and feeling. These cerebral changes all take time, and, as I shall show, the times can in many cases be determined."

In Experiment 1, one group of subjects, who were given knowledge of the alternatives after the display, showed the usual WLP. The WLP was eliminated in a second group of subjects who were given knowledge of the alternatives both before and after the display. In Experiment 2, the same subjects were either precued or not precued on alternating trials of each block. It appeared that the WLP suppression with precuing resulted from a decrease in word performance whereas letter performance was unaffected by precuing. It is suggested that precuing exerts a detrimental effect, because, instead of attending to the word as a whole, subjects search for where in the word the forced choice would be plausible."

Subjects viewed brief, masked presentations of words and pronounceable pseudowords differing in letter cluster frequency. Identification of both display types was compared to control single letters. Perceptual accuracy was indexed by probe forced-choice responses and full verbal reports of the displays. Evidence that familiarity of whole-word units facilitated encoding was mixed but, on balance, favorable. Evidence that familiarity of letter-cluster units facilitated encoding was completely absent. This negative finding is surprising in view of the fact that we did obtain a large advantage of letters in pseudo-words as well as words over single letters. The discussion section considers an alternative to the view that perceivers use detectors for familiar letter-cluster units in the process of forming representations of pronounceable, orthographically regular letter strings."

Data obtained rule out several artifactual interpretations, including the possibility that perception of letters in a word is facilitated merely by the presence of adjacent contours. The WLP is shown to depend critically on what type of display is used as a preand postexposure field. While a masking field of high-contrast random contours produced a large and reliable WLP, a plain white field eliminated the phenomenon entirely. This pattern of results suggests several ways in which perception at the word level may differ from perception at the letter level."

Specifically, the masking of single letters, common fiveletter words, and five-letter pseudowords masked by a blank flash, strings of overlapped letters, pseudowords, and words was investigated. Target duration was varied from 2 to 32 msec, with mask duration held constant at 25 msec. The dependent measure was the critical interstimulus interval for correct target identification. Letters were more effectively masked than words and pseudowords. A blank mask caused the least amount of masking, followed by the overlapped letter strings, and then the word and pseudoword masks. In addition to the overall greater masking effectiveness for the three patterned masks, overlapped letter strings masked letters more effectively than they did words. The implications of current theories of masking for these results and the implications of these results for theories of word recognition were discussed."

The results of a recent tachistoscopic recognition study question the importance of lexical availability by finding no difference in performance between meaningful words and well-structured, pronounceable nonwords. In the present study, further comparisons between words and pronounceable nonwords were performed, and a meaningfulness effect was demonstrated. The generality of this finding was discussed, and alternative models accounting for the effect were considered. Two of these were capable of explaining structural effects as well as the meaningfulness effect: a translation model and a lexical discrimination net."

Experiment 1 showed that the presence of a vowel or multiletter spelling patterns facilitates perceptual accuracy. To account for these results a model was proposed in which an input string is first parsed into syllablelike units, which are then recorded into speech. It was demonstrated that the perceptual accuracy for a string is correlated with the number of recoding steps needed to convert that string into speech. Experiment 2 further demonstrated that this recoding process can predict perceptibility differences among strings with varying numbers of phonotactic violations, and Experiment 3 assessed some of the specific assumptions of the recoding process."

                "text": "Four tachistoscopic forced-choice recognition experiments explored the flexibility of processes underlying word perception. Stimuli were words, orthographically regular but unfamiliar pseudowords, and orthographically irregular nonsense strings. In the first two experiments, subjects knew that several different kinds of stimuli would occur in each block of trials and that one kind would occur much more often than the others. No matter which stimulus subjects expected to see most often, accuracy on words and pseudowords differed little, and both were identified considerably better than nonsense. In the third and fourth experiments, subjects were led to believe that only on stimulus type would occur but were surreptitiously shown another type on a small number of trials. Words were again identified more accurately than nonsense, and the size of the effect was independent of expectations. However, when either words or nonsense strings were expected exclusively, pseudoword accuracy did not differ from nonsense accuracy. Only when subjects knew that pseudowords would occur did they identify pseudowords more accurately than nonsense. This dissociation between word and pseudoword identification indicates the operation of two independent encoding mechanisms during tachistoscopic recognition, a stimulus-specific or logogenlike system sensitive to particular familiar strings and an orthographic mechanism sensitive to generally applicable constraints on letter sequencing. The stimulus-specific mechanism appears to be utilized automatically, but use of the orthographic mechanism is under strategic control. As shown in the first two experiments, however, rather extraordinary measures were required to demonstrate the flexibility of the orthographic processes used in this task."

A brief tachistoscopic display of one or two single letters, four-letter common words, or four-letter nonwords was immediately followed by a masking field along with two single-letter response alternatives chosen so as to minimize informational differences among the tasks. Giving 5s response alternatives before the stimulus display as well as after it caused an impairment of performance. Performance on single words was clearly better than performance on single letters. The data suggest that the first stages of information processing are done in parallel, but scanning of the resultant highly processed information is done serially."

The idea behind how U-shaped metacontrast functions are generated is similar in both models, but the assumptions about how the visual system is organized are quite different. In one of the models temporal ringing, combined with a complex and implausible linking hypothesis, is necessary in order for masking to be obtained; this model assumes a single spatial and temporal channel. In the other model, masking does not depend on temporal ringing; this model assumes multiple spatial and temporal channels and a simple linking hypothesis. We show that of the two models only the second adequately predicts empirical metacontrast functions, and we relate this model to recent evidence that the visual system contains multiple channels. Sometimes treated as a puzzling and somewhat singular phenomenon, isolated from the \"mainstream\" of visual data and theory, metacontrast may, on the contrary, turn out to be one of the more interesting manifestations of a multiple-channel visual system."

We assume that (a) nervous system activity is usefully represented as the set of simultaneous individual neuron activities in a group of neurons; (b) different memory traces make use of the same synapses; and (c) synapses associate two patterns of neural activity by incrementing synaptic connectivity proportionally to the product of pre- and postsynaptic activity, forming a matrix of synaptic connectivities. We extend this model by (a) introducing positive feedback of a set of neurons onto itself and (b) allowing the individual neurons to saturate. A hybrid model, partly analog and partly binary, arises. The system has certain characteristics reminiscent of analysis by distinctive features. Next, we apply the model to \"categorical perception.\" Finally, we discuss probability learning. The model can predict overshooting, recency data, and probabilities occurring in systems with more than two events with reasonably good accuracy."

The present results replicated earlier findings in a paradigm that controls for redundancy by presenting the response alternatives after the stimulus presentation. However, this study failed to find an effect of visual similarity. This result suggests that presenting the alternatives right after the stimulus presentation does not control for redundancy since alternatives are eliminated during perception of the stimulus, not after the visual information has been completely analyzed. Identification was, therefore, examined in a task in which 5s were given the letter and word alternatives prior to the experimental session. This task eliminated the spelling pattern advantage and also provided evidence for visual similarity effects in letter and word identification. The findings are consonant with a visual identification process that analyzes visual features of letters in both letter and word recognition."

A model called the cascade model is presented and it is shown to be compatible with the general form of the relation between time and accuracy in speed-accuracy trade-off experiments. In the model , experimentlLlmanipulations may have either or both of two effects on a processing level: They may alter the rate of response or the asymptotic quality pf the output. The effects of such manipulations on the output of a system of proessesare described. The model is then used to reexamine, the subtraction and additive factors methods for analyzing the composition of systems of processes. The examination of the additive factors method yields particularly interesting results. Among them is the finding that factors that affect the rates of two different processes would be expected to have additive effects on reaction times under the cascade model, whereas factors that both affect the rate of the same process would tend to interact, just as in the case in which the manipulations affect the durations of discrete stages. On the other hand, factors that affect asymptotic output tend to interact whether they affect the same or different processes. In light of this observation, the conclusions drawn from several studies about the locus of perceptual and attentional effects on processing are reexamined. Finally, an outline is presented of a new method for analyzing processes in cascade. The method extends the additive factors method to an analysis of the parameters of the function relating response time and accuracy."

The model is a \"sophisticated guessing\" model which takes explicit account of the geometry of the characters which make up the words or letter strings. Explicit attempts are made to account for word frequency effects, effects due to letter transition probabilities, and effects due to physical similarity of character strings to one another. A word recognition experiment using the set of three-letter words is reported, and the model is used to make quantitative predictions of these results as well as to give a qualitative account for a number of results in the literature. Finally, it is shown that under certain simplifying assumptions this sophisticated guessing model is isomorphic with the \"criterion bias\" model as developed in 1967 by Broadbent. The process whereby words are recognized has long fascinated experimental psy-Several related findings have commanded the most attention. For example, more letters per unit time may be apprehended when a word is presented than when a string of unrelated letters is presented (Huey, 1908). A letter string formed by taking a word and either deleting or replacing one or two letters is often clearly perceived as that word (Pillsbury, 1897). Other things being equal, words which occur frequently in the language are more easily perceived than those which occur less frequently (Goldia-The more the statistics of letter strings approximate those of words, the better the perception of the letter strings (cf. Miller, Bruner, & Postman , 1954). The more predictable a word is within a sentence, the more easily it is Most explanations of these phenomena suggest that they all result from the fact that the subject combines internally provided information about language with externally provided information from the sensory system (cf. Morton, 1969, 1970). By this argument, words are easier to see than nonwords because we can apply our knowledge of the vocabulary of the language. Knowledge of relative frequencies of words in the language allows us to read high-frequency words more readily. Knowledge of syntactic and semantic relations allows us to read words more easily in the context of 99"

According to the model context aids the perception of target letters as they are processed in the perceptual system. The implication that the duration and timing of the context in which a letter occurs should greatly influence the perceptibility of the target is confirmed by a series of experiments demonstrating that early or enhanced presentations of word and pronounceablepseudoword contexts greatly increase the perceptibility of target letters. Also according to the model, letters in strings that share several letters with words should be equally perceptible whether they are orthographically regular and pronounceable (SLET) or irregular (SLNT) and should be much more perceptible than letters in contexts that share few letters with any word (XLQJ). This prediction is tested and confirmed. The basic results of all the experiments are accounted for, with some modification of parameters, although there are some discrepancies in detail. Several recent findings that seem to challenge the model are considered and a number of extensions are proposed."
