The global interpolation methods with Duchon's \u201cthin plate splines\u201d and Hardy's multiquadrics are considered to be of high quality; however, their application is limited, due to computational difficulties, to $ \\sim 150$ data points. In this work we develop some efficient iterative schemes for computing global approximation surfaces interpolating a given smooth data. The suggested iterative procedures can, in principle, handle any number of data points, according to computer capacity. These procedures are extensions of a previous work by Dyn and Levin on iterative methods for computing thin-plate spline interpolants for data given on a square grid. Here the procedures are improved significantly and generalized to the case of data given in a general configuration.The major theme of this work is the development of an iterative scheme for the construction of a smooth surface, presented by global basis functions, which approximates only the smooth components of a set of scattered noisy data. The novelty in the suggested method is in the construction of an iterative procedure for low-pass filtering based on detailed spectral properties of a preconditioned matrix. The general concepts of this approach can also be used in designing iterative computation procedures for many other problems.The interpolation and smoothing procedures are tested, and the theoretical results are verified, by many numerical experiments."

In all these spaces a distance function is assumed to be defined as usual. t L2 is equivalent to the real Hilbert space t. The spaces EmP, IP and LP are metric only if p > 1, but we shall consider them also for positive values of p O). A general theorem of Banach and Mazur ([1], p. 187) states that any separable metric space (5 may be imbedded isometrically in the space C. Furthermore, as a special case of a well known theorem of Urysohn, any such space (E may be imbedded topologically in t. Isometric imbeddability of (E in '& is, however, a much more restricted property of (B. The chief purpose of this paper is to point out the intimate relationship between the problem of isometric imbedding and the concept of positive definite functions, if this concept is properly enlarged. As a first approach to this connection we consider here isometric imbedding in Hilbert space only.

In the introduction to this paper we outlined the plan of papers which were to follow. In the meantime, however, the general theory has been developed in many directions, and our original plans have had to be changed. Due to wartime conditions we were not able, at the time of writing the first paper, to take into account all the earlier investigations which, although sometimes of quite a different character, were, nevertheless, related to our subject. Our investigation is concerned with kernels of a special type which have been used under different names and in different ways in many domains of mathematical research. We shall therefore begin our present paper with a short historical introduction in which we shall attempt to indicate the different manners in which these kernels have been used by various investigators, and to clarify the terminology. We shall also discuss the more important trends of the application of these kernels without attempting, however, a complete bibliography of the subject matter. (KAR) P. 2"
