Instead, we frame object detection as a regression problem to spatially separated bounding boxes and associated class probabilities. A single neural network predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities directly from full images in one evaluation. Since the whole detection pipeline is a single network, it can be optimized end-to-end directly on detection performance. Our unified architecture is extremely fast. Our base YOLO model processes images in real-time at 45 frames per second. A smaller version of the network, Fast YOLO, processes an astounding 155 frames per second while still achieving double the mAP of other real-time detectors. Compared to state-of-the-art detection systems, YOLO makes more localization errors but is less likely to predict false positives on background. Finally, YOLO learns very general representations of objects. It outperforms other detection methods, including DPM and R-CNN, when generalizing from natural images to other domains like artwork."

This integrated framework is the winner of the localization task of the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge 2013 (ILSVRC2013) and obtained very competitive results for the detection and classifications tasks.

The best-performing methods are complex ensemble systems that typically combine multiple low-level image features with high-level context. In this paper, we propose a simple and scalable detection algorithm that improves mean average precision (mAP) by more than 30% relative to the previous best result on VOC 2012 -- achieving a mAP of 53.3%. Our approach combines two key insights: (1) one can apply high-capacity convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to bottom-up region proposals in order to localize and segment objects and (2) when labeled training data is scarce, supervised pre-training for an auxiliary task, followed by domain-specific fine-tuning, yields a significant performance boost. Since we combine region proposals with CNNs, we call our method R-CNN: Regions with CNN features. We also present experiments that provide insight into what the network learns, revealing a rich hierarchy of image features. Source code for the complete system is available at http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~rbg/rcnn."

Our method exploits stereo imagery to place proposals in the form of 3D bounding boxes. We formulate the problem as minimizing an energy function encoding object size priors, ground plane as well as several depth informed features that reason about free space, point cloud densities and distance to the ground. Our experiments show significant performance gains over existing RGB and RGB-D object proposal methods on the challenging KITTI benchmark. Combined with convolutional neural net (CNN) scoring, our approach outperforms all existing results on all three KITTI object classes."

We present extensive results on standard face benchmarks, as well as a new \u201cin the wild\u201d annotated dataset, that suggests our system advances the state-of-the-art, sometimes considerably, for all three tasks.

The winning model on the localization sub-task was a network that predicts a single bounding box and a confidence score for each object category in the image. Such a model captures the whole-image context around the objects but cannot handle multiple instances of the same object in the image without naively replicating the number of outputs for each instance. In this work, we propose a saliency-inspired neural network model for detection, which predicts a set of class-agnostic bounding boxes along with a single score for each box, corresponding to its likelihood of containing any object of interest. The model naturally handles a variable number of instances for each class and allows for cross-class generalization at the highest levels of the network. We are able to obtain competitive recognition performance on VOC2007 and ILSVRC2012, while using only the top few predicted locations in each image and a small number of neural network evaluations."

Advances like SPPnet and Fast R-CNN have reduced the running time of these detection networks, exposing region proposal computation as a bottleneck. In this work, we introduce a Region Proposal Network (RPN) that shares full-image convolutional features with the detection network, thus enabling nearly cost-free region proposals. An RPN is a fully convolutional network that simultaneously predicts object bounds and objectness scores at each position. The RPN is trained end-to-end to generate high-quality region proposals, which are used by Fast R-CNN for detection. We further merge RPN and Fast R-CNN into a single network by sharing their convolutional features---using the recently popular terminology of neural networks with 'attention' mechanisms, the RPN component tells the unified network where to look. For the very deep VGG-16 model, our detection system has a frame rate of 5fps (including all steps) on a GPU, while achieving state-of-the-art object detection accuracy on PASCAL VOC 2007, 2012, and MS COCO datasets with only 300 proposals per image. In ILSVRC and COCO 2015 competitions, Faster R-CNN and RPN are the foundations of the 1st-place winning entries in several tracks. Code has been made publicly available"

                "text": "Standard sliding window based object detection requires dense classifier evaluation on densely sampled locations in scale space in order to achieve an accurate localization. To avoid such dense evaluation, selective search based algorithms only evaluate the classifier on a small subset of object proposals. Notwithstanding the demonstrated success, object proposals do not guarantee perfect overlap with the object, leading to a suboptimal detection accuracy. To address this issue, we propose to first relax the dense sampling of the scale space with coarse object proposals generated from bottom-up segmentations. Based on detection results on these proposals, we then conduct a top-down search to more precisely localize the object using supervised descent. This two-stage detection strategy, dubbed location relaxation, is able to localize the object in the continuous parameter space. Furthermore, there is a conflict between accurate object detection and robust object detection. That is because the achievement of the later requires the accommodation of inaccurate and perturbed object locations in the training phase. To address this conflict, we leverage the rich spatial information learned from the Regionlets detection framework to determine where the object is precisely localized. Our proposed approaches are extensively validated on the PASCAL VOC 2007 dataset and a self-collected large scale car dataset. Our method boosts the mean average precision of the current state-of-the-art (41.7 %) to 44.1 % on PASCAL VOC 2007 dataset. To our best knowledge, it is the best performance reported without using outside data (Convolutional neural network based approaches are commonly pre-trained on a large scale outside dataset and fine-tuned on the VOC dataset.)."

                "text": "Despite the great progress achieved in recognizing objects as 2D bounding boxes in images, it is still very challenging to detect occluded objects and estimate the 3D properties of multiple objects from a single image. In this paper, we propose a novel object representation, 3D Voxel Pattern (3DVP), that jointly encodes the key properties of objects including appearance, 3D shape, viewpoint, occlusion and truncation. We discover 3DVPs in a data-driven way, and train a bank of specialized detectors for a dictionary of 3DVPs. The 3DVP detectors are capable of detecting objects with specific visibility patterns and transferring the meta-data from the 3DVPs to the detected objects, such as 2D segmentation mask, 3D pose as well as occlusion or truncation boundaries. The transferred meta-data allows us to infer the occlusion relationship among objects, which in turn provides improved object recognition results. Experiments are conducted on the KITTI detection benchmark [17] and the outdoor-scene dataset [41]. We improve state-of-the-art results on car detection and pose estimation with notable margins (6% in difficult data of KITTI). We also verify the ability of our method in accurately segmenting objects from the background and localizing them in 3D."

This new deep learning object detection diagram has innovations in multiple aspects. In the proposed new deep architecture, a new deformation constrained pooling (defpooling) layer models the deformation of object parts with geometric constraint and penalty. With the proposed multistage training strategy, multiple classifiers are jointly optimized to process samples at different difficulty levels. A ne w pre-training strategy is proposed to learn feature represe ntations more suitable for the object detection task and with good generalization capability. By changing the net structures, training strategies, adding and removing some key components in the detection pipeline, a set of models with large diversity are obtained, which significantly improves the effectiveness of modeling averaging. The proposed approach ranked #2 in ILSVRC 2014. It improves the mean averaged precision obtained by RCNN, which is the stateof-the-art of object detection, from31% to 45%. Detailed component-wise analysis is also provided through extensiv e experimental evaluation."

Such approaches have been shown they can be fast, while achieving the state of the art in detection performance. In this paper, we propose a new way to generate object proposals, introducing an approach based on a discriminative convolutional network. Our model is trained jointly with two objectives: given an image patch, the first part of the system outputs a class-agnostic segmentation mask, while the second part of the system outputs the likelihood of the patch being centered on a full object. At test time, the model is efficiently applied on the whole test image and generates a set of segmentation masks, each of them being assigned with a corresponding object likelihood score. We show that our model yields significant improvements over state-of-the-art object proposal algorithms. In particular, compared to previous approaches, our model obtains substantially higher object recall using fewer proposals. We also show that our model is able to generalize to unseen categories it has not seen during training. Unlike all previous approaches for generating object masks, we do not rely on edges, superpixels, or any other form of low-level segmentation."

While there has been significant research on this problem, current state-of-the-art approaches for this task require annotation of facial landmarks, e.g. TSM [25], or annotation of face poses [28, 22]. They also require training dozens of models to fully capture faces in all orientations, e.g. 22 models in HeadHunter method [22]. In this paper we propose Deep Dense Face Detector (DDFD), a method that does not require pose/landmark annotation and is able to detect faces in a wide range of orientations using a single model based on deep convolutional neural networks. The proposed method has minimal complexity; unlike other recent deep learning object detection methods [9], it does not require additional components such as segmentation, bounding-box regression, or SVM classifiers. Furthermore, we analyzed scores of the proposed face detector for faces in different orientations and found that 1) the proposed method is able to detect faces from different angles and can handle occlusion to some extent, 2) there seems to be a correlation between distribution of positive examples in the training set and scores of the proposed face detector. The latter suggests that the proposed method's performance can be further improved by using better sampling strategies and more sophisticated data augmentation techniques. Evaluations on popular face detection benchmark datasets show that our single-model face detector algorithm has similar or better performance compared to the previous methods, which are more complex and require annotations of either different poses or facial landmarks."

This paper handles object detection in a superpixel oriented manner instead of the proposal oriented. Specially, this paper takes object detection as a multi-label superpixel labeling problem by minimizing an energy function. It uses the data cost term to capture the appearance, smooth cost term to encode the spatial context and label cost term to favor compact detection. The data cost is learned through a convolutional neural network and the parameters in the labeling model are learned through a structural SVM. Compared with proposal generation and classification based methods, the proposed superpixel labeling method can naturally detect objects missed by proposal generation step and capture the global image context to infer the overlapping objects. The proposed method shows its advantage in Pascal VOC and ImageNet. Notably, it performs better than the ImageNet ILSVRC2014 winner GoogLeNet (45.0% V.S. 43.9% in mAP) with much shallower and fewer CNNs."

Although existing part based models have achieved impressive progress in the past several years, their improvement is still limited by low-level feature representation. Therefore, this paper mainly studies the description of object structure from both feature level and topology level. Following the bottom-up paradigm, we propose a boosted Local Structured HOG-LBP based object detector. Firstly, at feature level, we propose Local Structured Descriptor to capture the object's local structure, and develop the descriptors from shape and texture information, respectively. Secondly, at topology level, we present a boosted feature selection and fusion scheme for part based object detector. All experiments are conducted on the challenging PASCAL VOC2007 datasets. Experimental results show that our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance."

Consequently, effective models for the problem tend to be computationally prohibitive. To address these two conflicting challenges, we propose a cascade architecture built on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with very powerful discriminative capability, while maintaining high performance. The proposed CNN cascade operates at multiple resolutions, quickly rejects the background regions in the fast low resolution stages, and carefully evaluates a small number of challenging candidates in the last high resolution stage. To improve localization effectiveness, and reduce the number of candidates at later stages, we introduce a CNN-based calibration stage after each of the detection stages in the cascade. The output of each calibration stage is used to adjust the detection window position for input to the subsequent stage. The proposed method runs at 14 FPS on a single CPU core for VGA-resolution images and 100 FPS using a GPU, and achieves state-of-the-art detection performance on two public face detection benchmarks."

Our main contribution is a thorough evaluation of networks of increasing depth using an architecture with very small (3x3) convolution filters, which shows that a significant improvement on the prior-art configurations can be achieved by pushing the depth to 16-19 weight layers. These findings were the basis of our ImageNet Challenge 2014 submission, where our team secured the first and the second places in the localisation and classification tracks respectively. We also show that our representations generalise well to other datasets, where they achieve state-of-the-art results. We have made our two best-performing ConvNet models publicly available to facilitate further research on the use of deep visual representations in computer vision."

In this paper we want to better understand these choices by inspecting two key aspects \u201cwhat did the network learn?\u201d, and \u201cwhat can the network learn?\u201d. We exploit new annotations (Pascal3D+), to enable a new empirical analysis of the R-CNN detector. Despite common belief, our results indicate that existing state-of-the-art convnets are not invariant to various appearance factors. In fact, all considered networks have similar weak points which cannot be mitigated by simply increasing the training data (architectural changes are needed). We show that overall performance can improve when using image renderings as data augmentation. We report the best known results on Pascal3D+ detection and view-point estimation tasks."

We show that convolutional networks by themselves, trained end-to-end, pixels-to-pixels, improve on the previous best result in semantic segmentation. Our key insight is to build \u201cfully convolutional\u201d networks that take input of arbitrary size and produce correspondingly-sized output with efficient inference and learning. We define and detail the space of fully convolutional networks, explain their application to spatially dense prediction tasks, and draw connections to prior models. We adapt contemporary classification networks (AlexNet, the VGG net, and GoogLeNet) into fully convolutional networks and transfer their learned representations by fine-tuning to the segmentation task. We then define a skip architecture that combines semantic information from a deep, coarse layer with appearance information from a shallow, fine layer to produce accurate and detailed segmentations. Our fully convolutional networks achieve improved segmentation of PASCAL VOC (30% relative improvement to 67.2% mean IU on 2012), NYUDv2, SIFT Flow, and PASCAL-Context, while inference takes one tenth of a second for a typical image."

For computational and storage efficiency, we use a recent segmentation-based method to generate class-independent object detection hypotheses, in combination with data compression techniques. Our main contribution is a method to produce tentative object segmentation masks to suppress background clutter in the features. Re-weighting the local image features based on these masks is shown to improve object detection significantly. We also exploit contextual features in the form of a full-image FV descriptor, and an inter-category rescoring mechanism. Our experiments on the VOC 2007 and 2010 datasets show that our detector improves over the current state-of-the-art detection results."

Fast R-CNN builds on previous work to efficiently classify object proposals using deep convolutional networks. Compared to previous work, Fast R-CNN employs several innovations to improve training and testing speed while also increasing detection accuracy. Fast R-CNN trains the very deep VGG16 network 9x faster than R-CNN, is 213x faster at test-time, and achieves a higher mAP on PASCAL VOC 2012. Compared to SPPnet, Fast R-CNN trains VGG16 3x faster, tests 10x faster, and is more accurate. Fast R-CNN is implemented in Python and C++ (using Caffe) and is available under the open-source MIT License at https://github.com/rbgirshick/fast-rcnn."

We discuss the challenges of collecting large-scale ground truth annotation, highlight key breakthroughs in categorical object recognition, provide a detailed analysis of the current state of the field of large-scale image classification and object detection, and compare the state-of-the-art computer vision accuracy with human accuracy. We conclude with lessons learned in the 5\u00a0years of the challenge, and propose future directions and improvements."

However, we claim that recognizing objects and predicting contours are two mutually related tasks. Contrary to traditional approaches, we show that we can invert the commonly established pipeline: instead of detecting contours with low-level cues for a higher-level recognition task, we exploit object-related features as high-level cues for contour detection."

The approach is simple, using the average feature for a layer to augment the features at each location. In addition, we study several idiosyncrasies of training, significantly increasing the performance of baseline networks (e.g. from FCN). When we add our proposed global feature, and a technique for learning normalization parameters, accuracy increases consistently even over our improved versions of the baselines. Our proposed approach, ParseNet, achieves state-of-the-art performance on SiftFlow and PASCAL-Context with small additional computational cost over baselines, and near current state-of-the-art performance on PASCAL VOC 2012 semantic segmentation with a simple approach.

Our system is able to represent highly variable object classes and achieves state-of-the-art results in the PASCAL object detection challenges. While deformable part models have become quite popular, their value had not been demonstrated on difficult benchmarks such as the PASCAL data sets. Our system relies on new methods for discriminative training with partially labeled data. We combine a margin-sensitive approach for data-mining hard negative examples with a formalism we call latent SVM. A latent SVM is a reformulation of MI--SVM in terms of latent variables. A latent SVM is semiconvex, and the training problem becomes convex once latent information is specified for the positive examples. This leads to an iterative training algorithm that alternates between fixing latent values for positive examples and optimizing the latent SVM objective function."

Perhaps one of the main reasons for this is the lack of demanding benchmarks that mimic such scenarios. In this paper, we take advantage of our autonomous driving platform to develop novel challenging benchmarks for the tasks of stereo, optical flow, visual odometry/SLAM and 3D object detection. Our recording platform is equipped with four high resolution video cameras, a Velodyne laser scanner and a state-of-the-art localization system. Our benchmarks comprise 389 stereo and optical flow image pairs, stereo visual odometry sequences of 39.2 km length, and more than 200k 3D object annotations captured in cluttered scenarios (up to 15 cars and 30 pedestrians are visible per image). Results from state-of-the-art algorithms reveal that methods ranking high on established datasets such as Middlebury perform below average when being moved outside the laboratory to the real world. Our goal is to reduce this bias by providing challenging benchmarks with novel difficulties to the computer vision community. Our benchmarks are available online at: www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti."

Currently, evaluation of adjacent windows proceeds independently; this is suboptimal as detector responses at nearby locations and scales are correlated. We propose to exploit these correlations by tightly coupling detector evaluation of nearby windows. We introduce two opposing mechanisms: detector excitation of promising neighbors and inhibition of inferior neighbors. By enabling neighboring detectors to communicate, crosstalk cascades achieve major gains (4-30\u00d7 speedup) over cascades evaluated independently at each image location. Combined with recent advances in fast multi-scale feature computation, for which we provide an optimized implementation, our approach runs at 35-65 fps on 640\u00d7480 images while attaining state-of-the-art accuracy."

The main hallmark of this architecture is the improved utilization of the computing resources inside the network. By a carefully crafted design, we increased the depth and width of the network while keeping the computational budget constant. To optimize quality, the architectural decisions were based on the Hebbian principle and the intuition of multi-scale processing. One particular incarnation used in our submission for ILSVRC14 is called GoogLeNet, a 22 layers deep network, the quality of which is assessed in the context of classification and detection."

Rather than modeling articulation using a family of warped (rotated and foreshortened) templates, we use a mixture of small, nonoriented parts. We describe a general, flexible mixture model that jointly captures spatial relations between part locations and co-occurrence relations between part mixtures, augmenting standard pictorial structure models that encode just spatial relations. Our models have several notable properties: 1) They efficiently model articulation by sharing computation across similar warps, 2) they efficiently model an exponentially large set of global mixtures through composition of local mixtures, and 3) they capture the dependency of global geometry on local appearance (parts look different at different locations). When relations are tree structured, our models can be efficiently optimized with dynamic programming. We learn all parameters, including local appearances, spatial relations, and co-occurrence relations (which encode local rigidity) with a structured SVM solver. Because our model is efficient enough to be used as a detector that searches over scales and image locations, we introduce novel criteria for evaluating pose estimation and human detection, both separately and jointly. We show that currently used evaluation criteria may conflate these two issues. Most previous approaches model limbs with rigid and articulated templates that are trained independently of each other, while we present an extensive diagnostic evaluation that suggests that flexible structure and joint training are crucial for strong performance. We present experimental results on standard benchmarks that suggest our approach is the state-of-the-art system for pose estimation, improving past work on the challenging Parse and Buffy datasets while being orders of magnitude faster."

We study the influence of each stage of the computation on performance, concluding that fine-scale gradients, fine orientation binning, relatively coarse spatial binning, and high-quality local contrast normalization in overlapping descriptor blocks are all important for good results. The new approach gives near-perfect separation on the original MIT pedestrian database, so we introduce a more challenging dataset containing over 1800 annotated human images with a large range of pose variations and backgrounds."

In this work, we address both of these issues. We present a new data set of face images with more faces and more accurate annotations for face regions than in previous data sets.

The MALF dataset highlights in two main features: 1) It is the largest dataset for evaluation of face detection in the wild, and the annotation of multiple facial attributes makes it possible for fine-grained performance analysis. 2) To reveal the `true' performances of algorithms in practice, MALF adopts an evaluation metric that puts stress on the recall rate at a relatively low false alarm rate. Besides providing a large dataset for face detection evaluation, this paper also collects more than 20 state-of-the-art algorithms, both from academia and industry, and conducts a fine-grained comparative evaluation of these algorithms, which can be considered as a summary of past advances made in face detection.

There are three key contributions. The first is the introduction of a new image representation called the \u201cIntegral Image\u201d which allows the features used by our detector to be computed very quickly. The second is a simple and efficient classifier which is built using the AdaBoost learning algorithm (Freund and Schapire, 1995) to select a small number of critical visual features from a very large set of potential features. The third contribution is a method for combining classifiers in a \u201ccascade\u201d which allows background regions of the image to be quickly discarded while spending more computation on promising face-like regions. A set of experiments in the domain of face detection is presented. The system yields face detection performance comparable to the best previous systems (Sung and Poggio, 1998; Rowley et al., 1998; Schneiderman and Kanade, 2000; Roth et al., 2000). Implemented on a conventional desktop, face detection proceeds at 15 frames per second."

The And-Or model represents the regularities of car-to-car context and occlusion patterns at three levels: (i) layouts of spatially-coupled N cars, (ii) single cars with different viewpoint-occlusion configurations, and (iii) a small number of parts. The learning process consists of two stages. We first learn the structure of the And-Or model with three components: (a) mining N-car contextual patterns based on layouts of annotated single car bounding boxes, (b) mining the occlusion configurations based on the overlapping statistics between single cars, and (c) learning visible parts based on car 3D CAD simulation or heuristically mining latent car parts. The And-Or model is organized into a directed and acyclic graph which leads to the Dynamic Programming algorithm in inference. In the second stage, we jointly train the model parameters (for appearance, deformation and bias) using Weak-Label Structural SVM. In experiments, we test our model on four car datasets: the KITTI dataset [11], the street parking dataset [19], the PASCAL VOC2007 car dataset [7], and a self-collected parking lot dataset. We compare with state-of-the-art variants of deformable part-based models and other methods. Our model obtains significant improvement consistently on the four datasets."

This requirement is \u201cartificial\u201d and may reduce the recognition accuracy for the images or sub-images of an arbitrary size/scale. In this work, we equip the networks with another pooling strategy, \u201cspatial pyramid pooling\u201d, to eliminate the above requirement. The new network structure, called SPP-net, can generate a fixed-length representation regardless of image size/scale. Pyramid pooling is also robust to object deformations. With these advantages, SPP-net should in general improve all CNN-based image classification methods. On the ImageNet 2012 dataset, we demonstrate that SPP-net boosts the accuracy of a variety of CNN architectures despite their different designs. On the Pascal VOC 2007 and Caltech101 datasets, SPP-net achieves state-of-the-art classification results using a single full-image representation and no fine-tuning. The power of SPP-net is also significant in object detection. Using SPP-net, we compute the feature maps from the entire image only once, and then pool features in arbitrary regions (sub-images) to generate fixed-length representations for training the detectors. This method avoids repeatedly computing the convolutional features. In processing test images, our method is 24-102 <inline-formula><tex-math>$\\times$</tex-math><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:type=\"simple\" xlink:href=\"he-ieq2-2389824.gif\"/> </alternatives></inline-formula> faster than the R-CNN method, while achieving better or comparable accuracy on Pascal VOC 2007. In ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC) 2014, our methods rank #2 in object detection and #3 in image classification among all 38 teams. This manuscript also introduces the improvement made for this competition."

Unlike similar systems which are limited to detecting upright, frontal faces, this system detects faces at any degree of rotation in the image plane. The system employs multiple networks; a \"router\" network first processes each input window to determine its orientation and then uses this information to prepare the window for one or more \"detector\" networks. We present the training methods for both types of networks. We also perform sensitivity analysis on the networks, and present empirical results on a large test set. Finally, we present preliminary results for detecting faces rotated out of the image plane, such as profiles and semi-profiles."

Our work is motivated by the pictorial structure models introduced by Fischler and Elschlager. The basic idea is to represent an object by a collection of parts arranged in a deformable configuration. The appearance of each part is modeled separately, and the deformable configuration is represented by spring-like connections between pairs of parts. These models allow for qualitative descriptions of visual appearance, and are suitable for generic recognition problems. We address the problem of using pictorial structure models to find instances of an object in an image as well as the problem of learning an object model from training examples, presenting efficient algorithms in both cases. We demonstrate the techniques by learning models that represent faces and human bodies and using the resulting models to locate the corresponding objects in novel images."

On the test data, we achieved top-1 and top-5 error rates of 37.5% and 17.0%, respectively, which is considerably better than the previous state-of-the-art. The neural network, which has 60 million parameters and 650,000 neurons, consists of five convolutional layers, some of which are followed by max-pooling layers, and three fully connected layers with a final 1000-way softmax. To make training faster, we used non-saturating neurons and a very efficient GPU implementation of the convolution operation. To reduce overfitting in the fully connected layers we employed a recently developed regularization method called \"dropout\" that proved to be very effective. We also entered a variant of this model in the ILSVRC-2012 competition and achieved a winning top-5 test error rate of 15.3%, compared to 26.2% achieved by the second-best entry."

A retinally connected neural network examines small windows of an image and decides whether each window contains a face. The system arbitrates between multiple networks to improve performance over a single network. We use a bootstrap algorithm for training the networks, which adds false detections into the training set as training progresses. This eliminates the difficult task of manually selecting non-face training examples, which must be chosen to span the entire space of non-face images. Comparisons with other state-of-the-art face detection systems are presented; our system has better performance in terms of detection and false-positive rates."

Although specific domain knowledge can be used to help design representations, learning with generic priors can also be used, and the quest for AI is motivating the design of more powerful representation-learning algorithms implementing such priors. This paper reviews recent work in the area of unsupervised feature learning and deep learning, covering advances in probabilistic models, autoencoders, manifold learning, and deep networks. This motivates longer term unanswered questions about the appropriate objectives for learning good representations, for computing representations (i.e., inference), and the geometrical connections between representation learning, density estimation, and manifold learning."

In the first step, a rough localisation is performed by presenting each pixel with its neighbourhood to a neural net which is able to indicate whether this pixel and its neighbourhood are the image of the search object. This first filter does not discriminate for position. From its result, areas which might contain an image of the object can be selected. In the second step, these areas are presented to another neural net which can determine the exact position of the object in each area. This algorithm is applied to the problem of localising faces in images."
