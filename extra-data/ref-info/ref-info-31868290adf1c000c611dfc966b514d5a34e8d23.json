They can be trained to model windows of coefficients extracted from speech and they discover multiple layers of features that capture the higher-order statistical structure of the data. These features can be used to initialize the hidden units of a feed-forward neural network that is then trained to predict the HMM state for the central frame of the window. Initializing with features that are good at generating speech makes the neural network perform much better than initializing with random weights. DBNs have already been used successfully for phone recognition with input coefficients that are MFCCs or filterbank outputs [1, 2]. In this paper, we demonstrate that they work even better when their inputs are speaker adaptive, discriminative features. On the standard TIMIT corpus, they give phone error rates of 19.6% using monophone HMMs and a bigram language model and 19.4% using monophone HMMs and a trigram language model."

We show that better phone recognition on the TIMIT dataset can be achieved by replacing Gaussian mixture models by deep neural networks that contain many layers of features and a very large number of parameters. These networks are first pre-trained as a multi-layer generative model of a window of spectral feature vectors without making use of any discriminative information. Once the generative pre-training has designed the features, we perform discriminative fine-tuning using backpropagation to adjust the features slightly to make them better at predicting a probability distribution over the states of monophone hidden Markov models."

Although HMMs are a natural choice to warp the time axis and model the temporal phenomena in the speech signal, their conditional independence properties limit their ability to model spectral phenomena well. In this paper, a new acoustic modeling paradigm based on augmented conditional random fields (ACRFs) is investigated and developed. This paradigm addresses some limitations of HMMs while maintaining many of the aspects which have made them successful. In particular, the acoustic modeling problem is reformulated in a data driven, sparse, augmented space to increase discrimination. Acoustic context modeling is explicitly integrated to handle the sequential phenomena of the speech signal. We present an efficient framework for estimating these models that ensures scalability and generality. In the TIMIT phone recognition task, a phone error rate of 23.0% was recorded on the full test set, a significant improvement over comparable HMM-based systems."

We describe a pre-trained deep neural network hidden Markov model (DNN-HMM) hybrid architecture that trains the DNN to produce a distribution over senones (tied triphone states) as its output. The deep belief network pre-training algorithm is a robust and often helpful way to initialize deep neural networks generatively that can aid in optimization and reduce generalization error. We illustrate the key components of our model, describe the procedure for applying CD-DNN-HMMs to LVSR, and analyze the effects of various modeling choices on performance. Experiments on a challenging business search dataset demonstrate that CD-DNN-HMMs can significantly outperform the conventional context-dependent Gaussian mixture model (GMM)-HMMs, with an absolute sentence accuracy improvement of 5.8% and 9.2% (or relative error reduction of 16.0% and 23.2%) over the CD-GMM-HMMs trained using the minimum phone error rate (MPE) and maximum-likelihood (ML) criteria, respectively."

In contrast, Gaussian mixture HMM systems are discriminatively trained using sequence-based criteria, such as minimum phone error or maximum mutual information, that are more directly related to speech recognition accuracy. This paper demonstrates that neural-network acoustic models can be trained with sequence classification criteria using exactly the same lattice-based methods that have been developed for Gaussian mixture HMMs, and that using a sequence classification criterion in training leads to considerably better performance. A neural network acoustic model with 153K weights trained on 50 hours of broadcast news has a word error rate of 34.0% on the rt04 English broadcast news test set. When this model is trained with the state-level minimum Bayes risk criterion, the rt04 word error rate is 27.7%."

The success is largely attributed to the use of local filtering and max-pooling in the CNN architecture. In this paper, we propose to apply CNN to speech recognition within the framework of hybrid NN-HMM model. We propose to use local filtering and max-pooling in frequency domain to normalize speaker variance to achieve higher multi-speaker speech recognition performance. In our method, a pair of local filtering layer and max-pooling layer is added at the lowest end of neural network (NN) to normalize spectral variations of speech signals. In our experiments, the proposed CNN architecture is evaluated in a speaker independent speech recognition task using the standard TIMIT data sets. Experimental results show that the proposed CNN method can achieve over 10% relative error reduction in the core TIMIT test sets when comparing with a regular NN using the same number of hidden layers and weights. Our results also show that the best result of the proposed CNN model is better than previously published results on the same TIMIT test sets that use a pre-trained deep NN model."

By contrast, hybrid connectionist-HMM systems use discriminatively-trained neural networks to estimate the probability distribution among subword units given the acoustic observations. In this work we show a large improvement in word recognition performance by combining neural-net discriminative feature processing with Gaussian-mixture distribution modeling. By training the network to generate the subword probability posteriors, then using transformations of these estimates as the base features for a conventionally-trained Gaussian-mixture based system, we achieve relative error rate reductions of 35% or more on the multicondition Aurora noisy continuous digits task."

This paper concentrates on the maximum mutual information estimation (MMIE) criterion which has been used to train HMM systems for conversational telephone speech transcription using up to 265 hours of training data. These experiments represent the largest-scale application of discriminative training techniques for speech recognition of which the authors are aware. Details are given of the MMIE lattice-based implementation used with the extended Baum-Welch algorithm, which makes training of such large systems computationally feasible. Techniques for improving generalization using acoustic scaling and weakened language models are discussed. The overall technique has allowed the estimation of triphone and quinphone HMM parameters which has led to significant reductions in word error rate for the transcription of conversational telephone speech relative to our best systems trained using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). This is in contrast to some previous studies, which have concluded that there is little benefit in using discriminative training for the most difficult large vocabulary speech recognition tasks. The lattice MMIE-based discriminative training scheme is also shown to out-perform the frame discrimination technique. Various properties of the lattice-based MMIE training scheme are investigated including comparisons of different lattice processing strategies (full search and exact-match) and the effect of lattice size on performance. Furthermore a scheme based on the linear interpolation of the MMIE and MLE objective functions is shown to reduce the danger of over-training. It is shown that HMMs trained with MMIE benefit as much as MLE-trained HMMs from applying model adaptation using maximum likelihood linear regression (MLLR). This has allowed the straightforward integration of MMIE-trained HMMs into complex multi-pass systems for transcription of conversational telephone speech and has contributed to our MMIE-trained systems giving the lowest word error rates in both the 2000 and 2001 NIST Hub5 evaluations."

However, the first-layer Gaussian-Bernoulli Restricted Boltzmann Machine (GRBM) has an important limitation, shared with mixtures of diagonal-covariance Gaussians: GRBMs treat different components of the acoustic input vector as conditionally independent given the hidden state. The mean-covariance restricted Boltzmann machine (mcRBM), first introduced for modeling natural images, is a much more representationally efficient and powerful way of modeling the covariance structure of speech data. Every configuration of the precision units of the mcRBM specifies a different precision matrix for the conditional distribution over the acoustic space. In this work, we use the mcRBM to learn features of speech data that serve as input into a standard DBN. The mcRBM features combined with DBNs allow us to achieve a phone error rate of 20.5%, which is superior to all published results on speaker-independent TIMIT to date."

They are competitive for three reasons: DBNs can be fine-tuned as neural networks; DBNs have many non-linear hidden layers; and DBNs are generatively pre-trained. This paper illustrates how each of these three aspects contributes to the DBN's good recognition performance using both phone recognition performance on the TIMIT corpus and a dimensionally reduced visualization of the relationships between the feature vectors learned by the DBNs that preserves the similarity structure of the feature vectors at multiple scales. The same two methods are also used to investigate the most suitable type of input representation for a DBN."

In this framework, neural networks (and in particular, multilayer perceptrons or MLPs) have been restricted to well-defined subtasks of the whole system, i.e., HMM emission probability estimation and feature extraction. The book describes a successful five year international collaboration between the authors. The lessons learned form a case study that demonstrates how hybrid systems can be developed to combine neural networks with more traditional statistical approaches. The book illustrates both the advantages and limitations of neural networks in the framework of a statistical system. Using standard databases and comparing with some conventional approaches, it is shown that MLP probability estimation can improve recognition performance. Other approaches are discussed, though there is no such unequivocal experimental result for these methods. Connectionist Speech Recognition: A Hybrid Approach is of use to anyone intending to use neural networks for speech recognition or within the framework provided by an existing successful statistical approach. This includes research and development groups working in the field of speech recognition, both with standard and neural network approaches, as well as other pattern recognition and/or neural network researchers. This book is also suitable as a text for advanced courses on neural networks or speech processing."

In the original DBNs, only framelevel information was used for training DBN weights while it has been known for long that sequential or full-sequence information can be helpful in improving speech recognition accuracy. In this paper we investigate approaches to optimizing the DBN weights, state-to-state transition parameters, and language model scores using the sequential discriminative training criterion. We describe and analyze the proposed training algorithm and strategy, and discuss practical issues and how they affect the final results. We show that the DBNs learned using the sequence-based training criterion outperform those with frame-based criterion using both threelayer and six-layer models, but the optimization procedure for the deeper DBN is more difficult for the former criterion."

As expected, we show that pre-training can initialize weights to a point in the space where fine-tuning can be effective and thus is crucial in training deep structured models. However, a moderate increase of the amount of unlabeled pre-training data has an insignificant effect on the final recognition results as long as the original training size is sufficiently large to initialize the DBN weights. On the other hand, with additional labeled training data, the fine-tuning phase of DBN training can significantly improve the recognition accuracy."

Analogous to structured language models where syntactic structure is exploited to represent long-distance relationships among words , the structured speech model described in this paper makes use of the dynamic structure in the hidden vocal tract resonance space to characterize long-span contextual influence among phonetic units. A general overview is provided first on hierarchically classified types of dynamic speech models in the literature. A detailed account is then given for a specific model type called the hidden trajectory model, and we describe detailed steps of model construction and the parameter estimation algorithms. We show how the use of resonance target parameters and their temporal filtering enables joint modeling of long-span coarticulation and phonetic reduction effects. Experiments on phonetic recognition evaluation demonstrate superior recognizer performance over a modern hidden Markov model-based system. Error analysis shows that the greatest performance gain occurs within the sonorant speech class"

In this paper we employ deep neural networks (DNNs) to improve detection accuracy over conventional shallow MLPs (multi-layer perceptrons) with one hidden layer. A range of DNN architectures with five to seven hidden layers and up to 2048 hidden units per layer have been explored. Training on the SI84 and testing on the Nov92 WSJ data, the proposed DNNs achieve significant improvements over the shallow MLPs, producing greater than 90% frame-level attribute estimation accuracies for all 21 attributes tested for the full system. On the phone detection task, we also obtain excellent frame-level accuracy of 86.6%. With this level of high-precision detection of basic speech units we have opened the door to a new family of flexible speech recognition system design for both top-down and bottom-up, lattice-based search strategies and knowledge integration."

First, heterogeneous acoustic measurements are chosen in order to maximize the acoustic-phonetic information extracted from the speech signal in preprocessing. Second, classifier systems are presented for successfully utilizing high-dimensional acoustic measurement spaces. The techniques used for achieving these two goals can be broadly categorized as hierarchical, committeebased, or a hybrid of these two. This paper presents committeebased and hybrid approaches. In context-independent classification and context-dependent recognition on the TIMIT core test set using 39 classes, the system achieved error rates of 18.3% and 24.4%, respectively. These error rates are the lowest we have seen reported on these tasks. In addition, experiments with a telephone-based weather information word recognition task led to word error rate reductions of 10\u201316%."

A learning algorithm for the T-DSN is presented, in which the main parameter estimation burden is shifted to a convex sub-problem with a closed-form solution. Using an efficient and scalable parallel implementation, we train a T-DSN to discriminate standard three-state monophones in the TIMIT database. The T-DSN outperforms an alternative pretrained Deep Neural Network (DNN) architecture in frame-level classification (both state and phone) and in the cross-entropy measure. For continuous phonetic recognition, T-DSN performs equivalently to a DNN but without the need for a hard-to-scale, sequential fine-tuning step."

Both linear and non-linear functions of an observation sequence are used as features to be modeled. This paper shows that this combination of multiple acoustic models can be expressed as a product of experts (PoE); the likelihoods from the models are scaled, multiplied together, and then normalized. Normally these models are individually trained and only combined at the synthesis stage. This paper discusses a more consistent PoE framework where the models are jointly trained. A training algorithm for PoEs based on linear feature functions and Gaussian experts is derived by generalizing the training algorithm for trajectory HMMs. However for non-linear feature functions or non-Gaussian experts this is not possible, so a scheme based on contrastive divergence learning is described. Experimental results show that the PoE framework provides both a mathematically elegant way to train multiple acoustic models jointly and significant improvements in the quality of the synthesized speech."

The key theme of the workshop was to improve on state-of-the-art speech recognition systems by using Segmental Conditional Random Fields (SCRFs) to integrate multiple types of information. This approach uses a state-of-the-art baseline as a springboard from which to add a suite of novel features including ones derived from acoustic templates, deep neural net phoneme detections, duration models, modulation features, and whole word point-process models. The SCRF framework is able to appropriately weight these different information sources to produce significant gains on both the Broadcast News and Wall Street Journal tasks."

However, to our knowledge, these deep learning approaches have not been extensively studied for auditory data. In this paper, we apply convolutional deep belief networks to audio data and empirically evaluate them on various audio classification tasks. In the case of speech data, we show that the learned features correspond to phones/phonemes. In addition, our feature representations learned from unlabeled audio data show very good performance for multiple audio classification tasks. We hope that this paper will inspire more research on deep learning approaches applied to a wide range of audio recognition tasks."

The formulation of this generalized HTM is presented in the generative-modeling framework, enabling efficient computation of the joint likelihood for both static and delta cepstral sequences as the acoustic features given the model. The parameter estimation techniques for the new model are developed and presented, giving closed-form estimation formulas after the use of vector Taylor series approximation. We show principled generalization from the earlier static-cepstra HTM to the new static/delta-cepstra HTM not only in terms of model formulations but also in terms of their respective analytical forms in (monophone) parameter estimation. Experimental results on the standard TIMIT phonetic recognition task demonstrate recognition accuracy improvement over the earlier best HTM system, both significantly better than state-of-the-art triphone HMM systems."

In this paper, our recent development of an overlapping-feature-based phonological model that represents long-span contextual dependency in speech acoustics is reported. In this model, high-level linguistic constraints are incorporated in automatic construction of the patterns of feature-overlapping and of the hidden Markov model (HMM) states induced by such patterns. The main linguistic information explored includes word and phrase boundaries, morpheme, syllable, syllable constituent categories, and word stress. A consistent computational framework developed for the construction of the feature-based model and the major components of the model are described.

SMLP learns the transformation from the inputs to the targets as in multilayer perceptron (MLP) while the outputs of one of the internal hidden layers is forced to be sparse. This is achieved by adding a sparse regularization term to the cross-entropy cost and updating the parameters of the network to minimize the joint cost. On the TIMIT phoneme recognition task, SMLP-based systems trained on individual speech recognition feature streams perform significantly better than the corresponding MLP-based systems. Phoneme error rate of 19.6% is achieved using the combination of SMLP-based systems, a relative improvement of 3.0% over the combination of MLP-based systems."

While achieving impressive recognition error rate reduction, we face the insurmountable problem of scalability in dealing with virtually unlimited amount of training data available nowadays. To overcome the scalability challenge, we have designed the deep convex network (DCN) architecture. The learning problem in DCN is convex within each module. Additional structure-exploited fine tuning further improves the quality of DCN. The full learning in DCN is batch-mode based instead of stochastic, naturally lending it amenable to parallel training that can be distributed over many machines. Experimental results on both MNIST and TIMIT tasks evaluated thus far demonstrate superior performance of DCN over the DBN (Deep Belief Network) counterpart that forms the basis of the DNN. The superiority is reflected not only in training scalability and CPU-only computation, but more importantly in classification accuracy in both tasks."

Current laboratory systems are capable of transcribing continuous speech from any speaker with average word-error rates between 5% and 10%. If speaker adaptation is allowed, then after 2 or 3 minutes of speech, the error rate will drop well below 5% for most speakers. LVR systems had been limited to dictation applications since the systems were speaker dependent and required words to be spoken with a short pause between them. However, the capability to recognize natural continuous-speech input from any speaker opens up many more applications. As a result, LVR technology appears to be on the brink of widespread deployment across a range of information technology (IT) systems. This article discusses the principles and architecture of current LVR systems and identifies the key issues affecting their future deployment. To illustrate the various points raised, the Cambridge University HTK system is described. This system is a modem design that gives state-of-the-art performance, and it is typical of the current generation of recognition systems."

For this reason, authors have proposed methods that incorporate different (and larger) analysis windows, which are described in this article. Note in passing that we and many others have already taken advantage of processing techniques that incorporate information over long time ranges, for instance for normalization (by cepstral mean subtraction as stated in B. Atal (1974) or relative spectral analysis (RASTA) based in H. Hermansky and N. Morgan (1994)). They also have proposed features that are based on speech sound class posterior probabilities, which have good properties for both classification and stream combination."

Recently, an alternative structure was proposed which trains a NN with a constant number of hidden units to predict output targets, and then reduces the dimensionality of these output probabilities through an auto-encoder, to create auto-encoder bottleneck (AE-BN) features. The benefit of placing the BN after the posterior estimation network is that it avoids the loss in frame classification accuracy incurred by networks that place the BN before the softmax. In this work, we investigate the use of pre-training when creating AE-BN features. Our experiments indicate that with the AE-BN architecture, pre-trained and deeper NNs produce better AE-BN features. On a 50-hour English Broadcast News task, the AE-BN features provide over a 1% absolute improvement compared to a state-of-the-art GMM/HMM with a WER of 18.8% and pre-trained NN hybrid system with a WER of 18.4%. In addition, on a larger 430-hour Broadcast News task, AE-BN features provide a 0.5% absolute improvement over a strong GMM/HMM baseline with a WER of 16.0%. Finally, system combination with the GMM/HMM baseline and AE-BN systems provides an additional 0.5% absolute on 430 hours over the AE-BN system alone, yielding a final WER of 15.0%."

The basic design philosophy has been motivated by the theory of distinctive features and by a new form of phonology which argues for use of multidimensional articulatory structures. In this paper, the most recently developed feature\u2010based recognizer is presented, which is capable of operating on all classes of English sounds. Detailed descriptions of the design considerations for the recognizer and of key aspects of the design process are provided. This process, which is called lexicon \u2018\u2018compilation,\u2019\u2019 consists of three elements (1) establishing a feature\u2010specification system; (2) constructing a probabilistic and fractional temporal overlapping pattern across the features; and (3) mapping from the feature\u2010overlap pattern to a state\u2010transition graph. A standard phonetic classification task from the TIMIT database is used as a test bed to evaluate the performance of the recognizer. The experimental results provide preliminary evidence for the effectiveness of the feature\u2010based approach to speech recognition."

Our findings suggest that DBNs outperform single layer MLPs under the clean condition, but the gains diminish as the noise level is increased. Furthermore, using MFCCs in conjunction with the posteriors from DBNs outperforms merely using single DBNs in low to moderate noise conditions. MFCCs, however, do not help for the high noise settings."

CRFs have previously been shown to be effective combiners of posterior estimates from multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) in phone and word recognition tasks. In this paper, we describe a novel hybrid Multilayer-CRF structure (ML-CRF), where a MLP-like hidden layer serves as input to the CRF; moreover, we propose a technique for directly training the ML-CRF to optimize a conditional log-likelihood based criterion, based on error backpropagation. The proposed technique thus allows for the implicit learning of suitable feature functions for the CRF. We present results for initial phone recognition experiments on the TIMIT database that indicate that our proposed method is a promising approach for training CRFs."

                "text": "The use of exemplar-based methods, such as support vector machines (SVMs), k-nearest neighbors (kNNs) and sparse representations (SRs), in speech recognition has thus far been limited. Exemplar-based techniques utilize information about individual training examples and are computationally expensive, making it particularly difficult to investigate these methods on large-vocabulary continuous speech recognition (LVCSR) tasks. While research in LVCSR provides a good testbed to tackle real-world speech recognition problems, research in this area suffers from two main drawbacks. First, the overall complexity of an LVCSR system makes error analysis quite difficult. Second, exploring new research ideas on LVCSR tasks involves training and testing state-of-the-art LVCSR systems, which can render a large turnaround time. This makes a small vocabulary task such as TIMIT more appealing. TIMIT provides a phonetically rich and hand-labeled corpus that allows easy insight into new algorithms. However, research ideas explored for small vocabulary tasks do not always provide gains on LVCSR systems. In this paper, we combine the advantages of using both small and large vocabulary tasks by taking well-established techniques used in LVCSR systems and applying them on TIMIT to establish a new baseline. We then utilize these existing LVCSR techniques in creating a novel set of exemplar-based sparse representation (SR) features. Using these existing LVCSR techniques, we achieve a phonetic error rate (PER) of 19.4% on the TIMIT task. The additional use of SR features reduce the PER to 18.6%. We then explore applying the SR features to a large vocabulary Broadcast News task, where we achieve a 0.3% absolute reduction in word error rate (WER)."

First, because of the large number of parameters and poorly labeled transcriptions, gaining insight into further improvements based on error analysis is very difficult. Second, LVCSR systems often take a significantly longer time to train and test new research ideas compared to small vocabulary tasks. A small vocabulary task like TIMIT provides a phonetically rich and hand-labeled corpus and offers a good test bed to study algorithmic improvements. However, oftentimes research ideas explored for small vocabulary tasks do not always provide gains on LVCSR systems. In this paper, we address these issues by taking the standard \u021crecipe\u021d used in typical LVCSR systems and applying it to the TIMIT phonetic recognition corpus, which provides a standard benchmark to compare methods. We find that at the speaker-independent (SI) level, our results offer comparable performance to other SI HMM systems. By taking advantage of speaker adaptation and discriminative training techniques commonly used in LVCSR systems, we achieve an error rate of 20%, the best results reported on the TIMIT task to date, moving us closer to the human reported phonetic recognition error rate of 15%. We propose the use of this system as the baseline for future research and believe that it will serve as a good framework to explore ideas that will carry over to LVCSR systems."

This paper introduces a new statistical framework, derived from the Bayesian principle, to perform such a composition. The potential power of this new framework is explored, both algorithmically and experimentally, by an implementation with hidden Markov modeling techniques. This implementation is applied to the recognition of the 39-phone set on the TIMIT database. The new model achieves 74.4% and 75.6% accuracy, respectively, on the core and complete test sets."

                "text": "Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM) continue to be a popular methodology to pre-train weights of Deep Belief Networks (DBNs). However, the RBM objective function cannot be maximized directly. Therefore, it is not clear what function to monitor when deciding to stop the training, leading to a challenge in managing the computational costs. The Sparse Encoding Symmetric Machine (SESM) has been suggested as an alternative method for pre-training. By placing a sparseness term on the NN output codebook, SESM allows the objective function to be optimized directly and reliably be monitored as an indicator to stop the training. In this paper, we explore SESM to pre-train DBNs and apply this the first time to speech recognition. First, we provide a detailed analysis comparing the behavior of SESM and RBM. Second, we compare the performance of SESM pre-trained and RBM pre-trained DBNs on TIMIT and a 50 hour English Broadcast News task. Results indicate that pre-trained DBNs using SESM and RBMs achieve comparable performance and outperform randomly initialized DBNs with SESM providing a much easier stopping criterion relative to RBM."

This technique uses three concepts from the psychophysics of hearing to derive an estimate of the auditory spectrum: (1) the critical-band spectral resolution, (2) the equal-loudness curve, and (3) the intensity-loudness power law. The auditory spectrum is then approximated by an autoregressive all-pole model. A 5th-order all-pole model is effective in suppressing speaker-dependent details of the auditory spectrum. In comparison with conventional linear predictive (LP) analysis, PLP analysis is more consistent with human hearing. The effective second formant F2' and the 3.5-Bark spectral-peak integration theories of vowel perception are well accounted for. PLP analysis is computationally efficient and yields a low-dimensional representation of speech. These properties are found to be useful in speaker-independent automatic-speech recognition."

The modification consists of boosting the likelihoods of paths in the denominator lattice that have a higher phone error relative to the correct transcript, by using the same phone accuracy function that is used in Minimum Phone Error (MPE) training. We combine this with another improvement to our implementation of the Extended Baum-Welch update equations for MMI, namely the canceling of any shared part of the numerator and denominator statistics on each frame (a procedure that is already done in MPE). This change affects the Gaussian-specific learning rate. We also investigate another modification whereby we replace I-smoothing to the ML estimate with I-smoothing to the previous iteration's value. Boosted MMI gives better results than MPE in both model and feature-space discriminative training, although not consistently."

In this work, we are exploring the possibility of obtaining the features directly from neural net without the necessity of converting output probabilities to features suitable for subsequent GMM-HMM system. We experimented with 5-layer MLP with bottle-neck in the middle layer. After training such a neural net, we used outputs of the bottle-neck as features for GMM-HMM recognition system. The benefits are twofold: first, improvement was gained when these features are used instead of the probabilistic features, second, the size of the system was reduced, as only part of the neural net is used. The experiments were performed on meetings recognition task defined in MST RT'05 evaluation."

The operation of the system is based on a set of functions of time obtained from acoustic analysis of a fixed, sentence-long utterance. Cepstrum coefficients are extracted by means of LPC analysis successively throughout an utterance to form time functions, and frequency response distortions introduced by transmission systems are removed. The time functions are expanded by orthogonal polynomial representations and, after a feature selection procedure, brought into time registration with stored reference functions to calculate the overall distance. This is accomplished by a new time warping method using a dynamic programming technique. A decision is made to accept or reject an identity claim, based on the overall distance. Reference functions and decision thresholds are updated for each customer. Several sets of experimental utterances were used for the evaluation of the system, which include male and female utterances recorded over a conventional telephone connection. Male utterances processed by ADPCM and LPC coding systems were used together with unprocessed utterances. Results of the experiment indicate that verification error rate of one percent or less can be obtained even if the reference and test utterances are subjected to different transmission conditions."

We present the Deep Stacking Network (DSN), which overcomes the problem of parallelizing learning algorithms for deep architectures. The DSN provides a method of stacking simple processing modules in buiding deep architectures, with a convex learning problem in each module. Additional fine tuning further improves the DSN, while introducing minor non-convexity. Full learning in the DSN is batch-mode, making it amenable to parallel training over many machines and thus be scalable over the potentially huge size of the training data. Experimental results on both the MNIST (image) and TIMIT (speech) classification tasks demonstrate that the DSN learning algorithm developed in this work is not only parallelizable in implementation but it also attains higher classification accuracy than the DNN."

We emphasize data layout, batching of the computation, the use of SSE2 instructions, and particularly leverage SSSE3 and SSE4 fixed-point instructions which provide a 3\u00d7 improvement over an optimized floating-point baseline. We use speech recognition as an example task, and show that a real-time hybrid hidden Markov model / neural network (HMM/NN) large vocabulary system can be built with a 10\u00d7 speedup over an unoptimized baseline and a 4\u00d7 speedup over an aggressively optimized floating-point baseline at no cost in accuracy. The techniques described extend readily to neural network training and provide an effective alternative to the use of specialized hardware."

The resulting algorithm is a straightforward variation on the stacking of ordinary autoencoders. It is however shown on a benchmark of classification problems to yield significantly lower classification error, thus bridging the performance gap with deep belief networks (DBN), and in several cases surpassing it. Higher level representations learnt in this purely unsupervised fashion also help boost the performance of subsequent SVM classifiers. Qualitative experiments show that, contrary to ordinary autoencoders, denoising autoencoders are able to learn Gabor-like edge detectors from natural image patches and larger stroke detectors from digit images. This work clearly establishes the value of using a denoising criterion as a tractable unsupervised objective to guide the learning of useful higher level representations."

                "text": "Whereas before 2006 it appears that deep multilayer neural networks were not successfully trained, since then several algorithms have been shown to successfully train them, with experimental results showing the superiority of deeper vs less deep architectures. All these experimental results were obtained with new initialization or training mechanisms. Our objective here is to understand better why standard gradient descent from random initialization is doing so poorly with deep neural networks, to better understand these recent relative successes and help design better algorithms in the future. We first observe the influence of the non-linear activations functions. We find that the logistic sigmoid activation is unsuited for deep networks with random initialization because of its mean value, which can drive especially the top hidden layer into saturation. Surprisingly, we find that saturated units can move out of saturation by themselves, albeit slowly, and explaining the plateaus sometimes seen when training neural networks. We find that a new non-linearity that saturates less can often be beneficial. Finally, we study how activations and gradients vary across layers and during training, with the idea that training may be more difficult when the singular values of the Jacobian associated with each layer are far from 1. Based on these considerations, we propose a new initialization scheme that brings substantially faster convergence. 1 Deep Neural Networks Deep learning methods aim at learning feature hierarchies with features from higher levels of the hierarchy formed by the composition of lower level features. They include Appearing in Proceedings of the 13 International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics (AISTATS) 2010, Chia Laguna Resort, Sardinia, Italy. Volume 9 of JMLR: WC Weston et al., 2008). Much attention has recently been devoted to them (see (Bengio, 2009) for a review), because of their theoretical appeal, inspiration from biology and human cognition, and because of empirical success in vision (Ranzato et al., 2007; Larochelle et al., 2007; Vincent et al., 2008) and natural language processing (NLP) (Collobert & Weston, 2008; Mnih & Hinton, 2009). Theoretical results reviewed and discussed by Bengio (2009), suggest that in order to learn the kind of complicated functions that can represent high-level abstractions (e.g. in vision, language, and other AI-level tasks), one may need deep architectures. Most of the recent experimental results with deep architecture are obtained with models that can be turned into deep supervised neural networks, but with initialization or training schemes different from the classical feedforward neural networks (Rumelhart et al., 1986). Why are these new algorithms working so much better than the standard random initialization and gradient-based optimization of a supervised training criterion? Part of the answer may be found in recent analyses of the effect of unsupervised pretraining (Erhan et al., 2009), showing that it acts as a regularizer that initializes the parameters in a \u201cbetter\u201d basin of attraction of the optimization procedure, corresponding to an apparent local minimum associated with better generalization. But earlier work (Bengio et al., 2007) had shown that even a purely supervised but greedy layer-wise procedure would give better results. So here instead of focusing on what unsupervised pre-training or semi-supervised criteria bring to deep architectures, we focus on analyzing what may be going wrong with good old (but deep) multilayer neural networks. Our analysis is driven by investigative experiments to monitor activations (watching for saturation of hidden units) and gradients, across layers and across training iterations. We also evaluate the effects on these of choices of activation function (with the idea that it might affect saturation) and initialization procedure (since unsupervised pretraining is a particular form of initialization and it has a drastic impact)."

Using complementary priors, we derive a fast, greedy algorithm that can learn deep, directed belief networks one layer at a time, provided the top two layers form an undirected associative memory. The fast, greedy algorithm is used to initialize a slower learning procedure that fine-tunes the weights using a contrastive version of the wake-sleep algorithm. After fine-tuning, a network with three hidden layers forms a very good generative model of the joint distribution of handwritten digit images and their labels. This generative model gives better digit classification than the best discriminative learning algorithms. The low-dimensional manifolds on which the digits lie are modeled by long ravines in the free-energy landscape of the top-level associative memory, and it is easy to explore these ravines by using the directed connections to display what the associative memory has in mind."

As a first step, this group reviewed major developments in the field and the circumstances that led to their success and then focused on areas it deemed especially fertile for future research. Part 1 of this article will focus on historically significant developments in the ASR area, including several major research efforts that were guided by different funding agencies, and suggest general areas in which to focus research."

Though they have demonstrated impressive performance, to date, they have only been evaluated on relatively simple problems such as digit recognition in a controlled environment, for which many machine learning algorithms already report reasonable results. Here, we present a series of experiments which indicate that these models show promise in solving harder learning problems that exhibit many factors of variation. These models are compared with well-established algorithms such as Support Vector Machines and single hidden-layer feed-forward neural networks."

As a result of the weight adjustments, internal \u2018hidden\u2019 units which are not part of the input or output come to represent important features of the task domain, and the regularities in the task are captured by the interactions of these units. The ability to create useful new features distinguishes back-propagation from earlier, simpler methods such as the perceptron-convergence procedure1."

Despite its ease of implementation, SGDs are difficult to tune and parallelize. These problems make it challenging to develop, debug and scale up deep learning algorithms with SGDs. In this paper, we show that more sophisticated off-the-shelf optimization methods such as Limited memory BFGS (L-BFGS) and Conjugate gradient (CG) with line search can significantly simplify and speed up the process of pretraining deep algorithms. In our experiments, the difference between L-BFGS/CG and SGDs are more pronounced if we consider algorithmic extensions (e.g., sparsity regularization) and hardware extensions (e.g., GPUs or computer clusters). Our experiments with distributed optimization support the use of L-BFGS with locally connected networks and convolutional neural networks. Using L-BFGS, our convolutional network model achieves 0.69% on the standard MNIST dataset. This is a state-of-the-art result on MNIST among algorithms that do not use distortions or pretraining."

We show that by adding a well chosen penalty term to the classical reconstruction cost function, we can achieve results that equal or surpass those attained by other regularized auto-encoders as well as denoising auto-encoders on a range of datasets. This penalty term corresponds to the Frobenius norm of the Jacobian matrix of the encoder activations with respect to the input. We show that this penalty term results in a localized space contraction which in turn yields robust features on the activation layer. Furthermore, we show how this penalty term is related to both regularized auto-encoders and denoising auto-encoders and how it can be seen as a link between deterministic and non-deterministic auto-encoders. We find empirically that this penalty helps to carve a representation that better captures the local directions of variation dictated by the data, corresponding to a lower-dimensional non-linear manifold, while being more invariant to the vast majority of directions orthogonal to the manifold. Finally, we show that by using the learned features to initialize a MLP, we achieve state of the art classification error on a range of datasets, surpassing other methods of pretraining."

This way of combining individual expert models makes it hard to generate samples from the combined model but easy to infer the values of the latent variables of each expert, because the combination rule ensures that the latent variables of different experts are conditionally independent when given the data. A product of experts (PoE) is therefore an interesting candidate for a perceptual system in which rapid inference is vital and generation is unnecessary. Training a PoE by maximizing the likelihood of the data is difficult because it is hard even to approximate the derivatives of the renormalization term in the combination rule. Fortunately, a PoE can be trained using a different objective function called contrastive divergence whose derivatives with regard to the parameters can be approximated accurately and efficiently. Examples are presented of contrastive divergence learning using several types of expert on several types of data."

                "text": "In this article, we studied the objective functions of MMI, MCE, and MPE/MWE for discriminative learning in sequential pattern recognition. We presented an approach that unifies the objective functions of MMI, MCE, and MPE/MWE in a common rational-function form of (25). The exact structure of the rational-function form for each discriminative criterion was derived and studied. While the rational-function form of MMI has been known in the past, we provided the theoretical proof that the similar rational-function form exists for the objective functions of MCE and MPE/MWE. Moreover, we showed that the rational function forms for objective functions of MMI, MCE, and MPE/MWE differ in the constant weighting factors CDT (s1 . . . sR) and these weighting factors depend only on the labeled sequence s1 . . . sR, and are independent of the parameter set - to be optimized. The derived rational-function form for MMI, MCE, and MPE/MWE allows the GT/EBW-based parameter optimization framework to be applied directly in discriminative learning. In the past, lack of the appropriate rational-function form was a difficulty for MCE and MPE/MWE, because without this form, the GT/EBW-based parameter optimization framework cannot be directly applied. Based on the unified rational-function form, in a tutorial style, we derived the GT/EBW-based parameter optimization formulas for both discrete HMMs and CDHMMs in discriminative learning using MMI, MCE, and MPE/MWE criteria. The unifying review provided in this article has been based upon a large number of earlier contributions that have been cited and discussed throughout the article. Here we provide a brief summary of such background work. Extension to large-scale speech recognition tasks was accomplished in the work of [59] and [60]. The dissertation of [47] further improved the MMI criterion to that of MPE/MWE. In a parallel vein, the work of [20] provided an alternative approach to that of [41], with an attempt to more rigorously provide a CDHMM model re-estimation formula that gives positive growth of the MMI objective function. A crucial error of this attempt was corrected in [2] for establishing an existence proof of such positive growth. The main goal of this article is to provide an underlying foundation for MMI, MCE, and MPE/MWE at the objective function level to facilitate the development of new parameter optimization techniques and to incorporate other pattern recognition concepts, e.g., discriminative margins [66], into the current discriminative learning paradigm."

RBMs are usually trained using the contrastive divergence learning procedure. This requires a certain amount of practical experience to decide how to set the values of numerical meta-parameters. Over the last few years, the machine learning group at the University of Toronto has acquired considerable expertise at training RBMs and this guide is an attempt to share this expertise with other machine learning researchers."

Our method is practical, easy to use, scales nicely to very large datasets, and isn't limited in applicability to auto-encoders, or any specific model class.
