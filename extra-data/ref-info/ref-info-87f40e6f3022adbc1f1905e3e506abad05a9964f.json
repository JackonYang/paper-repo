However, they cannot capture the compositional meaning of longer phrases, preventing them from a deeper understanding of language. We introduce a recursive neural network (RNN) model that learns compositional vector representations for phrases and sentences of arbitrary syntactic type and length. Our model assigns a vector and a matrix to every node in a parse tree: the vector captures the inherent meaning of the constituent, while the matrix captures how it changes the meaning of neighboring words or phrases. This matrix-vector RNN can learn the meaning of operators in propositional logic and natural language. The model obtains state of the art performance on three different experiments: predicting fine-grained sentiment distributions of adverb-adjective pairs; classifying sentiment labels of movie reviews and classifying semantic relationships such as cause-effect or topic-message between nouns using the syntactic path between them."

In this paper, we examine the vector-space word representations that are implicitly learned by the input-layer weights. We find that these representations are surprisingly good at capturing syntactic and semantic regularities in language, and that each relationship is characterized by a relation-specific vector offset. This allows vector-oriented reasoning based on the offsets between words. For example, the male/female relationship is automatically learned, and with the induced vector representations, \u201cKing Man + Woman\u201d results in a vector very close to \u201cQueen.\u201d We demonstrate that the word vectors capture syntactic regularities by means of syntactic analogy questions (provided with this paper), and are able to correctly answer almost 40% of the questions. We demonstrate that the word vectors capture semantic regularities by using the vector offset method to answer SemEval-2012 Task 2 questions. Remarkably, this method outperforms the best previous systems."

                "text": "A goal of statistical language modeling is to learn the joint probability function of sequences of words in a language. This is intrinsically difficult because of the curse of dimensionality: a word sequence on which the model will be tested is likely to be different from all the word sequences seen during training. Traditional but very successful approaches based on n-grams obtain generalization by concatenating very short overlapping sequences seen in the training set. We propose to fight the curse of dimensionality by learning a distributed representation for words which allows each training sentence to inform the model about an exponential number of semantically neighboring sentences. The model learns simultaneously (1) a distributed representation for each word along with (2) the probability function for word sequences, expressed in terms of these representations. Generalization is obtained because a sequence of words that has never been seen before gets high probability if it is made of words that are similar (in the sense of having a nearby representation) to words forming an already seen sentence. Training such large models (with millions of parameters) within a reasonable time is itself a significant challenge. We report on experiments using neural networks for the probability function, showing on two text corpora that the proposed approach significantly improves on state-of-the-art n-gram models, and that the proposed approach allows to take advantage of longer contexts."

We investigate the behaviour of the algorithm on the Penn Treebank corpus and show that it reduces the training times by more than an order of magnitude without affecting the quality of the resulting models. The algorithm is also more efficient and much more stable than importance sampling because it requires far fewer noise samples to perform well. \n \nWe demonstrate the scalability of the proposed approach by training several neural language models on a 47M-word corpus with a 80K-word vocabulary, obtaining state-of-the-art results on the Microsoft Research Sentence Completion Challenge dataset."

One way to extend beyond words is to compare two tuples using a function that combines pairwise similarities between the component words in the tuples. A strength of this approach is that it works with both relational similarity (analogy) and compositional similarity (paraphrase). However, past work required hand-coding the combination function for different tasks. The main contribution of this paper is that combination functions are generated by supervised learning. We achieve state-of-the-art results in measuring relational similarity between word pairs (SAT analogies and SemEval 2012 Task 2) and measuring compositional similarity between noun-modifier phrases and unigrams (multiple-choice paraphrase questions)."

The main advantage of these architectures is that they learn an embedding for words (or other symbols) in a continuous space that helps to smooth the language model and provide good generalization even when the number of training examples is insufficient. However, these models are extremely slow in comparison to the more commonly used n-gram models, both for training and recognition. As an alternative to an importance sampling method proposed to speed-up training, we introduce a hierarchical decomposition of the conditional probabilities that yields a speed-up of about 200 both during training and recognition. The hierarchical decomposition is a binary hierarchical clustering constrained by the prior knowledge extracted from the WordNet semantic hierarchy."

The main drawback of NPLMs is their extremely long training and testing times. Morin and Bengio have proposed a hierarchical language model built around a binary tree of words, which was two orders of magnitude faster than the non-hierarchical model it was based on. However, it performed considerably worse than its non-hierarchical counterpart in spite of using a word tree created using expert knowledge. We introduce a fast hierarchical language model along with a simple feature-based algorithm for automatic construction of word trees from the data. We then show that the resulting models can outperform non-hierarchical neural models as well as the best n-gram models."

This profoundly limits our ability to give instructions to computers, the ability of computers to explain their actions to us, and the ability of computers to analyse and process text. Vector space models (VSMs) of semantics are beginning to address these limits. This paper surveys the use of VSMs for semantic processing of text. We organize the literature on VSMs according to the structure of the matrix in a VSM. There are currently three broad classes of VSMs, based on term-document, word-context, and pair-pattern matrices, yielding three classes of applications. We survey a broad range of applications in these three categories and we take a detailed look at a specific open source project in each category. Our goal in this survey is to show the breadth of applications of VSMs for semantics, to provide a new perspective on VSMs for those who are already familiar with the area, and to provide pointers into the literature for those who are less familiar with the field."

All the tasks use labeled data except the language model which is learnt from unlabeled text and represents a novel form of semi-supervised learning for the shared tasks. We show how both multitask learning and semi-supervised learning improve the generalization of the shared tasks, resulting in state-of-the-art-performance."

Discovering this recursive structure helps us to not only identify the units that an image or sentence contains but also how they interact to form a whole. We introduce a max-margin structure prediction architecture based on recursive neural networks that can successfully recover such structure both in complex scene images as well as sentences. The same algorithm can be used both to provide a competitive syntactic parser for natural language sentences from the Penn Treebank and to outperform alternative approaches for semantic scene segmentation, annotation and classification. For segmentation and annotation our algorithm obtains a new level of state-of-the-art performance on the Stanford background dataset (78.1%). The features from the image parse tree outperform Gist descriptors for scene classification by 4%."

Traditional techniques for estimating these models are based on N gram counts. Despite known weaknesses of N -grams and huge efforts of research communities across many fields (speech recognition, machine translation, neuroscience, artificial intelligence, natural language processing, data compression, psychology etc.), N -grams remained basically the state-of-the-art. The goal of this thesis is to present various architectures of language models that are based on artificial neural networks. Although these models are computationally more expensive than N -gram models, with the presented techniques it is possible to apply them to state-of-the-art systems efficiently. Achieved reductions of word error rate of speech recognition systems are up to 20%, against stateof-the-art N -gram model. The presented recurrent neural network based model achieves the best published performance on well-known Penn Treebank setup.

The procedure repeatedly adjusts the weights of the connections in the network so as to minimize a measure of the difference between the actual output vector of the net and the desired output vector. As a result of the weight adjustments, internal \u2018hidden\u2019 units which are not part of the input or output come to represent important features of the task domain, and the regularities in the task are captured by the interactions of these units. The ability to create useful new features distinguishes back-propagation from earlier, simpler methods such as the perceptron-convergence procedure1."

In this work, we show approaches that lead to more than 15 times speedup for both training and testing phases. Next, we show importance of using a backpropagation through time algorithm. An empirical comparison with feedforward networks is also provided. In the end, we discuss possibilities how to reduce the amount of parameters in the model. The resulting RNN model can thus be smaller, faster both during training and testing, and more accurate than the basic one."

As AMS iechniques are refined to handle smaller samples, it may also become possible to date individual amino acid enantiomers by the \u00b0C method. If one enantiomer is entirely derived from the other by racemization during diagenesis, the individual Dp. and L-enantiomers for a given amino acid should have identical \u201cC ages. Older, more poorly preserved fossils may not always prove amenable to the determination of amino acid indigeneity by the stable isotope method, as the prospects for complete replacement of indigenous amino acids with non-indigenous amino acids increases with time. As non-indigenous amino acids undergo racemization, the enantiomers may have identical isotopic compositions and still not be related to the original organisms. Such a circumstance may, however, become easier to recognize as more information becomes available concerning the distribution and stable isotopic composition of the amino acid constituents of modern representatives of fossil organisms. Also, AMS dates on individual amino acid enantiomers may, in some cases, help to clarify indigeneity problems, in particular when stratigraphic controls can be used to estimate a general age range for the fossil in question. Finally, the development of techniques for determining the stable isotopic compasition of amino acid enantiomers may enable us to establish whether non-racemic amino acids in some carbonaceous meteorites\u201d are indigenous, or result in part from terrestrial contamination.

Reviews can span so many different domains that it is difficult to gather annotated training data for all of them. Hence, this paper studies the problem of domain adaptation for sentiment classifiers, hereby a system is trained on labeled reviews from one source domain but is meant to be deployed on another. We propose a deep learning approach which learns to extract a meaningful representation for each review in an unsupervised fashion. Sentiment classifiers trained with this high-level feature representation clearly outperform state-of-the-art methods on a benchmark composed of reviews of 4 types of Amazon products. Furthermore, this method scales well and allowed us to successfully perform domain adaptation on a larger industrial-strength dataset of 22 domains."

In particular, we are considering the situation where the model probability density function is unnormalized. That is, the model is only specified up to the partition function. The partition function normalizes a model so that it integrates to one for any choice of the parameters. However, it is often impossible to obtain it in closed form. Gibbs distributions, Markov and multi-layer networks are examples of models where analytical normalization is often impossible. Maximum likelihood estimation can then not be used without resorting to numerical approximations which are often computationally expensive. We propose here a new objective function for the estimation of both normalized and unnormalized models. The basic idea is to perform nonlinear logistic regression to discriminate between the observed data and some artificially generated noise. With this approach, the normalizing partition function can be estimated like any other parameter. We prove that the new estimation method leads to a consistent (convergent) estimator of the parameters. For large noise sample sizes, the new estimator is furthermore shown to behave like the maximum likelihood estimator. In the estimation of unnormalized models, there is a trade-off between statistical and computational performance. We show that the new method strikes a competitive trade-off in comparison to other estimation methods for unnormalized models. As an application to real data, we estimate novel two-layer models of natural image statistics with spline nonlinearities."

While the study of the parity of the classical partition function p(N, n) (where N is the set of positive integers) is a deep and di cult problem, it is easy to construct a set A for which p(A, n) is even for n large enough : as explained in a paper of I.Z. Ruzsa, A. S\u00e1rk\u00f6zy and J.-L. Nicolas published in 1998 in the Journal of Number Theory , if B is a subset of {1, 2, . . . , N}, there is a unique set A = A0(B, N) such that A \u2229 {1, 2, . . . , N} = B and p(A, n) is even for n > N . In this paper we recall some properties of the sets A0(B, N), we describe the factorization into primes of the elements of the set A0({1, 2, 3}, 3), and prove that the number of elements of this set up to x is asymptotically equivalent to c x (log x)3/4 , where c = 0.937 . . ..

Ruzsa, A. S\u00e1rk\u00f6zy et J.-L. Nicolas montrent que si B est un sous-ensemble de {1, 2, . . . , N}, il existe un seul ensemble A = A0(B, N) tel que A \u2229 {1, 2, . . . , N} = B et p(A, n) est pair pour n > N .
