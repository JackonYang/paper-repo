These occur typically as parts of the background immediately to the left and right sides of nearby occluding objects, and are present in most natural scenes. Previous approaches to stereo either ignored these unmatchable points or attempted to weed them out in a second pass. An algorithm that incorporates them from the start as a strong clue to depth discontinuities is presented. The authors first derive a measure for goodness of fit and a prior based on a simplified model of objects in space, which leads to an energy functional depending both on the depth as measured from a central cyclopean eye and on the regions of points occluded from the left and right eye perspectives. They minimize this using dynamic programming along epipolar lines followed by annealing in both dimensions. Experiments indicate that this method is very effective even in difficult scenes.<<ETX>>"

Once solved, the minimum-cut associated to the maximum-flow yields a disparity surface for the whole image at once. This global approach to stereo analysis provides a more accurate and coherent depth map than the traditional line-by-line stereo. Moreover, the optimality of the depth surface is guaranteed and can be shown to be a generalization of the dynamic programming approach that is widely used in standard stereo. Results show improved depth estimation as well as better handling of depth discontinuities. While the worst case running time is O(n/sup 2/d/sup 2/log(nd)), the observed average running time is O(n/sup 1.2/ d/sup 1.3/) for an image size of n pixels and depth resolution d."

But such models have difficulty in resolving image regions containing occlusions, because a portion of the occluded surface is visible to only one of the two eyes ('half-occlusions')1. Here I present displays revealing an unexpected relationship between interocular differences in image position and occluding contours. The partial occlusion of contours can give rise to both horizontal and vertical image differences that are not disparities. The results show that the visual system interprets these image differences as signalling the presence of occluding contours. Even when a single line segment serves as a binocular target, subjective contours form that can appear both oriented and in depth. These local subjective contours have a strong tendency to interact cooperatively and form global contours not present in the monocular images. These and other findings2\u20134 show that stereoscopic processing actively decomposes vertical and horizontal image differences into disparities and half-occlusions. The two sources of information are complementary: while disparity provides relative depth information about surface features visible to both eyes, half-occlusions provide information to segment the visual world into coherent objects at object boundaries."

This is equivalent to the monocularly occluded part of the background in the real-life viewing of one object in front of another. The role of these monocular regions in the stereoscopic process has not been investigated previously, although it is generally assumed that they are a source of difficulty in stereoscopic resolution because of the unmatchable texture within them. The basis of the present study was a prediction that the presence of texture within these regions would facilitate rather than retard stereoscopic processing. This prediction follows from a hypothesis that stereoscopic processing is initially located at disparity discontinuities.

The selected window is optimal in the sense that it produces the disparity estimate having the least uncertainty after evaluating both the intensity and the disparity variations within a window. The algorithm employs a statistical model that represents uncertainty of disparity of points over the window; the uncertainty is assumed to increase with the distance of the point from the center point. The algorithm is completely local and does not include any global optimization. Also, the algorithm does not use any post-processing smoothing, but smooth surfaces are recovered as smooth while sharp disparity edges are retained. Experimental results have demonstrated a clear advantage of this algorithm over algorithms with a fixed-size window, for both synthetic and real images.<<ETX>>"

The stereo matching problem, that is, obtaining a correspondence between right and left images, can be cast as a search problem. When a pair of stereo images is rectified, pairs of corresponding points can be searched for within the same scanlines. We call this search intra-scanline search. This intra-scanline search can be treated as the problem of finding a matching path on a two-dimensional (2D) search plane whose axes are the right and left scanlines. Vertically connected edges in the images provide consistency constraints across the 2D search planes. Inter-scanline search in a three-dimensional (3D) search space, which is a stack of the 2D search planes, is needed to utilize this constraint. Our stereo matching algorithm uses edge-delimited intervals as elements to be matched, and employs the above mentioned two searches: one is inter-scanline search for possible correspondences of connected edges in right and left images and the other is intra-scanline search for correspondences of edge-delimited intervals on each scanline pair. Dynamic programming is used for both searches which proceed simultaneously: the former supplies the consistency constraint to the latter while the latter supplies the matching score to the former. An interval-based similarity metric is used to compute the score. The algorithm has been tested with different types of images including urban aerial images, synthesized images, and block scenes, and its computational requirement has been discussed."

The parameter estimation suggested is gradient descent, though other search strategies are also possible. Processing image data in blocks (windows) is central to the approach. After objects are modeled as patches of spheres, cylinders, planes and general quadrics-primitive objects, the estimation proceeds by searching in parameter space to simultaneously determine and use the appropriate pair of image regions, one from each image, and to use these for estimating a 3-D surface patch. The expression for the joint likelihood of the two images is derived and it is shown that the algorithm is a maximum-likelihood parameter estimator. A concept arising in the maximum likelihood estimation of 3-D surfaces is modeled and estimated. Cramer-Rao lower bounds are derived for the covariance matrices for the errors in estimating the a priori unknown object surface shape parameters. >"

In Foundations of Cyclopean Perception (first published in 1971 and unavailable for years), Bela Julesz traced the visual information flow in the brain, analyzing how the brain combines separate images received from the two eyes to produce depth perception. Julesz developed novel tools to do this: random-dot stereograms and cinematograms, generated by early digital computers at Bell Labs. These images, when viewed with the special glasses that came with the book, revealed complex, three-dimensional surfaces; this mode of visual stimulus became a paradigm for research in vision and perception. This reprint edition includes all 48 color random-dot designs from the original, as well as the special 3-D glasses required to view them.Foundations of Cyclopean Perception has had a profound impact on the vision studies community. It was chosen as one of the one hundred most influential works in cognitive science in a poll conducted by the University of Minnesota's Center for Cognitive Sciences. Many copies are \"permanently borrowed\" from college libraries; used copies are sought after online. Now, with this facsimile of the 1971 edition, the book is available again to cognitive scientists, neuroscientists, vision researchers, artists, and designers."

Like the first edition,this text can also be used for self-study by technical professionals since it discusses engineering issues in algorithm design as well as the mathematical aspects. \nIn its new edition,Introduction to Algorithms continues to provide a comprehensive introduction to the modern study of algorithms. The revision has been updated to reflect changes in the years since the book's original publication. New chapters on the role of algorithms in computing and on probabilistic analysis and randomized algorithms have been included. Sections throughout the book have been rewritten for increased clarity,and material has been added wherever a fuller explanation has seemed useful or new information warrants expanded coverage. \nAs in the classic first edition,this new edition of Introduction to Algorithms presents a rich variety of algorithms and covers them in considerable depth while making their design and analysis accessible to all levels of readers. Further,the algorithms are presented in pseudocode to make the book easily accessible to students from all programming language backgrounds. \nEach chapter presents an algorithm,a design technique,an application area,or a related topic. The chapters are not dependent on one another,so the instructor can organize his or her use of the book in the way that best suits the course's needs. Additionally,the new edition offers a 25% increase over the first edition in the number of problems,giving the book 155 problems and over 900 exercises thatreinforcethe concepts the students are learning."
