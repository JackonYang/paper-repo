To make this information available, we need to develop techniques for recovering textual information from in-line Web images. In this paper, we describe two methods for Web image OCR. Recognizing text extracted from in-line Web images is difficult because characters in these images are often rendered at a low spatial resolution. Such images are typically considered to be 'low quality' by traditional OCR technologies. Our proposed methods utilize the information contained in the color bits to compensate for the loss of information due to low sampling resolution. The first method uses a polynomial surface fitting technique for object recognition. The second method is based on the traditional n-tuple technique. We collected a small set of character samples from Web documents and tested the two algorithms. Preliminary experimental results show that our n-tuple method works quite well. However, the surface fitting method performs rather poorly due to the coarseness and small number of color shades used in the text."

Development of these clustering algorithms was based on examples from two-dimensional space because we wanted to copy the human perception of gestalts or point groupings. On the other hand, all the methods considered apply to higher dimensional spaces and even to general metric spaces. Advantages of these methods include determinacy, easy interpretation of the resulting clusters, conformity to gestalt principles of perceptual organization, and invariance of results under monotone transformations of interpoint distance. Brief discussion is made of the application of cluster detection to taxonomy and the selection of good feature spaces for pattern recognition. Detailed analyses of several planar cluster detection problems are illustrated by text and figures. The well-known Fisher iris data, in four-dimensional space, have been analyzed by these methods also. PL/1 programs to implement the minimal spanning tree methods have been fully debugged."

The design of each component is determined by a human expert and is optimized for a given class of inputs. Such a system can fail when confronted by an input that falls outside its anticipated domain. This paper investigates the use of a genetic-based adaptive mechanism in the analysis of complex test formatting. Specifically, we explore a genetic approach to the binarization problem. As opposed to a single, pre-defined, 'optimal' thresholding scheme, the genetic-based process applies various known methods and evaluates their effectiveness on the input image. Individual regions are treated independently, while the genetic algorithm attempts to optimize the overall result for the entire page. Advantages and disadvantages of this approach are discussed."

In fact, there are several apparently independent sources and algorithmic solutions of the problem.
