Many authors have therefore suggested solving vision problems using architectures of locally connected units updating their activity in parallel. Unfortunately, the convergence of traditional relaxation methods on such architectures has proven to be excruciatingly slow and in general they do not guarantee that the stable point will be a global minimum. \n \nIn this paper we show that an architecture in which Bayesian Beliefs about image properties are propagated between neighboring units yields convergence times which are several orders of magnitude faster than traditional methods and avoids local minima. In particular our architecture is non-iterative in the sense of Marr [5]: at every time step, the local estimates at a given location are optimal given the information which has already been propagated to that location. We illustrate the algorithm's performance on real images and compare it to several existing methods."

(1993) and an algorithm that has been well known in the artificial intelligence community for a decade, but which is relatively unknown to information theorists: Pearl's (1982) belief propagation algorithm. We see that if Pearl's algorithm is applied to the \"belief network\" of a parallel concatenation of two or more codes, the turbo decoding algorithm immediately results. Unfortunately, however, this belief diagram has loops, and Pearl only proved that his algorithm works when there are no loops, so an explanation of the experimental performance of turbo decoding is still lacking. However, we also show that Pearl's algorithm can be used to routinely derive previously known iterative, but suboptimal, decoding algorithms for a number of other error-control systems, including Gallager's (1962) low-density parity-check codes, serially concatenated codes, and product codes. Thus, belief propagation provides a very attractive general methodology for devising low-complexity iterative decoding algorithms for hybrid coded systems."

The author provides a coherent explication of probability as a language for reasoning with partial belief and offers a unifying perspective on other AI approaches to uncertainty, such as the Dempster-Shafer formalism, truth maintenance systems, and nonmonotonic logic. The author distinguishes syntactic and semantic approaches to uncertainty\u0097and offers techniques, based on belief networks, that provide a mechanism for making semantics-based systems operational. Specifically, network-propagation techniques serve as a mechanism for combining the theoretical coherence of probability theory with modern demands of reasoning-systems technology: modular declarative inputs, conceptually meaningful inferences, and parallel distributed computation. Application areas include diagnosis, forecasting, image interpretation, multi-sensor fusion, decision support systems, plan recognition, planning, speech recognition\u0097in short, almost every task requiring that conclusions be drawn from uncertain clues and incomplete information. \nProbabilistic Reasoning in Intelligent Systems will be of special interest to scholars and researchers in AI, decision theory, statistics, logic, philosophy, cognitive psychology, and the management sciences. Professionals in the areas of knowledge-based systems, operations research, engineering, and statistics will find theoretical and computational tools of immediate practical use. The book can also be used as an excellent text for graduate-level courses in AI, operations research, or applied probability."

Formalisms for manipulating these models have been developed relatively independently in these research communities. In this paper we explore hidden Markov models (HMMs) and related structures within the general framework of probabilistic independence networks (PINs). The paper presents a self-contained review of the basic principles of PINs. It is shown that the well-known forward-backward (F-B) and Viterbi algorithms for HMMs are special cases of more general inference algorithms for arbitrary PINs. Furthermore, the existence of inference and estimation algorithms for more general graphical models provides a set of analysis tools for HMM practitioners who wish to explore a richer class of HMM structures. Examples of relatively complex models to handle sensor fusion and coarticulation in speech recognition are introduced and treated within the graphical model framework to illustrate the advantages of the general approach."

                "text": "Pattern classification, data compression, and channel coding are tasks that usually must deal with complex but structured natural or artificial systems. Patterns that we wish to classify are a consequence of a causal physical process. Images that we wish to compress are also a consequence of a causal physical process. Noisy outputs from a telephone line are corrupted versions of a signal produced by a structured man-made telephone modem. Not only are these tasks characterized by complex structure, but they also contain random elements. Graphical models such as Bayesian networks provide a way to describe the relationships between random variables in a stochastic system. \nIn this thesis, I use Bayesian networks as an overarching framework to describe and solve problems in the areas of pattern classification, data compression, and channel coding. Results on the classification of handwritten digits show that Bayesian network pattern classifiers outperform other standard methods, such as the k-nearest neighbor method. When Bayesian networks are used as source models for data compression, an exponentially large number of codewords are associated with each input pattern. It turns out that the code can still be used efficiently, if a new technique called \"bits-back coding\" is used. Several new error-correcting decoding algorithms are instances of \"probability propagation\" in various Bayesian networks. These new schemes are rapidly closing the gap between the performances of practical channel coding systems and Shannon's 50-year-old channel coding limit. The Bayesian network framework exposes the similarities between these codes and leads the way to a new class of \"trellis-constraint codes\" which also operate close to Shannon's limit."

The algorithms work in a sliding window form, like the Viterbi algorithm, and can thus be used to decode continuously transmitted sequences obtained by parallel concatenated codes, without requiring code trellis termination. A heuristic explanation is also given of how to embed the maximum a posteriori algorithms into the iterative decoding of parallel concatenated codes (turbo codes). The performances of the two algorithms are compared on the basis of a powerful rate 1/3 parallel concatenated code. Basic circuits to implement the simplified a posteriori decoding algorithm using lookup tables, and two further approximations (linear and threshold), with a very small penalty, to eliminate the need for lookup tables are proposed."
