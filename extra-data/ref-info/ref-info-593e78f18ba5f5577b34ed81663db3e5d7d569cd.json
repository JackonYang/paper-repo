In this context, text appearing in images represents an important entity for indexing and retrieval purposes. Often, text is superimposed over complex image background and its recognition by a commercial optical character recognition (OCR) engine is difficult. Thus, there is the need for a text segmentation process, including background removal and binarization, in order to achieve a satisfactory recognition rate by OCR. In this paper, an unsupervised learning method for text segmentation in images with complex backgrounds is presented. First, the color of the text and background is determined based on a color quantizer. Then, the pixel color and the standard deviation of the wavelet transformed image are used to distinguish between text and non-text pixels. To classify pixels into text and background, a slightly modified k-means algorithm is applied which is used to produce a binarized text image. The segmentation result is fed into a commercial OCR software to investigate the segmentation quality. The performance of our approach is demonstrated by presenting experimental results for a set of video frames."

                "text": "There are many applications in which the automatic detection and recognition of text embedded in images is useful. These applications include digad libraries, multimedia systems, and Geographical Information Systems. When machine generated text is prdnted against clean backgrounds, it can be converted to a computer readable form (ASCII) using current Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology. However, text is often printed against shaded or textured backgrounds or is embedded in images. Examples include maps, advertisements, photographs, videos and stock certificates. Current document segmentation and recognition technologies cannot handle these situafons well. In this paper, a four-step system which automaticnlly detects and extracts text in images i& proposed. First, a texture segmentation scheme is used to focus attention on regions where text may occur. Second, strokes are extracted from the segmented text regions. Using reasonable heuristics on text strings such as height similarity, spacing and alignment, the extracted strokes are then processed to form rectangular boxes surrounding the corresponding ttzt strings. To detect text over a wide range of font sizes, the above steps are first applied to a pyramid of images generated from the input image, and then the boxes formed at each resolution level of the pyramid are fused at the image in the original resolution level. Third, text is extracted by cleaning up the background and binarizing the detected ted strings. Finally, better text bounding boxes are generated by srsiny the binarized text as strokes. Text is then cleaned and binarized from these new boxes, and can then be passed through a commercial OCR engine for recognition if the text is of an OCR-recognizable font. The system is stable, robust, and works well on imayes (with or without structured layouts) from a wide van\u2019ety of sources, including digitized video frames, photographs, *This material is based on work supported in part by the National Science Foundation, Library of Congress and Department of Commerce under cooperative agreement number EEC9209623, in part by the United States Patent and mademark Office and Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency/IT0 under ARPA order number D468, issued by ESC/AXS contract number F19628-96-C-0235, in part by the National Science Foundation under grant number IF&9619117 and in part by NSF Multimedia CDA-9502639.

However, since text is often printed against a shaded or textured background it is often difficult to recognize. In this paper, an approach, which can automatically detect, localize and extract horizontally aligned text with different sizes, fonts and languages in images, is presented. The basic idea of our approach is to apply an appropriate local thresholding technique to sequences of line histogram differences in order to increase the robustness of text detection with respect to complex backgrounds. The performance of our approach is demonstrated by presenting experimental results for a set of images taken from video sequences."

If these text occurrences could be detected, segmented, and recognized automatically, they would be a valuable source of high-level semantics for indexing and retrieval. We propose a novel method for localizing and segmenting text in complex images and videos. Text lines are identified by using a complex-valued multilayer feed-forward network trained to detect text at a fixed scale and position. The network's output at all scales and positions is integrated into a single text-saliency map, serving as a starting point for candidate text lines. In the case of video, these candidate text lines are refined by exploiting the temporal redundancy of text in video. Localized text lines are then scaled to a fixed height of 100 pixels and segmented into a binary image with black characters on white background. For videos, temporal redundancy is exploited to improve segmentation performance. Input images and videos can be of any size due to a true multiresolution approach. Moreover, the system is not only able to locate and segment text occurrences into large binary images, but is also able to track each text line with sub-pixel accuracy over the entire occurrence in a video, so that one text bitmap is created for all instances of that text line. Therefore, our text segmentation results can also be used for object-based video encoding such as that enabled by MPEG-4."

The protocol includes a positive set and a negative set of indices at textbox level, which evaluate the detection quality in terms of both location accuracy and fragmentation of the detected textboxes. In the protocol, we assign a detection difficulty (DD) level to each ground truth textbox. The performance indices can then be normalized with respect to the textbox DD level and are therefore independent of the ground truth difficulty. We also assign a detection importance (DI) level to each ground truth textbox. The overall detection rate is the DI-weighted average of the detection qualities of all ground truth textboxes, which makes the detection rate more accurate to reveal the real performance. The automatic performance evaluation scheme has been applied on a text detection approach to determine the best parameters that can yield the best detection results."

Our scheme consists of two separate processes: monitoring which detects the new text line entering a frame, and tracking which uses prediction techniques to reconcile the text from frame to frame. Temporal consistency allows one to monitor periodically and reduce the computation complexity. The tracking process uses a rapid prediction/search scheme to update the position of the text blocks between frames. We provide details of the implementation and results for text moving in the scene and text which moves as a result of camera motion."
