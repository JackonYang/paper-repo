This paper describes a general solution for detecting tables based on computing an optimal partitioning of a document into some number of tables. A dynamic programming algorithm is given to solve the resulting optimization problem. This high-level framework is independent of any particular table quality measure and independent of the document medium. Moreover, it does not rely on the presence of ruling lines or other table delimiters. We also present table quality measures based on white space correlation and vertical connected component analysis. These measures can be applied equally well to ASCII text and scanned images. We report on some preliminary experiments using this method to detect tables in both ASCII text and scanned images, yielding promising results. We present detailed evaluation of these results using three different criteria which by themselves pose interesting research questions."

The discussed recognition process differs significantly from existing approaches as it realizes a bottom-up clustering of given word segments, whereas conventional table structure recognizers all rely on the detection of some separators such as delineation or significant white space to analyze a page from the top-down. The following analysis of the recognized layout elements is based on the construction of a tile structure and detects row- and/or column spanning cells as well as sparse tables with a high degree of confidence. \n \nThe overall system is completely domain independent, optionally neglects textual contents and can thus be applied to arbitrary mixed-mode documents (with or without tables) of any language and even operates on low quality OCR documents (e.g. facsimiles)."

In these tables, textual data are presented in record lines made up of fixed-width fields. Tables often do not rely on line-art (ruled lines) to delimit fields, and in this way differ crucially from fixed forms. Our system performs these steps: copes with multiple tables per page; identifies records within tables; segments records into fields; and recognizes characters within fields, constrained by field-specific contextual knowledge. Obstacles to good performance on tables include small print, tight line-spacing, poor-quality text (such as photocopies), and line-art or background patterns that touch the text. Precise skew-correction and pitch-estimation, and high-performance OCR using neural nets proved crucial in overcoming these obstacles. The most significant technical advances in this work appear to be algorithms for identifying and segmenting records with known layout, and integration of these algorithms with a graphical user interface (GUI) for defining new layouts. This GUI has been ergonomically designed to make efficient and intuitive use of exemplary images, so that the skill and manual effort required to retarget the system to new table layouts are held to a minimum. The system has been applied in this way to more than 400 distinct tabular layouts. During the last three years the system has read over fifty million records with high accuracy."

Table recognition starts with the detection of the table header. Afterwards, this header is compared with table headers of known reference tables.

The algorithm has two parts: first a row labeling algorithm groups similar rows into clusters then, a column labeling algorithm identifies the column structure within each cluster. Each column structure is identified by a set of column separation intervals that are computed from the intervals representing the extent of the white spacing between consecutive word fragments. We formally describe a method for finding column separation intervals based on word fragment separation intervals. This method is based on constructing a closure of a set of line intervals under the operation of line intersection. The closure is maintained dynamically in a data structure which facilitates easy access to the elements within the closure. This technique is computationally less expensive than projection and search at the pixel level since word fragment acquisition is already required for document recognition applications."
