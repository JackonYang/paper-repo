We introduce a greedy algorithm, called a matching pursuit, which computes a suboptimal expansion. The dictionary waveforms that best match a signal's structures are chosen iteratively. An orthogonalized version of the matching pursuit is also developed. Matching pursuits are general procedures for computing adaptive signal representations. With a dictionary of Gabor functions, a matching pursuit defines an adaptive time-frequency transform.

Finally, the obtained filters are used to measure the effect of regularity versus frequency selectivity in a still image compression scheme with optimized rate-distortion. In this case, regularity is shown to be more relevant than frequency selectivity, especially for short filters. >"

A nonrecursive algorithm using only Finite Impulse Response filters (FIR) with complexity O (N2) is presented. The complexity is reduced to O (N log2N) by using Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT). A faster algorithm is obtained by using recursive filters in the decomposition or reconstruction of the signal. The recursive algorithm has complexity O (N), and the same accuracy as the others. By allowing nonsymmetric wavelets, an exact orthogonal reconstruction algorithm is shown, which also has complexity O (N)."

Allowing for departures from stationary proves useful for modelling, e.g., transient phenomena, quasi-oscillating behaviour or spectrum modulation. In our work wavelets are used to provide an adaptive local smoothing of a short-time periodogram in the time-freqeuncy plane. For this, in contrast to classical nonparametric (linear) approaches we use nonlinear thresholding of the empirical wavelet coefficients of the evolutionary spectrum. We show how these techniques allow for both adaptively reconstructing the local structure in the time-frequency plane and for denoising the resulting estimates. To this end a threshold choice is derived which is motivated by minimax properties w.r.t. the integrated mean squared error. Our approach is based on a 2-d orthogonal wavelet transform modified by using a cardinal Lagrange interpolation function on the finest scale. As an example, we apply our procedure to a time-varying spectrum motivated from mobile radio propagation."

The goal of this work is to develop guidelines for implementing discrete and continuous wavelet transforms efficiently, and to compare the various algorithms obtained and give an idea of possible gains by providing operation counts. Most wavelet transform algorithms compute sampled coefficients of the continuous wavelet transform using the filter bank structure of the discrete wavelet transform. Although this general method is already efficient, it is shown that noticeable computational savings can be obtained by applying known fast convolution techniques, such as the FFT (fast Fourier transform), in a suitable manner. The modified algorithms are termed 'fast' because of their ability to reduce the computational complexity per computed coefficient from L to log L (within a small constant factor) for large filter lengths L. For short filters, smaller gains are obtained: 'fast running FIR (finite impulse response) filtering' techniques allow one to achieve typically 30% savings in computations. >"

These signals, which are referred to as 'dy-homogeneous' signals because they generalize the well-known homogeneous functions, have highly convenient representations in terms of orthonormal wavelet bases. In particular, wavelet representations can be exploited to construct orthonormal self-similar bases for these signals. The spectral and fractal characteristics of dy-homogeneous signals make them appealing candidates for use in a number of applications. As one potential example, their use in a communications-based context is considered. Specifically, a strategy for embedding information into a dy-homogeneous waveform on multiple time-scales is developed. This multirate modulation strategy, called fractal modulation, is potentially well-suited for use with noisy channels of simultaneously unknown duration and bandwidth. >"

The approach combines the mathematical rigor of the multiresolution wavelet analysis with well-known spatiotemporal frequency flow computation principles. The foundation of the approach consists of a unique, nonhomogeneous multiresolution wavelet filter bank designed to extract moving objects in a 3-D image sequence based on their location, size, and speed. The filter bank is generated by an unconventional 3-D subband coding scheme that generates 20 orientation-tuned filters at each spatial and temporal resolution. The frequency responses of the wavelet filter bank are combined using a least-squares method to assign a velocity vector to each spatial location in an image sequence. Several examples are provided to demonstrate the flow computation abilities of the wavelet vector motion sensor."

In fact, the a trous algorithm is more properly viewed as a nonorthonormal multiresolution algorithm for which the discrete wavelet transform is exact. Moreover, it is shown that the commonly used Lagrange a trous filters are in one-to-one correspondence with the convolutional squares of the Daubechies filters for orthonormal wavelets of compact support. A systematic framework for the discrete wavelet transform is provided, and conditions are derived under which it computes the continuous wavelet transform exactly. Suitable filter constraints for finite energy and boundedness of the discrete transform are also derived. Relevant signal processing parameters are examined, and it is observed that orthonormality is balanced by restrictions on resolution. >"

The properties of the operator which approximates a signal at a given resolution were studied. It is shown that the difference of information between the approximation of a signal at the resolutions 2/sup j+1/ and 2/sup j/ (where j is an integer) can be extracted by decomposing this signal on a wavelet orthonormal basis of L/sup 2/(R/sup n/), the vector space of measurable, square-integrable n-dimensional functions. In L/sup 2/(R), a wavelet orthonormal basis is a family of functions which is built by dilating and translating a unique function psi (x). This decomposition defines an orthogonal multiresolution representation called a wavelet representation. It is computed with a pyramidal algorithm based on convolutions with quadrature mirror filters. Wavelet representation lies between the spatial and Fourier domains. For images, the wavelet representation differentiates several spatial orientations. The application of this representation to data compression in image coding, texture discrimination and fractal analysis is discussed. >"

First, a wavelet transform used in order to obtain a set of biorthogonal subclasses of images: the original image is decomposed at different scales using a pyramidal algorithm architecture. The decomposition is along the vertical and horizontal directions and maintains constant the number of pixels required to describe the image. Second, according to Shannon's rate distortion theory, the wavelet coefficients are vector quantized using a multiresolution codebook. To encode the wavelet coefficients, a noise shaping bit allocation procedure which assumes that details at high resolution are less visible to the human eye is proposed. In order to allow the receiver to recognize a picture as quickly as possible at minimum cost, a progressive transmission scheme is presented. It is shown that the wavelet transform is particularly well adapted to progressive transmission."

                "text": "The discrete wavelet transform (DWT) decomposes an image into bands that vary in spatial frequency and orientation. It is widely used for image compression. Measures of the visibility of DWT quantization errors are required to achieve optimal compression. Uniform quantization of a single band of coefficients results in an artifact that is the sum of a lattice of random amplitude basis functions of the corresponding DWT synthesis filter, which we call DWT uniform quantization noise. We measured visual detection thresholds for samples of DWT uniform quantization noise in Y, Cb, and Cr color channels. The spatial frequency of a wavelet is r 2-L, where r is display visual resolution in pixels/degree, and L is the wavelet level. Amplitude thresholds increase rapidly with spatial frequency. Thresholds also increase from Y to Cr to Cb, and with orientation from low-pass to horizontal/vertical to diagonal. We propose a mathematical model for DWT noise detection thresholds that is a function of level, orientation, and display visual resolution. This allows calculation of a 'perceptually lossless' quantization matrix for which all errors are in theory below the visual threshold. The model may also be used as the basis for adaptive quantization schemes."

Pursuit algorithms choose the decomposition vectors depending upon the signal properties. The dictionary among which these vectors are selected is much larger than a basis. Matching Pursuit is fast to compute, but can provide coarse representations. Basis Pursuit gives a better representation but is very expensive in terms of calculation time. This paper develops a High Resolution Matching Pursuit : it is a fast, high time-resolution, time-frequency anal;ysis algorithm, that makes it likely to be used for musical applications."

It permits efficient compression of a variety of signals, such as sound and images. The predefined libraries of modulated waveforms include orthogonal wavelet-packets and localized trigonometric functions, and have reasonably well-controlled time-frequency localization properties. The idea is to build out of the library functions an orthonormal basis relative to which the given signal or collection of signals has the lowest information cost. The method relies heavily on the remarkable orthogonality properties of the new libraries: all expansions in a given library conserve energy and are thus comparable. Several cost functionals are useful; one of the most attractive is Shannon entropy, which has a geometric interpretation in this context. >"

Theorems that estimate local Lipschitz exponents of functions from the evolution across scales of their wavelet transform are reviewed. It is then proven that the local maxima of the wavelet transform modulus detect the locations of irregular structures and provide numerical procedures to compute their Lipschitz exponents. The wavelet transform of singularities with fast oscillations has a particular behavior that is studied separately. The local frequency of such oscillations is measured from the wavelet transform modulus maxima. It has been shown numerically that one- and two-dimensional signals can be reconstructed, with a good approximation, from the local maxima of their wavelet transform modulus. As an application, an algorithm is developed that removes white noises from signals by analyzing the evolution of the wavelet transform maxima across scales. In two dimensions, the wavelet transform maxima indicate the location of edges in images. >"

Unlike wavelet-based orthonormal representations, the representation has symmetric analyzing functions, shift invariance, natural and simple iterative interpolation schemes, and a simple algorithm for finding the locations of the multiscale edges as zero crossings. A noniterative method is developed for reconstructing signals from their zero crossings (and slopes at these zero crossings) in the representation.

The analysis uses an overcomplete wavelet decomposition, which yields a description that is translation invariant. It is shown that this representation constitutes a tight frame of l(2) and that it has a fast iterative algorithm. A texture is characterized by a set of channel variances estimated at the output of the corresponding filter bank. Classification experiments with l(2) Brodatz textures indicate that the discrete wavelet frame (DWF) approach is superior to a standard (critically sampled) wavelet transform feature extraction. These results also suggest that this approach should perform better than most traditional single resolution techniques (co-occurrences, local linear transform, and the like). A detailed comparison of the classification performance of various orthogonal and biorthogonal wavelet transforms is also provided. Finally, the DWF feature extraction technique is incorporated into a simple multicomponent texture segmentation algorithm, and some illustrative examples are presented."

Statistical self-similarity is an essential feature of FBM and makes natural the use of wavelets for both its analysis and its synthesis. A detailed second-order analysis is carried out for wavelet coefficients of FBM. It reveals a stationary structure at each scale and a power-law behavior of the coefficients' variance from which the fractal dimension of FBM can be estimated. Conditions for using orthonormal wavelet decompositions as approximate whitening filters are discussed, consequences of discretization are considered, and some connections between the wavelet point of view and previous approaches based on length measurements (analysis) or dyadic interpolation (synthesis) are briefly pointed out. >"

Decomposition into overcomplete systems is not unique, and several methods for decomposition have been proposed, including the method of frames (MOF), Matching pursuit (MP), and, for special dictionaries, the best orthogonal basis (BOB). \nBasis Pursuit (BP) is a principle for decomposing a signal into an \"optimal\" superposition of dictionary elements, where optimal means having the smallest l1 norm of coefficients among all such decompositions. We give examples exhibiting several advantages over MOF, MP, and BOB, including better sparsity and superresolution. BP has interesting relations to ideas in areas as diverse as ill-posed problems, in abstract harmonic analysis, total variation denoising, and multiscale edge denoising. \nBP in highly overcomplete dictionaries leads to large-scale optimization problems. With signals of length 8192 and a wavelet packet dictionary, one gets an equivalent linear program of size 8192 by 212,992. Such problems can be attacked successfully only because of recent advances in linear programming by interior-point methods. We obtain reasonable success with a primal-dual logarithmic barrier method and conjugate-gradient solver."

A general signal description, called an inherently bounded adaptive quasi linear representation (AQLR), motivated by two important examples, namely, the wavelet maxima representation, and the wavelet zero-crossings representation, is introduced. This paper mainly addresses the questions of uniqueness and stability. It is shown, that the dyadic wavelet maxima (zero-crossings) representation is, in general, nonunique. Nevertheless, using the idea of the inherently bounded AQLR, two stability results are proven. For a general perturbation, a global BIBO stability is shown. For a special case, where perturbations are limited to the continuous part of the representation, a Lipschitz condition is satisfied. >"

Their power lies in the fact that they only require a small number of coefficients to represent general functions and large data sets accurately. This allows compression and efficient computations. Classical constructions have been limited to simple domains such as intervals and rectangles. In this paper we present a wavelet construction for scalar functions defined on the sphere. We show how biorthogonal wavelets with custom properties can be constructed with the lifting scheme. The bases are extremely easy to implement and allow fully adaptive subdivisions. We give examples of functions defined on the sphere, such as topographic data, bidirectional reflection distribution functions, and illumination, and show how they can be efficiently represented with spherical wavelets.

Measuring emergent signal frequencies requires spectral measurements accurate in both frequency and time or space, conflicting requirements that are shown to be balanced by a generalized uncertainty relationship. Such spectral measurements can be obtained from the responses of multiple wavelet-like channel filters that sample the signal spectrum, and that yield a locus of possible solutions for each locally emergent frequency. It is shown analytically that this locus of solutions is maximally localized in both space and frequency if the channel filters used are Gabor wavelets. A constrained solution is obtained by imposing a stabilizing term that develops naturally from the assumptions on the signal. The measurement of frequencies is then cast as an ill-posed extremum problem regularized by the stabilizing term, leading to an iterative constraint propagation algorithm. The technique is demonstrated by application to a variety of 2-D textured images. >"

This theory precisely relates (a) the rate of decay in the error between the original image and the compressed image as the size of the compressed image representation increases (i.e., as the amount of compression decreases) to (b) the smoothness of the image in certain smoothness classes called Besov spaces. Within this theory, the error incurred by the quantization of wavelet transform coefficients is explained. Several compression algorithms based on piecewise constant approximations are analyzed in some detail. It is shown that, if pictures can be characterized by their membership in the smoothness classes considered, then wavelet-based methods are near-optimal within a larger class of stable transform-based, nonlinear methods of image compression. Based on previous experimental research it is argued that in most instances the error incurred in image compression should be measured in the integral sense instead of the mean-square sense. >"

This distribution is called exponential distribution (ED) after its exponential kernel function. First, the authors interpret the ED from the spectral-density-estimation point of view. They then show how the exponential kernel controls the cross terms as represented in the generalized ambiguity function domain, and they analyze the ED for two specific types of multicomponent signals: sinusoidal signals and chirp signals. Next, they define the ED for discrete-time signals and the running windowed exponential distribution (RWED), which is computationally efficient. Finally, the authors present numerical examples of the RWED using the synthetically generated signals. It is found that the ED is very effective in diminishing the effects of cross terms while retaining most of the properties which are useful for a time-frequency distribution. >"

Using orthonormal bases of compactly supported wavelets, we develop a nonlinear method which works in the wavelet domain by simple nonlinear shrinkage of the empirical wavelet coefficients. The shrinkage can be tuned to be nearly minimax over any member of a wide range of Triebel- and Besov-type smoothness constraints and asymptotically minimax over Besov bodies with p < q. Linear estimates cannot achieve even the minimax rates over Triebel and Besov classes with p < 2, so the method can significantly outperform every linear method (e.g., kernel, smoothing spline, sieve) in a minimax sense. Variants of our method based on simple threshold nonlinear estimators are nearly minimax. Our method possesses the interpretation of spatial adaptivity; it reconstructs using a kernel which may vary in shape and bandwidth from point to point, depending on the data. Least favorable distributions for certain of the Triebel and Besov scales generate objects with sparse wavelet transforms. Many real objects have similarly sparse transforms, which suggests that these minimax results are relevant for practical problems. Sequels to this paper, which was first drafted in November 1990, discuss practical implementation, spatial adaptation properties, universal near minimaxity and applications to inverse problems."

We describe the joint distribution between pairs of coefficients at adjacent spatial locations, orientations, and scales. Although the raw coefficients are nearly, uncorrelated, their magnitudes are highly correlated. A linear magnitude predictor coupled with both multiplicative and additive uncertainties, provides a reasonable description of the conditional probability densities. We use this model to construct an image coder called EPWIC (embedded predictive wavelet image coder), in which subband coefficients are encoded one bit-plane at a time using a non-adaptive arithmetic encoder. Bit-planes are ordered using a greedy algorithm that considers the MSE reduction per encoded bit. We demonstrate the quality of the statistical characterization by comparing rate-distortion curves of the coder to several standard coders."

                "text": "Why does fractal image compression work? What is the implicit image model underlying fractal block coding? How can we characterize the types of images for which fractal block coders will work well? These are the central issues we address. We introduce a new wavelet-based framework for analyzing block-based fractal compression schemes. Within this framework we are able to draw upon insights from the well-established transform coder paradigm in order to address the issue of why fractal block coders work. We show that fractal block coders of the form introduced by Jacquin (1992) are Haar wavelet subtree quantization schemes. We examine a generalization of the schemes to smooth wavelets with additional vanishing moments. The performance of our generalized coder is comparable to the best results in the literature for a Jacquin-style coding scheme. Our wavelet framework gives new insight into the convergence properties of fractal block coders, and it leads us to develop an unconditionally convergent scheme with a fast decoding algorithm. Our experiments with this new algorithm indicate that fractal coders derive much of their effectiveness from their ability to efficiently represent wavelet zero trees. Finally, our framework reveals some of the fundamental limitations of current fractal compression schemes."

We show how any discrete wavelet transform or two band subband filtering with finite filters can be decomposed into a finite sequence of simple filtering steps, which we call lifting steps but that are also known as ladder structures. This decomposition corresponds to a factorization of the polyphase matrix of the wavelet or subband filters into elementary matrices. That such a factorization is possible is well-known to algebraists (and expressed by the formulaSL(n;R[z, z\u22121])=E(n;R[z, z\u22121])); it is also used in linear systems theory in the electrical engineering community. We present here a self-contained derivation, building the decomposition from basic principles such as the Euclidean algorithm, with a focus on applying it to wavelet filtering. This factorization provides an alternative for the lattice factorization, with the advantage that it can also be used in the biorthogonal, i.e., non-unitary case. Like the lattice factorization, the decomposition presented here asymptotically reduces the computational complexity of the transform by a factor two. It has other applications, such as the possibility of defining a wavelet-like transform that maps integers to integers."

The story goes back of course to Shannon's R(D) theory in the case of Gaussian stationary processes, which says that transforming into a Fourier basis followed by block coding gives an optimal lossy compression technique; practical developments like transform-based image compression have been inspired by this result. In this paper we also discuss connections perhaps less familiar to the information theory community, growing out of the field of harmonic analysis. Recent harmonic analysis constructions, such as wavelet transforms and Gabor transforms, are essentially optimal transforms for transform coding in certain settings. Some of these transforms are under consideration for future compression standards. We discuss some of the lessons of harmonic analysis in this century. Typically, the problems and achievements of this field have involved goals that were not obviously related to practical data compression, and have used a language not immediately accessible to outsiders. Nevertheless, through an extensive generalization of what Shannon called the \"sampling theorem\", harmonic analysis has succeeded in developing new forms of functional representation which turn out to have significant data compression interpretations. We explain why harmonic analysis has interacted with data compression, and we describe some interesting recent ideas in the field that may affect data compression in the future."

                "text": "Scaling functions and orthogonal wavelets are created from the coefficients of a lowpass and highpass filter (in a two-band orthogonal filter bank). For \"multifilters\" those coefficients are matrices. This gives a new block structure for the filter bank, and leads to multiple scaling functions and wavelets. Geronimo, Hardin, and Massopust (see J. Approx. Theory, vol.78, p.373-401, 1994) constructed two scaling functions that have extra properties not previously achieved. The functions /spl Phi//sub 1/ and /spl Phi//sub 2/ are symmetric (linear phase) and they have short support (two intervals or less), while their translates form an orthogonal family. For any single function /spl Phi/, apart from Haar's piecewise constants, those extra properties are known to be impossible. The novelty is to introduce 2/spl times/2 matrix coefficients while retaining orthogonality of the multiwavelets. This note derives the properties of /spl Phi//sub 1/ and /spl Phi//sub 2/ from the matrix dilation equation that they satisfy. Then our main step is to construct associated wavelets: two wavelets for two scaling functions. The properties were derived by Geronimo, Hardin, and Massopust from the iterated interpolation that led to /spl Phi/1 and /spl Phi//sub 2/. One pair of wavelets was found earlier by direct solution of the orthogonality conditions (using Mathematica). Our construction is in parallel with recent progress by Hardin and Geronimo, to develop the underlying algebra from the matrix coefficients in the dilation equation-in another language, to build the 4/spl times/4 paraunitary polyphase matrix in the filter bank. The short support opens new possibilities for applications of filters and wavelets near boundaries. >"

More recently, multiresolution signal decomposition methods are being examined from the standpoint of the discrete wavelet transform for continuous-time signals [6]-[8]. In this paper, we describe a class of orthogonal binomial filters that provide basis functions for a perfect reconstruction bank of finite impulse response QMF\u2019s. The orthonormal wavelet filters derived by Daubechies 171 from a discrete wavelet transform approach are shown to be the same as the solutions inherent in the binomial-based filters. The energy compaction performance of the binomial QMF decomposition is computed and shown to be better than the DCT for the Markov source models, as well as real-world images considered. The proposed binomial structure is efficient, simple to implement on VLSI, and suitable for multiresolution signal decomposition and coding applications."

We see that the structure of Multiresolution Analysis adapts very well to the study of scaling functions. The equation is reduced to an equation in a subspace of \u21122(R) of much lower resolution. This simpler equation is then \u201cwavelet transformed\u201d to obtain a discrete dilation equation. In particular we study the case of compactly supported solutions and we see that conditions for the existence of solutions are given by convergence of infinite products of matrices. These matrices are of the type obtained by Daubechies, and, when the analyzing wavelet is the Haar wavelet, they are exactly the same."

The method uses optimal adaptive wavelet selection and wavelet coefficients quantization procedures together with a dynamic dictionary approach. The adaptive wavelet transform selection and transform coefficient bit allocation procedures are designed to take advantage of the masking effect in human hearing. They minimize the number of bits required to represent each frame of audio material at a fixed distortion level. The dynamic dictionary greatly reduces statistical redundancies in the audio source. Experiments indicate that the proposed adaptive wavelet selection procedure by itself can achieve almost transparent coding of monophonic compact disk (CD) quality signals (sampled at 44.1 kHz) at bit rates of 64-70 kilobits per second (kb/s). The combined adaptive wavelet selection and dynamic dictionary coding procedures achieve almost transparent coding of monophonic CD quality signals at bit rates of 48-66 kb/s. >"

We do this in a setting that closely resembles the numerical analysis setting of Mallat and Zhong and that seems to capture something of the essence of their (practical) reconstruction method. Our work builds on a uniqueness result for reconstructing an L2 signal from irregular sampling of its wavelet transform of Gr\u00f6chenig and the related work of Benedetto, Heller, Mallat, and Zhong. We show that the rate of convergence for this reconstruction algorithm is geometric and computable in advance.

In this paper we present a new method based on a \"local\" eigenexpansion to estimate the spectrum in terms of the solution of an integral equation. Computationally this method is equivalent to using the weishted average of a series of direct-spectrum estimates based on orthogonal data windows (discrete prolate spheroidal sequences) to treat both the bias and smoothing problems. Some of the attractive features of this estimate are: there are no arbitrary windows; it is a small sample theory; it is consistent; it provides an analysis-of-variance test for line components; and it has high resolution. We also show relations of this estimate to maximum-likelihood estimates, show that the estimation capacity of the estimate is high, and show applications to coherence and polyspectrum estimates."

In each case, the use of wavelets offers tangible benefits over the traditional Fourier-transform-based imaging. These stem from the simultaneous time and frequency localization properties of the wavelets. The first application utilizes the localization properties of wavelets to acquire single T/sub 2/ weighted images in times which are short relative to current methods. An interesting combinatorial scheduling problem arises from the multiscale structure inherent in the formulation of this procedure. Its solution is sketched and applied to the imaging process. The second example is a technique for potentially 'instant' imaging. Image acquisition is modeled as an inverse wavelet transform of the spin density in the region in question. Signal acquisition takes place in as few as one or two echoes after the excitation by RF pulses designed to excite a moving band of spins in a slice. These sweeping RF pulses excite strips of spins which rephase at different times during acquisition. They replace phase-encoding gradients; no fast pulsed gradients are required. >"

Methods in which techniques are used in applications are illustrated, and many problems are included. The book also introduces several significant recent topics, including pseudo-differential operators, wave front sets, wavelets, and quasicrystals. Background mathematical prerequisites have been kept to a minimum, with only a knowledge of multidimensional calculus and basic complex variables needed to fully understand the concepts in the book. in applied analysis and mathematical physics."

The recently introduced wavelet transforms provide a time-and-scale decomposition of signals that offers the possibility of such analysis. A corresponding statistical framework to support the development of optimal, multiscale statistical signal processing algorithms is described. The theory of multiscale signal representation leads naturally to models of signals on trees, and this provides the framework for investigation. In particular, the class of isotropic processes on homogeneous trees is described, and a theory of autoregressive models is developed in this context. This leads to generalizations of Schur and Levinson recursions, associated properties of the resulting reflection coefficients, and the initial pieces in a system theory for multiscale modeling. >"

The mathematical concept of frames is utilized in the analysis of the properties of the sequence of sampling functions. The frame operator of this sequence is expressed as a matrix-valued function multiplying a vector-valued function. An important property of this matrix is that the maximum and minimum eigenvalues are equal (in some sense) to the upper and lower frame bounds. We present a method for finding the dual frame and, thereby, a method for reconstructing the signal from its samples. Using the matrix approach we prove that the sequence of sampling functions is always complete in the cases of critical sampling and oversampling. A sufficient condition for the sequence of sampling functions to constitute a frame is derived. We show that if no sampling of the signal itself is involved, the sampling is not stable and cannot be stabilized by oversampling. Examples are considered, and the frame bounds in the case of sampling of the signal and its first derivative are calculated explicitly. Finally, the matrix approach can be similarly applied to other problems of signal representation."

A variety of threshold choices is proposed, including one based on an unbiased estimate of mean\u2010squared error. The practical performance of the method is demonstrated on examples, including data from a neurophysiological context. The theoretical properties of the estimators are investigated by comparing them with an ideal but unattainable `bench\u2010mark', that can be considered in the wavelet context as the risk obtained by ideal spatial adaptivity, and more generally is obtained by the use of an `oracle' that provides information that is not actually available in the data. It is shown that the level\u2010dependent threshold estimator performs well relative to the bench\u2010mark risk, and that its minimax behaviour cannot be improved on in order of magnitude by any other estimator. The wavelet domain structure of both short\u2010 and long\u2010range dependent noise is considered, and in both cases it is shown that the estimators have near optimal behaviour simultaneously in a wide range of function classes, adapting automatically to the regularity properties of the underlying model. The proofs of the main results are obtained by considering a more general multivariate normal decision theoretic problem."

In order to design digital models mirroring as closely as possible a real sound and permitting in addition intimate transformations by altering the synthesis parameters, we look for a signal model based on additive synthesis whose parameters are estimated by the analysis of real sounds. This model is relevant from both the physical and perceptual points of view, especially when the sound to be analyzed comes from a musical instrument. We present some techniques, mostly unpublished, based on time-frequency representations which make possible the estimation of relevant parameters such as frequency and amplitude modulation laws corresponding to each spectral component of the sound. The techniques described extend the results presented by Delprat et al. (see IEEE Trans. Inform. Theory, vol.38, p.644-65, March 1992). These methods are then transposed to broadband signals, allowing the characterization of transients."

The authors concentrate on the subband/transform coding scheme using filter banks known as time domain aliasing cancellation (TDAC). This scheme first involves a window on a set of N data, overlapping by N/2 with the previous one, followed by a TDAC transform. First, it is shown that the transform turns out to be a doubly odd DCT, for which a fast algorithm is provided. Then, it is shown how the windowing and the overlap can be merged with the first step of the first algorithm. The total number of operations (multiplications plus additions) required by this algorithm for computing a length-N TDAC plus windowing is exactly N log/sub 2/ N. Implementation considerations are provided.<<ETX>>"

What are wavelets, and why might they be useful to you? The fundamental idea behind wavelets is to analyze according to scale. Indeed, some researchers feel that using wavelets means adopting a whole new mind-set or perspective in processing data. Wavelets are functions that satisfy certain mathematical requirements and are used in representing data or other functions. Most of the basic wavelet theory has now been done. The mathematics have been worked out in excruciating detail, and wavelet theory is now in the refinement stage. This involves generalizing and extending wavelets, such as in extending wavelet packet techniques. The future of wavelets lies in the as-yet uncharted territory of applications. Wavelet techniques have not been thoroughly worked out in such applications as practical data analysis, where, for example, discretely sampled time-series data might need to be analyzed. Such applications offer exciting avenues for exploration. >"

In this paper we extend this approach to estimating the covariance from sampled data. Our method combines both wavelet shrinkage and cosine-packet best-basis selection in a simple and natural way. The resulting algorithm is fast and automatic. The method has an interpretation as a nonlinear, adaptive form of anisotropic timefrequency smoothing. We introduce a new class of locally stationary processes which exhibits a form of inhomogeneous nonstationarity; our processes have covariances which typically change little from row to row, but might occasionally change abruptly. We study performance in an asymptotic setting involving triangular arrays of processes which are becoming increasingly stationary, and are able to prove rates of convergence results for our estimator. For this class of processes, the algorithm has advantages over traditional approaches like flxed-window-length segmentation followed by autocovariance estimation."

We show that this method provides a natural generalization of the classical box-counting techniques to fractal functions (the wavelets actually play the role of \u201cgeneralized boxes\u201d). We report on a systematic comparison between this alternative method and the structure function approach which is commonly used in the context of fully developed turbulence. We comment on the intrinsic limitations of the structure functions which possess fundamental drawbacks and do not provide a full characterization of the singularities of a signal in many cases.

A family of orthonormal wavelets that have a maximum number of disappearing moments is shown to be generated by the halfband Butterworth filters.

These differ from the short-time Fourier transform, wavelet transform, and wavelet packets tilings in that they change over time. They show how this can be achieved using time-varying orthogonal tree structures, which preserve orthogonality, even across transitions. The method is based on the construction of boundary and transition filters; these allow us to construct essentially arbitrary tilings. Time-varying modulated lapped transforms are a special case, where both boundary and overlapping solutions are possible with filters obtained by modulation. They present a double-tree algorithm which for a given signal decides on the best binary segmentation in both time and frequency. That is, it is a joint optimization of time and frequency splitting. The algorithm is optimal for additive cost functions (e.g., rate-distortion), and results in time-varying best bases, the main application of which is for compression of nonstationary signals. Experiments on test signals are presented. >"

The technique utilizes the recently-popularized nonlinear energy operator Psi (s)=(s)/sup 2/-ss to isolate the AM-FM energy, and an energy separation algorithm (ESA) to extract the instantaneous amplitudes and frequencies. It is demonstrated that the performance of the energy operator/ESA approach is vastly improved if the signal is first filtered through a bank of bandpass filters, and at each instant analyzed (via Psi and the ESA) using the dominant local channel response. Moreover, it is found that uniform (worst-case) performance across the frequency spectrum is attained by using a constant-Q, or multiscale wavelet-like filter bank. The elementary stochastic properties of Psi and of the ESA are developed first. The performance of Psi and the ESA when applied to bandpass filtered versions of an AM-FM signal-plus-noise combination is then analyzed. The predicted performance is greatly improved by filtering, if the local signal frequencies occur in-band. These observations motivate the multiband energy operator and ESA approach, ensuring the in-band analysis of local AM-PM energy. In particular, the multi-bands must have the constant-Q or wavelet scaling property to ensure uniform performance across bands. The theoretical predictions and the simulation results indicate that improved practical strategies are feasible for tracking and identifying AM-FM components in signals possessing pattern coherencies manifested as local concentrations of frequencies. >"

Alternatively, texturing of contoured (cartoonlike) images is analogous to adding chromaticity information to contoured images. A method for texture discrimination and image segmentation using local features based on the Gabor approach is introduced. Features related to the EF's parameters provide efficient means for texture discrimination and classification. This method is invariant under rotation and translation. The performance of the classification appears to be robust with respect to noisy conditions. The results show the insensitivity of the discrimination to relatively high noise levels, comparable to the performances of the human observer.<<ETX>>"

Wavelet transforms are also unstable with respect to dilations of the input signal and, in two dimensions, rotations of the input signal. The authors formalize these problems by defining a type of translation invariance called shiftability. In the spatial domain, shiftability corresponds to a lack of aliasing; thus, the conditions under which the property holds are specified by the sampling theorem. Shiftability may also be applied in the context of other domains, particularly orientation and scale. Jointly shiftable transforms that are simultaneously shiftable in more than one domain are explored. Two examples of jointly shiftable transforms are designed and implemented: a 1-D transform that is jointly shiftable in position and scale, and a 2-D transform that is jointly shiftable in position and orientation. The usefulness of these image representations for scale-space analysis, stereo disparity measurement, and image enhancement is demonstrated. >"

The channels are characterized by a bank of Gabor filters that nearly uniformly covers the spatial-frequency domain. A systematic filter selection scheme based on reconstruction of the input image from the filtered images is proposed. Texture features are obtained by subjecting each (selected) filtered image to a nonlinear transformation and computing a measure of energy in a window around each pixel. An unsupervised square-error clustering algorithm is then used to integrate the feature images and produce a segmentation. A simple procedure to incorporate spatial adjacency information in the clustering process is proposed. Experiments on images with natural textures as well as artificial textures with identical second and third-order statistics are reported. The algorithm appears to perform as predicted by preattentive texture discrimination by a human.<<ETX>>"

First, a tapered Fourier transform, y/sub v/(f, t), is calculated. Then the log-spectral estimate, is smoothed. As the characteristic widths of the kernel smoother increase, the bias from the temporal and frequency averaging increases while the variance decreases. The demodulation parameters, such as the order, length, and bandwidth of spectral taper and the kernel smoother, are determined by minimizing the expected error. For well-resolved evolutionary, spectra, the optimal taper length is a small fraction of the optimal kernel halfwidth. The optimal frequency bandwidth, w, for the spectral window scales as w/sup 2/ approximately lambda / tau , where tau is the characteristic time and lambda /sub F/ is the characteristic frequency scalelength. In contrast, the optimal halfwidths for the second stage kernel smoother scales as h approximately 1/( tau lambda /sub F/)/sup 1/(p+2)/ where p is the order of the kernel smoother.

We give necessary and sufficient conditions for biorthogonality of the corresponding scaling functions, and we present a sufficient condition for the decay of their Fourier transforms. We study the regularity of these biorthogonal bases. We provide several families of examples, all symmetric (corresponding to \u201clinear phase\u201d filters). In particular we can construct symmetric biorthogonal wavelet bases with arbitrarily high preassigned regularity; we also show how to construct symmetric biorthogonal wavelet bases \u201cclose\u201d to a (nonsymmetric) orthonormal basis."

The theory puts no restrictions on the system input which can be an arbitrary finite energy signal; bandlimitedness is not required. In contrast to previous approaches, this formulation allows for an independent specification of the sampling (analysis) and approximation (synthesis) spaces. In particular, when both spaces are identical, the theorem provides a simple procedure for obtaining the least squares approximation of a signal. They discuss the properties of this new sampling procedure and present some examples of applications involving bandlimited, and polynomial spline signal representations. They also define a spectral coherence function that measures the \"similarity\" between the sampling and approximation spaces, and derive a relative performance bound for the comparison with the least squares solution. >"

This result can be generalized to apply to level crossings of any linear differential operator: it applies in particular to ridges and ravines in the image intensity. In the case of the second derivative along the gradient, there is no filter that avoids creation of zero crossings, unless the filtering is performed after the derivative is applied."

One method to suppress such artifacts, termed \u201ccycle spinning\u201d by Coifman, is to \u201caverage out\u201d the translation dependence. For a range of shifts, one shifts the data (right or left as the case may be), De-Noises the shifted data, and then unshifts the de-noised data. Doing this for each of a range of shifts, and averaging the several results so obtained, produces a reconstruction subject to far weaker Gibbs phenomena than thresholding based De-Noising using the traditional orthogonal wavelet transform."

                "text": "Much recent effort has sought asymptotically minimax methods for recovering infinite dimensional objects-curves, densities, spectral densities, images-from noisy data. A now rich and complex body of work develops nearly or exactly minimax estimators for an array of interesting problems. Unfortunately, the results have rarely moved into practice, for a variety of reasons-among them being similarity to known methods, computational intractability and lack of spatial adaptivity. We discuss a method for curve estimation based on n noisy data: translate the empirical wavelet coefficients towards the origin by an amount \u221a(2 log n) /\u221an. The proposal differs from those in current use, is computationally practical and is spatially adaptive; it thus avoids several of the previous objections. Further, the method is nearly minimax both for a wide variety of loss functions-pointwise error, global error measured in L p -norms, pointwise and global error in estimation of derivatives-and for a wide range of smoothness classes, including standard Holder and Sobolev classes, and bounded variation. This is a much broader near optimality than anything previously proposed: we draw loose parallels with near optimality in robustness and also with the broad near eigenfunction properties of wavelets themselves. Finally, the theory underlying the method is interesting, as it exploits a correspondence between statistical questions and questions of optimal recovery and information-based complexity"

                "text": "1278 NOTICES OF THE AMS VOLUME 42, NUMBER 11 T he new mathematical field of wavelet transforms has achieved a major success, specifically, the Federal Bureau of Investigation\u2019s decision to adopt a wavelet-based image coding algorithm as the national standard for digitized fingerprint records [11, 4, 3]. The FBI standard, which uses an approach known as wavelet transform/scalar quantization (WSQ) image coding, was developed by project leader Tom Hopper of the FBI\u2019s Criminal Justice Information Services Division and Jonathan Bradley and Chris Brislawn from the Computer Research and Applications Group at Los Alamos National Laboratory. The standard, which is entirely within the public domain, involves a 2-dimensional discrete wavelet transform (DWT), uniform scalar quantization (a process that truncates, or \u201cquantizes\u201d, the precision of the floating-point DWT output), and Huffman entropy coding (i.e., encoding the quantized DWT output with a minimal number of bits). The FBI has a database consisting of some 200 million fingerprint records, stored (as they have been since the turn of the century) in the form of inked impressions on paper cards. As part of a modernization program, the FBI is digitizing these records as 8-bit grayscale images, with a spatial resolution of 500 dots per inch. This results in some 10 megabytes per card, making the current archive about 2,000 terabytes in size. (Note that a 3.5\u201d high-density floppy disk holds \u201conly\u201d 1.5 megabytes.) Moreover, the FBI receives on the order of 30,000 new cards (\u2261 300 gigabytes) per day, from all over the country, for background checks. After considering these numbers, the FBI decided that some form of data compression would be necessary and undertook a survey of the available image compression technology. Transform-domain data compression is based on finding a signal representation, preferably one computable via a fast transform algorithm, that provides the ability to represent complicated signals accurately with a relatively small number of bits. This role has traditionally been filled by the Fast Fourier Transform and its related fast trigonometric transforms, particularly the discrete cosine transform [22]. Wavelets provide an important class of alternatives, however, whose properties make them particularly well suited for encoding high-resolution imagery, so let\u2019s briefly review the mathematical ideas behind wavelet transforms."

The computational effort of the overall procedure is order N \u00b7 log(N) as a function of the sample size N. SureShrink is smoothness adaptive: If the unknown function contains jumps, then the reconstruction (essentially) does also; if the unknown function has a smooth piece, then the reconstruction is (essentially) as smooth as the mother wavelet will allow. The procedure is in a sense optimally smoothness adaptive: It is near minimax simultaneously over a whole interval of the Besov scale; the size of this interval depends on the choice of mother wavelet.

It is a substitute for the singular value decomposition (SVD) of an inverse problem, and it exists for a class of special inverse problems of homogeneous type\u2014such as numerical differentiation, inversion of Abel-type transforms, certain convolution transforms, and the Radon transform. We propose to solve ill-posed linear inverse problems by nonlinearly \"shrinking\" the WVD coefficients of the noisy, indirect data. Our approach offers significant advantages over traditional SVD inversion in recovering spatially inhomogeneous objects. We suppose that observations are contaminated by white noise and that the object is an unknown element of a Besov space. We prove that nonlinear WVD shrinkage can be tuned to attain the minimax rate of convergence, for L2 loss, over the entire scale of Besov spaces. The important case of Besov spaces B\u03c3p,q, p < 2, which model spatial inhomogeneity, is included. In comparison, linear procedures\u2014 SVD included\u2014cannot attain optimal rates of convergence over such classes in the case p < 2. For example, our methods achieve faster rates of convergence for objects known to lie in the bump algebra or in bounded variation than any linear procedure."

This restrictive quasistationarity assumption limits the use of existing estimation techniques to a small class of nonstationary processes. We overcome this limitation by deriving a statistically optimal kernel, within Cohen's (1989) class of time-frequency representations (TFR's), for estimating the Wigner-Ville spectrum of a nonstationary process. We also solve the related problem of minimum mean-squared error estimation of an arbitrary bilinear TFR of a realization of a process from a correlated observation. Both optimal time-frequency invariant and time-frequency varying kernels are derived. It is shown that in the presence of any additive independent noise, optimal performance requires a nontrivial kernel and that optimal estimation may require smoothing filters that are very different from those based on a quasistationarity assumption. Examples confirm that the optimal estimators often yield tremendous improvements in performance over existing methods. In particular, the ability of the optimal kernel to suppress interference is quite remarkable, thus making the proposed framework potentially useful for interference suppression via time-frequency filtering. >"

Many signals can be modeled as a pair: Excitation Function-Parallel Filter. In the FOF method this pair is replaced by a unique formula describing in a more or less approximate way the output of the filter. Two tynes of advantages have motivated the first uses of the FOF technique: on the one hand, in certain cases, the FOF formula can beplified to a point where calculations are fast and easy ([1], [2], [4],[5]). On the other hand, the FOF method allows modeling of signals without the need of separating \u201ca priori\u201d the excitation function and the filter ([3], [53])."

Appendix F contains a number of problems, grouped to be used on a chapter by chapter basis The problems are designed to illustrate practical applications of the text material. The parts of this book of most interest and value to the EMC engineer will be the chapters on Thermal Noise, Antennas, Propagation and Transmission Lines, and  Reflection and Refraction. This is not  to downpade the chapters on Statistics and Its Applications, Signal Processing and Detection, and Some System Characteristics which also contain much potentially useful materials. Additional plus values for the book include a list of 40 references, a table of symbols used throughout the book, and a subject index. Some readers may find the condensed type and close line spacing hard to read. It was apparently set up by typewriter using an elite type face with single line spacing. When reduced down to a 6 by 9 5 inch size page it is too crowded for easy reading. In spite of this shortcoming your reviewer recommends this book as a worthwhile reference in this field of interest."

Particular attention is given to the fact that receptive field profiles of simple cells in the visual cortex often resemble even-symmetric or odd-symmetric Gabor filters; i.e. their receptive field profiles can be described by the product of a Gaussian and either a cosine or sine function. Their spatial frequency tuning is of medium bandwidth (~one octave) which is narrow enough for a cell to distinguish the third harmonic from the fundamental frequency for square-wave gratings of low spatial frequency. The responses of adjacent simple cells, tuned to the same spatial frequency, orientation, and direction, differ in their phase response to drifting sine-wave gratings by approximately either 90\u00b0 or 180\u00b0. This latter result makes it possible to consider two adjacent simple cell pairs as operating like paired Gaussian-attenuated sine and cosine filters of Gabor filters for restricted regions of visual space. The entire set of simple cells provides a complete representation of the visual scene, yet each simple cell is unique in its response properties. At the complex cell stage, the cell's mean firing rate appears to represent the amplitude of a local Fourier coefficient, but phase information is seldom conveyed with much precision in the action potential code."

Signal Processing, vol.41, no.12, p.3445, 1993), is a very effective and computationally simple technique for image compression. We offer an alternative explanation of the principles of its operation, so that the reasons for its excellent performance can be better understood. These principles are partial ordering by magnitude with a set partitioning sorting algorithm, ordered bit plane transmission, and exploitation of self-similarity across different scales of an image wavelet transform. Moreover, we present a new and different implementation based on set partitioning in hierarchical trees (SPIHT), which provides even better performance than our previously reported extension of EZW that surpassed the performance of the original EZW. The image coding results, calculated from actual file sizes and images reconstructed by the decoding algorithm, are either comparable to or surpass previous results obtained through much more sophisticated and computationally complex methods. In addition, the new coding and decoding procedures are extremely fast, and they can be made even faster, with only small loss in performance, by omitting entropy coding of the bit stream by the arithmetic code."

These methods include method of frames, matching pursuit, and, most recently, basis pursuit. In this work, high resolution pursuit (HRP) is developed as an alternative to existing function approximation techniques. Existing techniques do not always efficiently yield representations which are sparse and physically interpretable. HRP is an enhanced version of the matching pursuit algorithm and overcomes the shortcomings of the traditional matching pursuit algorithm by emphasizing local fit over global fit at each stage. Further, the HRP algorithm has the same order of complexity as matching pursuit. In this paper, the HRP algorithm is developed and demonstrated on 1D functions. Convergence properties of HRP are also examined. HRP is also suitable for extracting features which may then be used in recognition."

For computational reasons the set is also (e) orthogonal and lends itself to (f) rapid computation. The systems are derived from concepts in matrix algebra, but are closely connected to decompositions based on quadrature mirror filters. Our computations take place hierarchically, leading to a pyramid representation in which all of the basis functions have the same basic shape, and appear at many scales. By placing the high-pass and low-pass kernels on staggered grids, we can derived odd-tap QMF kernels that are quite compact. We have developed pyramids using separable, quincunx, and hexagonal kernels. Image data compression with the pyramids gives excellent results, both in terms of MSE and visual appearance. A non-orthogonal variant allows good performance with 3-tap basis kernels and the appropriate inverse sampling kernels."

The representation differs from established techniques in that the code elements are localized in spatial frequency as well as in space. Pixel-to-pixel correlations are first removed by subtracting a lowpass filtered copy of the image from the image itself. The result is a net data compression since the difference, or error, image has low variance and entropy, and the low-pass filtered image may represented at reduced sample density. Further data compression is achieved by quantizing the difference image. These steps are then repeated to compress the low-pass image. Iteration of the process at appropriately expanded scales generates a pyramid data structure. The encoding process is equivalent to sampling the image with Laplacian operators of many scales. Thus, the code tends to enhance salient image features. A further advantage of the present code is that it is well suited for many image analysis tasks as well as for image compression. Fast algorithms are described for coding and decoding."

The encoder is a multi-channel system, each channel approximately of critical bandwidth. The input signal is filtered into 17 frequency channels via the quadrature mirror filter technique. Each channel is then coded using block-companding adaptive PCM. For 4.1 kHz bandwidth speech, the differential threshold of the encoding degradation occurs at a bit rate of 34.4 kbps.

Simple thresholding operations, applied in the unconditional basis, work essentially better for compressing, estimating, and recovering than they do in any other orthogonal basis. In fact, simple thresholding in an unconditional basis works essentially better for recovery and estimation than other methods, period. (Performance is measured in an asymptotic minimax sense.) As an application, we formalize and prove Mallat\u2032s Heuristic, which says that wavelet bases are optimal for representing functions containing singularities, when there may be an arbitrary number of singularities, arbitrarily distributed."

The success of the approach depends on the definition of a comprehensive set of goals for the computation of edge points. These goals must be precise enough to delimit the desired behavior of the detector while making minimal assumptions about the form of the solution. We define detection and localization criteria for a class of edges, and present mathematical forms for these criteria as functionals on the operator impulse response. A third criterion is then added to ensure that the detector has only one response to a single edge. We use the criteria in numerical optimization to derive detectors for several common image features, including step edges. On specializing the analysis to step edges, we find that there is a natural uncertainty principle between detection and localization performance, which are the two main goals. With this principle we derive a single operator shape which is optimal at any scale. The optimal detector has a simple approximate implementation in which edges are marked at maxima in gradient magnitude of a Gaussian-smoothed image. We extend this simple detector using operators of several widths to cope with different signal-to-noise ratios in the image. We present a general method, called feature synthesis, for the fine-to-coarse integration of information from operators at different scales. Finally we show that step edge detector performance improves considerably as the operator point spread function is extended along the edge."

The image sequence is first convolved with a set of linear, separable spatiotemporal filter kernels similar to those that have been used in other early vision problems such as texture and stereopsis. The brightness constancy constraint can then be applied to each of the resulting images, giving us, in general, an overdetermined system of equations for the optical flow at each pixel. There are three principal sources of error: (a) stochastic error due to sensor noise (b) systematic errors in the presence of large displacements and (c) errors due to failure of the brightness constancy model. Our analysis of these errors leads us to develop an algorithm based on a robust version of total least squares. Each optical flow vector computed has an associated reliability measure which can be used in subsequent processing. The performance of the algorithm on the data set used by Barron et al. (IJCV 1994) compares favorably with other techniques. In addition to being separable, the filters used are also causal, incorporating only past time frames. The algorithm is fully parallel and has been implemented on a multiple processor machine."

In 1977 Marr and Poggio proposed one such computational model, which was characterized as matching certain feature points in difference-of-Gaussian filtered images and using the information obtained by matching coarser resolution representations to restrict the search space for matching finer resolution representations. An implementation of the algorithm and its testing on a range of images was reported in 1980. Since then a number of psychophysical experiments have suggested possible refinements to the model and modifications to the algorithm. As well, recent computational experiments applying the algorithm to a variety of natural images, especially aerial photographs, have led to a number of modifications.

This article describes conventional A/D conversion, as well as its performance modeling. We then look at the technique of oversampling, which can be used to improve the resolution of classical A/D methods. We discuss how sigma-delta converters use the technique of noise shaping in addition to oversampling to allow high resolution conversion of relatively low bandwidth signals. We examine the use of sigma-delta converters to convert narrowband bandpass signals with high resolution. Several parallel sigma-delta converters, which offer the potential of extending high resolution conversion to signals with higher bandwidths, are also described."

                "text": "The digital representation of an image requires a very large number of bits. The goal of image coding is to reduce this number, as much as possible, and reconstruct a faithful duplicate of the original picture. Early efforts in image coding, solely guided by information theory, led to a plethora of methods. The compression ratio, starting at 1 with the first digital picture in the early 1960s, reached a saturation level around 10:1 a couple of years ago. This certainly does not mean that the upper bound given by the entropy of the source has also been reached. First, this entropy is not known and depends heavily on the model used for the source, i.e., the digital image. Second, the information theory does not take into account what the human eye sees and how it sees. Recent progress in the study of the brain mechanism of vision has opened new vistas in picture coding. Directional sensitivity of the neurones in the visual pathway combined with the separate processing of contours and textures has led to a new class of coding methods capable of achieving compression ratios as high as 70:1. Image quality, of course, remains as an important problem to be investigated. This class of methods, that we call second generation, is the subject of this paper. Two groups can be formed in this class: methods using local operators and combining their output in a suitable way and methods using contour-texture descriptions. Four methods, two in each class, are described in detail. They are applied to the same set of original pictures to allow a fair comparison of the quality in the decoded pictures. If more effort is devoted to this subject, a compression ratio of 100:1 is within reach."

A previously given definition of such a function turned out to yield a distribution that was periodic with period \u03c0 instead of 2\u03c0 and this caused aliasing to occur. Various alternative definitions are considered and compared with respect to aliasing and computational complexity. From this comparison it appears that no definition leads to a function that is optimum in all respects. This is illustrated by an example."

In particular, the zero crossings of this so-called scale-space data are associated with edges and have been proposed by D. Marr (1982) and others as the basis of a representation of the image data. The question arises as to whether the representation is complete and stable. The authors survey some of the studies and results related to these questions as well as several studies that attempt reconstructions based on this or related representations. They formulate a novel method for reconstruction from zero crossings in scale space that is based on minimizing equation error, and they present results showing that the reconstruction is possible but can be unstable. They further show that the method applies when gradient data along the zero crossings are included in the representation, and they demonstrate empirically that the reconstruction is then stable. >"

Its properties are revised with emphasis on its central role in the analysis of second-order properties of nonstationary random signals. We propose here a general class of spectral estimators of the Wigner-Ville spectrum: this class is based on arbitrarily weighted covariance estimators and its formal description corresponds to the general class of conjoint time-frequency representations of deterministic signals with finite energy. Classical estimators like short-time periodograms and the recently introduced pseudo-Wigner estimators are shown to be special cases of the general class. The generalized framework allows the calculation of the moments of general spectral estimators and comparing the results emphasizes the versatility of the new pseudo-Wigner estimators. The effective numerical implementation, by an N-point FFT, of pseudo-Wigner estimators of 2N points is indicated and various examples are given."

Digital video-coding technology has developed into a mature field and products have been developed that are targeted for a wide range of emerging applications, such as video on demand, digital TV/HDTV broadcasting, and multimedia image/video database services. With the increased commercial interest in video communications, the need for international image- and video-compression standards arose. To meet this need, the Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG) was formed to develop coding standards. MPEG-1 and MPEG-2 video-coding standards have attracted much attention worldwide, with an increasing number of very large scale integration (VLSI) and software implementations of these standards becoming commercially available. MPEG-4, the most recent MPEG standard that is still under development, is targeted for future content-based multimedia applications. We provide an overview of the MPEG video-coding algorithms and standards and their role in video communications. We review the basic concepts and techniques that are relevant in the context of the MPEG video-compression standards and outline MPEG-1 and MPEG-2 video-coding algorithms. The specific properties of the standards related to their applications are presented, and the basic elements of the forthcoming MPEG-4 standard are also described. We also discuss the performance of the standards and their success in the market place."

In this paper, our attention focuses on complexity issues. First, the most expensive step of the signal expansion process is significantly speeded up by exploiting results achieved in the wavelet and multiresolution theory. A subband dictionary is proposed as an alternative to the Gabor dictionary that has been used up to now. Equivalent levels of quality are achieved with both dictionaries, but the computational cost is significantly reduced when using the subband one. Then, we explain how, with any dictionary, the linearity of the inner product could be exploited to further speed up the process in return for an increased amount of memory."

The embedded code represents a sequence of binary decisions that distinguish an image from the \"null\" image. Using an embedded coding algorithm, an encoder can terminate the encoding at any point thereby allowing a target rate or target distortion metric to be met exactly. Also, given a bit stream, the decoder can cease decoding at any point in the bit stream and still produce exactly the same image that would have been encoded at the bit rate corresponding to the truncated bit stream. In addition to producing a fully embedded bit stream, the EZW consistently produces compression results that are competitive with virtually all known compression algorithms on standard test images. Yet this performance is achieved with a technique that requires absolutely no training, no pre-stored tables or codebooks, and requires no prior knowledge of the image source. The EZW algorithm is based on four key concepts: (1) a discrete wavelet transform or hierarchical subband decomposition, (2) prediction of the absence of significant information across scales by exploiting the self-similarity inherent in images, (3) entropy-coded successive-approximation quantization, and (4) universal lossless data compression which is achieved via adaptive arithmetic coding. >"

A natural question arising from their work is to translate approximation results into estimation results. In this paper we discuss the problem of estimation of the covariance from sampled data. We show that it is possible to obtain an empirical basis from sampled data which is nearly as good as the ideal theoretical basis. We describe a specific method which is nicely suited to the Coifman-Wickerhauser [1992] fast algorithm for obtaining a best basis. In this note we describe theoretical results."

Adopting the viewpoint of computational harmonic analysis, we develop an overcomplete collection of atoms called wedgelets, dyadically organized indicator functions with a variety of locations, scales, and orientations. The wedgelet representation provides nearly-optimal representations of objects in the Horizon model, as measured by minimax description length. We show how to rapidly compute a wedgelet approximation to noisy data by flnding a special edgelet-decorated recursive partition which minimizes a complexity-penalized sum of squares. This estimate, using su-cient sub-pixel resolution, achieves nearly the minimax mean-squared error in the Horizon Model. In fact, the method is adaptive in the sense that it achieves nearly the minimax risk for any value of the unknown degree of regularity of the Horizon, 1\u2022 fi\u2022 2. Wedgelet analysis and de-noising may be used successfully outside the Horizon model. We study images modelled as indicators of star-shaped sets with smooth bound- aries and show that complexity-penalized wedgelet partitioning achieves nearly the minimax risk in that setting also."

This is achieved by solving a functional equation by means of the construction of a contractive operator on an appropriate functional space. The solution, a fixed point of the operator, can be obtained by an iterative process, making this model very suitable to use in applications such as fractal image and signal compression. On the other hand, this \u201cgeneralized self-similarity equation\u201d includes matrix refinement equations of the typef(x)\u00a0=\u00a0\u2211\u00a0ckf(Ax\u00a0\u2212\u00a0k) which are central in the construction of wavelets and multiwavelets. The results of this paper will therefore yield conditions for the existence of L p-refinable functions in a very general setting."

In the typical situation one is interested in recovering a whole function given a finite number of noisy measurements on functionals. Performance characteristics of an inversion algorithm are studied via the mean square error which is decomposed into bias and variability. Variability calculations are often straightforward, but useful bias measures are more difficult to obtain. An appropriate definition of what geophysicists call the Backus-Gilbert averaging kernel leads to a natural way of measuring bias characteristics. Moreover, the ideas give rise to some important experimen- tal design criteria. It can be shown that the optimal inversion algorithms are methods of regularization procedures, but to completely specify these algorithms the signal to noise ratio must be supplied. Statistical approaches to the empirical determination of the signal to noise ratio are discussed; cross-validation and unbiased risk methods are reviewed; and some exten- sions, which seem particularly appropriate in the inverse problem context, are indicated. Linear and nonlinear examples from medicine, meteorology, and geophysics are used for illustration."

Using these two properties, we group the scaling and wavelet functions into equivalent classes and consider various equivalent basis functions of the associated function spaces We use the n-fold convolution product to construct sequences of multiresolution and wavelet spaces V (j)(\u03d5n) and W (j)(\u03d5n) with increasing regularity. We discuss the link between multiresolution analysis and Shannon's sampling theory. We then show that the interpolating and orthogonal pre- and post-filters associated with the multiresolution sequence V (0)(\u03d5n)asymptotically converge to the ideal lowpass filter of S..."

Bony's two-microlocal spaces Cx0s,s', and the corresponding definition on the wavelet coefficients. The purpose is mainly to show that these two-microlocal spaces provide \"good substitutes\" for the pointwise Holder regularity condition; they can be very precisely compared with this condition, they have more functional properties, and can be characterized by conditions on the wavelet coefficients. We also give applications of these properties. In Part 2 some results on the microlocal spaces contained in [B2] will be recalled. Theorems 3 and 4 are also essentially contained in [B2]. The starting point for this paper was a note ([J1]) the author had written on a comparison between the Holder criterion of regularity at a given point x0 and a corresponding property defined on the wavelet coefficients. Some easy proofs are omitted or abridged and can be found in [J2]."

Part I showed that equations of this type have at most one $L^1 $-solution up to a multiplicative constant, which necessarily has compact support in $[0,{N / {k - 1}}]$. This paper gives a time-domain representation for such a function $f(x)$ (if it exists) in terms of infinite products of matrices (that vary as x varies). Sufficient conditions are given on $\\{ {c_n } \\}$ for a continuous nonzero $L^1 $-solution to exist. Additional conditions sufficient to guarantee $f \\in C^r $ are also given. The infinite matrix product representations is used to bound from below the degree of regularity of such an $L^1 $-solution and to estimate the Holder exponent of continuity of the highest-order well-defined derivative of $f(x)$. Such solutions $f(x)$ are often smoother at some points than others. For certain $f(x)$ a hierarchy of fractal se..."

Moreover, the reconstruction can be implemented using fast algorithms. Since, a special case is the space of bandlimited functions, our result generalizes the classical Shannon-Whittacker (1949) sampling theorem on regular sampling and the Paley-Wiener (1934) theorem on nonuniform sampling."

To achieve more efficient visual communication and fully utilize limited channel bandwidth and storage space, video compression (or coding) that reduces data amount is necessary. Video coders were once thought to be technically and economically unfeasible. However, thanks to the parallel progress on microelectronics and compression techniques, video coders for a variety of applications are becoming a reality. Realizing this, tremendous global efforts are being made to standardize video coders for various applications so as to expedite the ubiquitous deployment of visual communications. In this paper, common elements of video compression are described, followed by an introduction of international video coding standards for applications ranging from still image to HDTV. Specifically, JPEG (for still image compression), H.261 (for videophone and videoconferencing applications), and MPEG (for storage media) are covered. HDTV standard proposals to the F.C.C. in the U.S. are also discussed briefly. This paper is concluded with a discussion of products and some network issues related to video compression."

We derived the equations which govern the system. We made models of the system and performed numerical simulations to test these models. The theoretical and numerical studies of this system have been validated by experiment. A recent design improvement has led to a system that synchronizes at 0 db signal-to-noise ratio.

This approach allows for explicit and easy handling of a variety of difficulties commonly associated with problems of this type. Regularization is accomplished via the incorporation of prior information in the form of a multiscale stochastic model. We introduce the relative error covariance matrix (RECM) as a tool for quantitatively evaluating the manner in which data contribute to the structure of a reconstruction. In particular, the use of a scale space formulation is ideally suited to the fusion of data from several sensors with differing resolutions and spatial coverage (e.g., sparse or limited availability). Moreover, the RECM both provides us with an ideal tool for understanding and analyzing the process of multisensor fusion and allows us to define the space-varying optimal scale for reconstruction as a function of the nature (resolution, quality, and coverage) of the available data. Examples of our multiscale maximum a posteriori inversion algorithm are demonstrated using a two channel deconvolution problem formulated to illustrate many of the features associated with more general linear inverse problems."

The paper falls into three parts. In the first, the distribution functions of the complete set of dynamical variables specifying a mechanical system (phase-space distributions), which are fundamental in any form of statistical dynamics, are expressed in terms of the wave vectors of quantum theory. This is shown to be equivalent to specifying a theory of functions of non-commuting operators, and may hence be considered as an interpretation of quantum kinematics. In the second part, the laws governing the transformation with time of these phase-space distributions are derived from the equations of motion of quantum dynamics and found to be of the required form for a dynamical stochastic process. It is shown that these phase-space transformation equations can be used as an alternative to the Schrodinger equation in the solution of quantum mechanical problems, such as the evolution with time of wave packets, collision problems and the calculation of transition probabilities in perturbed systems; an approximation method is derived for this purpose. The third part, quantum statistics, deals with the phase-space distribution of members of large assemblies, with a view to applications of quantum mechanics to kinetic theories of matter. Finally, the limitations of the theory, its uniqueness and the possibilities of experimental verification are discussed."

Given a band-limited input X producing a quantized version C, the authors consider the set of all input signals that are band-limited and produce C. They call any element of this set a consistent estimate of X. Regardless of the type of encoder (simple, predictive, or noise-shaping), they show that this set is convex, and as a consequence, any nonconsistent estimate can be improved. They also show that the classical linear decoding estimates are not necessarily consistent. Numerical tests performed on simple ADC, single-loop, and multiloop /spl Sigma//spl Delta/ modulation show that consistent estimates yield a mean square error (MSE) that decreases asymptotically with the oversampling ratio faster than the linear decoding MSE by approximately 3 dB/octave. This implies an asymptotic MSE of the order of /spl Oscr/(R/sup /spl minus/(2n+2/)) instead of /spl Oscr/(R/sup /spl minus/(2n+1/)) in linear decoding, where R is the oversampling ratio and n the order of the modulator. Methods of improvement of nonconsistent estimates based on the deterministic knowledge of the quantized signal are proposed for simple ADC, predictive ADC, single-loop, and multiloop /spl Sigma//spl Delta/ modulation. >"

JPEG\u2019s proposed standard aims to be generic, to support a wide variety of applications for continuous-tone images. To meet the differing needs of many applications, the JPEG standard includes two basic compression methods, each with various modes of operation. A DCT-based method is specified for \u201clossy\u2019\u2019 compression, and a predictive method for \u201clossless\u2019\u2019 compression. JPEG features a simple lossy technique known as the Baseline method, a subset of the other DCT-based modes of operation. The Baseline method has been by far the most widely implemented JPEG method to date, and is sufficient in its own right for a large number of applications. This article provides an overview of the JPEG standard, and focuses in detail on the Baseline method."

In this paper, the question of what are good triangles (and triangulations) for linear interpolation is studied further. First, the model problem of constructing optimal triangulations for interpolating quadratic functions by PLIS is considered. Next, a new interpretation of existing error bounds for interpolating general smooth functions by PUS is studied. The conclusion is that triangles should be long in directions where the magnitude of the second directional derivative of F is small and thin in directions where the magnitude of the second directional derivative of F is large."

                "text": "Coefficient quantization has peculiar qualitative effects on representations of vectors in IR with respect to overcomplete sets of vectors. These effects are investigated in two settings: frame expansions (representations obtained by forming inner products with each element of the set) and matching pursuit expansions (approximations obtained by greedily forming linear combinations). In both cases, based on the concept of consistency, it is shown that traditional linear reconstruction methods are suboptimal, and better consistent reconstruction algorithms are given. The proposed consistent reconstruction algorithms were in each case implemented, and experimental results are included. For frame expansions, results are proven to bound distortion as a function of frame redundancy r and quantization step size for linear, consistent, and optimal reconstruction methods. Taken together, these suggest that optimal reconstruction methods will yield O(1/r/sup 2/) mean-squared error (MSE), and that consistency is sufficient to insure this asymptotic behavior. A result on the asymptotic tightness of random frames is also proven. Applicability of quantized matching pursuit to lossy vector compression is explored. Experiments demonstrate the likelihood that a linear reconstruction is inconsistent, the MSE reduction obtained with a nonlinear (consistent) reconstruction algorithm, and generally competitive performance at low bit rates."

We consider the problem of finding an innovations system for a process characterized by its correlation function, and we discuss the connection between GES analysis and the class of underspread processes. Furthermore, we show that another special case of the GES-a novel time-varying power spectrum that we call the Weyl spectrum-has substantial advantages over all other members of the GES family.

In such systems, it is important that the individual channel signals be decimated in such a way that the number of samples coded and transmitted does not exceed the number of samples in the original speech signal. Under this constraint, the systems presented in the past have sought to remove the aliasing distortion while minimizing the overall analysis/reconstruction distortion. In this paper, it is shown that it is possible to design tree-structured analysis/reconstruction systems which meet the sampling rate condition and which also result in exact reconstruction of the input signal. This paper develops the conditions for exact reconstruction and presents a general method for designing the corresponding high quality analysis and reconstruction filters."

Perfect-reconstruction structures for the two-band case are reviewed, and the results are extended to the case of arbitrary number of channels. The relation between perfect-reconstruction QMF banks and the concept of losslessness in transfers-matrices is indicated. New lattice structures are presented, which perform the perfect reconstruction, sometimes even under coefficient quantization."

The notion of an information source that simplifies and sharpens the traditional one is axiomatized, and adaptive and nonadaptive models are defined. With a measure of complexity assigned to the models, a fundamental theorem is proved which states that models that use any kind of alphabet extension are inferior to the best models using no alphabet extensions at all. A general class of so-called first-in first-out (FIFO) arithmetic codes is described which require no alphabet extension devices and which therefore can be used in conjunction with the best models. Because the coding parameters are the probabilities that define the model, their design is easy, and the application of the code is straightforward even with adaptively changing source models."

We studied the statistics of natural images including the scale invariant properties, then generic prior models were learned to duplicate the observed statistics, based on minimax entropy theory. The resulting Gibbs distributions have potentials of the form U(I; /spl Lambda/, S)=/spl Sigma//sub /spl alpha/=1//sup k//spl Sigma//sub x,y//spl lambda//sup (/spl alpha/)/((F/sup (/spl alpha/)/*I)(x,y)) with S={F/sup (1)/, F/sup (2)/,...,F/sup (K)/} being a set of filters and /spl Lambda/={/spl lambda//sup (1)/(),/spl lambda//sup (2)/(),...,/spl lambda//sup (K)/()} the potential functions. The learned Gibbs distributions confirm and improve the form of existing prior models such as line-process, but, in contrast to all previous models, inverted potentials were found to be necessary. We find that the partial differential equations given by gradient descent on U(I; /spl Lambda/, S) are essentially reaction-diffusion equations, where the usual energy terms produce anisotropic diffusion, while the inverted energy terms produce reaction associated with pattern formation, enhancing preferred image features. We illustrate how these models can be used for texture pattern rendering, denoising, image enhancement, and clutter removal by careful choice of both prior and data models of this type, incorporating the appropriate features."

The structure inherently has the perfect-reconstruction property, while the algorithm ensures a good stopband attenuation for each of the analysis filters. Implementations of such lattice structures are robust in the sense that the perfect-reconstruction property is preserved in spite of coefficient quantization. The lattice structure has the hierarchical property that a higher order perfect-reconstruction QMF bank can be obtained from a lower order perfect-reconstruction QMF bank, simply by adding more lattice sections. Several numerical examples are provided in the form of design tables. >"

The probability of any configurational position is then proportional to exp\u2014U/kT, with U the potential energy. Wigner has shown that quantum\u2010mechanical deviations, as the temperature is lowered, may be approximated by multiplication of this with 1\u2013f, where f is a function proportional to h2 and having terms in T\u22122 and terms in T\u22123. This type of approximation is unsatisfactory for a system of many degrees of freedom, that is, one of many dependent molecules. For such a system it is shown that instead of Wigner's approximation we may replace the classical potential U in the exponent by U\u2014kTf, where f is the same as Wigner's function."
