These variations arise from different clothing, anatomy, imaging conditions and the large number of poses it is possible for a human body to take. Recent work has shown state-of-the-art results by partitioning the pose space and using strong nonlinear classifiers such that the pose dependence and multi-modal nature of body part appearance can be captured. We propose to extend these methods to handle much larger quantities of training data, an order of magnitude larger than current datasets, and show how to utilize Amazon Mechanical Turk and a latent annotation update scheme to achieve high quality annotations at low cost. We demonstrate a significant increase in pose estimation accuracy, while simultaneously reducing computational expense by a factor of 10, and contribute a dataset of 10,000 highly articulated poses."

Building on the successful pictorial structure model (PSM) we propose richer models of both appearance and pose, using state-of-the-art discriminative classifiers without introducing unacceptable computational expense. We introduce a new annotated database of challenging consumer images, an order of magnitude larger than currently available datasets, and demonstrate over 50% relative improvement in pose estimation accuracy over a stateof-the-art method."

Here we tackle the problem in a new setting, coined Human Pose Coestimation (PCE), where multiple people are in a common, but unknown pose. The task of PCE is to estimate their poses jointly and to produce prototypes characterizing the shared pose. Since the poses of the individual people should be similar to the prototype, PCE has less freedom compared to estimating each pose independently, which simplifies the problem. We demonstrate our PCE technique on two applications. The first is estimating the pose of people performing the same activity synchronously, such as during aerobics, cheerleading, and dancing in a group. We show that PCE improves pose estimation accuracy over estimating each person independently. The second application is learning prototype poses characterizing a pose class directly from an image search engine queried by the class name (e.g., \u201clotus pose\u201d). We show that PCE leads to better pose estimation in such images, and it learns meaningful prototypes which can be used as priors for pose estimation in novel images."

Such video material is uncontrolled and extremely challenging. We propose an approach that progressively reduces the search space for body parts, to greatly improve the chances that pose estimation will succeed. This involves two contributions: (i) a generic detector using a weak model of pose to substantially reduce the full pose search space; and (ii) employing 'grabcut' initialized on detected regions proposed by the weak model, to further prune the search space. Moreover, we also propose (Hi) an integrated spatio- temporal model covering multiple frames to refine pose estimates from individual frames, with inference using belief propagation. The method is fully automatic and self-initializing, and explains the spatio-temporal volume covered by a person moving in a shot, by soft-labeling every pixel as belonging to a particular body part or to the background. We demonstrate upper-body pose estimation by an extensive evaluation over 70000 frames from four episodes of the TV series Buffy the vampire slayer, and present an application to full- body action recognition on the Weizmann dataset."

A typical approach to this problem is to use a linear structured model, which struggles to capture the wide range of appearance present in realistic, unconstrained images. In this paper, we instead propose a model of human pose that explicitly captures a variety of pose modes. Unlike other multimodal models, our approach includes both global and local pose cues and uses a convex objective and joint training for mode selection and pose estimation. We also employ a cascaded mode selection step which controls the trade-off between speed and accuracy, yielding a 5x speedup in inference and learning. Our model outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across the accuracy-speed trade-off curve for several pose datasets. This includes our newly-collected dataset of people in movies, FLIC, which contains an order of magnitude more labeled data for training and testing than existing datasets."

Recent methods that rely on discriminatively trained deformable parts organized in a tree model have shown to be very successful in solving this task. Within such a pictorial structure framework, we address the problem of obtaining good part templates by proposing novel, non-linear joint regressors. In particular, we employ two-layered random forests as joint regressors. The first layer acts as a discriminative, independent body part classifier. The second layer takes the estimated class distributions of the first one into account and is thereby able to predict joint locations by modeling the interdependence and co-occurrence of the parts. This results in a pose estimation framework that takes dependencies between body parts already for joint localization into account and is thus able to circumvent typical ambiguities of tree structures, such as for legs and arms. In the experiments, we demonstrate that our body parts dependent joint regressors achieve a higher joint localization accuracy than tree-based state-of-the-art methods."

For this purpose, we build on the notion of poselets [4] and train highly discriminative classifiers to differentiate among arm configurations, which we call armlets. We propose a rich representation which, in addition to standard HOG features, integrates the information of strong contours, skin color and contextual cues in a principled manner. Unlike existing methods, we evaluate our approach on a large subset of images from the PASCAL VOC detection dataset, where critical visual phenomena, such as occlusion, truncation, multiple instances and clutter are the norm. Our approach outperforms Yang and Ramanan [26], the state-of-the-art technique, with an improvement from 29.0% to 37.5% PCP accuracy on the arm keypoint prediction task, on this new pose estimation dataset."

Interactions are modeled as occlusions between people. First, we propose an occlusion probability predictor, based on the location of persons automatically detected in the image, and incorporate the predictions as occlusion priors into our multi-person PS model. Moreover, our model includes an inter-people exclusion penalty, preventing body parts from different people from occupying the same image region. Thanks to these elements, our model has a global view of the scene, resulting in better pose estimates in group photos, where several persons stand nearby and occlude each other. In a comprehensive evaluation on a new, challenging group photo datasets we demonstrate the benefits of our multi-person model over a state-of-the-art single-person pose estimator which treats each person independently."

Besides increasing the size of the datasets in the current state-of-the-art by several orders of magnitude, we also aim to complement such datasets with a diverse set of motions and poses encountered as part of typical human activities (taking photos, talking on the phone, posing, greeting, eating, etc.), with additional synchronized image, human motion capture, and time of flight (depth) data, and with accurate 3D body scans of all the subject actors involved. We also provide controlled mixed reality evaluation scenarios where 3D human models are animated using motion capture and inserted using correct 3D geometry, in complex real environments, viewed with moving cameras, and under occlusion. Finally, we provide a set of large-scale statistical models and detailed evaluation baselines for the dataset illustrating its diversity and the scope for improvement by future work in the research community. Our experiments show that our best large-scale model can leverage our full training set to obtain a 20% improvement in performance compared to a training set of the scale of the largest existing public dataset for this problem. Yet the potential for improvement by leveraging higher capacity, more complex models with our large dataset, is substantially vaster and should stimulate future research. The dataset together with code for the associated large-scale learning models, features, visualization tools, as well as the evaluation server, is available online at http://vision.imar.ro/human3.6m."

This paper aims to push the state-of-the-art in articulated pose estimation in two ways. First we explore various types of appearance representations aiming to substantially improve the body part hypotheses. And second, we draw on and combine several recently proposed powerful ideas such as more flexible spatial models as well as image-conditioned spatial models. In a series of experiments we draw several important conclusions: (1) we show that the proposed appearance representations are complementary, (2) we demonstrate that even a basic tree-structure spatial human body model achieves state-of-the-art performance when augmented with the proper appearance representation, and (3) we show that the combination of the best performing appearance model with a flexible image-conditioned spatial model achieves the best result, significantly improving over the state of the art, on the ``Leeds Sports Poses'' and ``Parse'' benchmarks."

In previous articulated pose estimation work on unconstrained videos, using temporal coupling of limb positions has made little to no difference in performance over parsing frames individually [8, 28]. One crucial reason for this is that joint parsing of multiple articulated parts over time involves intractable inference and learning problems, and previous work has resorted to approximate inference and simplified models. We overcome these computational and modeling limitations using an ensemble of tractable submodels which couple locations of body joints within and across frames using expressive cues. Each submodel is responsible for tracking a single joint through time (e.g., left elbow) and also models the spatial arrangement of all joints in a single frame. Because of the tree structure of each submodel, we can perform efficient exact inference and use rich temporal features that depend on image appearance, e.g., color tracking and optical flow contours. We propose and experimentally investigate a hierarchy of submodel combination methods, and we find that a highly efficient max-marginal combination method outperforms much slower (by orders of magnitude) approximate inference using dual decomposition. We apply our pose model on a new video dataset of highly varied and articulated poses from TV shows. We show significant quantitative and qualitative improvements over state-of-the-art single-frame pose estimation approaches."

Many recent approaches improve accuracy and robustness to cope with challenging video sequences, but it is often unclear what affects the results most. This paper attempts to provide insights based on a systematic performance evaluation using thoroughly-annotated data of human actions. We annotate human Joints for the HMDB dataset (J-HMDB). This annotation can be used to derive ground truth optical flow and segmentation. We evaluate current methods using this dataset and systematically replace the output of various algorithms with ground truth. This enables us to discover what is important - for example, should we work on improving flow algorithms, estimating human bounding boxes, or enabling pose estimation? In summary, we find that high-level pose features greatly outperform low/mid level features, in particular, pose over time is critical, but current pose estimation algorithms are not yet reliable enough to provide this information. We also find that the accuracy of a top-performing action recognition framework can be greatly increased by refining the underlying low/mid level features, this suggests it is important to improve optical flow and human detection algorithms. Our analysis and J-HMDB dataset should facilitate a deeper understanding of action recognition algorithms."

The difficulty is particularly pronounced in activities involving human-object interactions (e.g. playing tennis), where the relevant object tends to be small or only partially visible, and the human body parts are often self-occluded. We observe, however, that objects and human poses can serve as mutual context to each other \u2013 recognizing one facilitates the recognition of the other. In this paper we propose a new random field model to encode the mutual context of objects and human poses in human-object interaction activities. We then cast the model learning task as a structure learning problem, of which the structural connectivity between the object, the overall human pose, and different body parts are estimated through a structure search approach, and the parameters of the model are estimated by a new max-margin algorithm. On a sports data set of six classes of human-object interactions [12], we show that our mutual context model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art in detecting very difficult objects and human poses."

We present data obtained using a hardware system that is able to capture synchronized video and ground-truth 3D motion. The resulting HumanEva datasets contain multiple subjects performing a set of predefined actions with a number of repetitions. On the order of 40,000 frames of synchronized motion capture and multi-view video (resulting in over one quarter million image frames in total) were collected at 60\u00a0Hz with an additional 37,000 time instants of pure motion capture data. A standard set of error measures is defined for evaluating both 2D and 3D pose estimation and tracking algorithms. We also describe a baseline algorithm for 3D articulated tracking that uses a relatively standard Bayesian framework with optimization in the form of Sequential Importance Resampling and Annealed Particle Filtering. In the context of this baseline algorithm we explore a variety of likelihood functions, prior models of human motion and the effects of algorithm parameters. Our experiments suggest that image observation models and motion priors play important roles in performance, and that in a multi-view laboratory environment, where initialization is available, Bayesian filtering tends to perform well. The datasets and the software are made available to the research community. This infrastructure will support the development of new articulated motion and pose estimation algorithms, will provide a baseline for the evaluation and comparison of new methods, and will help establish the current state of the art in human pose estimation and tracking."

Rather than modeling articulation using a family of warped (rotated and foreshortened) templates, we use a mixture of small, nonoriented parts. We describe a general, flexible mixture model that jointly captures spatial relations between part locations and co-occurrence relations between part mixtures, augmenting standard pictorial structure models that encode just spatial relations. Our models have several notable properties: 1) They efficiently model articulation by sharing computation across similar warps, 2) they efficiently model an exponentially large set of global mixtures through composition of local mixtures, and 3) they capture the dependency of global geometry on local appearance (parts look different at different locations). When relations are tree structured, our models can be efficiently optimized with dynamic programming. We learn all parameters, including local appearances, spatial relations, and co-occurrence relations (which encode local rigidity) with a structured SVM solver. Because our model is efficient enough to be used as a detector that searches over scales and image locations, we introduce novel criteria for evaluating pose estimation and human detection, both separately and jointly. We show that currently used evaluation criteria may conflate these two issues. Most previous approaches model limbs with rigid and articulated templates that are trained independently of each other, while we present an extensive diagnostic evaluation that suggests that flexible structure and joint training are crucial for strong performance. We present experimental results on standard benchmarks that suggest our approach is the state-of-the-art system for pose estimation, improving past work on the challenging Parse and Buffy datasets while being orders of magnitude faster."

Whether holistic representations will sustain or will be superseded by higher level video encoding in terms of body pose and motion is the subject of an ongoing debate [12]. In this paper we aim to clarify the underlying factors responsible for good performance of holistic and pose-based representations. To that end we build on our recent dataset [2] leveraging the existing taxonomy of human activities. This dataset includes \\(24,920\\) video snippets covering \\(410\\) human activities in total. Our analysis reveals that holistic and pose-based methods are highly complementary, and their performance varies significantly depending on the activity. We find that holistic methods are mostly affected by the number and speed of trajectories, whereas pose-based methods are mostly influenced by viewpoint of the person. We observe striking performance differences across activities: for certain activities results with pose-based features are more than twice as accurate compared to holistic features, and vice versa. The best performing approach in our comparison is based on the combination of holistic and pose-based approaches, which again underlines their complementarity."

Most previous work in part-based models only considers rigid parts (e.g. torso, head, half limbs) guided by human anatomy. We argue that this representation of parts is not necessarily appropriate for human parsing. In this paper, we introduce hierarchical poselets\u2013a new representation for human parsing. Hierarchical poselets can be rigid parts, but they can also be parts that cover large portions of human bodies (e.g. torso + left arm). In the extreme case, they can be the whole bodies. We develop a structured model to organize poselets in a hierarchical way and learn the model parameters in a max-margin framework. We demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed approach on two datasets with aggressive pose variations."

Our public framework has annotated thousands of real world videos, including massive data sets unprecedented for their size, complexity, and cost. To accomplish this, we designed a state-of-the-art video annotation user interface and demonstrate that, despite common intuition, many contemporary interfaces are sub-optimal. We present several user studies that evaluate different aspects of our system and demonstrate that minimizing the cognitive load of the user is crucial when designing an annotation platform. We then deploy this interface on Amazon Mechanical Turk and discover expert and talented workers who are capable of annotating difficult videos with dense and closely cropped labels. We argue that video annotation requires specialized skill; most workers are poor annotators, mandating robust quality control protocols. We show that traditional crowdsourced micro-tasks are not suitable for video annotation and instead demonstrate that deploying time-consuming macro-tasks on MTurk is effective. Finally, we show that by extracting pixel-based features from manually labeled key frames, we are able to leverage more sophisticated interpolation strategies to maximize performance given a fixed budget. We validate the power of our framework on difficult, real-world data sets and we demonstrate an inherent trade-off between the mix of human and cloud computing used vs. the accuracy and cost of the labeling. We further introduce a novel, cost-based evaluation criteria that compares vision algorithms by the budget required to achieve an acceptable performance. We hope our findings will spur innovation in the creation of massive labeled video data sets and enable novel data-driven computer vision applications."

We review the state-of-the-art in evaluated methods for both classification and detection, analyse whether the methods are statistically different, what they are learning from the images (e.g. the object or its context), and what the methods find easy or confuse.

Our work is motivated by the pictorial structure models introduced by Fischler and Elschlager. The basic idea is to represent an object by a collection of parts arranged in a deformable configuration. The appearance of each part is modeled separately, and the deformable configuration is represented by spring-like connections between pairs of parts. These models allow for qualitative descriptions of visual appearance, and are suitable for generic recognition problems. We address the problem of using pictorial structure models to find instances of an object in an image as well as the problem of learning an object model from training examples, presenting efficient algorithms in both cases. We demonstrate the techniques by learning models that represent faces and human bodies and using the resulting models to locate the corresponding objects in novel images."

                "text": "PURPOSE\nThe Compendium of Physical Activities was developed to enhance the comparability of results across studies using self-report physical activity (PA) and is used to quantify the energy cost of a wide variety of PA. We provide the second update of the Compendium, called the 2011 Compendium.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe 2011 Compendium retains the previous coding scheme to identify the major category headings and specific PA by their rate of energy expenditure in MET. Modifications in the 2011 Compendium include cataloging measured MET values and their source references, when available; addition of new codes and specific activities; an update of the Compendium tracking guide that links information in the 1993, 2000, and 2011 compendia versions; and the creation of a Web site to facilitate easy access and downloading of Compendium documents. Measured MET values were obtained from a systematic search of databases using defined key words.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe 2011 Compendium contains 821 codes for specific activities. Two hundred seventeen new codes were added, 68% (561/821) of which have measured MET values. Approximately half (317/604) of the codes from the 2000 Compendium were modified to improve the definitions and/or to consolidate specific activities and to update estimated MET values where measured values did not exist. Updated MET values accounted for 73% of all code changes.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe Compendium is used globally to quantify the energy cost of PA in adults for surveillance activities, research studies, and, in clinical settings, to write PA recommendations and to assess energy expenditure in individuals. The 2011 Compendium is an update of a system for quantifying the energy cost of adult human PA and is a living document that is moving in the direction of being 100% evidence based."
