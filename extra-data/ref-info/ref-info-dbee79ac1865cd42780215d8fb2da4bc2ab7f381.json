Results indicate that it is possible to obtain around 50% reduction of perplexity by using mixture of several RNN LMs, compared to a state of the art backoff language model. Speech recognition experiments show around 18% reduction of word error rate on the Wall Street Journal task when comparing models trained on the same amount of data, and around 5% on the much harder NIST RT05 task, even when the backoff model is trained on much more data than the RNN LM. We provide ample empirical evidence to suggest that connectionist language models are superior to standard n-gram techniques, except their high computational (training) complexity.

Our findings suggest that DBNs outperform single layer MLPs under the clean condition, but the gains diminish as the noise level is increased. Furthermore, using MFCCs in conjunction with the posteriors from DBNs outperforms merely using single DBNs in low to moderate noise conditions.

Fortunately, recent advances in Hessian-free optimization have been able to overcome the difficulties associated with training RNNs, making it possible to apply them successfully to challenging sequence problems. In this paper we demonstrate the power of RNNs trained with the new Hessian-Free optimizer (HF) by applying them to character-level language modeling tasks. The standard RNN architecture, while effective, is not ideally suited for such tasks, so we introduce a new RNN variant that uses multiplicative (or \"gated\") connections which allow the current input character to determine the transition matrix from one hidden state vector to the next. After training the multiplicative RNN with the HF optimizer for five days on 8 high-end Graphics Processing Units, we were able to surpass the performance of the best previous single method for character-level language modeling \u2013 a hierarchical non-parametric sequence model. To our knowledge this represents the largest recurrent neural network application to date."

In the original DBNs, only framelevel information was used for training DBN weights while it has been known for long that sequential or full-sequence information can be helpful in improving speech recognition accuracy. In this paper we investigate approaches to optimizing the DBN weights, state-to-state transition parameters, and language model scores using the sequential discriminative training criterion. We describe and analyze the proposed training algorithm and strategy, and discuss practical issues and how they affect the final results. We show that the DBNs learned using the sequence-based training criterion outperform those with frame-based criterion using both threelayer and six-layer models, but the optimization procedure for the deeper DBN is more difficult for the former criterion."

We describe a pre-trained deep neural network hidden Markov model (DNN-HMM) hybrid architecture that trains the DNN to produce a distribution over senones (tied triphone states) as its output. The deep belief network pre-training algorithm is a robust and often helpful way to initialize deep neural networks generatively that can aid in optimization and reduce generalization error. We illustrate the key components of our model, describe the procedure for applying CD-DNN-HMMs to LVSR, and analyze the effects of various modeling choices on performance. Experiments on a challenging business search dataset demonstrate that CD-DNN-HMMs can significantly outperform the conventional context-dependent Gaussian mixture model (GMM)-HMMs, with an absolute sentence accuracy improvement of 5.8% and 9.2% (or relative error reduction of 16.0% and 23.2%) over the CD-GMM-HMMs trained using the minimum phone error rate (MPE) and maximum-likelihood (ML) criteria, respectively."

However, practical difficulties have been reported in training recurrent neural networks to perform tasks in which the temporal contingencies present in the input/output sequences span long intervals. We show why gradient based learning algorithms face an increasingly difficult problem as the duration of the dependencies to be captured increases. These results expose a trade-off between efficient learning by gradient descent and latching on information for long periods. Based on an understanding of this problem, alternatives to standard gradient descent are considered."

By contrast, hybrid connectionist-HMM systems use discriminatively-trained neural networks to estimate the probability distribution among subword units given the acoustic observations. In this work we show a large improvement in word recognition performance by combining neural-net discriminative feature processing with Gaussian-mixture distribution modeling. By training the network to generate the subword probability posteriors, then using transformations of these estimates as the base features for a conventionally-trained Gaussian-mixture based system, we achieve relative error rate reductions of 35% or more on the multicondition Aurora noisy continuous digits task."

Searching the parameter space of deep architectures is a difficult optimization task, but learning algorithms such as those for Deep Belief Networks have recently been proposed to tackle this problem with notable success, beating the state-of-the-art in certain areas.

These improvements are applied to phone recognition from the TIMIT task and word recognition from the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) task. A recurrent net is used to map acoustic vectors to posterior probabilities of phone classes. The maximum likelihood phone or word string is then extracted using Markov models. The paper describes three improvements: connectionist model merging; explicit presentation of acoustic context; and improved duration modelling. The first is shown to provide a significant improvement in the TIMIT phone recognition rate and all three provide an improvement in the WSJ word recognition rate.<<ETX>>"

The top layer of the generative model learns binary codes that can be used for efficient compression of speech and could also be used for scalable speech recognition or rapid speech content retrieval. Each layer of the generative model is fully connected to the layer below and the weights on these connections are pretrained efficiently by using the contrastive divergence approximation to the log likelihood gradient. After layer-bylayer pre-training we \u201cunroll\u201d the generative model to form a deep auto-encoder, whose parameters are then fine-tuned using back-propagation. To reconstruct the full-length speech spectrogram, individual spectrogram segments predicted by their respective binary codes are combined using an overlapand-add method. Experimental results on speech spectrogram coding demonstrate that the binary codes produce a logspectral distortion that is approximately 2 dB lower than a subband vector quantization technique over the entire frequency range of wide-band speech.

We show that after a non-linear transformation, a number of features can be effectively used in a HMM-based recognition system. The non-linear transformation is computed using a neural network which is discriminatively trained on the phonetically labeled (forcibly aligned) training data. A combination of the non-linearly transformed PLP (perceptive linear predictive coefficients), MSG (modulation filtered spectrogram) and TRAP (temporal pattern) features yields a 63% improvement in error rate as compared to baseline me frequency cepstral coefficients features. The use of the non-linearly transformed RASTA-like features, with system parameters scaled down to take into account the ETSI imposed memory and latency constraints, still yields a 40% improvement in error rate."

Using complementary priors, we derive a fast, greedy algorithm that can learn deep, directed belief networks one layer at a time, provided the top two layers form an undirected associative memory. The fast, greedy algorithm is used to initialize a slower learning procedure that fine-tunes the weights using a contrastive version of the wake-sleep algorithm. After fine-tuning, a network with three hidden layers forms a very good generative model of the joint distribution of handwritten digit images and their labels. This generative model gives better digit classification than the best discriminative learning algorithms. The low-dimensional manifolds on which the digits lie are modeled by long ravines in the free-energy landscape of the top-level associative memory, and it is easy to explore these ravines by using the directed connections to display what the associative memory has in mind."

In our method, we construct on each iteration a Krylov subspace formed by the gradient and an approximation to the Hessian matrix, and then use a subset of the training data samples to optimize over this subspace. As with the Hessian Free (HF) method of Martens (2010), the Hessian matrix is never explicitly constructed, and is computed using a subset of data. In practice, as in HF, we typically use a positive definite substitute for the Hessian matrix such as the Gauss-Newton matrix. We investigate the effectiveness of our proposed method on deep neural networks, and compare its performance to widely used methods such as stochastic gradient descent, conjugate gradient descent and L-BFGS, and also to HF. Our method leads to faster convergence than either L-BFGS or HF, and generally performs better than either of them in cross-validation accuracy. It is also simpler and more general than HF, as it does not require a positive semidefinite approximation of the Hessian matrix to work well nor the setting of a damping parameter. The chief drawback versus HF is the need for memory to store a basis for the Krylov subspace."

The database may either be used for the evaluation of front-end feature extraction algorithms using a defined HMM recognition back-end or complete recognition systems. The source speech for this database is the TIdigits, consisting of connected digits task spoken by American English talkers (downsampled to 8kHz) . A selection of 8 different real-world noises have been added to the speech over a range of signal to noise ratios and special care has been taken to control the filtering of both the speech and noise. The framework was prepared as a contribution to the ETSI STQ-AURORA DSR Working Group [1]. Aurora is developing standards for Distributed Speech Recognition (DSR) where the speech analysis is done in the telecommunication terminal and the recognition at a central location in the telecom network. The framework is currently being used to evaluate alternative proposals for front-end feature extraction. The database has been made publicly available through ELRA so that other speech researchers can evaluate and compare the performance of noise robust algorithms. Recognition results are presented for the first standard DSR feature extraction scheme that is based on a cepstral analysis."
