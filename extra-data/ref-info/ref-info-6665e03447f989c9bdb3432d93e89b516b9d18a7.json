The goal of this paper is to study the degree to which \\separate and conquer\" rule learning induction methods scale up to large, real-world learning problems. In particular, we study the asymptotic complexity of rule induction on large training sets in the presence of noise. We present formal arguments and experimental data supporting the claim that existing methods do not scale up well on noisy data. We then present a solution in the form of new pruning techniques that dramatically improve the runtime of rule induction methods with no loss in accuracy: formal analysis shows an improvement in asymp-totic time complexity, and experiments show an order-of-magnitude speedup on a set of benchmark problems while obtaining slightly more accurate hypotheses."

A new heuristic technique for finding a covering rule set of sample data is described. This technique refines a set of production rules by iteratively replacing a component of a rule with its single best replacement. A method for rule induction has been developed that combines this covering and refinement scheme with other techniques known to help reduce the complexity of rule sets, such as weakest-link pruning, resampling, and the judicious use of linear discriminants. Published results on several real-world datasets are reviewed where decision trees have performed relatively poorly. It is shown that far simpler decision rules can be found with predictive performance that exceeds those previously reported for various learning models, including neural nets and decision trees."

Existing inductive systems create definitions that are ideal with regard to large disjuncts, but far from ideal with regard to small disjuncts, where a small (large) disjunct is one that correctly classifies few (many) training examples. The problem with small disjuncts is that many of them have high rates of misclassification, and it is difficult to eliminate the errorprone small disjuncts from a definition without adversely affecting other disjuncts in the definition. Various approaches to this problem are evaluated, including the novel approach of using a bias different than the \"maximum generality\" bias. This approach, and some others, prove partly successful, but the problem of small disjuncts remains open."

In fact, there is no statistical basis for believing it will have this effect. Overfitting avoidance is simply a form of bias and, as such, its effect on expected accuracy depends, not on statistics, but on the degree to which this bias is appropriate to a problem-generating domain. This paper identifies one important factor that affects the degree to which the bias of overfitting avoidance is appropriate--the abundance of training data relative to the complexity of the relationship to be induced--and shows empirically how it determines whether such methods as pessimistic and cross-validated cost-complexity pruning will increase or decrease predictive accuracy in decision tree induction. The effect of sparse data is illustrated first in an artificial domain and then in more realistic examples drawn from the UCI machine learning database repository."

Although the decision trees generated by these methods are accurate and efficient, they often suffer the disadvantage of excessive complexity and are therefore incomprehensible to experts. It is questionable whether opaque structures of this kind can be described as knowledge, no matter how well they function. This paper discusses techniques for simplifying decision trees while retaining their accuracy. Four methods are described, illustrated, and compared on a test-bed of decision trees from a variety of domains."
