We describe several algorithms used to recognize phonemes using context-dependent Hidden Markov Models of the phonemes. We present results for several variations of the parameters of the algorithms. In addition, we propose a technique that makes it possible to integrate traditional acoustic-phonetic features into a hidden Markov process. The categorical decisions usually associated with heuristic acoustic-phonetic algorithms are replaced by automated training techniques and global search strategies. The combination of general spectral information and specific acoustic-phonetic features is shown to result in more accurate phonetic recognition than either representation by itself."

The resulting recognizer was tested on a vocabulary of the ten digits across a wide range of talkers and test conditions and shown to have an error rate comparable to that of the best template recognizers and significantly lower than that of the discrete symbol hidden Markov model system. We discuss several issues involved in the training of the continuous density models and in the implementation of the recognizer."

This technique is shown to be highly effective in speaker-independent speech recognition. Spoken utterances are represented by time sequences of cepstrum coefficients and energy. Regression coefficients for these time functions are extracted for every frame over an approximately 50 ms period. Time functions of regression coefficients extracted for cepstrum and energy are combined with time functions of the original cepstrum coefficients, and used with a staggered array DP matching algorithm to compare multiple templates and input speech. Speaker-independent isolated word recognition experiments using a vocabulary of 100 Japanese city names indicate that a recognition error rate of 2.4 percent can be obtained with this method. Using only the original cepstrum coefficients the error rate is 6.2 percent."

We show that we can effectively increase the codebook size by dividing the feature vector into two vectors of lower dimensionality, and then quantizing and training each vector separately. For a small codebook size, integration of the results of the two parameter vectors provides significant improvement in recognition performance as compared to the quantizing and training of the entire feature set together. Even for a codebook size as small as 64, the results obtained when using the new quantization procedure are quite close to those obtained when using Gaussian distribution of the parameter vectors."

This problem is to design a speech-recognition system which can extract from the speech waveform as much information as possible about the corresponding word sequence. The information extraction process is broken down into two steps: a signal processing step which converts a speech waveform into a sequence of information bearing acoustic feature vectors, and a step which models such a sequence. This thesis is primarily concerned with the use of hidden Markov models to model sequences of feature vectors which lie in a continuous space such as R sub N. It explores the trade-off between packing a lot of information into such sequences and being able to model them accurately. The difficulty of developing accurate models of continuous parameter sequences is addressed by investigating a method of parameter estimation which is specifically designed to cope with inaccurate modeling assumptions."

In this paper, speaker adaptation algorithms through VQ are proposed in order to improve speaker-independent recognition. The speaker adaptation algorithms use VQ codebooks of a reference speaker and an input speaker. Speaker adaptation is performed by substituting vectors in the codebook of a reference speaker for vectors of the input speaker's codebook, or vice versa. To confirm the effectiveness of these algorithms, word recognition experiments are carried out using the IBM office correspondence task uttered by 11 speakers. The total number of words is 1174 for each speaker, and the number of different words is 422. The average word recognition rate using different speaker's reference through speaker adaptation is 80.9%, and the rate within the second choice is 92.0%."

The system, designed for large vocabulary applications, integrates acoustic, phonetic, lexical, and linguistic knowledge sources to achieve high recognition performance. The basic approach, as described in previous papers [1, 2], makes extensive use of robust context-dependent models of phonetic coarticulation using Hidden Markov Models (HMM). We describe the components of the BYBLOS system, including: signal processing frontend, dictionary, phonetic model training system, word model generator, grammar and decoder. In recognition experiments, we demonstrate consistently high word recognition performance on continuous speech across: speakers, task domains, and grammars of varying complexity. In speaker-dependent mode, where 15 minutes of speech is required for training to a speaker, 98.5% word accuracy has been achieved in continuous speech for a 350-word task, using grammars with perplexity ranging from 30 to 60. With only 15 seconds of training speech we demonstrate performance of 97% using a grammar."

The goal is to investigate how the framework of multilayer perceptrons can be exploited in speech recognition when the are augmented with acoustic-phonetic knowledge. Major issues as the choice of the error metric, the use of contextual information, and determination of the training procedure are investigated within a set of experiments that attempt to recognize the 16 vowels in American English. The results, based on some 10000 vowel tokens excised from 1000 sentences spoken by 200 speakers, indicate that a top-choice accuracy of 54% and 67% can be achieved for the context-independent and -dependent networks, respectively.<<ETX>>"

The system has recently been enhanced by expanding the vocabulary from 5,000 words to 20,000 words and by the addition of a speech workstation to support usability studies on document creation by voice. The system supports spelling and interactive personalization to augment the vocabularies. This paper describes the implementation, user interface, and comparative performance of the recognizer."

Two sentences were constant for all speakers; the remaining eight sentences were selected from a set of 450 designed at MIT and 1890 selected at TI from text sources. The set of sentences is phonetically rich, balanced, and deep. Although all recordings were made in Dallas, we sampled as many varieties of American English as possible. Selection of volunteer speakers was based on their childhood locality to give a balanced representation of geographical origins. The subject population is adult; 70% male; young (63% in their twenties); well educated (78% with bachelor's degree); and predominantly white (96%). Recordings were made in a noise\u2010reducing sound booth using a Sennheiser headset microphone and digitized at 20 kHz. A natural reading style was encouraged. The recordings are complete, and time\u2010registered phonetic transcriptions are being added to the 6300 speech files at ..."

Most of the results obtained are not due to general problem solving techniques but to the use of specific, domain-dependent knowledge. Formalizing and incorporating specific knowledge into a system makes it possible to reach the level of expertise comparable to that of a human expert in some specialized field. Such knowledge-based and expert systems have been extensively used in various domains like chemistry, medicine, geology, etc. The basic idea in these systems is to clearly distinguish between the knowledge base which usually incorporates rules and meta-rules about the domain of expertise and the control structures which manipulate this knowledge. That ensures great modularity and flexibility and makes it easy to modify and update a system [11]."
