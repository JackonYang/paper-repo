In this paper, we propose a novel method for table detection in PDF documents based on convolutional neutral networks, one of the most popular deep learning models. In the proposed method, some table-like areas are selected first by some loose rules, and then the convolutional networks are built and refined to determine whether the selected areas are tables or not. Besides, the visual features of table areas are directly extracted and utilized through the convolutional networks, while the non-visual information (e.g. characters, rendering instructions) contained in original PDF documents is also taken into consideration to help achieve better recognition results. The primary experimental results show that the approach is effective in table detection."

It is a hard problem due to varying layouts and encodings of the tables. Researchers have proposed numerous techniques for table detection based on layout analysis of documents. Most of these techniques fail to generalize because they rely on hand engineered features which are not robust to layout variations. In this paper, we have presented a deep learning based method for table detection. In the proposed method, document images are first pre-processed. These images are then fed to a Region Proposal Network followed by a fully connected neural network for table detection. The proposed method works with high precision on document images with varying layouts that include documents, research papers, and magazines. We have done our evaluations on publicly available UNLV dataset where it beats Tesseract's state of the art table detection system by a significant margin."

We present a page segmentation algorithm that incorporates state-of-the-art deep learning methods for segmenting three types of document elements: text blocks, tables, and figures. We propose a multi-scale, multi-task fully convolutional neural network (FCN) for the tasks of semantic page segmentation and element contour detection. The semantic segmentation network accurately predicts the probability at each pixel of the three element classes. The contour detection network accurately predicts instance level \"edges\" around each element occurrence. We propose a conditional random field (CRF) that uses features output from the semantic segmentation and contour networks to improve upon the semantic segmentation network output. Given the semantic segmentation output, we also extract individual table instances from the page using some heuristic rules and a verification network to remove false positives. We show that although we only consider a page image as input, we produce comparable results with other methods that relies on PDF file information and heuristics and hand crafted features tailored to specific types of documents. Our approach learns the representative features for page segmentation from real and synthetic training data. %, and produces good results on real documents. The learning-based property makes it a more general method than existing methods in terms of document types and element appearances. For example, our method reliably detects sparsely lined tables which are hard for rule-based or heuristic methods."

                "text": "Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) have recently been applied successfully to a variety of vision and multimedia tasks, thus driving development of novel solutions in several application domains. Document analysis is a particularly promising area for DCNNs: indeed, the number of available digital documents has reached unprecedented levels, and humans are no longer able to discover and retrieve all the information contained in these documents without the help of automation. Under this scenario, DCNNs offers a viable solution to automate the information extraction process from digital documents. Within the realm of information extraction from documents, detection of tables and charts is particularly needed as they contain a visual summary of the most valuable information contained in a document. For a complete automation of visual information extraction process from tables and charts, it is necessary to develop techniques that localize them and identify precisely their boundaries. In this paper we aim at solving the table/chart detection task through an approach that combines deep convolutional neural networks, graphical models and saliency concepts. In particular, we propose a saliency-based fully-convolutional neural network performing multi-scale reasoning on visual cues followed by a fully-connected conditional random field (CRF) for localizing tables and charts in digital/digitized documents. Performance analysis carried out on an extended version of ICDAR 2013 (with annotated charts as well as tables) shows that our approach yields promising results, outperforming existing models."

                "text": "This paper presents a novel end-to-end system for table understanding in document images called DeepDeSRT. In particular, the contribution of DeepDeSRT is two-fold. First, it presents a deep learning-based solution for table detection in document images. Secondly, it proposes a novel deep learning-based approach for table structure recognition, i.e. identifying rows, columns, and cell positions in the detected tables. In contrast to existing rule-based methods, which rely on heuristics or additional PDF metadata (like, for example, print instructions, character bounding boxes, or line segments), the presented system is data-driven and does not need any heuristics or metadata to detect as well as to recognize tabular structures in document images. Furthermore, in contrast to most existing table detection and structure recognition methods, which are applicable only to PDFs, DeepDeSRT processes document images, which makes it equally suitable for born-digital PDFs (as they can automatically be converted into images) as well as even harder problems, e.g. scanned documents. To gauge the performance of DeepDeSRT, the system is evaluated on the publicly available ICDAR 2013 table competition dataset containing 67 documents with 238 pages overall. Evaluation results reveal that DeepDeSRT outperforms state-of-the-art methods for table detection and structure recognition and achieves F1-measures of 96.77% and 91.44% for table detection and structure recognition, respectively. Additionally, DeepDeSRT is evaluated on a closed dataset from a real use case of a major European aviation company comprising documents which are highly unlike those in ICDAR 2013. Tested on a randomly selected sample from this dataset, DeepDeSRT achieves high detection accuracy for tables which demonstrates the sound generalization capabilities of our system."

It is a difficult problem due to the variety of table layouts, encoding techniques and the similarity of tabular regions with non-tabular document elements. Earlier approaches of table detection are based on heuristic rules or require additional PDF metadata. Recently proposed methods based on machine learning have shown good results. This paper demonstrates performance improvement to these table detection techniques. The proposed solution is based on the observation that tables tend to contain more numeric data and hence it applies color coding/coloration as a signal for telling apart numeric and textual data. Deep learning based Faster R-CNN is used for detection of tabular regions from document images. To gauge the performance of our proposed solution, publicly available UNLV dataset is used. Performance measures indicate improvement when compared with best in-class strategies."

Usually, modern OCR systems provide textual information coming from tables without recognizing actual table structure. However, recognition of table structure is important to get the contextual meaning of the contents. Table structure recognition in heterogeneous documents is challenging due to a variety of table layouts. It becomes harder where no physical rulings are present in a table. This work proposes a novel learning based methodology for the recognition of table contents in heterogeneous document images. Textual contents of documents are classified as table or non-table elements using a pre-trained neural network model. The output of the neural network is further enhanced by applying a contextual post processing on each element to correct the classifications errors if any. The system is trained using a subset of UNLV and UW3 document images and depicted more than 97% accuracy on a test set in detection of table and non-table elements."

In this work, we study feature learning techniques for graph-structured inputs. Our starting point is previous work on Graph Neural Networks (Scarselli et al., 2009), which we modify to use gated recurrent units and modern optimization techniques and then extend to output sequences. The result is a flexible and broadly useful class of neural network models that has favorable inductive biases relative to purely sequence-based models (e.g., LSTMs) when the problem is graph-structured. We demonstrate the capabilities on some simple AI (bAbI) and graph algorithm learning tasks. We then show it achieves state-of-the-art performance on a problem from program verification, in which subgraphs need to be matched to abstract data structures."

In this paper we describe a general solution to the problem of recognizing the structure of a detected table region. First hierarchial clustering is used to identify columns and then spatial and lexical criteria to classify headers. We also address the problem of evaluating table structure recognition. Our model is based on a directed acyclic attribute graph, or table DAG. We describe a new paradigm, 'random graph probing,' for comparing the results returned by the recognition system and the representation created during ground-truthing. Probing is in fact a general concept that could be applied to other document recognition tasks and perhaps even other computer vision problems as well."

We present a formulation of CNNs in the context of spectral graph theory, which provides the necessary mathematical background and efficient numerical schemes to design fast localized convolutional filters on graphs. Importantly, the proposed technique offers the same linear computational complexity and constant learning complexity as classical CNNs, while being universal to any graph structure. Experiments on MNIST and 20NEWS demonstrate the ability of this novel deep learning system to learn local, stationary, and compositional features on graphs."

In this paper, we propose a new neural network model, called graph neural network (GNN) model, that extends existing neural network methods for processing the data represented in graph domains. This GNN model, which can directly process most of the practically useful types of graphs, e.g., acyclic, cyclic, directed, and undirected, implements a function tau(G,n) isin IRm that maps a graph G and one of its nodes n into an m-dimensional Euclidean space. A supervised learning algorithm is derived to estimate the parameters of the proposed GNN model. The computational cost of the proposed algorithm is also considered. Some experimental results are shown to validate the proposed learning algorithm, and to demonstrate its generalization capabilities."

Conventional approaches for table detection rely on heuristics that are error prone and specific to a dataset. In contrast, the presented approach harvests the potential of data to recognize tables of arbitrary layout. Most of the prior approaches for table detection are only applicable to PDFs, whereas, the presented approach directly works on images making it generally applicable to any format. The presented approach is based on a novel combination of deformable CNN with faster R-CNN/FPN. Conventional CNN has a fixed receptive field which is problematic for table detection since tables can be present at arbitrary scales along with arbitrary transformations (orientation). Deformable convolution conditions its receptive field on the input itself allowing it to mold its receptive field according to its input. This adaptation of the receptive field enables the network to cater for tables of arbitrary layout. We evaluated the proposed approach on two major publicly available table detection datasets: ICDAR-2013 and ICDAR-2017 POD. The presented approach was able to surpass the state-of-the-art performance on both ICDAR-2013 and ICDAR-2017 POD datasets with a F-measure of 0.994 and 0.968, respectively, indicating its effectiveness and superiority for the task of table detection."

We present a unified methodology that is applicable to construction of document structures at different hierarchical levels. An iterative, relaxation-like method is used to find a partitioning solution that maximizes the probability of the extracted structure. All the probabilities used in the partitioning process are estimated from an extensive training set of various kinds of measurements among the entities within the hierarchy. The offline probabilities estimated in the training then drive all decisions in the online document structure extraction. We have implemented a text line extraction algorithm using this framework."

                "text": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has undergone a renaissance recently, making major progress in key domains such as vision, language, control, and decision-making. This has been due, in part, to cheap data and cheap compute resources, which have fit the natural strengths of deep learning. However, many defining characteristics of human intelligence, which developed under much different pressures, remain out of reach for current approaches. In particular, generalizing beyond one's experiences--a hallmark of human intelligence from infancy--remains a formidable challenge for modern AI. \nThe following is part position paper, part review, and part unification. We argue that combinatorial generalization must be a top priority for AI to achieve human-like abilities, and that structured representations and computations are key to realizing this objective. Just as biology uses nature and nurture cooperatively, we reject the false choice between \"hand-engineering\" and \"end-to-end\" learning, and instead advocate for an approach which benefits from their complementary strengths. We explore how using relational inductive biases within deep learning architectures can facilitate learning about entities, relations, and rules for composing them. We present a new building block for the AI toolkit with a strong relational inductive bias--the graph network--which generalizes and extends various approaches for neural networks that operate on graphs, and provides a straightforward interface for manipulating structured knowledge and producing structured behaviors. We discuss how graph networks can support relational reasoning and combinatorial generalization, laying the foundation for more sophisticated, interpretable, and flexible patterns of reasoning. As a companion to this paper, we have released an open-source software library for building graph networks, with demonstrations of how to use them in practice."

Today, quite a large number of different approaches facing these tasks have been described in literature or are available as part of commercial OCR systems that claim to deal with tables on the scanned documents and to treat them accordingly.\n However, the problem of detecting tables is not yet solved at all. Different approaches have different strengths and weak points. Some fail in certain situations or layouts where others perform better. How shall one know, which approach or system is the best for his specific job? The answer to this question raises the demand for an objective comparison of different approaches which address the same task of spotting tables and recognizing their structure.\n This paper describes our approach towards establishing a complete and publicly available, hence open environment for the benchmarking of table spotting and structural analysis. We provide free access to the ground truthing tool and evaluation mechanism described in this paper, describe the ideas behind and we also provide ground truth for the 547 documents of the UNLV and UW-3 datasets that contain tables.\n In addition, we applied the quality measures to the results that were generated by the T-Recs system which we developed some years ago and which we started to further advance since a few months."

We analyze and make explicit the model properties needed for such regularities to emerge in word vectors. The result is a new global logbilinear regression model that combines the advantages of the two major model families in the literature: global matrix factorization and local context window methods. Our model efficiently leverages statistical information by training only on the nonzero elements in a word-word cooccurrence matrix, rather than on the entire sparse matrix or on individual context windows in a large corpus. The model produces a vector space with meaningful substructure, as evidenced by its performance of 75% on a recent word analogy task. It also outperforms related models on similarity tasks and named entity recognition."

This paper describes a general solution for detecting tables based on computing an optimal partitioning of a document into some number of tables. A dynamic programming algorithm is given to solve the resulting optimization problem. This high-level framework is independent of any particular table quality measure and independent of the document medium. Moreover, it does not rely on the presence of ruling lines or other table delimiters. We also present table quality measures based on white space correlation and vertical connected component analysis. These measures can be applied equally well to ASCII text and scanned images. We report on some preliminary experiments using this method to detect tables in both ASCII text and scanned images, yielding promising results. We present detailed evaluation of these results using three different criteria which by themselves pose interesting research questions."

Despite the abundance of these techniques, an objective comparison of their performance is still missing. The Table Competition held in the context of ICDAR 2013 is our first attempt at objectively evaluating these techniques against each other in a standardized way, across several input formats. The competition independently addresses three problems: (i) table location, (ii) table structure recognition, and (iii) these two tasks combined. We received results from seven academic systems, which we have also compared against four commercial products. This paper presents our findings."

The discussed recognition process differs significantly from existing approaches as it realizes a bottom-up clustering of given word segments, whereas conventional table structure recognizers all rely on the detection of some separators such as delineation or significant white space to analyze a page from the top-down. The following analysis of the recognized layout elements is based on the construction of a tile structure and detects row- and/or column spanning cells as well as sparse tables with a high degree of confidence. \n \nThe overall system is completely domain independent, optionally neglects textual contents and can thus be applied to arbitrary mixed-mode documents (with or without tables) of any language and even operates on low quality OCR documents (e.g. facsimiles)."

                "text": "Point clouds provide a flexible geometric representation suitable for countless applications in computer graphics; they also comprise the raw output of most 3D data acquisition devices. While hand-designed features on point clouds have long been proposed in graphics and vision, however, the recent overwhelming success of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image analysis suggests the value of adapting insight from CNN to the point cloud world. Point clouds inherently lack topological information, so designing a model to recover topology can enrich the representation power of point clouds. To this end, we propose a new neural network module dubbed EdgeConv suitable for CNN-based high-level tasks on point clouds, including classification and segmentation. EdgeConv acts on graphs dynamically computed in each layer of the network. It is differentiable and can be plugged into existing architectures. Compared to existing modules operating in extrinsic space or treating each point independently, EdgeConv has several appealing properties: It incorporates local neighborhood information; it can be stacked applied to learn global shape properties; and in multi-layer systems affinity in feature space captures semantic characteristics over potentially long distances in the original embedding. We show the performance of our model on standard benchmarks, including ModelNet40, ShapeNetPart, and S3DIS."

Although much work has been conducted in the domain of machine-print including books, scientific papers, etc., little has been done to address the case of handwritten inputs. In this paper, we study table detection in scanned handwritten documents subject to challenging artifacts and noise. First, we separate text components (machine-print, handwriting) from the rest of the page using an SVM classifier. We then employ a correlation-based approach to measure the coherence between adjacent text lines which may be part of the same table, solving the resulting page decomposition problem using dynamic programming. A report of preliminary results from ongoing experiments concludes the paper."

Existing approaches for table detection mainly focus on detecting tables in single columns of text and do not work reliably on documents with varying layouts. This paper presents a practical algorithm for table detection that works with a high accuracy on documents with varying layouts (company reports, newspaper articles, magazine pages, ...). An open source implementation of the algorithm is provided as part of the Tesseract OCR engine. Evaluation of the algorithm on document images from publicly available UNLV dataset shows competitive performance in comparison to the table detection module of a commercial OCR system."

Their ease of use and abundant functionalities equip novices and professionals alike with the means to generate, transform, analyze, and visualize data. As a result, spreadsheets are a great resource of factual and structured information. This accentuates the need to automatically understand and extract their contents. In this paper, we present a novel approach for recognizing tables in spreadsheets. Having inferred the layout role of the individual cells, we build layout regions. We encode the spatial interrelations between these regions using a graph representation. Based on this, we propose Remove and Conquer (RAC), an algorithm for table recognition that implements a list of carefully curated rules. An extensive experimental evaluation shows that our approach is viable. We achieve significant accuracy in a dataset of real spreadsheets from various domains."

In this work, we introduce two new modules to enhance the transformation modeling capability of CNNs, namely, deformable convolution and deformable RoI pooling. Both are based on the idea of augmenting the spatial sampling locations in the modules with additional offsets and learning the offsets from the target tasks, without additional supervision. The new modules can readily replace their plain counterparts in existing CNNs and can be easily trained end-to-end by standard back-propagation, giving rise to deformable convolutional networks. Extensive experiments validate the performance of our approach. For the first time, we show that learning dense spatial transformation in deep CNNs is effective for sophisticated vision tasks such as object detection and semantic segmentation. The code is released at https://github.com/msracver/Deformable-ConvNets."

Fast R-CNN trains the very deep VGG16 network 9x faster than R-CNN, is 213x faster at test-time, and achieves a higher mAP on PASCAL VOC 2012. Compared to SPPnet, Fast R-CNN trains VGG16 3x faster, tests 10x faster, and is more accurate.

Lines and tables are among the most frequent graphic, non-textual entities in documents and their detection is directly related to the OCR performance as well as to the document layout description. We propose a workflow for table detection that comprises three distinct steps: (i) image pre-processing; (ii) horizontal and vertical line detection and (iii) table detection. The efficiency of the proposed method is demonstrated by using a performance evaluation scheme which considers a great variety of documents such as forms, newspapers/magazines, scientific journals, tickets/bank cheques, certificates and handwritten documents."

Luckily, several promising and closely related neural network models invariant to molecular symmetries have already been described in the literature. These models learn a message passing algorithm and aggregation procedure to compute a function of their entire input graph. At this point, the next step is to find a particularly effective variant of this general approach and apply it to chemical prediction benchmarks until we either solve them or reach the limits of the approach. In this paper, we reformulate existing models into a single common framework we call Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) and explore additional novel variations within this framework. Using MPNNs we demonstrate state of the art results on an important molecular property prediction benchmark; these results are strong enough that we believe future work should focus on datasets with larger molecules or more accurate ground truth labels."

Thanks to their representation-learning capabilities, graph networks can exploit the full detector granularity, while natively managing the event sparsity and arbitrarily complex detector geometries. We introduce two distance-weighted graph network architectures, dubbed GarNet and GravNet layers, and apply them to a typical particle reconstruction task. The performance of the new architectures is evaluated on a data set of simulated particle interactions on a toy model of a highly granular calorimeter, loosely inspired by the endcap calorimeter to be installed in the CMS detector for the High-Luminosity LHC phase. We study the clustering of energy depositions, which is the basis for calorimetric particle reconstruction, and provide a quantitative comparison to alternative approaches. The proposed algorithms provide an interesting alternative to existing methods, offering equally performing or less resource-demanding solutions with less underlying assumptions on the detector geometry and, consequently, the possibility to generalize to other detectors."

While most research in the area of table analysis and recognition has focused on analyzing the raster image, our approach builds upon the advances in optical character recognition (OCR) software to preserve the layout of tabular data by means of white space. By using methods to analyze the geometry, syntax, and the semantics of the character data, as well as utilizing some well-known image processing techniques, we are able to 1) isolate embedded tables from documents, and 2) identify table components uch as title blocks, table entries, and footer blocks. Furthermore, the table analysis techniques presented in this paper can also be applied when analyzing blocks of text isolated by traditional methods such as connected component analysis[1] or bounding box [2]."

Techniques to enable aural presentation and navigation of tables have been proposed, but they assume a thorough knowledge of the structure of the table; on the other hand, boundaries and structure of tables in a spreadsheet are not evident without a visual exploration. This paper presents an algorithm for table recognition in spreadsheets. The algorithm uses three types of cells as its basis: title cell, header cell, and data cell. Different attributes of the cells are used to identify the cell type within a spreadsheet. Hierarchical clustering is used to aggregate cells to compose the functional components of a table. The algorithm has been evaluated on a diverse set of benchmarks with very encouraging results."

A recent paper [1] describes a number of techniques to find maximal complete subgraphs of a given undirected graph. In this paper, we present two backtracking algorithms, using a branchand-bound technique [4] to cut off branches that cannot lead to a clique. The first version is a straightforward implementation of the basic algorithm. It is mainly presented to illustrate the method used. This version generates cliques in alphabetic (lexicographic) order. The second version is derived from the first and generates cliques in a rather unpredictable order in an attempt to minimize the number of branches to be traversed. This version tends to produce the larger cliques first and to generate sequentially cliques having a large common intersection. The detailed algorithm for version 2 is presented here. Description o f the algorithm--Version 1. Three sets play an important role in the algorithm. (1) The set compsub is the set to be extended by a new point or shrunk by one point on traveling along a branch of the backtracking tree. The points that are eligible to extend compsub, i.e. that are connected to all points in compsub, are collected recursively in the remaining two sets. (2) The set candidates is the set of all points that will in due time serve as an extension to the present configuration of compsub. (3) The set not is the set of all points that have at an earlier stage already served as an extension of the present configuration of compsub and are now explicitly excluded. The reason for maintaining this set trot will soon be made clear. The core of the algorithm consists of a recursively defined extension operator that will be applied to the three sets Just described. It has the duty to generate all extensions of the given configuration of compsub that it can make with the given set of candidates and that do not contain any of the points in not. To put it differently: all extensions of compsub containing any point in not have already been generated. The basic mechanism now consists of the following five steps:"

A generic model is designed to support the different stages of tabular composition, including the editing of logical structure, the specification of layout structure, and the formatting of concrete tables. The model separates table's logical structure from its layout structure, which consists of tabular topology and typographic style. The notion of an abstract table, which describes the logical relationships among tabular items, is formally defined and a set of logical operations is proposed to manipulate tables based on these logical relationships. An abstract table can be visualized through a layout structure specified by a set of topological rules, which determine the relative placement of tabular items in two dimensions, and a set of style rules, which determine the final appearance of different items. The absolute placement of a concrete table can be automatically generated by applying a layout specification to an abstract line. An NP-complete problem arises in the formatting process that uses automatic line breaking and determines the physical dimension of a table to satisfy user-specified size constraints. An algorithm has been designed to solve the formatting problem in polynomial time for typical tables. Based on the tabular model, a prototype tabular composition system has been implemented in a UNIX, X Windows environment. This prototype provides an interactive interface to edit the logical structure, the topology and the styles of tables. It allows us to manipulate tables based on the logical relationships tabular items, regardless of where the items are placed in the layout structure, and capable of presenting a table in different topologies and styles so that we can select a high-quality layout structure."
