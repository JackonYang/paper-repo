                "text": "In the central nervous system the visual pathway from retina to striate cortex provides an opportunity to observe and compare single unit responses at several distinct levels. Patterns of light stimuli most effective in influencing units at one level may no longer be the most effective at the next. From differences in responses at successive stages in the pathway one may hope to gain some understanding of the part each stage plays in visual perception. By shining small spots of light on the light-adapted cat retina Kuffler (1953) showed that ganglion cells have concentric receptive fields, with an 'on' centre and an 'off ' periphery, or vice versa. The 'on' and 'off' areas within a receptive field were found to be mutually antagonistic, and a spot restricted to the centre of the field was more effective than one covering the whole receptive field (Barlow, FitzHugh & Kuffler, 1957). In the freely moving lightadapted cat it was found that the great majority of cortical cells studied gave little or no response to light stimuli covering most of the animal's visual field, whereas small spots shone in a restricted retinal region often evoked brisk responses (Hubel, 1959). A moving spot of light often produced stronger responses than a stationary one, and sometimes a moving spot gave more activation for one direction than for the opposite. The present investigation, made in acute preparations, includes a study of receptive fields of cells in the cat's striate cortex. Receptive fields of the cells considered in this paper were divided into separate excitatory and inhibitory ('on' and 'off') areas. In this respect they resembled retinal ganglion-cell receptive fields. However, the shape and arrangement of excitatory and inhibitory areas differed strikingly from the concentric pattern found in retinal ganglion cells. An attempt was made to correlate responses to moving stimuli"

Lorente de No (29) also described neuron chains of varying complexity within each column. Some chains were simple two-neuron arcs, with the afferent fiber synapsing directly onto an output cell. Other chains involved various numbers of interneurons between input and output. Implicit in this concept of multiple neuron chains is the notion that any given column has multiple functions and multiple outputs. Hubel and Wiesel (24, 26) have postulated a single neuron chain in visual cortex, involving afferent axons, simple cells, complex cells, and (more recently) hypercomplex cells. In cat visual cortex most of the cells (233/303 or 77yo) had simple properties (24), whereas in monkeys most of the cells (1771272 or 65y0) were complex (26). Xn the course of experiments dealing primarily with co,lor properties of neurons in monkey visual cortex (13), it became evident that complex cells did not constitute a single homogeneous group, but included several subclasses. When the recording sites were determined histologically, the physiologically defined subclasses of complex cells turned out to have different laminar distributions. The physiologic properties used to define the new cell classes are presented in this paper, and the laminar distributions are shown. Some important differences be-"

                "text": "ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL STUDIES have shown that the characteristics of single cells in the superior colliculus depend to a considerable extent on cortical input. In the cat, the majority of studies reveal a dramatic loss of binocularity and direction selectivity in superficial collicular units following ablation of the visual cortex (1, 18, 25). In the ground squirrel, removal of the visual cortex renders most cells in the intermediate and deep layers of the superior colliculus unresponsive to visual stimuli (14); this also appears to apply to the cat (22). Work on the rabbit, however, indicates that in this species, ablation of visual cortex produces no discernible effects on collicular function (10). The present study has been undertaken to investigate the contribution of visual cortex to collicular function in the rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta), a species whose visual svstem is believed to be rather similar to that of man. Neuroanatomical work has indicated that in the monkey, as in the cat, retina and visual cortex project densely on the superior colliculus (8). In the monkey, a foveate animal, an interesting specialization has been reported: anterograde-degeneration and autoradiographic studies indicate that the anterior part of the colliculus, representing the central 5\u201d of the visual field, receives extremely sparse or no terminations from the retina and, conversely, heavy projections from visual cortex (5, 9, 26) Single-unit studies of the superior colliculus of the intact monkey have disclosed that, as in the cat, most cells have binocular"

It would be astonishing if such a structure did not profoundly modify the response patterns of fibres coming into it. In the cat's visual cortex, the receptive field arrangements of single cells suggest that there is indeed a degree of complexity far exceeding anything yet seen at lower levels in the visual system. In a previous paper we described receptive fields of single cortical cells, observing responses to spots of light shone on one or both retinas (Hubel & Wiesel, 1959). In the present work this method is used to examine receptive fields of a more complex type (Part I) and to make additional observations on binocular interaction (Part II). This approach is necessary in order to understand the behaviour of individual cells, but it fails to deal with the problem of the relationship of one cell to its neighbours. In the past, the technique of recording evoked slow waves has been used with great success in studies of functional anatomy. It was employed by Talbot & Marshall (1941) and by Thompson, Woolsey & Talbot (1950) for mapping out the visual cortex in the rabbit, cat, and monkey. Daniel & Whitteiidge (1959) have recently extended this work in the primate. Most of our present knowledge of retinotopic projections, binocular overlap, and the second visual area is based on these investigations. Yet the method of evoked potentials is valuable mainly for detecting behaviour common to large populations of neighbouring cells; it cannot differentiate functionally between areas of cortex smaller than about 1 mm2. To overcome this difficulty a method has in recent years been developed for studying cells separately or in small groups during long micro-electrode penetrations through nervous tissue. Responses are correlated with cell location by reconstructing the electrode tracks from histological material. These techniques have been applied to"

This ability seems related to the specificity and complexity of stimuli needed for activation of single neurones of the visual cortex, in contrast to the relatively unselective requirements of retinal and lateral geniculate neurones. The retina and tectum of some lower vertebrates including frogs, pigeons and rabbits, already possess selective cells responding to very specific aspects of stimulation. The class differences are in part connected with the chiasmatic decussation and mechanisms of binocular and stereoptic vision which are prominent in the visual cortex of animals with forward looking rather than laterally placed eyes. They are also associated with the enormously expanded behavioural repertoire of, for instance, primates in comparision to lower vertebrate forms. The complex primate cortex permits a rich interaction and modification of cellular performance according to the momentary needs and disposition of the individual. The opportunities which allow plasticity of performance also unfortunately often lead to response unpredictability, despite careful laboratory controls."

Ablation studies have shown that destruction of superior colliculi interferes with spatial orientation and eye movement (Z-29), although the evidence regarding the effects of such lesions in primates is conflicting (1, 7, 17, 18; and unpublished observations). Stimulation studies have disclosed that electrical or chemical stimulation of the superior colliculus elicits eye and head movement in several species (4, 1 I, 20, 22). While most single-unit studies centered on the visual information-processing role of the mammalian superior colliculi (12-16, 30, 32, 33; M. Cynader and N. Berman, unpublished observations), a few studies have recently appeared that demonstrate eye-movement related unit activity (22, 31, 35) The aim of the present study was to investigate the discharge characteristics of single units in the superior colliculus of the alert, unanesthe tized monkey. We wished to assess both the visual receptivefield characteristics of units and the possible relation of unit discharges to eye movement. To carry out this plan one eye of each monkey was immobilized prior to the experiment by transection of the 3rd, 4th, and 6th cranial nerves. This made it possible to study in the monkey, whose head was restrained, receptive fields of units of the immobilized eye, and to relate the discharge characteristics of collicular units to the movement of the normal eye during both saccadic and smooth pursuit eye movements. M. Cynader and N. Berman (unpublished data) recently have shown that nearly all units in the monkey"

                "text": "The striate cortex of the macaque monkey is subdivided into two independent and overlapping systems of columns termed \u201corientation columns\u201d and \u201cocular dominance columns.\u201d The present paper is concerned with the orientation columns, particularly their geometry and the relationship between successive columns. The arrangement of the columns is highly ordered; in the great majority of oblique or tangential microelectrode penetrations the preferred orientations of cells changed systematically with electrode position, in a clockwise or counterclockwise direction. Graphs of orientation vs. electrode track distance were virtually straight lines over distances of up to several millimeters; such orderly sequences were often terminated by sudden changes in the direction of orientation shifts, from clockwise to counterclockwise or back. The orientations at which these reversals occurred were quite unpredictable. Total rotations of 180\u2013360\u00b0 were frequently seen between reversals. In tangential or almost tangential penetrations orientation shifts occurred almost every time the electrode was moved forward, indicating that the columns were either not discrete or had a thickness of less than 25\u201350 \u03bc, the smallest order of distance that our methods could resolve. In penetrations that were almost perpendicular to the surface, the graphs of orientation vs. track distance were relatively flatter, as expected if the surfaces of constant orientation are perpendicular to the cortical surface. Stepwise changes in orientation of about 10\u00b0 could sometimes be seen in perpendicular penetrations, each orientation persisting through several clear advances of the electrode, suggesting a set of discrete columnar subdivisions. The possibility of some kind of continuous variation in orientation with horizontal distance along the cortex was not, however, completely ruled out. Occasionally a highly ordered sequence was broken by an abrupt large shift in orientation of up to 90\u00b0. Shifts in ocular dominance occurred roughly every 0.25\u20130.5 mm and were independent of orientation shifts. In multiple parallel penetrations spaced closer than about 250 \u03bc the slopes of the orientation vs. track distance curves were almost the same; reconstruction of these penetrations indicated that the regions of constant orientation are parallel sheets. On crossing perpendicular to these sheets, a total orientation shift of 180\u00b0 took place over a distance of 0.5\u20131.0 mm. Column thickness, size of shifts in orientation, and the rate of change of orientation with distance along the cortex seemed to be independent of eccentricity, at least between 2\u00b0 and 15\u00b0 from the fovea. A few penetrations made in area 17 of the cat and in area 18 of the monkey showed similar orderly sequences of receptive\u2010field orientation shifts."
