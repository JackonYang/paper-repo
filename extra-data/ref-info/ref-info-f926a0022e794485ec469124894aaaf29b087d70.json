We discovered that the knowledge about relevance among queries and documents can be used to obtain empirical connections between query terms and the canonical concepts which are used for indexing the content of documents. These connections do not depend on whether there are shared terms among the queries and documents; therefore, they are especially effective for a mapping from queries to the documents where the concepts are relevant but the terms used by article authors happen to be different from the terms of database users. We employ a Linear Least Squares Fit (LLSF) technique to compute such connections from a collection of queries and documents where the relevance is assigned by humans, and then use these connections in the retrieval of documents where the relevance is unknown. We tested this method on both retrieval and indexing with a set of MEDLINE documents which has been used by other information retrieval systems for evaluations. The effectiveness of the LLSF mapping and the significant improvement over alternative approaches was evident in the tests."

This paper studies the effects of using canonical concepts versus document words in different retrieval systems with a testing collection of MEDLINE documents. In our tests, for a retrieval system which does not use any human knowledge, using words yielded better retrieval results, while using concepts suffered from a vocabulary difference between canonical expressions of concepts and non-canonical words in queries or documents. For a system which depends on the UMLS synonym set for a mapping from queries or documents to canonical concepts, the retrieval results were slightly better than the case of not using the synonyms, but still worse than the systems using words. For the systems which automatically \"learn\" empirical connections between words and concepts from examples in the testing collection, the vocabulary problem was effectively solved, and the results of using concepts were competitive or better, compared to those using words."

This method learns empirical associations between free-form texts and canonical terms from human-assigned matches and determines a Linear Least Squares Fit (LLSF) mapping function which represents weighted connections between words in the texts and the canonical terms. The mapping function enables us to project an arbitrary text to the canonical term space where the \"transformed\" text is compared with the terms, and similarity scores are obtained which quantify the relevance between the the text and the terms. This approach has superior power to discover synonyms or related terms and to preserve the context sensitivity of the mapping. We achieved a rate of 84% in both the recall and the precision with a testing set of 6,913 texts, outperforming other techniques including string matching (15%), morphological parsing (17%) and statistical weighting (21%)."

Omission of important data from reports is common and methods of measuring effectiveness vary widely. This has made judging the relative merits of techniques for text categorization difficult and has disguised important research issues.In this paper I discuss a variety of ways of evaluating the effectiveness of text categorization systems, drawing both on reported categorization experiments and on methods used in evaluating query-driven retrieval. I also consider the extent to which the same evaluation methods may be used with systems for text extraction, a more complex task. In evaluating either kind of system, the purpose for which the output is to be used is crucial in choosing appropriate evaluation methods."

For this task, an indexing dictionary with rules for mapping terms from the text onto descriptors is required, which can be derived automatically from a set of manually indexed documents. Based on the Darmstadt Indexing Approach, the indexing task is divided into a description step and a decision step. First, terms (single words or phrases) are identiied in the document text. With term-descriptor rules from the dictionary, descriptor indications are formed. The set of all indications from a document leading to the same descriptor is called a relevance description. A probabilistic classiication procedure computes indexing weights for each relevance description. Since the whole system is rule-based, it can be adapted to diierent subject elds by appropriate modiications of the rule bases. A major application of AIR/X is the AIR/PHYS system developed for a large physics database. This application is described in more detail along with experimental results."

Human coding performed best, two-step LSI did less well than surface matching or SMART. This evaluation suggests that concept-based LSI may be compromised by its two-stage nature and its dependence upon a robust term database linked to main concepts. However, the potential elegance of partial- credit concept matching merits the continued evaluation of LSI for clinical case retrieval."

Participants were offered a 2-hour introduction to online searching and 2 hours of free search time.\n\n\nMEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS\nFor each search, a computer program requested identification of the user and the question to be addressed. Search transactions were recorded automatically. Interviews were conducted after a random sample of searches, and search questions were given to more expert searchers to run for comparison with the original. Eighty-one percent of participants did searches on study computers, at a mean rate of 2.7 searches per month. On comparison searches, participants retrieved 55% of the number of relevant articles retrieved by reference librarians (P = 0.024) and 50% more irrelevant articles (P less than 0.001). Forty-seven percent of searches on patient problems affected clinical decisions, but often on scanty information.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nMEDLINE searching from clinical settings is feasible with brief training and affects clinical decisions. However, inexperienced searchers miss many relevant citations and search inefficiently. Further studies are needed to assess the impact of searching on physician performance and patient care."
