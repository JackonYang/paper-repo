In order to automatically acquire these models, we propose the application of machine learning techniques. Problems raised by possible dependencies between concepts to be learned are illustrated and solved with a computational strategy based on the separate-and-parallel-conquer search. The approach is tested on a set of real multi-page documents processed by the system WISDOM++. New results confirm the validity of the proposed strategy and show some limits of the learning system used in this work."

To infer relations of the logical layout we resort to a qualitative spatial calculus closely related to Allen's calculus.

Domain-specific as well as generic knowledge about document layout is used in order to classify, logically group, and determine the read-order of the individual blocks in the image, i.e., translate the physical structure of the document into a layout-independent logical structure. We have developed a computational model for the derivation of the logical structure of documents. Our model uses a rule-based control structure, as well as a hierarchical multi-level knowledge representation scheme in which knowledge about various types of documents is encoded into a document knowledge base and is used by reasoning processes to make inferences about the document. An important issue addressed in our research is the kind of domain knowledge that is required for such analysis. A document logical structure derivation system (DeLoS) has been developed based on the above model, and has achieved good results in deriving the logical structure of complex multi- articled documents such as newspaper pages. Applications of this approach include its use in information retrieval from digital libraries, as well as in comprehensive document understanding systems."

Knowledge-based systems for document analysis and understanding (DAU) are quite useful whenever analysis has to deal with the changing of free-form document types which require different analysis components. In this case, declarative modeling is a good way to achieve flexibility. An important application domain for such systems is the business letter domain. Here, high accuracy and the correct assignment to the right people and the right processes is a crucial success factor. Our solution to this proposes a comprehensive knowledge-centered approach: we model not only comparatively static knowledge concerning document properties and analysis results within the same declarative formalism, but we also include the analysis task and the current context of the system environment within the same formalism. This allows an easy definition of new analysis tasks and also an efficient and accurate analysis by using expectations about incoming documents as context information. The approach described has been implemented within the VOPR (VOPR is an acronym for the Virtual Office PRototype.) system. This DAU system gains the required context information from a commercial workflow management system (WfMS) by constant exchanges of expectations and analysis tasks. Further interaction between these two systems covers the delivery of results from DAU to the WfMS and the delivery of corrected results vice versa."

However, an extensive and systematic evaluation of the various approaches has not yet been done. In particular, evaluations on OCR documents are very rare. In this paper we investigate seven text representations based on n-grams and single words. We compare their effectiveness in classifying OCR texts and the corresponding correct ASCII texts in two domains: business letters and abstracts of technical reports. Our results indicate that the use of n-grams is an attractive technique which can even compare to techniques relying on a morphological analysis. This holds for OCR texts as well as for correct ASCII texts."

Searching for a set of known table headers (approach 1) works rather well in a significant number of documents. But this approach (though it is implemented tolerant to OCR errors) is not tolerant enough towards some kinds of even minor aberrations. This not only decreases the recognition results, but also, even worse, makes users feel uncomfortable. Pragmatically trying to mimic for what the human eyes might key, leads to our two further, complementary approaches: searching for layout structures which resemble parts of columns (approach 2), and searching for groupings of similar lines (approach 3). The suitability of the approaches for our system requires them to be very simple to implement and simple to explain to users, computationally cheap, and combinable. In the domain of health insurances who receive huge amounts of so called medical liquidations on a daily basis we obtain very good results. On document samples representative for the every day practice of five customers-health insurance companies-tables were spotted as good and as fast as the customers expected the system to be. We thus consider our current approaches as a step towards cognitive adequacy."

However, an extensive and systematic evaluation of the various approaches has not been done yet. In order to investigate different text representations for document classification, we have developed a tool which transforms documents into feature-value representations that are suitable for standard learning algorithms. In this paper, we investigate seven document representations for German texts based on n-grams and single words. We compare their effectiveness in classifying OCR texts and the corresponding correct ASCII texts in two domains: business letters and abstracts of technical reports. Our results indicate that the use of n-grams is an attractive technique which can even compare to techniques relying on a morphological analysis. This holds for OCR texts as well as for correct ASCII texts."

The key idea is to use the patterns in the distribution of white space in a document to recognize and interpret its components. The recognition algorithm divides the document into a hierarchy of logical elements; the interpretation algorithms classify these divisions as base-text, tables, indented lists, polygonal drawings, and graphs. We present experimental data and discuss an information access application. Our methodology allows the automatic markup of documents\\footnote{For instance in the SGML format} and the creation of multi-level indices and browsing tools for electronic libraries."

A segmentation method based on \"logical closeness\" is proposed. A novel and natural representation of document layout structure-a directed weight graph (DWG)-is described. To classify a given document, a string representation matching algorithm is applied first, instead of comparing all the sample graphs. A frame template and a document type hierarchy (DTH) are used to represent the document's logical structure and the hierarchical relationships among these frame templates, respectively.

T-Recs works on the output of commercial OCR systems that provide the word bounding box geometry together with the text itself (e.g. Xerox ScanWorX). While T-Recs performs well on a number of document categories, business letters still remained a challenging domain because the T-Recs location heuristics are mislead by their header or footer resulting in a low recognition precision. Business letters such as invoices are a very interesting domain for industrial applications due to the large amount of documents to be analyzed and the importance of the data carried within their tables. Hence, we developed a more restrictive approach which is implemented in the T-Recs++ prototype. This paper describes the ideas of the T-Recs++ location and also proposes a quality evaluation measure that reflects the bottom-up strategy of either T-Recs or T-Recs++. Finally, some results comparing both systems on a collection of business letters are given."

Layout is a critical factor in recognizing fine-grained genres, as document content features are similar. Document genre is determined from the layout structure detected from scanned binary images of the document pages, using no OCR results and minimal a priori knowledge of document logical structures. Our method uses the attributed relational graphs (ARGs) to represent the layout structure of document instances, and the first order random graphs (FORGs) to represent document genres. In this paper we develop our FORG-based genre classification method and present a comparative evaluation between our technique and a variety of statistical pattern classifiers. FORGs are capable of modeling common layout structure within a document genre and are shown to significantly outperform traditional pattern classification techniques when fine-grained genre distinctions must be drawn."

This paper describes a general solution for detecting tables based on computing an optimal partitioning of a document into some number of tables. A dynamic programming algorithm is given to solve the resulting optimization problem. This high-level framework is independent of any particular table quality measure and independent of the document medium. Moreover, it does not rely on the presence of ruling lines or other table delimiters. We also present table quality measures based on white space correlation and vertical connected component analysis. These measures can be applied equally well to ASCII text and scanned images. We report on some preliminary experiments using this method to detect tables in both ASCII text and scanned images, yielding promising results. We present detailed evaluation of these results using three different criteria which by themselves pose interesting research questions."

This paper shows that the accuracy of a naive Bayes text classi er can be signi cantly improved by taking advantage of a hierarchy of classes. We adopt an established statistical technique called shrinkage that smoothes parameter estimates of a data-sparse child with its parent in order to obtain more robust parameter estimates. The approach is also employed in deleted interpolation, a technique for smoothing n-grams in language modeling for speech recognition. Our method scales well to large data sets, with numerous categories in large hierarchies. Experimental results on three real-world data sets from UseNet, Yahoo, and corporate web pages show improved performance, with a reduction in error up to 29% over the traditional at classi er."

Categorization of text is of increasing importance in information retrieval and natural language processing systems. Previous research on automated text categorization has mixed machine learning and knowledge engineering methods, making it diicult to draw conclusions about the performance of particular methods. In this paper we present empirical results on the performance of a Bayesian classiier and a decision tree learning algorithm on two text categorization data sets. We nd that both algorithms achieve reasonable performance and allow controlled tradeoos between false positives and false negatives. The stepwise feature selection in the decision tree algorithm is particularly eeective in dealing with the large feature sets common in text categorization. However, even this algorithm is aided by an initial preeltering of features, connrming the results found by Almuallim and Dietterich on artiicial data sets. We also demonstrate the impact of the time-varying nature of category deenitions."

In these tables, textual data are presented in record lines made up of fixed-width fields. Tables often do not rely on line-art (ruled lines) to delimit fields, and in this way differ crucially from fixed forms. Our system performs these steps: copes with multiple tables per page; identifies records within tables; segments records into fields; and recognizes characters within fields, constrained by field-specific contextual knowledge. Obstacles to good performance on tables include small print, tight line-spacing, poor-quality text (such as photocopies), and line-art or background patterns that touch the text. Precise skew-correction and pitch-estimation, and high-performance OCR using neural nets proved crucial in overcoming these obstacles. The most significant technical advances in this work appear to be algorithms for identifying and segmenting records with known layout, and integration of these algorithms with a graphical user interface (GUI) for defining new layouts. This GUI has been ergonomically designed to make efficient and intuitive use of exemplary images, so that the skill and manual effort required to retarget the system to new table layouts are held to a minimum. The system has been applied in this way to more than 400 distinct tabular layouts. During the last three years the system has read over fifty million records with high accuracy."

While most research in the area of table analysis and recognition has focused on analyzing the raster image, our approach builds upon the advances in optical character recognition (OCR) software to preserve the layout of tabular data by means of white space. By using methods to analyze the geometry, syntax, and the semantics of the character data, as well as utilizing some well-known image processing techniques, we are able to 1) isolate embedded tables from documents, and 2) identify table components uch as title blocks, table entries, and footer blocks. Furthermore, the table analysis techniques presented in this paper can also be applied when analyzing blocks of text isolated by traditional methods such as connected component analysis[1] or bounding box [2]."

Table recognition starts with the detection of the table header. Afterwards, this header is compared with table headers of known reference tables.

Visual clues that exist in the image are used for extracting first the physical, and then the logical structure of the table. Since these visual clues generally have a logical meaning, there must be some association made between the graphical attributes extracted and their function of reflecting the logic expressed by the table; this knowledge is coordinated in a model. This approach, therefore, can be adapted to all tables which have graphical attributes discernible to the image analysis being used."

The proposed knowledge base encodes geometric characteristics that are not only common in technical journals but also publication-specific in the form of rules. The method takes the hybrid of top-down and bottom-up techniques and consists of two phases: region segmentation and identification. Generally, the result of the segmentation process does not have a one-to-one matching with composite layout components. Therefore, the proposed method identifies non-text objects, such as images, drawings, and tables, as well as text objects, by splitting or grouping segmented regions into composite layout components. Experimental results with 372 images scanned from the IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence show that the proposed method has performed geometric structure analysis successfully on more than 99 percent of the test images."

The paper presents an analysis of why TSVMs are well suited for text classi cation. These theoretical ndings are supported by experiments on three test collections. The experiments show substantial improvements over inductive methods, especially for small training sets, cutting the number of labeled training examples down to a twentieth on some tasks.

We added two new features to the feature vector from one previously published method (Sivaramakrishnan et al., 1995). We assumed different independence relationships in two zone sets. We used an optimized binary decision tree to estimate the maximum zone content class probability in one set while using the Viterbi algorithm to find the optimal solution for a zone sequence in the other set. The training, pruning and testing data set for the algorithm include 1,600 images drawn from the UWCDROM III document image database. The classifier is able to classify each given scientific and technical document zone into one of the nine classes, 2 text classes (of font size 4 - 18pt and font size 19 - 32 pt), math, table, halftone, map/drawing, ruling, logo, and others. Compared with our previous work (Wang et al., 2000), it raised the accuracy rate to 98.52% from 97.53% and reduced the mean false alarm rate to 0.53% from 1.26%."

The system acquires the image of the document by a flatbed scanner and recognizes the type of the document among a set of predefined models using color information. Textual fields are located in the image by a connected component analysis and identified in terms of their structural arrangement. A set of complementary statistical and structural OCR techniques are combined by a voting strategy to read each text image region. For unknown input documents, lines compliant with machine readable ICAO 9303 format are located and recognized. Although the system has been initially designed for Spanish documents, it allows the integration of new formats by a supervised learning procedure. The system is currently installed as a check-in application in a real environment."

A framework is developed for conceptualizing the processes that occur between dominants and tokens. Three perceptual phenomena are associated with tokens: visibility (tokens capture a disproportionate awareness share), polarization (differences between tokens and dominants are exaggerated), and assimilation (tokens' attributes are distorted to fit preexisting generalizations about their social type). Visibility generates performance pressures; polarization leads dominants to heighten their group boundaries; and assimilation leads to the tokens' role entrapment. Illustrations are drawn from a field study in a large industrial corporation. Concepts are extended to tokens of all kinds, and research issues are identified."

However, whether these differences reflect policy makers' private thoughts, or their public impression management strategies, cannot be inferred using only data from the public record. The experiment reported here established that in freely interacting groups composed of majorities and minorities, this pattern is obtained under private communication conditions as well as in public statements. Results suggest that cognitive flexibility in response to influence from insiders, rather than communication strategies designed to influence outsiders, underlies the differences observed."

                "text": "Racial conflict was becoming commonplace on American college campuses throughout the 1980s, with more than one hundred college campuses reporting incidents of racial/ethnic harassment and violence in each of the last two years of the decade [40]. The most highly publicized racial incidents, ranging from verbal harassment to violent beatings, occurred at some of the most elite institutions in the country [25, 56]. In many cases students organized protests as a direct response to these problems, or to express solidarity with students facing similar problems at other institutions [60]. Although these events have provided the impetus for examining the quality of race relations on individual college campuses, researchers have not explored at any great length the nature of campus race relations across a variety of institutional contexts. The research on minorities in higher education is extensive, yet a surprisingly small number of empirical studies have focused specifically on campus racial climates. Only a few studies include measures of campus race relations in their models of student persistence [54, 57, 58], academic achievement [2, 41, 42, 46], and social involvement [1]. Al-"

                "text": "Those who seek to understand the experiences of Black students on White campuses in the United States have far more information available to them at the close of the twentieth century than could have ever been imagined at the beginning. Because of the tremendous social, political, economic, and educational changes in our society over the past thirty years there has been an expansion in the study of Blacks in all aspects of the American culture. Not surprisingly, education has played a central role in increasing our knowledge about the lives and experiences of Blacks. Research that has focused on Black students on predominately White campuses overwhelmingly reveals a story of academic difficulty (Fleming, 1984; Nettles, 1988; Mow & Nettles, 1990; Allen, 1992). Consequently much of the research on Black students has focused on those who have pronounced academic needs and who are perceived as academically less prepared than their White counterparts. The disproportionate focus on Black underachievement in the literature not only distorts the image of the community of Black collegians, it creates, perhaps unintentionally, a lower set of expectations for Black student achievement. The purpose of this study was to examine, through extensive interviews, the academic, social, and racial experiences of high-achieving Black students enrolled in the Meyerhoff Program, a merit-based scholarship program for students in math, science, and engineering. Interview questions (explained below) were focused around three broad areas: academic experiences in and outside of the classroom, social interactions and relationships with peers/faculty, and experiences in, and perceptions of, a \"race specific\" program. Established in 1989, the Meyerhoff program initially was developed to address the underrepresentation of Black males in the hard sciences. In 1990 the first class of Black females was admitted, and in 1996 the program was expanded to include other minority and White students. At the time of this writing, there were eight classes of Meyerhoffs enrolled in the program. High ability in this study was defined by conventional measures such as Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) scores and Grade Point Average (GPA). The cohort of Meyerhoffs interviewed had an average high-school GPA of 3.5 on a 4.0 scale, average SAT math score of 621, and the average SAT total score was 1198. The fall semester average GPA in the senior year was 3.0. This study is based on interviews with the class of 1990, the second class of Meyerhoffs and the first to admit female students. The 1990 class enrolled 15 students, of whom 14 persisted to the senior year, and 12 students (6 males and 6 females) participated in the 60-90 minute interviews. The Meyerhoff program provides an enormous level of support for the students. There are thirteen different components of the program, including full, or in some cases (for affiliate scholars) partial, scholarship support, study groups, tutoring, personal and academic advising, and connections with mentors in the field who can help with career issues and internship placement. For a description of the program and the services it provides, see Fries-Britt (1997) and Hrabowski, Maton, and Greif (1998). Factors Affecting the Academic Success of Gifted Blacks Much of what we know about gifted Black students in general comes from the work of scholars who study Black students in elementary, junior high, and high-school environments. The scant research on gifted collegians combined with the limited research on Black adolescents and high-school students provides some insight into the issues encountered by this population. Like other students, gifted Black students face social-emotional adjustment issues, such as self-concept and acceptance by peers (Rubenzer, 1976; Baldwin, 1991; Roeper, 1991). For gifted Blacks the issues of self-concept are different from those of other Blacks and gifted White students (Exum, 1979). \u2026"

In another study, Chang (2002b) found that students who had nearly completed a required diversity-related course made significantly more favorable judgments of African Americans than those who had just started the requirement. The effect occurred even though the content of the courses that were randomly selected for the study varied, and many of them did not specifically focus on African American issues. This study\u2019s findings suggest that general education curricula, specifically diversity course requirements, can play a meaningful role in diminishing divisive racial prejudices and can subsequently improve race relations. To examine the broader educational implications of reducing racial biases, Chang (2001) collected and analyzed data from an institutional sample of undergraduate students to estimate the relationship between racial prejudice and seven educational experiences."

Recent work in this area provides insight into one way in which students access the benefits of diversity. Antonio\u2019s (2001a) study of friendships on a racially diverse campus indicates that the outcomes associated with diversity are both realized from and mediated by friendships with students from different racial and ethnic backgrounds."

Moreover, this perception is shared both by students who maintain many interracial relationships and by those who maintain few. In other words, even when students actively take advantage of campus diversity via their friendships, they remain somewhat discouraged by the lack of institutional support for a positive climate for diversity. Institutional commitment to diversity, Antonio concludes, needs to be highly visible and unambiguous if students are to view such interactions as contributing to the larger cultural norms of the campus. Even though a student\u2019s actual engagement with diversity is a more direct and powerful way to realize developmental gains, the above findings suggest that being in an environment committed to diversity may also contribute to students\u2019 development and influence their participation in different campus activities. This emerging body of research indicates that the institutional conditions that promote diversity may by themselves improve race relations, irrespective of a student\u2019s level of interest in and engagement with diversity. As illustrated by Chang et al. (2004), a supportive campus climate and set of institutional practices might be linked to, or serve as a proxy for, high levels of cross-racial interaction among students\u2014and make it possible for all students to improve their knowledge of and ability to accept others from different backgrounds and cultures."

On some campuses, the pace of demographic change has been nothing short of dramatic. At the University of California, for example, White students still represented over 70% of all undergraduates as late as 1984. Just six years later in 1990, however, the White student proportion had dropped to less than 60% of all students (University of California, 1991) and only 46% of first-time freshmen (CPEC, 1995).

The theory assumes that sustained school success requires identification with school and its subdomains; that societal pressures on these groups (e.g., economic disadvantage, gender roles) can frustrate this identification; and that in school domains where these groups are negatively stereotyped, those who have become domain identified face the further barrier of stereotype threat, the threat that others' judgments or their own actions will negatively stereotype them in the domain. Research shows that this threat dramatically depresses the standardized test performance of women and African Americans who are in the academic vanguard of their groups (offering a new interpretation of group differences in standardized test performance), that it causes disidentification with school, and that practices that reduce this threat can reduce these negative effects."

Studies 1 and 2 varied the stereotype vulnerability of Black participants taking a difficult verbal test by varying whether or not their performance was ostensibly diagnostic of ability, and thus, whether or not they were at risk of fulfilling the racial stereotype about their intellectual ability. Reflecting the pressure of this vulnerability, Blacks underperformed in relation to Whites in the ability-diagnostic condition but not in the nondiagnostic condition (with Scholastic Aptitude Tests controlled). Study 3 validated that ability-diagnosticity cognitively activated the racial stereotype in these participants and motivated them not to conform to it, or to be judged by it. Study 4 showed that mere salience of the stereotype could impair Blacks' performance even when the test was not ability diagnostic. The role of stereotype vulnerability in the standardized test performance of ability-stigmatized groups is discussed."

In this study, differences between the effects of interracial contact among students that are close friends versus more casual interracial interactions are examined for their affect on students' leadership skills and cultural knowledge and understanding. Findings suggest that casual interracial interaction is particularly beneficial among students with more racially homogeneous friendship circles, especially with regard to developing leadership skills. In addition, findings indicate that frequent interracial interaction among students may be more important in developing cultural knowledge than involvement in formal activities such as cultural awareness workshops."

                "text": "In the ten-year period between 1969 and 1979, minority students enrolled in predominantly White colleges in increasing numbers, due in part to the greater access afforded by affirmative action programs |14~. Since the early 1980s, however, there has been a disturbing regressive trend in the enrollment, academic performance, and retention of these students. For example, African-American and other non-Asian minority students attending predominantly White colleges are less likely to graduate within five years, have lower grade point averages, experience higher attrition rates, and matriculate into graduate programs at lower rates than White students and their counterparts at predominantly Black or minority institutions |3, 6~.(*) Efforts to account for these regressive trends suggest that intellective and academic background factors (that is, aptitude test scores, high-school preparation, and so on) and non-cognitive, contextual, and socio-cultural factors may be differentially associated with the college adjustment and performance of minority and non-minority students |6, 23, 26, 29, 35, 36~. For example, African-American students are more likely than Whites to view predominantly White campuses as hostile, alienating, and socially isolating |1, 2, 4, 10, 16, 28, 30, 34, 35, 36~, and as less responsive to their needs and interests |4~. African-American students have also been found to experience greater estrangement from the campus community |16, 34~ and heightened discomfort in interactions with faculty and peers |20, 30~. In addition, Tracey and Sedlacek |35~ and Nettles, Theony, and Gosman |27~ have found that the academic adjustment and achievement of African-American and other minority students are influenced by different sociocultural and contextual factors (for example, student satisfaction with college, peer group relations) than those that have an impact on White students. In order to define conceptually how these factors might contribute to minority student college adjustment, we have proposed a multidimensional stress-coping model |33~ which identifies three sets of factors as important in minority college student adjustment and achievement: (1) individual attributes that enhance or moderate students' vulnerability to academic failure (for example, academic preparation, intelligence, self-confidence, social maturity); (2) the psychological and sociocultural stresses students face during their academic careers (for example, stresses that are experienced on campus, in the community, and so on); and (3) the strategies students use to cope with these stresses (for example, individual and group appraisals of stresses and the strategies used to cope with them). Consistent with a transactional model of stress and coping |22~, we view the types of stresses experienced, the coping styles used, and the outcomes obtained as mutually interacting. Consequently, the pattern of relationships among these variables are likely to vary as a function of individual, group, and college campus characteristics. We also note that many of the experiences reported by minority students at predominantly White colleges are experienced by and affect all college students and are integral to the role of college student (for example, academic demands, relationship problems, financial worries, and so on). These student role strains constitute a generic pathway of influences and contribute to college maladjustment for all students. However, these generic role strains should be distinguished from the more unique stresses experienced by minority students that heighten feelings of not belonging and interfere with minority students' effective integration into the university community (for example, experiences with racism, questions about their right to be on campus). These experiences are conceptualized as minority status stresses and constitute a separate and additional pathway of risk for maladjustment (that is, an additional stress load). \u2026"

Results showed that racial and opinion minorities were both perceived as contributing to novelty. Generally positive effects on integrative complexity were found when the groups had racial-and opinion-minority members and when members reported having racially diverse friends and classmates. The findings are discussed in the context of social psychological theories of minority influence and social policy implications for affirmative action. The research supports claims about the educational significance of race in higher education, as well as the complexity of the interaction of racial diversity with contextual and individual factors."

                "text": "OF THE DISCLOSURE A gas Spring for a drawing table which has a cylinder, a piston in the cylinder, and a piston rod projecting from the piston through one end wall of the cylinder, the other end wall being imperforate. Gas under pressure fills the cylinder and may be released from the chamber adjacent the piston rod if the latter is almost fully expelled from the cylinder against a compression spring through a chan nel having orifices in the piston and in the piston rod. Additional gas is admitted to the cylinder of a modified Spring when the piston rod is almost fully retracted into the cylinder and the piston strikes a normally closed valve Separating the cylinder cavity from a storage chamber. SLSSSMSSSLSSSSTSSSTSS The present invention relates to a weight-compensating and equilibrium-maintaining device, and it is the principal object of this invention to provide a very simple and inexpensive device in the form of a so-called gas spring for compensating the weight or maintaining the equi librium of any device or apparatus which is adjustable to different levels or inclinations and for permitting such adjustments to be carried out with the least possible physi cal effort. Among the numerous types of devices and appa ratus to which the present invention may be applied may be mentioned especially: drawing tables, X-ray apparatus, hair driers, tilting doors and windows, covers for large freezer chests, and so forth. In connection with such devices or apparatus it is con ventionai to balance their weight or to maintain their equi librium by the provision of counterweights or coil springs. The employment of counterweights has the disadvantage that they require considerable space and also considerably increase the weight of the entire apparatus. The use of coil springs, on the other hand, has the disadvantage that the operations of compressing or expanding such springs require a considerable force and either require or result in considerable changes inforce which have to be compen sated by special mechanical means such as levers, cams, or other force-transmitting means which considerably in crease the cost of the respective apparatus. Another device which has previously been employed for the above-mentioned purposes is a so-called gas spring which consists of a pneumatic cylinder and piston unit in which the cylinder is filled with a pressure gas, for exam ple, compressed air. Although very successful when spe cially designed for a specific apparatus, these gas springs have the disadvantage that each of them has a very par ticular spring characteristic and that therefore a large number of different gas springs have to be produced and be held available for compensating the different forces of different devices or apparatus and even for compen sating differences in force which might be due to inac curacies of manufacture of an individual apparatus of a series thereof. When such gas springs are to be installed, for example, on a drawing table, it is evident that dif ferent gas springs would be required either for merely balancing the weight of the drawing board itself or for 0."

Actualizing this educational vision requires understanding the forces that preclude and those that promote equal opportunity and academic success. Higher college dropout rates, lower levels of academic preparation in high school, lower socioeconomic status, and greater alienation or isolation in the white college environment have been cited as problems facing ethnic minority college students [2, 3, 14, 22, 29, 30]. There is a need at the national level for research on ethnic minority and white college students' attitudes and perceptions. Despite this need, little such research has been conducted [10]. Comparative studies have either been conducted among various white student populations [12, 18, 24] or between white students and only one ethnic minority group [13, 25, 28].

We now introduce guidelines as well as specific recommendations for engaging diversity\u2014an intentional and coherent process of planning, developing, and implementing institutional policies and practices explicitly designed to help students attain the benefits that can be gained from attending a racially and ethnically diverse college or university. In this way, we hope to strengthen the connection between academic scholarship on diversity and educational practice. Our list of proposals is not exhaustive; however, our proposals are informed by the most current research available. Consistent with this research, we preface these recommendations with three principles of practice. 1. Take a multidimensional approach. Specific policies may not be effective with all students in the same way. Therefore, it would be wise for campus leaders to utilize a multidimensional approach to diversity and anticipate that the effects of diversity policies may differ. For example, Duster (1992) found that at the University of California-Berkeley, white students preferred informal opportunities to engage diversity while African Americans desired formal campus programs."

According to the reviews, higher perceived levels of institutional commitment to diversity are associated with perceptions of relatively low racial tension among African American, Chicano, and, to some extent, white students. Higher perceived levels of commitment have also been shown to be associated with higher reported college grade-point averages and increases in personal goals to promote racial understanding. In contrast, lower levels of perceived institutional commitment to diversity are accompanied by higher levels of perceived hostility and discrimination and are associated with low grades for African American students, feelings of isolation among Native American students, higher levels of alienation among all students, and lower scores on college adjustment and sense of belonging among Latino students. Likewise, white students\u2019 perceptions of hostility or discrimination on campus have both direct and indirect effects on their persistence in college and are related to their lower sense of belonging on diverse campuses. Given the above findings, it appears that students\u2019 assessments and perceptions of their institution\u2019s overall commitment to diversity are influential in determining whether or not they are able to benefit from diversity. Evidence suggests that students are more likely to perceive greater levels of institutional commitment when campuses enact a more comprehensive diversity approach, as opposed to a piecemeal one. The effects of strong institutional commitment to diversity may positively affect not only individual outcomes but also the campus climate, which further reinforces the benefits associated with diversity. Some evidence of the type of effect noted above has been reported in two recent studies. Chang et al. (2004) found that the student body\u2019s average level of cross-racial interaction affects students\u2019 self-comparison of gains made since entering college, particularly in their knowledge of and ability to accept different races and cultures."

With regard to higher education institutions, Chang (1999) found that the likelihood that students will engage with students who are from different backgrounds increases as the compositional diversity of the campus increases. Hurtado, Dey, and Trevi\u00f1o (1994) showed that campuses with high proportions of white students provide limited opportunities for cross-racial interaction and restrict student learning experiences across social and cultural lines. On college campuses that lack a diverse population of students, underrepresented groups have an increased chance of being viewed as tokens. Tokenism contributes to the enhanced visibility of underrepresented groups, the exaggeration of group differences, and the alteration of images to fit existing stereotypes (Kanter 1977). On predominantly white campuses, the fact that students of color are underrepresented can produce both negative social stigma (e.g., see FriesBritt 1998; Fries-Britt and Turner 2001, 2002; Steele 1992, 1997, 1998; Steele and Aronson 1995) and \u201cminority status\u201d stressors (Prillerman, Myers, and Smedley 1989; Smedley, Myers, and Harrell 1993) that adversely affect student achievement. However, campus communities that are more racially and ethnically diverse tend to create more richly varied educational experiences that enhance students\u2019 learning and better prepare them for participation in a democratic society. This richness is due in part to the continuing role that race and ethnicity plays in shaping opportunities and experiences in U.S. society. Individuals of different racial and ethnic groups often have differing opinions and viewpoints about a wide range of issues. In a recent study, Chang (2003) confirmed that there are significant differences in viewpoints between racial groups at the point of college entry on a variety of pressing contemporary issues."

According to the reviews, higher perceived levels of institutional commitment to diversity are associated with perceptions of relatively low racial tension among African American, Chicano, and, to some extent, white students. Higher perceived levels of commitment have also been shown to be associated with higher reported college grade-point averages and increases in personal goals to promote racial understanding. In contrast, lower levels of perceived institutional commitment to diversity are accompanied by higher levels of perceived hostility and discrimination and are associated with low grades for African American students, feelings of isolation among Native American students, higher levels of alienation among all students, and lower scores on college adjustment and sense of belonging among Latino students. Likewise, white students\u2019 perceptions of hostility or discrimination on campus have both direct and indirect effects on their persistence in college and are related to their lower sense of belonging on diverse campuses. Given the above findings, it appears that students\u2019 assessments and perceptions of their institution\u2019s overall commitment to diversity are influential in determining whether or not they are able to benefit from diversity. Evidence suggests that students are more likely to perceive greater levels of institutional commitment when campuses enact a more comprehensive diversity approach, as opposed to a piecemeal one. The effects of strong institutional commitment to diversity may positively affect not only individual outcomes but also the campus climate, which further reinforces the benefits associated with diversity. Some evidence of the type of effect noted above has been reported in two recent studies. Chang et al. (2004) found that the student body\u2019s average level of cross-racial interaction affects students\u2019 self-comparison of gains made since entering college, particularly in their knowledge of and ability to accept different races and cultures. Even students who have very little crossracial interaction in college but are part of a student body that has high average levels of interaction tend to report greater individual gains in openness to diversity than those who have the same level of interaction but are a part of a student body that has low average levels of crossracial interaction. In a longitudinal study of college students attending institutions with varying degrees of racial diversity, Chang and DeAngelo (2002) found that white students attending an institution"

Likewise, the events of 9/11 and our country\u2019s response to these events are sociohistorical forces that have had a profound effect on campus racial climate. As noted by Hurtado and colleagues (1998, 1999), these external forces interact with internal forces to produce the campus racial climate. To describe these internal forces, they highlight four dimensions that result from the educational programs and practices at an institution: (1) compositional diversity(3), (2) historical legacy of inclusion or exclusion, (3) psychological climate, and (4) behavioral climate. We would add a fifth dimension of climate, the organizational/structural aspect, which was recently conceptualized by Milem, Dey, and White (2004)."
