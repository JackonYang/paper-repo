The model, called MORSEL (named for its ability to perform Multiple Object Recognition and attentional Selection), is unique in providing a broad and unified explanation for a wide range of experimental psychological data on visual perception and attention. Although it draws on existing theoretical perspectives from cognitive psychology, it is a fully mechanistic account, not just a functional-level theory.MORSEL has been trained to recognize letters and words in various positions on its \"retina.\" Following training, it can also recognize several items at once, subject to capacity limitations. The model makes predictions about what sorts of information the visual system can process in parallel and what sorts must be processed serially.Through simulation experiments, chiefly in letter and word perception, MORSEL has been shown to account for a variety of psychological phenomena, including perceptual errors that arise when several items appear simultaneously in the visual field, facilitatory effects of context and redundant information, attentional phenomena, visual search performance, and behaviors exhibited by neurological patients with acquired dyslexia."

As a recognition task, the speaker-dependent recognition of the phonemes B, D, and G in varying phonetic contexts was chosen. For comparison, several discrete hidden Markov models (HMM) were trained to perform the same task. Performance evaluation over 1946 testing tokens from three speakers showed that the TDNN achieves a recognition rate of 98.5% correct while the rate obtained by the best of the HMMs was only 93.7%. >"

However, their recognition accuracy has been limited by the accuracy of the underlying segmentation algorithm. Conventional, rule-based segmentation algorithms encounter difficulty if the characters are touching, broken, or noisy. The problem in these situations is that often one cannot properly segment a character until it is recognized yet one cannot properly recognize a character until it is segmented. We present here a neural network algorithm that simultaneously segments and recognizes in an integrated system. This algorithm has several novel features: it uses a supervised learning algorithm (backpropagation), but is able to take position-independent information as targets and self-organize the activities of the units in a competitive fashion to infer the positional information. We demonstrate this ability with overlapping handprinted numerals."

As a result of the weight adjustments, internal \u2018hidden\u2019 units which are not part of the input or output come to represent important features of the task domain, and the regularities in the task are captured by the interactions of these units. The ability to create useful new features distinguishes back-propagation from earlier, simpler methods such as the perceptron-convergence procedure1."

Resources can be multiplexed to permit implementation of networks with several hundreds of thousands of connections on a single chip. Computations are performed with 6 b accuracy for the weights and 3 b for the neuron states. Analog processing is used internally for reduced power dissipation and higher density, but all input/output is digital to simplify system integration.

This is an extension of previous work on recognizing isolated digits. In this architecture a single digit recognizer is replicated over the input. The output layer of the network is coupled to a Viterbi alignment module that chooses the best interpretation of the input. Training errors are propagated through the Viterbi module. The novelty in this procedure is that segmentation is done on the feature maps developed in the Space Displacement Neural Network (SDNN) rather than the input (pixel) space."

The input strings consist of a time-ordered sequence of X-Y coordinates, punctuated by pen-lifts. The methods were designed to work in \"run-on mode\" where there is no constraint on the spacing between characters. While both methods use a neural network recognition engine and a graph-algorithmic post-processor, their approaches to segmentation are quite different. The first method, which we call INSEG (for input segmentation), uses a combination of heuristics to identify particular penlifts as tentative segmentation points. The second method, which we call OUTSEG (for output segmentation), relies on the empirically trained recognition engine for both recognizing characters and identifying relevant segmentation points."

Locating the address block is a difficult object recognition problem because there is often a large amount of extraneous printing on a mail piece and because address blocks vary dramatically in size and shape. \n \nWe used a convolutional locator network with four outputs, each trained to find a different corner of the address block. A simple set of rules was used to generate ABL candidates from the network output. The system performs very well: when allowed five guesses, the network will tightly bound the address delivery information in 98.2% of the cases."
