Asymptoticity of the perturbation expansion in powers of \u03bb is established for the free energy density. This is achieved by using Kadanoff's block spin transformation successively to integrate out high momentum degrees of freedom and by applying ideas previously used by Gallavotti and Balaban in the context of the ultraviolet problems. The method works for arbitrary semibounded polynomials in \u2207\u03c6 and \u25b3\u03c6."

Expansions using this basis, i.e. expansions into \u201condelettes\u201d or \u201cwavelets,\u201d have yielded important new results in soft and hard analysis. The expansion into ondelettes of a boson scalar field naturally leads to phase cell cluster expansions, a formalism already developed by the authors using other related bases. Adoption of ondelettes expansions into the phase cell program gives improvements of some extant results, and excises an early error.Ondelettes lend more elegance to the phase cell cluster expansion of \u03c634, and to us are a vindication of the fundamental nature of this approach. This provides more promise for future developments."

The compatibility is given by a block spin transformation determining the configuration on a lattice in terms of the configuration on any finer lattice. Thus the configuration on any single lattice is not an \u201capproximation\u201d to the continuum field, but rather a subset of the variables describing the field.It is proven that the Wilson actions on the lattices monotonically increase to the continuum action as one passes to finer and finer lattices. Configurations that minimize the continuum action, subject to having the variables fixed on some lattice, are studied."

The field is expanded into modes with specific renormalization group scaling properties. The present cluster expansion for a vacuum expectation value is formally the natural factorization of each term in the perturbation expansion into the contribution of modes connected to the variables in the expectation via interactions, and that of the complementary set. The expectation value is thus realized as a sum of contributions due tofinite subsets of the modes. We emphasize the following additional features:1)Partitions of unity are not used.2)There areessentially no cut-offs.3)The expansion is developed directly, without an initial need to prove an ultraviolet stability bound, the most difficult part of the traditional approach.\nOur main interest in the present phase cell cluster expansion is founded in the belief that it may be the right vehicle for proving the existence of a nontrivial four-dimensional field theory."
