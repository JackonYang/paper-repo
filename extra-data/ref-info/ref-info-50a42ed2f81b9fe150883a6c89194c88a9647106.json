                "text": "The problems of statistics are broadly classified into problems of specification and problems of inference, and a brief recapitulation is given of some standard methods in statistics, based on the use of the probability p (S/H) of the data S on the specification H (or on the use of the equivalent likelihood function). The general problems of specification and inference for time-series are then also briefly surveyed. To conclude Part I, the relation is examined between the information (entropy) concept used in communication theory, associated with specification, and Fisher's information concept used in statistics, associated with inference. In Part II some detailed methods of analysis are described with special reference to stationary time-series. The first method is concerned with the analysis of probability chains (in which the variable X can assume only a finite number of values or 'states', and the time t is discrete). The next section deals with autoregressive and autocorrelation analysis, for series defined either for discrete or continuous time, including proper allowance for sampling fluctuations; in particular, least-squares estimation of unknown coefficients in linear autogressive representations, and Quenouille's goodness of fit test for the correlogram, are illustrated. Harmonic or periodogram analysis is theoretically equivalent to autocorrelation analysis, but in the case of time-series with continuous spectra is valueless in practice without some smoothing device, owing to the peculiar distributional properties of the observed periodogram; one such arithmetical device is described in Section 7. Finally the precise use of the likelihood function (when available) is illustrated by reference to two different theoretical series giving rise to the same autocorrelation function."

The large-sample theory developed by Cox, outlined in ? 2, is extended to two main types of problem. In the first, the time series is generated by an autoregression of specified order p under one hypothesis and by a movingaverage of specified order q under the other; the particular case p = q = 1 is treated in ? 3 and the general case in ? 4. In the second, the series is generated by a simple harmonic oscillation with superimposed random error under one hypothesis and by an autoregression under the other; this is treated in ? 5. More general types of problem are considered in ? 6, but for these the computations required by the procedure may be impracticable."

                "text": "This paper proves consistency and asymptotic normality of maximum likelihood (ML) estimators under weaker conditions than usual. In particular, (i) it is not assumed that the true distribution underlying the observations belongs to the parametric family defining the ML estimator, and (ii) the regularity conditions do not involve the second and higher derivatives of the likelihood function. The need for theorems on asymptotic normality of ML estimators subject to (i) and (ii) becomes apparent in connection with robust estimation problems; for instance, if one tries to extend the author's results on robust estimation of a location parameter [4] to multivariate and other more general estimation problems. Wald's classical consistency proof [6] satisfies (ii) and can easily be modified to show that the ML estimator is consistent also in case (i), that is, it converges to the 0o characterized by the property E(logf(x, 0) log f(x, O0)) < 0 for 0 . Oo, where the expectation is taken with respect to the true underlying distribution. Asymptotic normality is more troublesome. Daniels [1] proved asymptotic normality subject to (ii), but unfortunately he overlooked that a crucial step in his proof (the use of the central limit theorem in (4.4)) is incorrect without condition (2.2) of Linnik [5]; this condition seems to be too restrictive for many purposes. In section 4 we shall prove asymptotic normality, assuming that the ML estimator is consistent. For the sake of completeness, sections 2 and 3 contain, therefore, two different sets of sufficient conditions for consistency. Otherwise, these sections are independent of each other. Section 5 presents two examples."

This noise is taken to be generated by a stationary, ergodic, purely nondeterministic process. In case the observed vector sequence is generated by an autoregressive-moving average process then (a little more than) the additional requirement that the best predictor be the best linear predictor suffices for the development of an asymptotic inference theory. Signal measurement problems are considered, first where the signal is directly observed except for some unknown parameters and second where the signal is not directly observable and some characteristics, such as the velocity of propagation, have to be measured. Finally nonstationary models, nonlinear models for prediction, transient signals, and irregularly spaced samples are briefly discussed. Throughout, the methods are based on the use of the fast Fourier transforms of the data and their relation to the use of quasimaximum likelihoods in terms of those transforms is discussed."

However, the Kalman filter requires a knowledge of all the system and noise parameters. Here it is assumed that all these parameters are unknown and therefore must be identified before use in the Kalman filter. A correlation technique which identifies a system in its canonical form is presented. The estimates are shown to be asymptotically normal, unbiased, and consistent. The scheme is capable of being implemented on-line and can be used in conjunction with the Kalman filter. A technique for more efficient estimation by using higher order correlations is also given. A recursive technique is given to determine the order of the system when the dimension of the system is unknown. The results are first derived for stationary processes and are then extended to nonstationary processes which are stationary in the q th increment. An application of the results to a practical problem is presented."

Here we consider the case in which the true values of Q and R are unknown. The system is assumed to be constant, and the random inputs are stationary. First, a correlation test is given which checks whether a particular Kalman filter is working optimally or not. If the filter is suboptimal, a technique is given to obtain asymptotically normal, unbiased, and consistent estimates of Q and R . This technique works only for the case in which the form of Q is known and the number of unknown elements in Q is less than n \\times r where n is the dimension of the state vector and r is the dimension of the measurement vector. For other cases, the optimal steady-state gain K op is obtained directly by an iterative procedure without identifying Q . As a corollary, it is shown that the steady-state optimal Kalman filter gain K op depends only on n \\times r linear functionals of Q . The results are first derived for discrete systems. They are then extended to continuous systems. A numerical example is given to show the usefulness of the approach."

The predictor space constructed, by stochastic input and output processes forms the state space for the stochastic system representation, where a system is represented by the basis of the predictor space and the innovation process of input. The minimal realization problem is then solved for a given analytic impulse response matrix by defining a stochastic system driven by white noise whose input-output covariance equals the given impulse response matrix. It is shown that the coefficient matrices of the stochastic system representation constitute a solution to the minimal realization problem for the deterministic system with given impulse response matrix. The paper provides a unifying overview to many aspects of the realization problem and its algorithms."
