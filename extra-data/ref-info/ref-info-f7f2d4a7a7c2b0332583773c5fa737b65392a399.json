The aim of this study is to determine valid constraints that are sufficient to allow surface orientation and distance (up to a multiplicative constant) to be computed from the image of surface texture and of surface contours. The report is in three parts. Part I consists of a review of major theories of surface perception, a discussion of vision as computation and of the nature in which three-dimensional information is manifest in the image, and a study of the representation of local surface orientation. Part II reconisiders the familiar 'texture gradient'. Part III examines our preception of surface contours. It is shown that surface contours are strong sources of information about local surface shape."

We illustrate the use of these constraints to carry out geometric interpretation of images up to the volumetric level. A general coincidence assumption is used to derive suggestive but incomplete interpretations for local features. A reasoning system is described which can use these suggestive hypotheses to derive consistent global interpretations, while maintaining the ability to remove the implications of hypotheses which are disproved in the face of further evidence. An important aspect of interpretation is the classification of image boundaries (intensity discontinuities) into those caused by geometric, reflectance, or illumination discontinuities. These interact with other hypotheses regarding occlusion by solid objects, the direction of illumination, aspects of object geometry, and the production of illumination discontinuities by geometric discontinuities. Although only a subset of the constraints and system design features have been implemented to date, we demonstrate the successful interpretation of some simulated image boundaries up to the volumetric level, including the construction of a three-space model."

The pictures are first geometrically normalized to a common point of view. Then they are photometrically normalized to eliminate the differences due to different illumination, camera characteristics, and reflectance properties of the scene due to different sun and view angles. These pictures are then geometrically registered by maximizing the cross correlation between areas in them. The final normalized and registered pictures are then differenced point by point."

The basis for solving this problem lies in an understanding of projective geometry, coupled with simple statistical models of the contour generating process. This approach is first applied to the special case of surfaces known to be planar. The distortion of contour shape imposed by projection is treated as a signal to be estimated, and variations of non-projective origin are treated as noise. The resulting method is next extended to the estimation of curved surfaces, and applied successfully to natural images. The statistical estimation strategy is then experimentally compared to human perception of orientation: human observers' judgements of tilt correspond closely to the estimates produced by the planar strategy."

                "text": "An introduction is given to a theory of early visual information processing. The theory has been implemented, and examples are given of images at various stages of analysis. It is argued that the first step of consequence is to compute a primitive but rich description of the grey-level changes present in an image. The description is expressed in a vocabulary of kinds of intensity change (EDGE, SHADING-EDGE, EXTENDED-EDGE, LINE, BLOB etc.). Modifying parameters are bound to the elements in the description, specifying their POSITION, ORIENTATION, TERMINATION points, CONTRAST, SIZE and FUZZINESS. This description is obtained from the intensity array by fixed techniques, and it is called the primal sketch. For most images, the primal sketch is large and unwieldy. The second important step in visual information processing is to group its contents in a way that is appropriate for later recognition. From our ability to interpret drawings with little semantic content, one may infer the presence in our perceptual equipment of symbolic processes that can define \"place-tokens\" in an image in various ways, and can group them according to certain rules. Homomorphic techniques fail to account for many of these grouping phenomena, whose explanations require mechanisms of construction rather than mechanisms of detection. The necessary grouping of elements in the primal sketch may be achieved by a mechanism that has available the processes inferred from above, together with the ability to select items by first order discriminations acting on the elements' parameters. Only occasionally do these mechanisms use downward-flowing information about the contents of the particular image being processed. It is argued that \"non-attentive\" vision is in practice implemented by these grouping operations and first order discriminations acting on the primal sketch. The class of computations so obtained differs slightly from the class of second order operations on the intensity array. The extraction of a form from the primal sketch using these techniques amounts to the separation of figure from ground. It is concluded that most of the separation can be carried out by using techniques that do not depend upon the particular image in question. Therefore, figure-ground separation can normally precede the description of the shape of the extracted form. Up to this point, higher-level knowledge and purpose are brought to bear on only a few of the decisions taken during the processing. This relegates the widespread use of downward-flowing information to a later stage than is found in current machine-vision programs, and implies that such knowledge should influence the control of, rather than interfering with, the actual data-processing that is taking place lower down."

The method of characteristics can be used to do this, but it suffers from a number of theoretical difficulties and implementation problems. This thesis presents an iterative relaxation algorithm for solving this equation on a grid of points. Here, repeated local computations eventually lead to a global solution. The algorithm solves for the surface orientation at each point by employing an iterative relaxation scheme. The constraint of surface smoothness is achieved while simultaneously satisfying the constraints imposed by the equation of image illumination. The algorithm has the distinct advantage of being capable of handling any reflectance function whether analytically or empirically specified. Included are brief overviews of some of the more important shape-from-shading algorithms in existence and a list of potential applications of this iterative approach to several image domains including scanning electron microscopy, remote sensing of topography and industrial inspection.

With the increasing demand for 3-D spatial information for tasks of passive navigation [7,12], automatic surveillance [9], aerial cartography [10,13], and inspection in industrial automation, the importance of effective stereo analysis has been made quite clear. A particular challenge is to provide reliable and accurate depth data for input to object or terrain modelling systems (such as [5]. This paper describes an algorithm for such stereo sensing It uses an edge-based line-by-line stereo correlation scheme, and appears to be fast, robust, and parallel implementable. The processing consists of extracting edge descriptions for a stereo pair of images, linking these edges to their nearest neighbors to obtain the edge connectivity structure, correlating the edge descriptions on the basis of local edge properties, then cooperatively removmg those edge correspondences determined to be in error - those which violate the connectivity structure of the two images. A further correlation process, using a technique similar to that used for the edges, is applied to the image intensity values over intervals defined by the previous correlation The result of the processing is a full image array disparity map of the scene viewed."

Automatic navigation using visible light or radar images requires exact alignment of such images with digital terrain models. In addition, automatic classification of terrain, using satellite imagery, requires such alignment to deal correctly with the effects of varying sun angle and surface slope. Even inspection techniques for certain industrial parts may be improved by this means.\nWe achieve the required alignment by matching the real image with a synthetic image obtained from a surface model and known positions of the light sources. The synthetic image intensity is calculated using the reflectance map, a convenient way of describing surface reflection as a function of surface gradient. We illustrate the technique using LANDSAT images and digital terrain models."

Previous work has shown how optical flow arises when an observer moves through the static environment. The inverse problem is investigated here: how to recover intrinsic characteristics of the environment from optical flow patterns. The first result is a method for computing the local slant of surfaces relative to the moving observer. The second result is a method for detecting and discriminating among the five types of edges that form the boundaries of surfaces. The results have been formalised as mathematical equations, a physiological model, and a computer program. Properties and predictions resulting from these formal models are discussed with regard to experimental findings in psychophysics."

Therefore, implicit in the perceptual analysis of occluding contour must lie various assumptions about the viewed surfaces. The assumptions that seem most natural are (a) that the distinction between convex and concave segments reflects real properties of the viewed surface; and (b) that contiguous portions of contour arise from contiguous parts of the viewed surface \u2013 i. e. there are no invisible obscuring edges. It is proved that, for smooth surfaces, these assumptions are essentially equivalent to assuming that the viewed surface is a generalized cone. Methods are defined for finding the axis of such a cone, and for segmenting a surface constructed of several cones into its components, whose axes can then be found separately. These methods provide one link between an uninterpreted figure extracted from an image, and the 3-D representation theory of Marr & Nishihara (1977)."

The reflectance map, showing scene radiance as a function of surface gradient, has proved to be helpful in this endeavor. The reflectance map depends both on the nature of the surface layers of the objects being imaged and the distribution of light sources. Recently, a unified approach to the specification of surface reflectance in terms of both incident and reflected beam geometry has been proposed. The reflecting properties of a surface are specified in terms of the bidirectional reflectance-distribution function (BRDF). Here we derive the reflectance map in terms of the BRDF and the distribution of source radiance. A number of special cases of practical importance are developed in detail. The significance of this approach to the understanding of image formation is briefly indicated."

                "text": "A theory of edge detection is presented. The analysis proceeds in two parts. (1) Intensity changes, which occur in a natural image over a wide range of scales, are detected separately at different scales. An appropriate filter for this purpose at a given scale is found to be the second derivative of a Gaussian, and it is shown that, provided some simple conditions are satisfied, these primary filters need not be orientation-dependent. Thus, intensity changes at a given scale are best detected by finding the zero values of \u22072G(x, y)* I(x, y) for image I, where G(x, y) is a two-dimensional Gaussian distribution and \u22072 is the Laplacian. The intensity changes thus discovered in each of the channels are then represented by oriented primitives called zero-crossing segments, and evidence is given that this representation is complete. (2) Intensity changes in images arise from surface discontinuities or from reflectance or illumination boundaries, and these all have the property that they are spatially localized. Because of this, the zero-crossing segments from the different channels are not independent, and rules are deduced for combining them into a description of the image. This description is called the raw primal sketch. The theory explains several basic psychophysical findings, and the operation of forming oriented zero-crossing segments from the output of centre-surround \u22072G filters acting on the image forms the basis for a physiological model of simple cells (see Marr & Ullman 1979)."

The choice of such a representation depends on several factors, including the purpose for which the representation is intended, the visual effects tha t are desired, and the shape of the object. This paper describes how twodimensional views can be obtained using planar geometric projections such as perspective and parallel projections. It discusses how these projections can be generated from a threedimensional representation of an object in a manner suitable for computer graphics systems. In particular, it shows how these projections can be generated using the viewing transformations of the Core Graphics System. The factors tha t affect the choice of projection are also discussed, and some guidelines for making such a choice are given."

The primitives are the simple parts and intrusions of the shape which can be derived through the graph-theoretic clustering procedure described in [31]. The interrelationships are two ternary relations on the primitives: the intrusion relation which relates two simple parts that join to the intrusion they surround and the protrusion relation which relates two intrusions to the protrusion between them. Using this model, a shape matching procedure that uses a tree search with look-ahead to find mappings from a prototype shape to a candidate shape has been developed. An experimental Snobol4 implementation has been used to test the program on hand-printed character data with favorable results."

Here we concentrate on objects with specularly reflecting surfaces, since these are of importance in industrial applications. Previous methods, intended for diffusely reflecting surfaces, employed point source illumination, which is quite unsuitable in this case. Instead, we use a distributed light source obtained by uneven illumination of a diffusely reflecting planar surface. Experimental results are shown to verify analytic expressions obtained for a method employing three light source distributions."

The mathematics necessary to convert a set of matchings into a workable camera model are given, along with calculations which use this model and a pair of image points to locate the corresponding scene point. Methods are included to detect some types of unmatchable target areas in the original data and for detecting when a supposed match is invalid. Region growing techniques are di9 for extend matching areas into regions of constant parallax and for delimiting uniform regions in an image. Also, two algorithms are presented to show some of the ways in which these techniques can be combined to perform useful tasks in the processing of stereo images."

This world model includes a model of the scene, a model of the eye (camera), and a model of the illumination. Secondly, using this description, we have to recognize objects in the scene which match this description before we can remove them, that is, filter them out. Thirdly, we show that the strategy of sequencing the procedures (deciding which object in the scene is recognized when) is guided by the world model and the visibility of objects on the scene. Since the filtering process involves recognition of the visual concepts of objects, we call it conceptual filtering. Similarly, since the guided strategy of the scene analysis, depends on partial recognition of the scene, we call it conceptual focusing. The preceding points are demonstrated by a concrete example of computer recognition of bridges, rivers, lakes, and islands from ERTS satellite pictures."

Complex objects are represented as structures joining parts called generalized cylinders. These primitives are formalized in a volume representation by an arbitrary cross section varying along a space curve axis. Several types of joint structures are discussed. Experimental results are shown for the description (building of internal computer models) of a handful of complex objects, beginning with laser range data from actual objects. Our programs have generated complete descriptions of rings, cones, and snake-like objects, all of which may be described by a single primitive. Complex objects, such as dolls, have been segmented into parts, most of which are well described by programs which implement generalized cylinder descriptions."

A second constraint is needed. A method for finding the optical flow pattern is presented which assumes that the apparent velocity of the brightness pattern varies smoothly almost everywhere in the image. An iterative implementation is shown which successfully computes the optical flow for a number of synthetic image sequences. The algorithm is robust in that it can handle image sequences that are quantized rather coarsely in space and time. It is also insensitive to quantization of brightness levels and additive noise. Examples are included where the assumption of smoothness is violated at singular points or along lines in the image."

In particular, can the shape of an object be reconstructed by measuring the light it reflects from points on its surface? These questions were raised by Horn (H070) who formulated a set of conditions such that the image formation can be described in terms of a first order partial differential equation, the image irradiance equation. In general, an image irradiance equation has infinitely many solutions. Thus constraints necessary to find a unique solution need to be identified. First we study the continuous image irradiance equation. It is demonstrated when and how the knowledge of the position of edges on a surface can be used to reconstruct the surface. Furthermore we show how much about the shape of a surface can be deduced from so called singular points. At these points the surface orientation is uniquely determined by the measured brightness. Then we investigate images in which certain types of silhouettes, which we call b-silhouettes, can be detected. In particular we answer the following question in the affirmative: Is there a set of constraints which assure that if an image irradiance equation has a solution, it is unique? To this end we postulate three constraints upon the image irradiance equation and prove that they are sufficient to uniquely reconstruct the surface from its image."

In this paper, we apply this approach to the problem of representing three-dimensional shapes for the purpose of recognition. 1. Three criteria, accessibility, scope and uniqueness, and stability and sensitivity, are presented for judging the usefulness of a representation for shape recognition. 2. Three aspects of a representation\u2019s design are considered, (i) the representation\u2019s coordinate system, (ii) its primitives, which are the primary units of shape information used in the representation, and (iii) the organization the representation imposes on the information in its descriptions. 3. In terms of these design issues and the criteria presented, a shape representation for recognition should: (i) use an object-centred coordinate system, (ii) include volumetric primitives of varied sizes, and (iii) have a modular organization. A representation based on a shape\u2019s natural axes (for example the axes identified by a stick figure) follows directly from these choices. 4. The basic process for deriving a shape description in this representation must involve: (i) a means for identifying the natural axes of a shape in its image and (ii) a mechanism for transforming viewer-centred axis specifications to specifications in an object-centred coordinate system. 5. Shape recognition involves: (i) a collection of stored shape descriptions, and (ii) various indexes into the collection that allow a newly derived description to be associated with an appropriate stored description. The most important of these indexes allows shape recognition to proceed conservatively from the general to the specific based on the specificity of the information available from the image. 6. New constraints supplied by a conservative recognition process can be used to extract more information from the image. A relaxation process for carrying out this constraint analysis is described."

This theory predicts that if occlusion cues are not interpreted as evidence of occlusion, no intervening surface need be postulated, hence no subjective contours would be seen. This prediction, however, is difficult to test because observers normally interpret the cues as occlusion evidence and normally see the subjective contours. This article describes a patient with visual agnosia who is both unable to make the usual occlusion interpretations and is unable to see subjective contours. He has, however, normal ability to interpret standard visual illusions, stereograms, and in particular, stereogram versions of the standard subjective contour figures, which elicit to him strong subjective edges in depth (corresponding to the subjective contours viewed in the monocular versions of the figures).

The scenes which consisted of 6 samples from each of the nine categories scrub, orchard, heavily wooded, urban, suburban, lake, swamp, marsh, and railroad yard was analyzed manually and automatically. For the automatic analysis, a set of features measuring the spatial dependence of the grey tones of neighboring resolution cells was defined. On the basis of these features and a simple decision rule which assumed that the features were independent and uniformly distributed on identification accuracy of 70% was achieved by training of 53 samples and assigning an identification to the 54th sample and repeating the experiment 54 times. This identification accuracy must be compared with the average 81% correct identification which five photointerpreters achieved with the same scenes, although the 81% correct identification is the accuracy achieved when they used the 9\" \u00d7 9\" photograph to interpret from. Note that the photograph is data of considerably higher resolution having much more context information on it than the small digitized 1/8\" \u00d7 1/8\" area the automatic analysis had available."

The algorithm consists of five steps: (1) Each image is filtered at different orientations with bar masks of four sizes that increase with eccentricity; the equivalent filters are one or two octaves wide. (2) Zero-crossings in the filtered images, which roughly correspond to edges, are localized. Positions of the ends of lines and edges are also found. (3) For each mask orientation and size, matching takes place between pairs of zero-crossings or terminations of the same sign in the two images, for a range of disparities up to about the width of the mask\u2019s central region. (4) Wide masks can control vergence movements, thus causing small masks to come into correspondence. (5) When a correspondence is achieved, it is stored in a dynamic buffer, called the 2\u00bd-D sketch. It is shown that this proposal provides a theoretical framework for most existing psychophysical and neurophysiological data about stereopsis. Several critical experimental predictions are also made, for instance about the size of Panum\u2019s area under various conditions. The results of such experiments would tell us whether, for example, co-operativity is necessary for the matching process."

This paper describes the design and hardware implementation of a particular operator of visual processing. I constructed an NMOS VLSI circuit that computes the gradient, and detects zero-crossings, in a digital video image in real time. The algorithms employed by the chip, the design process that led to it, and its capabilites and limitations are discussed. For hardware to be a useful tool for AI, designing it must be as much like programming as possible. This paper concludes with some discussion of how such a goal can be met."

There are nine labels associated with each image point, eight labels indicating line segments at various orientations and one indicating the no-line case. Attached to each label is a probability. In the relaxation process, interaction takes place among the probabilities at neighboring points. This permits line segments in compatible orientations to strengthen one another, and incompatible segments to weaken one another. Similarly, no-line labels are reinforced by neighboring no-line labels and weakened by appropriately oriented line labels. This process converges, in only a few iterations, to a condition in which points lying on long curves have achieved high line probabilities, while other points have high no-line probabilities, There is some tendency, under this process, for curves to thicken; however, a thinning procedure can be incorporated to counteract this. The process is effective even for curves of low contrast, and even when many curves lie close to one another."

The algorithm consists of five steps: (1) Each image is filtered with bar masks of four sizes that vary with eccentricity; the equivalent filters are about one octave wide. (2) Zero-crossings of the mask values are localized, and positions that correspond to terminations are found; (3) For each mask size, matching takes place between pairs of zero- crossings or terminations of the same sign in the two images, for a range of disparities up to about the vergence movements, thus causing small masks to come into correspondence; (5) When a correspondence is achieved, it is written into a dynamic buffer, called the 2 1/2 D sketch. It is shown that this proposal provides a theoretical framework for most existing phychophysical and neurophysiological data about stereopsis. Several critical experimental predictions are also made, for instance, about the wsize of Panum?s area under various conditions. The results of such experiments would tell us whether, for example, cooperativity is necessary for the fusion process."

In this paper we consider the problem of optimizing spatial frequency domain filters for detecting edges in digital pictures. The filter is optimum in that it produces maximum energy within a resolution interval of specified width in the vicinity of the edge. We show that, in the continuous case, the filter transfer function is specified in terms of the prolate spheroidal wave function. In the discrete case, the filter transfer function is specified in terms of the sampled values of the first-order prolate spheroidal wave function or in terms of the sampled values of an asymptotic approximation of the wave function. Both versions can be implemented via the fast Fourier transform (FFT). We show that the optimum filter is very effective for detecting blufred and noisy edges. Finally, we compare the performance of the optimum edge detection filter with other edge detection filters using a variety of input images."

The zero crossings of \u22072G(x, y) \u2217 I(x, y) are located, as in Marr & Hildreth (1980). That is, the image is filtered through centre-surround receptive fields, and the zero values in the output are found. In addition, the time derivative \u2202[\u22072G(x, y) \u2217 l(x, y)]/\u2202t is measured at the zero crossings, and serves to constrain the local direction of motion to within 180\u00b0. The direction of motion can be determined in a second stage, for example by combining the local constraints. The second part of the paper suggests a specific model of the information processing by the X and Y cells of the retina and lateral geniculate nucleus, and certain classes of cortical simple cells.

We suggest that there has been a close parallel in the development of theories of reading and theories of vision in artificial intelligence. We propose to exploit and extend recent results in computer vision to develop an improved model of early processing in reading. This paper considers the problem of isolating words in text based on the information which Marr and Hildreth's (1980) theory asserts is available in the parafovea. We show in particular that the findings of Fisher (1975) on reading transformed texts can be accounted for without postulating the need for complex interactions between early processing and downflowing information as he suggests. The paper concludes with a brief discussion of the problem of integrating information over successive saccades, and relates the earlier analysis to the empirical findings of Rayner."

It is suggested that there may exist motion-sensitive cells in the visual system which operate on the optical flow over the retina, and, in so doing, structure the visual field in terms of distinct surfaces that move and/or lie at varying distances from the observer. First, concepts of static and dynamic perspective relative to a sphere centered about the eye are developed, partly on the basis of the work of Gordon. It is pointed out that the velocity flow pattern has a very simple form making it amenable to analysis by relatively low-level mechanisms. Next a higher-order variable of optical flow, the \u2018convexity\u2019, is defined; under the assumption of a rigid environment, convexity is shown to be related to relative depth. It is then postulated that velocity-sensitive cells having center\u2014surround organization could be linked in such a way as to define a higher-order cell, the convexity cell, having functional properties that make it sensitive to the convexity function. The response profile of a layer of such cells would provide an efficient structuring of the visual field in terms of distinct optical surfaces. Relevant evidence is briefly discussed. Lastly, the optical flow patterns corresponding to rotations of the observer are considered. It is shown that the convexity cell is insensitive to rotations and in consequence responds in an invariant fashion to aspects of the optical flow which are related to the surrounding environment."

The visual system must achieve this remarkable result by a scheme that does not measure flux. Such a scheme is described as the basis of retinex theory. This theory assumes that there are three independent cone systems, each starting with a set of receptors peaking, respectively, in the long-, middle-, and short-wavelength regions of the visible spectrum. Each system forms a separate image of the world in terms of lightness that shows a strong correlation with reflectance within its particular band of wavelengths. These images are not mixed, but rather are compared to generate color sensations. The problem then becomes how the lightness of areas in these separate images can be independent of flux. This article describes the mathematics of a lightness scheme that generates lightness numbers, the biologic correlate of reflectance, independent of the flux from objects"

Such motion patterns in animals and men are termed here as biological motion. They are characterized by a far higher degree of complexity than the patterns of simple mechanical motions usually studied in our laboratories. In everyday perceptions, the visual information from biological motion and from the corresponding figurative contour patterns (the shape of the body) are intermingled. A method for studying information from the motion pattern per se without interference with the form aspect was devised. In short, the motion of the living body was represented by a few bright spots describing the motions of the main joints. It is found that 10\u201312 such elements in adequate motion combinations in proximal stimulus evoke a compelling impression of human walking, running, dancing, etc. The kinetic-geometric model for visual vector analysis originally developed in the study of perception of motion combinations of the mechanical type was applied to these biological motion patterns. The validity of this model in the present context was experimentally tested and the results turned out to be highly positive."

The parallax field is decomposed into elementary transformations: a translation, a rigid rotation, a similarity, and a deformation. A topologically invariant classification based on critical-point analysis is also obtained. It is shown that the field is either that of a node or that of a saddle point. Numerical results for a general case are offered as illustration. We discuss the relevance of the local, as opposed to the global structure of the parallax field for visual perception and the visual space sense."

It has been proposed that there exist four such mechanisms, operating everywhere in the visual field, with the smallest mechanism having a central excitatory width of 3 in. of arc in the central fovea. This note argues that there exists indirect evidence for the existence of a fifth, smaller channel, with a central width in the fovea of 1.5 in. (Author)"

A computer has been programmed to drive the cart through cluttered indoor and outdoor spaces, gaining its knowledge of the world entirely from images broadcast by the onboard TV system. The cart uses several kinds of stereo to locate objects around it in 3D and to deduce its own motion. It plans an obstacle avoiding path to a desired destination on the basis of a model built with this information. The plan changes as the cart perceives new obstacles on its journey. The system is reliable for short runs, but slow. The cart moves one meter every ten to fifteen minutes, in lurches. After rolling a meter it stops, takes some pictures and thinks about them for a long time. Then it plans a new path, executes a little of it, and pauses again. The program has successfully driven the cart through several 20 meter indoor courses (each taking about five hours) complex enough to necessitate three or four avoiding swerves. A less successful outdoor run, in which the cart skirted two obstacles but collided with a third, was also done. Harsh lighting (very bright surfaces next to very dark shadows) giving poor pictures and movement of shadows during the cart's creeping progress were major reasons for the poorer outdoor performance. The action portions of these runs were filmed by computer controlled cameras. (Author)"

The effectiveness of such motion specification formalisms is greatly increased if the tool moves in a straight line between the user-specified points. This paper describes two methods for achieving such straight line motions. The first method is a refinement of one developed in 1974 by R. Paul. Intermediate points are interpolated along the Cartesian straight line path at regular intervals during the motion, and the manipulator's kinematic equations are solved to produce the corresponding intermediate joint parameter values. The path interpolation functions developed here offer several advantages, including less computational cost and improved motion characteristics. The second method uses a motion planning phase to precompute enough intermediate points so that the manipulator may be driven by interpolation of joint parameter values while keeping the tool on an approximately straight line path. This technique allows a substantial reduction in real time computation and permits problems arising from degenerate joint alignments to be handled more easily. The planning is done by an efficient recursive algorithm which generates only enough intermediate points to guarantee that the tool's deviation from a straight line path stays within prespecified error bounds."

                "text": "DAMAGE to striate cortex and neighbouring regions in man is well known to produce severe loss of visual capacity in correlated legions of the visual field (Holmes, 1918; Teuber, Battersby and Bender, 1960). Depending on the duration, nature and extent of the damage, and the method of measurement, the resultant blindness may be more or less absolute. In the most extreme examples, a patient may acknowledge no visual information or only the onset or offset of a light in the scotoma. In less extreme cases vigorously moving or flickering stimuli may be seen (Riddoch, 1917). It is generally held, however, that man is more severely impaired by damage to the visual cortex than the monkey, even though the anatomical organizations of the visual pathways and cortex are closely similar. Indeed, the more thoroughly the monkey has been studied, the more remarkable has been the extent of residual visual capacity found: for example, the ability to discriminate twodimensional patterns even when the whole of the striate cortex has been removed, with complete retrograde degeneration of the dorsal lateral geniculate nuclei (Pasik and Pasik, 1971). It has even been suggested that the monkey without striate cortex may be capable of qualitatively normal pattern vision but with reduced visual acuity (Weiskrantz, 1972; cf. Ward and Masterton, 1970). Recent animal results, however, also suggest strongly that a severe penalty is inflicted when damage to neighbouring posterior cortical areas is added to that of the striate cortex (Pasik and Pasik, 1971). For this reason, human cases in which damage is relatively restricted to area 17 (the only known cortical projection from the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus), with only minimal damage to surrounding tissue, have a renewed interest. There also have been suggestions, based on animal research, that the type of visual information processed by the direct pathway from the retina to the mid-brain is qualitatively different from that by the geniculo-cortical route (the \"two visual system\" hypothesis: Schneider, 1969; Trevarthen, 1968; Ingle, 1967). The former, it has been claimed, is primarily concerned with the detection of \"salient\" visual events in space and the control of ocular fixation, and the latter with the identification"

The Hearsay-II architecture is the latest attempt to explore the model. This paper describes experiences gained while successfully applying this architecture to the problem of speech understanding. The major conclusions are: 1. The paradigm of viewing problem solving in terms of hypothesize-and-test actions distributed among distinct representations of the problem has been shown to be computationally feasible. 2. A global working memory (the \"blackboard\"), in which the distinct representations are integrated in a uniform manner, has made it convenient to construct and integrate the individual sources of knowledge needed for the problem solution. 3. The use of a uniform data-directed structure for controlling knowledge-source activity has made the system easy to understand and modify. 4. A solution has been demonstrated to the problem of focus-of-attention in this type of control environment. This solution does not need to be modified when the sources of knowledge in the system are changed."
