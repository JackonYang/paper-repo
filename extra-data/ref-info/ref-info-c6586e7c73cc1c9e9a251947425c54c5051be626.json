Interestingly, state of the art language models for speech recognition are based on a very crude linguistic model, namely conditioning the probability of a word on a small fixed number of preceding words. Despite many attempts to incorporate more sophisticated information into the models, the n-gram model remains the state of the art, used in virtually all speech recognition systems. In this paper we address the question of whether there is hope in improving language modeling by incorporating more sophisticated linguistic and world knowledge, or whether the n-grams are already capturing the majority of the information that can be employed."

In statistical language modeling, large amounts of text are used to automatically determine the model's parameters. Language modeling is useful in automatic speech recognition, machine translation, and any other application that processes natural language with incomplete knowledge. In this thesis, I view language as an information source which emits a stream of symbols from a finite alphabet (the vocabulary). The goal of language modeling is then to identify and exploit sources of information in the language stream, so as to minimize its perceived entropy. Most existing statistical language models exploit the immediate past only. To extract information from further back in the document's history, I use trigger pairs as the basic information bearing elements. This allows the model to adapt its expectations to the topic of discourse. Next, statistical evidence from many sources must be combined. Traditionally, linear interpolation and its variants have been used, but these are shown here to be seriously deficient. Instead, I apply the principle of Maximum Entropy (ME). Each information source gives rise to a set of constraints, to be imposed on the combined estimate. The intersection of these constraints is the set of probability functions which are consistent with all the information sources. The function with the highest entropy within that set is the NE solution. Language modeling, Adaptive language modeling, Statistical language modeling, Maximum entropy, Speech recognition."

We describe an algorithm for determining maximum-likelihood estimates of the parameters of these models. The language models which we present differ from previous models based on stochastic context-free grammars in that they are highly lexical. In particular, they include the familiar $n$-gram models as a natural subclass. The motivation for considering this class is to estimate the contribution which grammar can make to reducing the relative entropy of natural language."

Since the possible strings may be acoustically similar, a language model is required; given a word string, the model returns its linguistic probability. Several Markov language models are discussed. A novel kind of language model which reflects short-term patterns of word use by means of a cache component (analogous to cache memory in hardware terminology) is presented. The model also contains a 3g-gram component of the traditional type. The combined model and a pure 3g-gram model were tested on samples drawn from the Lancaster-Oslo/Bergen (LOB) corpus of English text. The relative performance of the two models is examined, and suggestions for the future improvements are made. >"

Such a grammar expresses the relations between words by a directed graph. Because the edges of this graph may connect words that are arbitrarily far apart in a sentence, this technique can incorporate the predictive power of words that lie outside of bigram or trigram range. we have built several simple dependency models, as we call them, and tested them in a speech recognition experiment. We report experimental results for these models here, including one that has a small but statistically significant advantage (p .02) over a digram language model."

These models construct multi-dimensional hierarchies of partitions and select the most promising partitions to generate the estimated distributions. We discussed a specific two dimensional lattice and propose two primary features to measure the usefulness of each node: the training-set history count and the smoothed entropy of its prediction. Smoothing techniques are reviewed and a generalization of the conventional backoff strategy to multiple dimensions is proposed. Preliminary experimental results are obtained on the SWITCHBOARD corpus which lead to a 6.5% perplexity reduction over a word trigram model."

The resulting static trigram language model (STLM) has fixed probabilities that are independent of the document being dictated. To improve the language model (LM), one can adapt the probabilities of the trigram language model to match the current document more closely. The partially dictated document provides significant clues about what words are more likely to be used next. Of many methods that can be used to adapt the LM, we describe in this paper a simple model based on the trigram frequencies estimated from the partially dictated document. We call this model a cache trigram language model (CTLM) since we are caching the recent history of words. We have found that the CTLM reduces the perplexity of a dictated document by 23%. The error rate of a 20,000-word isolated word recognizer decreases by about 5% at the beginning of a document and by about 24% after a few hundred words."

For such models the number of relevant words in a context is not fixed as in conventional M-gram models but depends on the context itself. We develop a measure for the quality of variable-length models and present a pruning algorithm for the creation of such models, based on this measure. Further we address the question how the use of a special backing-off distribution can improve the language models. Experiments were performed on two data bases, the ARPANAB corpus and the German Verbmobil corpus, respectively. The results show that variable-length models outperform conventional models of the same size. Furthermore it can be seen that if a moderate loss in performance is acceptable, the size of a language model can be reduced drastically by using the presented pruning algorithm."

Specifically, the problem is to estimate the probability that a given word will be the next word uttered. Algorithms are presented for automatically constructing a binary decision tree designed to estimate these probabilities. At each node of the tree there is a yes/no question relating to the words already spoken, and at each leaf there is a probability distribution over the allowable vocabulary. Ideally, these nodal questions can take the form of arbitrarily complex Boolean expressions, but computationally cheaper alternatives are also discussed. Some results obtained on a 5000-word vocabulary with a tree designed to predict the next word spoken from the preceding 20 words are included. The tree is compared to an equivalent trigram model and shown to be superior. >"

By avoiding the chain rule, the model treats each sentence as a \u201cbag of features\", where features are arbitrary computable properties of the sentence. The new model is computationally more efficient, and more naturally suited to modeling global sentential phenomena, than the conditional exponential (e.g. maximum entropy) models proposed to date. Using the model is straightforward. Training the model requires sampling from an exponential distribution. We describe the challenge of applying Monte Carlo Markov Chain and other sampling techniques to natural language, and discuss smoothing and step-size selection. We then present a novel procedure for feature selection, which exploits discrepancies between the existing model and the training corpus. We demonstrate our ideas by constructing and analysing competitive models in the Switchboard and Broadcast News domains, incorporating lexical and syntactic information."

While statistical n-gram modeling can readily take local constraints into account, global constraints have been more difficult to handle within a data-driven formalism. In this work, they are captured via a paradigm first formulated in the context of information retrieval, called latent semantic analysis (LSA). This paradigm seeks to automatically uncover the salient semantic relationships between words and documents in a given corpus. Such discovery relies on a parsimonious vector representation of each word and each document in a suitable, common vector space. Since in this space familiar clustering techniques can be applied, it becomes possible to derive several families of large-span language models, with various smoothing properties. Because of their semantic nature, the new language models are well suited to complement conventional, more syntactically oriented n-grams, and the combination of the two paradigms naturally yields the benefit of a multispan context. An integrative formulation is proposed for this purpose, in which the latent semantic information is used to adjust the standard n-gram probability. The performance of the resulting multispan language models, as measured by perplexity, compares favorably with the corresponding n-gram performance."

Given training text labeled with topic information, we automatically identify the most relevant topics for new text. We adapt our language model toward these topics using an exponential model, by adjusting the probabilities in our model to agree with those found in the topical subset of the training data. For efficiency, we do not normalize the model; that is, we do not require that the \"probabilities\" in the language model sum to 1. With these techniques, we were able to achieve a modest reduction in speech recognition word-error rate in the broadcast news domain."

This paper presents a generalization of these algorithms to certain denumerable\u2010state, hidden Markov processes. This algorithm permits automatic training of the stochastic analog of an arbitrary context free grammar. In particular, in contrast to many grammatical inference methods, the new algorithm allows the grammar to have an arbitrary degree of ambiguity. Since natural language is often syntactically ambiguous, it is necessary for the grammatical inference algorithm to allow for this ambiguity. Furthermore, allowing ambiguity in the grammar allows errors in the recognition process to be explicitly modeled in the grammar rather than added as an extra component."

It was recently proposed to capture global constraints through the use of latent semantic analysis, while taking local constraints into account via the usual n-gram approach. This has led to several families of data-driven, multispan language models for large vocabulary speech recognition. Because of the inherent complementarity in the two types of constraints, the multispan performance, as measured by perplexity, has been shown to compare favorably with the corresponding n-gram performance. The objective of this work is to characterize the behavior of such multispan modeling in actual recognition. Major implementation issues are addressed, including search integration and context scope selection. Experiments are conducted on a subset of the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) speaker-independent, 20000-word vocabulary, continuous speech task. Results show that, compared to standard n-gram, the multispan framework can lead to a reduction in average word error rate of over 20%. The paper concludes with a discussion of intrinsic multi-span tradeoffs, such as the influence of training data selection on the resulting performance."

Most existing statistical language models exploit only the immediate history of a text. To extract information from further back in the document's history, we propose and usetrigger pairsas the basic information bearing elements. This allows the model to adapt its expectations to the topic of discourse. Next, statistical evidence from multiple sources must be combined. Traditionally, linear interpolation and its variants have been used, but these are shown here to be seriously deficient. Instead, we apply the principle of Maximum Entropy (ME). Each information source gives rise to a set of constraints, to be imposed on the combined estimate. The intersection of these constraints is the set of probability functions which are consistent with all the information sources. The function with the highest entropy within that set is the ME solution. Given consistent statistical evidence, a unique ME solution is guaranteed to exist, and an iterative algorithm exists which is guaranteed to converge to it. The ME framework is extremely general: any phenomenon that can be described in terms of statistics of the text can be readily incorporated. An adaptive language model based on the ME approach was trained on theWall Street Journalcorpus, and showed a 32\u201339% perplexity reduction over the baseline. When interfaced to SPHINX-II, Carnegie Mellon's speech recognizer, it reduced its error rate by 10\u201314%. This thus illustrates the feasibility of incorporating many diverse knowledge sources in a single, unified statistical framework."

Standard bigram probability estimation techniques are extended to calculate probabilities of dependencies between pairs of words. Tests using Wall Street Journal data show that the method performs at least as well as SPATTER (Magerman 95; Jelinek et al. 94), which has the best published results for a statistical parser on this task. The simplicity of the approach means the model trains on 40,000 sentences in under 15 minutes. With a beam search strategy parsing speed can be improved to over 200 sentences a minute with negligible loss in accuracy."

While previous work assumed the effects of word co-occurrence statistics to be constant over a window of several hundred words, we show that their influence is nonstationary on a much smaller time scale. Empirical data drawn from English and Japanese text, as well as conversational speech, reveals that the \"attraction\" between words decays exponentially, while stylistic and syntactic contraints create a \"repulsion\" between words that discourages close co-occurrence. We show that these characteristics are well described by simple mixture models based on two-stage exponential distributions which can be trained using the EM algorithm. The resulting distance distributions can then be incorporated as penalizing features in an exponential language model."

To extract information from the document history, trigger pairs are used as the basic information-bearing elements. To combine statistical evidence from multiple triggers, the principle of maximum entropy (ME) is used. To combine the trigger-based model with the static model, the latter is absorbed into the ME formalism. Given consistent statistical evidence, a unique ME solution is guaranteed to exist, and an iterative algorithm exists which is guaranteed to converge to it. Among the advantages of this approach are its simplicity, generality, and incremental nature. Among its disadvantages are its computational requirements. The model described here was trained on five million words of Wall Street Journal text. It used some 40000 unigram constraints, 200000 bigram constraints, 200000 trigram constraints, and 60000 trigger constraints. After 13 iterations, it produced a language model whose perplexity was 12% lower than that of a conventional trigram, as measured on independent data.<<ETX>>"

First, we develop a sentence-level mixture language model that takes advantage of the topic constraints in a sentence or article. Second, we introduce topic-dependent dynamic cache adaptation techniques in the framework of the mixture model. Experiments with the static (or unadapted) mixture model on the 1994 WSJ task indicated a 21% reduction in perplexity and a 3-4% improvement in recognition accuracy over a general n-gram model. The static mixture model also improved recognition performance over an adapted n-gram model. Mixture adaptation techniques contributed a further 14% reduction in perplexity and a small improvement in recognition accuracy."

In case of unseen events this method backs off to a less specific distribution. In this paper we propose to use distributions which are especially optimized for the task of backing-off. Two different theoretical derivations lead to distributions which are quite different from the probability distributions that are usually used for backing-off. Experiments show an improvement of about 10% in terms of perplexity and 5% in terms of word error rate."

We investigate whether linguistic features that capture the underlying linguistic structure of a sentence can improve modeling. We use a shallow parser to parse sentences into linguistic constituents in two corpora; one is the original training corpus, and the other is an artificial corpus generated from an initial trigram model. We define three sets of candidate linguistic features based on these constituents, and compute the prevalence of each feature in the two data sets. We select features with significantly different frequencies. These correspond to phenomena poorly modeled by traditional trigrams, and reveal interesting linguistic deficiencies of the initial model. We found 6798 linguistic features in the Switchboard domain and achieved small improvements in perplexity and speech recognition accuracy with these features."

The task of these distributions is to predict the probability of a new word by looking at M or even all predecessor words. The conventional approach is to limit M to 1 or 2 and to interpolate the resulting bigram and trigram models with a unigram model in a linear fashion. However, there are many other structures that can be used to model the probabilistic dependences between the predecessor word and the word to be predicted. The structures considered in this paper are: nonlinear interpolation as an alternative to linear interpolation; equivalence classes for word histories and single words; cache memory and word associations. For the optimal estimation of nonlinear and linear interpolation parameters, the leaving-one-out method is systematically used. For the determination of word equivalence classes in a bigram model, an automatic clustering procedure has been adapted. To capture long-distance dependences, we consider various models for word-by-word dependences; the cache model may be viewed as a special type of self-association. Experimental results are presented for two text databases, a Germany database and an English database."

Substantial improvements are demonstrated over a trigram model in both perplexity and speech recognition accuracy on the Switchboard task. It is shown that topic dependencies are most useful in predicting words which are semantically related by the subject matter of the conversation. Syntactic dependencies on the other hand are found to be most helpful in positions where the best predictors of the following word are not within N-gram range due to an intervening phrase or clause. It is also shown that these two methods individually enhance an N-gram model in complementary ways and the overall improvement from their combination is nearly additive."

The new model is conceptually simpler, and more naturally suited to modeling whole-sentence phenomena, than the conditional ME models proposed to date. By avoiding the chain rule, the model treats each sentence or utterance as a \"bag of features\", where features are arbitrary computable properties of the sentence. The model is unnormalizable, but this does not interfere with training (done via sampling) or with use. Using the model is computationally straightforward. The main computational cost of training the model is in generating sample sentences from a Gibbs distribution. Interestingly, this cost has different dependencies, and is potentially lower than in the comparable conditional ME model."

                "text": "Topic adaptation for language modeling is concerned with adjusting the probabilities in a language model to better reflect the expected frequencies of topical words for a new document. The language model to be adapted is usually built from large amounts of training text and is considered representative of the current domain. In order to adapt this model for a new document, the topic (or topics) of the new document are identified. Then, the probabilities of words that are more likely to occur in the identified topic(s) than in general are boosted, and the probabilities of words that are unlikely for the identified topic(s) are suppressed. We present a novel technique for adapting a language model to the topic of a document, using a nonlinear interpolation of -gram language models. A three-way, mutually exclusive division of the vocabulary into general, on-topic and off-topic word classes is used to combine word predictions from a topic-specific and a general language model. We achieve a slight decrease in perplexity and speech recognition word error rate on a Broadcast News test set using these techniques. Our results are compared to results obtained through linear interpolation of topic models."

In this paper, we investigate a new statistical language model that captures topic-related dependencies of words within and across sentences. First, we develop a topic-dependent, sentence-level mixture language model which takes advantage of the topic constraints in a sentence or article. Second, we introduce topic-dependent dynamic adaptation techniques in the framework of the mixture model, using n-gram caches and content word unigram caches. Experiments with the static (or unadapted) mixture model on the North American Business (NAB) task show a 21% reduction in perplexity and a 3-4% improvement in recognition accuracy over a general n-gram model, giving a larger gain than that obtained with supervised dynamic cache modeling. Further experiments on the Switchboard corpus also showed a small improvement in performance with the sentence-level mixture model. Cache modeling techniques introduced in the mixture framework contributed a further 14% reduction in perplexity and a small improvement in recognition accuracy on the NAB task for both supervised and unsupervised adaptation."

The length of eachn-gram is increased selectively according to an estimate of the resulting improvement in predictive quality. This allows the model size to be controlled while including longer-range dependencies when these benefit performance. The categories are chosen to correspond to part-of-speech classifications in a bid to exploita priorigrammatical information. To account for different grammatical functions, the language model allows words to belong to multiple categories, and implicitly involves a statistical tagging operation which may be used to label new text. Intrinsic generalization by the category-based model leads to good performance with sparse data sets. However word-basedn-grams deliver superior average performance as the amount of training material increases. Nevertheless, the category model continues to supply better predictions for wordn-tuples not present in the training set. Consequently, a method allowing the two approaches to be combined within a backoff framework is presented. Experiments with the LOB, Switchboard and Wall Street Journal corpora demonstrate that this technique greatly improves language model perplexities for sparse training sets, and offers significantly improved size vs. performance tradeoffs when compared with standard trigram models."

While perplexities can be calculated efficiently and without access to a speech recognizer, they often do not correlate well with speech recognition word-error rates. In this research, we attempt to find a measure that like perplexity is easily calculated but which better predicts speech recognition performance. We investigate two approaches; first, we attempt to extend perplexity by using similar measures that utilize information about language models that perplexity ignores. Second, we attempt to imitate the word-error calculation without using a speech recognizer by artificially generating speech recognition lattices. To test our new metrics, we have built over thirty varied language models. We find that perplexity correlates with word-error rate remarkably well when only considering n-gram models trained on in-domain data. When considering other types of models, our novel metrics are superior to perplexity for predicting speech recognition performance. However, we conclude that none of these measures predict word-error rate sufficiently accurately to be effective tools for language model evaluation in speech recognition."

Furthermore, the conditional framework does not lend itself to expressing global sentential phenomena. We have previously introduced a non-conditional maximum entropy language model which directly models the probability of an entire sentence or utterance. The model treats each utterance as a \"bag of features\", where features are arbitrary computable properties of the sentence. Using the model is computationally straightforward since it does not require normalization. Training the model requires efficient sampling of sentences from an exponential distribution. In this paper, we further develop the model and demonstrate its feasibility and power. We compare the efficiency of several sampling techniques. implement smoothing to accommodate rare features, and suggest an efficient algorithm for improving the convergence rate. We then present a novel procedure for feature selection, which exploits discrepancies between the existing model and the training corpus. We demonstrate our ideas by constructing and analyzing competitive modes in the Switchboard domain."

The central ingredient in this approach is a statistical model of how a user might distill or \"translate\" a given document into a query. To assess the relevance of a document to a user's query, we estimate the probability that the query would have been generated as a translation of the document, and factor in the user's general preferences in the form of a prior distribution over documents. We propose a simple, well motivated model of the document-to-query translation process, and describe an algorithm for learning the parameters of this model in an unsupervised manner from a collection of documents. As we show, one can view this approach as a generalization and justification of the \"language modeling\" strategy recently proposed by Ponte and Croft. In a series of experiments on TREC data, a simple translation-based retrieval system performs well in comparison to conventional retrieval techniques. This prototype system only begins to tap the full potential of translation-based retrieval."

                "text": "Models of document indexing and document retrieval have been extensively studied. The integration of these two classes of models has been the goal of several researchers but it is a very difficult problem. We argue that much of the reason for this is the lack of an adequate indexing model. This suggests that perhaps a better indexing model would help solve the problem. However, we feel that making unwarranted parametric assumptions will not lead to better retrieval performance. Furthermore, making prior assumptions about the similarity of documents is not warranted either. Instead, we propose an approach to retrieval based on probabilistic language modeling. We estimate models for each document individually. Our approach to modeling is non-parametric and integrates document indexing and document retrieval into a single model. One advantage of our approach is that collection statistics which are used heuristically in many other retrieval models are an integral part of our model. We have implemented our model and tested it empirically. Our approach significantly outperforms standard tf.idf weighting on two different collections and query sets."

We quanti ed the loss incurred when working from N -best lists as opposed to lattices, and consequently decided to use 1000-best lists. We learned that doubling the amount of language training data is likely to reduce the word error rate by no more than 2%. We experimented with rank histograms as an alternative measure of modeling progress. We found that a mismatch between segmentation information in the training and test data is a signi cant problem, and that it can be overcome to some extent by hypothesizing boundaries; linguistic boundries were found to be more informative than acoustic ones. Segment based error analysis revealed surprisingly that disuent segments are no more error prone than non-dis uent ones, and long segments are no more erroneous than short ones. Finally, word based error analysis yielded a list of features strongly correlated with word error."

We have developed a language model adaptation scheme that takes a piece of text, chooses the most similar topic clusters from a set of over 5000 elemental topics, and uses topic specific language models built from the topic clusters to rescore N-best lists. We are able to achieve a 15% reduction in perplexity and a small improvement in WER by using this adaptation. We also investigate the use of a topic tree, where the amount of training data for a specific topic can be judiciously increased in cases where the elemental topic cluster has too few word tokens to build a reliably smoothed and representative language model. Our system is able to fine-tune topic adaptation by interpolating models chosen from thousands of topics, allowing for adaptation to unique, previously unseen combinations of subjects."

A sequence of words is in the language of a link grammar if there is a way to draw links between words in such a way that (1) the local requirements of each word are satisfied, (2) the links do not cross, and (3) the words form a connected graph. We have encoded English grammar into such a system, and written a program (based on new algorithms) for efficiently parsing with a link grammar. The formalism is lexical and makes no explicit use of constituents and categories. The breadth of English phenomena that our system handles is quite large. A number of sophisticated and new techniques were used to allow efficient parsing of this very complex grammar. Our program is written in C, and the entire system may be obtained via anonymous ftp. Several other researchers have begun to use link grammars in their own research."

The learning paradigm builds increasingly complex fields by allowing potential functions, or features, that are supported by increasingly large subgraphs. Each feature has a weight that is trained by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the model and the empirical distribution of the training data. A greedy algorithm determines how features are incrementally added to the field and an iterative scaling algorithm is used to estimate the optimal values of the weights. The random field models and techniques introduced in this paper differ from those common to much of the computer vision literature in that the underlying random fields are non-Markovian and have a large number of parameters that must be estimated. Relations to other learning approaches, including decision trees, are given. As a demonstration of the method, we describe its application to the problem of automatic word classification in natural language processing."

Human communication, whether given as text, handwriting, or speech, has multi characteristic time scales. On short scales it is characterized mostly by the dynamics that generate the process, whereas on large scales, more syntactic and semantic information is carried. For that reason the conventionally used fixed memory Markov models cannot capture effectively the complexity of such structures. On the other hand using long memory models uniformly is not practical even for as short memory as four. The algorithm we propose is based on minimizing the statistical prediction error by extending the memory, or state length, adaptively, until the total prediction error is sufficiently small. We demonstrate the algorithm by learning the structure of natural English text and applying the learned model to the correction of corrupted text. Using less than 3000 states the model's performance is far superior to that of fixed memory models with similar number of states. We also show how the algorithm can be applied to intergenic E. coli DNA base prediction with results comparable to HMM based methods."

It is applied to a practical statistical coding scheme, where a slight modification is required to avoid divergence.

Several smoothing methods for ME models have been proposed to address this problem, but previous results do not make it clear how these smoothing methods compare with smoothing methods for other types of related models. In this work, we survey previous work in ME smoothing and compare the performance of several of these algorithms with conventional techniques for smoothing n-gram language models. Because of the mature body of research in n-gram model smoothing and the close connection between ME and conventional n-gram models, this domain is well-suited to gauge the performance of ME smoothing methods. Over a large number of data sets, we find that fuzzy ME smoothing performs as well as or better than all other algorithms under consideration. We contrast this method with previous n-gram smoothing methods to explain its superior performance."

The overall system is composed of several finite state automata, including the main VLMM and a proper noun VLMM. The best model reported in the literature (Brown et al., 1992) achieves 1.75 bits per character on the Brown corpus. On that same corpus, our model, trained on 10 times less data, reaches 2.19 bits per character and is 200 times smaller (/spl sime/160,000 parameters). The model was designed for handwriting recognition applications but could also be used for other OCR problems and speech recognition."

The approach is to take advantage of implicit higher-order structure in the association of terms with documents (\u201csemantic structure\u201d) in order to improve the detection of relevant documents on the basis of terms found in queries. The particular technique used is singular-value decomposition, in which a large term by document matrix is decomposed into a set of ca. 100 orthogonal factors from which the original matrix can be approximated by linear combination. Documents are represented by ca. 100 item vectors of factor weights. Queries are represented as pseudo-document vectors formed from weighted combinations of terms, and documents with supra-threshold cosine values are returned. initial tests find this completely automatic method for retrieval to be promising."
