The two approaches compared are the Gabor multichannel receptive field model and local linear transform techniques. In the local linear transform approach, it is shown that the orthogonal masks derived from the discrete cosine transform (DCT) have some interesting features which resemble Gabor filters. Although the texture representation concepts of orthogonal DCT basis masks and Gabor filters are fundamentally different, it is demonstrated that the representational structure of both approaches is inherently identical. This allows one to devise an experiment to compare the two approaches in terms of their computational efficiency and the representation potential of the extracted texture features. The performance of the approaches is assessed by means of their segmentation result accuracy on a set of images composed of Brodatz textures.<<ETX>>"

The analysis uses an overcomplete wavelet decomposition, which yields a description that is translation invariant. It is shown that this representation constitutes a tight frame of l(2) and that it has a fast iterative algorithm. A texture is characterized by a set of channel variances estimated at the output of the corresponding filter bank. Classification experiments with l(2) Brodatz textures indicate that the discrete wavelet frame (DWF) approach is superior to a standard (critically sampled) wavelet transform feature extraction. These results also suggest that this approach should perform better than most traditional single resolution techniques (co-occurrences, local linear transform, and the like). A detailed comparison of the classification performance of various orthogonal and biorthogonal wavelet transforms is also provided. Finally, the DWF feature extraction technique is incorporated into a simple multicomponent texture segmentation algorithm, and some illustrative examples are presented."

The rationale presented for the use of the Gabor filters is their relation to models for the early vision of mammals as well as their joint optimum resolution in time and frequency. In this work we present a critical evaluation of the Gabor filters as opposed to filter banks used in image coding-in both full rate and critically sampled realizations. In the critically sampled case, tremendous computational savings can be realized. We further evaluate the commonly used octave band decomposition versus alternative decompositions. We conclude that, for a texture segmentation task, several filters provide approximately the same results as the Gabor filter and, most important, it is possible to use subsampled filters with only a modest degradation in segmentation accuracy-realizing considerable computational savings."

Unlike existing correlation filters, the proposed filters are not meant to recognize specific shapes or objects. Rather, they discriminate between textures such as terrains, background surfaces, and random image fields. The filters do not require any on-line statistical computations for extracting texture information. Therefore optical (or digital) correlators can be used for fast real-time texture recognition without segmentation. The procedure is based on the assumption that textures can be modeled as stationary random processes over limited regions of an image. The optimum filter coefficients are determined by use of eigenvector analysis. Several examples are given to illustrate the proposed scheme."

Several different arguments are applied leading to the conclusion that the two-dimensional Gabor filters possess strong optimality properties for this task. Properties of the multiple-channel segmentation approach are analyzed. In particular, perturbations of textures from an ideal model are found to have important effects on the segmentation that can usually be ameliorated by simply preceding the segmentation process by a logarithmic operation and using a low-pass postfilter prior to making region assignments. The difficult problems of space-variant textures and multiple component textures are also considered. Local spatial frequency estimation approaches are suggested that use the responses as constraints in estimating the locally emergent texture frequencies. Complex texture aggregates containing multiple shared frequency components can be analyzed if the textures are distinct and few in number. >"

Although these schemes show promise, and although some analytical work has been done, the relationship between texture differences and the filter configurations required to distinguish them remain largely unknown. This paper examines the issue of designing individual filters. Using a 2-D texture model, we show analytically that applying a properly configured bandpass filter to a textured image produces distinct output discontinuities at texture boundaries; the analysis is based on Gabor elementary functions, but it is the bandpass nature of the filter that is essential. Depending on the type of texture difference, these discontinuities form one of four characteristic signatures: a step, ridge, valley, or a step change in average local output variation. Accompanying experimental evidence indicates that these signatures are useful for segmenting an image. The analysis indicates those texture characteristics that are responsible for each signature type. Detailed criteria are provided for designing filters that can produce quality output signatures. We also illustrate occasions when asymmetric filters are beneficial, an issue not previously addressed. >"

The channels are characterized by a bank of Gabor filters that nearly uniformly covers the spatial-frequency domain. A systematic filter selection scheme based on reconstruction of the input image from the filtered images is proposed. Texture features are obtained by subjecting each (selected) filtered image to a nonlinear transformation and computing a measure of energy in a window around each pixel. An unsupervised square-error clustering algorithm is then used to integrate the feature images and produce a segmentation. A simple procedure to incorporate spatial adjacency information in the clustering process is proposed. Experiments on images with natural textures as well as artificial textures with identical second and third-order statistics are reported.

Unfortunately, this approach when used for unsupervised image analysis tasks imposes excessive storage requirements due to the nonorthogonality of the basis functions and is computationally highly demanding. In this correspondence, we propose a novel method for efficient image analysis that uses tuned matched Gabor filters. The algorithmic determination of the parameters of the Gabor filters is based on the analysis of spectral feature contrasts obtained from iterative computation of pyramidal Gabor transforms with progressive dyadic decrease of elementary cell sizes. The method requires no a priori knowledge of the analyzed image so that the analysis is unsupervised. Computer simulations applied to different classes of textures illustrate the matching property of the tuned Gabor filters derived using our determination algorithm. Also, their capability to extract significant image information and thus enable an easy and efficient low-level image analysis will be demonstrated."

The development of this transform is motivated by the observation that a large class of natural textures can be modeled as quasi-periodic signals whose dominant frequencies are located in the middle frequency channels. With the transform, it is possible to zoom into any desired frequency channels for further decomposition. In contrast, the conventional pyramid-structured wavelet transform performs further decomposition in low-frequency channels. A progressive texture classification algorithm which is not only computationally attractive but also has excellent performance is developed. The performance of the present method is compared with that of several other methods."

The performance of wavelet packet spaces are measured in terms of sensitivity and selectivity for the classification of twenty-five natural textures. Both energy and entropy metrics were computed for each wavelet packet and incorporated into distinct scale space representations, where each wavelet packet (channel) reflected a specific scale and orientation sensitivity. Wavelet packet representations for twenty-five natural textures were classified without error by a simple two-layer network classifier. An analyzing function of large regularity (D/sub 20/) was shown to be slightly more efficient in representation and discrimination than a similar function with fewer vanishing moments (D/sub 6/) In addition, energy representations computed from the standard wavelet decomposition alone (17 features) provided classification without error for the twenty-five textures included in our study. The reliability exhibited by texture signatures based on wavelet packets analysis suggest that the multiresolution properties of such transforms are beneficial for accomplishing segmentation, classification and subtle discrimination of texture. >"

                "text": "Texture segmentation involves subdividing an image into differently textured regions. Many texture segmentation schemes are based on a filter-bank model, where the filters, called Gabor filters, are derived from Gabor elementary functions. The goal is to transform texture differences into detectable filter-output discontinuities at texture boundaries. By locating these discontinuities, one can segment the image into differently textured regions. Distinct discontinuities occur, however, only if the Gabor filter parameters are suitably chosen. Some previous analysis has shown how to design filters for discriminating simple textures. Designing filters for more general natural textures, though, has largely been done ad hoc. We have devised a more rigorously based method for designing Gabor filters. It assumes that an image contains two different textures and that prototype samples of the textures are given a priori. We argue that Gabor filter outputs can be modeled as Rician random variables (often approximated well as Gaussian rv's) and develop a decision-theoretic algorithm for selecting optimal filter parameters. To improve segmentations for difficult texture pairs, we also propose a multiple-filter segmentation scheme, motivated by the Rician model. Experimental results indicate that our method is superior to previous methods in providing useful Gabor filters for a wide range of texture pairs."

We solve the problem of finding an optimal set of masks by designing a neural network which is trained to maximize a relevant function. Two algorithms, the centroid algorithm and the gradient descent algorithm, are used to train the network. Experimental results on segmenting two natural textures and extracting barcodes in an image are reported, and the error rates compared for both the algorithms with different network configurations. The centroid algorithm gives better results in small parameter spaces, whereas the gradient descent algorithm works better with more parameters. Our method of automatically generating texture discrimination masks not only results in a good segmentation performance, but also reduces the dimensionality of the feature space compared to previously published multichannel filtering methods.<<ETX>>"

The Karhunen-Loeve transform is used to reduce the dimensionality of the resulting feature vector, and segmentation is achieved by thresholding or clustering in feature space. The combination of nonlinearities f(x)= mod x mod /sup alpha / (in particular, alpha =2) and g(x)=log x maximizes texture discrimination, and results in a description with variances approximately constant for all feature components and texture regions.

                "text": "A computational approach for analyzing visible textures is described. Textures are modeled as irradiance patterns containing a limited range of spatial frequencies, where mutually distinct textures differ significantly in their dominant characterizing frequencies. By encoding images into multiple narrow spatial frequency and orientation channels, the slowly varying channel envelopes (amplitude and phase) are used to segregate textural regions of different spatial frequency, orientation, or phase characteristics. Thus, an interpretation of image texture as a region code, or carrier of region information, is emphasized. The channel filters used, known as the two-dimensional Gabor functions, are useful for these purposes in several senses: they have tunable orientation and radial frequency bandwidths and tunable center frequencies, and they optimally achieve joint resolution in space and in spatial frequency. By comparing the channel amplitude responses, one can detect boundaries between textures. Locating large variations in the channel phase responses allows discontinuities in the texture phase to be detected. Examples are given of both types of texture processing using a variety of real and synthetic textures. >"

Although design methods for a single Gabor filter have been presented previously, the development of general multi-filter multi-texture design methods largely remains an open problem. Previous multi-filter design approaches required one filter per texture or were constrained to pairs of textures. Other approaches employed ad hoc banks of Gabor filters for texture segmentation, where the parameters of the constituent filters were restricted to fixed values and were not necessarily tuned for a specific texture-segmentation problem. The proposed method removes these restrictions on the number of filters and the number of textures. This offers the potential to improve the segmentation performance or to reduce the number of filters. Further, the development of the design method and mathematical models provide new insight into the design of multiple Gabor filters for texture segmentation. Results are presented that confirm the efficacy of our filter-design method and support underlying mathematical models."

The approach includes both the design of the constituent Gabor filters and the design of the classifier and postprocessing. The classifier uses a mixture density to reduce localization error at texture boundaries, and the postprocessing uses morphological operators to remove spurious misclassifications at texture boundaries. Results are presented that confirm the efficacy of the postprocessing methods and the overall integrated approach."

The \"texture energy\" approach requires only a few convolutions with small (typically 5x5) integer coefficient masks, followed by a moving-window absolute average operation. Normalization by the local mean and standard deviation eliminates the need for histogram equalization. Rotation-invariance can also be achieved by using averages of the texture energy features. The convolution masks are separable, and can be implemented with 1-dimensional (vertical and horizontal) or multipass 3x3 convolutions. Special techniques permit rapid processing on general-purpose digital computers."

The algorithms which will be examined are the spatial gray level dependence method (SGLDM), the gray level run length method (GLRLM), the gray level difference method (GLDM), and the power spectral method (PSM). The evaluation procedure employed does not depend on the set of features used with each algorithm or the pattern recognition scheme. Rather, what is examined is the amount of texturecontext information contained in the spatial gray level dependence matrices, the gray level run length matrices, the gray level difference density functions, and the power spectrum. The comparison will be performed in two steps. First, only Markov generated textures will be considered. The Markov textures employed are similar to the ones used by perceptual psychologist B. Julesz in his investigations of human texture perception. These Markov textures provide a convenient mechanism for generating certain example texture pairs which are important in the analysis process. In the second part of the analysis the results obtained by considering only Markov textures will be extended to all textures which can be represented by translation stationary random fields of order two. This generalization clearly includes a much broader class of textures than Markovian ones. The results obtained indicate that the SGLDM is the most powerful algorithm of the four considered, and that the GLDM is more powerful than the PSM."

There has been a great deal of activity both in the refinement of previously known approaches and in the development of completely new techniques. Although a wide variety of methodologies have been applied to this problem, there is a particularly strong concentration in the development of feature-based approaches and on the search for appropriate texture features. In this paper, we present a survey of current texture segmentation and feature extraction methods. Our emphasis is on techniques developed since 1980, particularly those with promise for unsupervised applications."

The properties of the operator which approximates a signal at a given resolution were studied. It is shown that the difference of information between the approximation of a signal at the resolutions 2/sup j+1/ and 2/sup j/ (where j is an integer) can be extracted by decomposing this signal on a wavelet orthonormal basis of L/sup 2/(R/sup n/), the vector space of measurable, square-integrable n-dimensional functions. In L/sup 2/(R), a wavelet orthonormal basis is a family of functions which is built by dilating and translating a unique function psi (x). This decomposition defines an orthogonal multiresolution representation called a wavelet representation. It is computed with a pyramidal algorithm based on convolutions with quadrature mirror filters. Wavelet representation lies between the spatial and Fourier domains. For images, the wavelet representation differentiates several spatial orientations. The application of this representation to data compression in image coding, texture discrimination and fractal analysis is discussed. >"

This paper describes some easily computable textural features based on gray-tone spatial dependancies, and illustrates their application in category-identification tasks of three different kinds of image data: photomicrographs of five kinds of sandstones, 1:20 000 panchromatic aerial photographs of eight land-use categories, and Earth Resources Technology Satellite (ERTS) multispecial imagery containing seven land-use categories. We use two kinds of decision rules: one for which the decision regions are convex polyhedra (a piecewise linear decision rule), and one for which the decision regions are rectangular parallelpipeds (a min-max decision rule). In each experiment the data set was divided into two parts, a training set and a test set. Test set identification accuracy is 89 percent for the photomicrographs, 82 percent for the aerial photographic imagery, and 83 percent for the satellite imagery. These results indicate that the easily computable textural features probably have a general applicability for a wide variety of image-classification applications."

Subband coding has emerged as one suitable technique for satisfying this need. Initially, image subband coders were based on FIR filter banks employing the quadrature mirror filters (QMF) of Johnston. To reduce the complexity associated with these subband coders, we have introduced image subband coders based on two types of IIR filter banks. The first is a tree structured filter bank, whereas the other is a fully parallel construction. The computational complexity ofthese filter banks is examined. The computational complexity of the llR-based structures is significantly lower than their FIR counterparts. Furthermore, we introduce multiplier-free IIR filter banks realizing even further complexity reductions. For the bit-efficient representation of the subband signals of both our still image and video coders, we propose a simple scheme similar to the ones employed for DCT-based coding in the CCITT H.261 recommendation and the emerging ISO/JPEG standard. In demonstrating the performance of our coders, we present simulation results at less than 0.5 bits per pel for still image coding and 64 to 200 kbps for coding of video. The performance of our low-complexity IIR structures is found to be comparable to structures based on FIR filters."

These filters provide a significant improvement over conventional optimal equiripple and window designs when used in QMF banks. The performance criterion for these filters differ from those usually used for filter design in a way which makes the usual filter design techniques difficult to apply. Two filters are actually designed simultaneously, with constraints on the stop band rejection, transition band width, and pass and transition band performance of the QMF filter structure made from those filters. Unlike most filter design problems, the behavior of the transition band is constrained, which places unusual requirements on the design algorithm. The requirement that the overall passband behavior of the QMF bank be constrained (which is a function of the passband and stop band behavior of the filter) also places very unusual requirements on the filter design. The filters were designed using a Hooke and Jeaves optimization routine with a Hanning window prototype. Theoretical results suggest that exactly flat frequency designs cannot be created for filter lengths greater than 2, however, using the discussed procedure, one can obtain QMF banks with as little as \u00b1.0015dB ripple in their frequency response. Due to the nature of QMF filter applications, a small set of filters can be derived which will fit most applications."
