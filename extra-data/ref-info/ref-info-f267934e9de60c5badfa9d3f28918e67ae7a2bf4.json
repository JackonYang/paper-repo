Learning probabilistic models directly on the raw pixel values has proved to be much more difficult and is typically only used for regularizing discriminative methods. In this work, we use one of the best, pixel-level, generative models of natural images\u2013a gated MRF\u2013as the lowest level of a deep belief network (DBN) that has several hidden layers. We show that the resulting DBN is very good at coping with occlusion when predicting expression categories from face images, and it can produce features that perform comparably to SIFT descriptors for discriminating different types of scene. The generative ability of the model also makes it easy to see what information is captured and what is lost at each level of representation."

The generative models can be learned one layer at a time and when learning is complete they have a very fast inference procedure for computing a good approximation to the posterior distribution in all of the hidden layers. Each hidden layer has its own MRF whose energy function is modulated by the top-down directed connections from the layer above. To generate from the model, each layer in turn must settle to equilibrium given its top-down input. We show that this type of model is good at capturing the statistics of patches of natural images."

One of the most promising directions for unsupervised learning may lie in Deep Learning methods, given their success in supervised learning. However, one of the current problems with deep unsupervised learning methods, is that they often are harder to scale. As a result there are some easier, more scalable shallow methods, such as the Gaussian Mixture Model and the Student-t Mixture Model, that remain surprisingly competitive. In this paper we propose a new scalable deep generative model for images, called the Deep Gaussian Mixture Model, that is a straightforward but powerful generalization of GMMs to multiple layers. The parametrization of a Deep GMM allows it to efficiently capture products of variations in natural images. We propose a new EM-based algorithm that scales well to large datasets, and we show that both the Expectation and the Maximization steps can easily be distributed over multiple machines. In our density estimation experiments we show that deeper GMM architectures generalize better than more shallow ones, with results in the same ballpark as the state of the art."

The approach provides a practical method for learning high-order Markov random field (MRF) models with potential functions that extend over large pixel neighborhoods. These clique potentials are modeled using the Product-of-Experts framework that uses non-linear functions of many linear filter responses. In contrast to previous MRF approaches all parameters, including the linear filters themselves, are learned from training data. We demonstrate the capabilities of this Field-of-Experts model with two example applications, image denoising and image inpainting, which are implemented using a simple, approximate inference scheme. While the model is trained on a generic image database and is not tuned toward a specific application, we obtain results that compete with specialized techniques."

By learning to predict missing frames or extrapolate future frames from an input video sequence, the model discovers both spatial and temporal correlations which are useful to represent complex deformations and motion patterns. The models we propose are largely borrowed from the language modeling literature, and adapted to the vision domain by quantizing the space of image patches into a large dictionary. We demonstrate the approach on both a filling and a generation task. For the first time, we show that, after training on natural videos, such a model can predict non-trivial motions over short video sequences."

Scaling such models to full-sized, high-dimensional images remains a difficult problem. To address this problem, we present the convolutional deep belief network, a hierarchical generative model which scales to realistic image sizes. This model is translation-invariant and supports efficient bottom-up and top-down probabilistic inference. Key to our approach is probabilistic max-pooling, a novel technique which shrinks the representations of higher layers in a probabilistically sound way. Our experiments show that the algorithm learns useful high-level visual features, such as object parts, from unlabeled images of objects and natural scenes. We demonstrate excellent performance on several visual recognition tasks and show that our model can perform hierarchical (bottom-up and top-down) inference over full-sized images."

We show that it is able to generate images with interesting higher-order correlations when trained on natural images or samples from an occlusion-based model. More importantly, our multiscale model allows for a principled evaluation. While it is easy to generate visually appealing images, we demonstrate that our model also yields the best performance reported to date when evaluated with respect to the cross-entropy rate, a measure tightly linked to the average log-likelihood. The ability to quantitatively evaluate our model differentiates it from other multiscale models, for which evaluation of these kinds of measures is usually intractable."

In this work we propose deep energy models, which use deep feedforward neural networks to model the energy landscapes that define probabilistic models. We are able to efficiently train all layers of our model simultaneously, allowing the lower layers of the model to adapt to the training of the higher layers, and thereby producing better generative models. We evaluate the generative performance of our models on natural images and demonstrate that this joint training of multiple layers yields qualitative and quantitative improvements over greedy layerwise training. We further generalize our models beyond the commonly used sigmoidal neural networks and show how a deep extension of the product of Student-t distributions model achieves good generative performance. Finally, we introduce a discriminative extension of our model and demonstrate that it outperforms other fully-connected models on object recognition on the NORB dataset."

Here we provide an in depth analysis of this simple yet rich model. We show that such a GMM model is able to compete with even the most successful models of natural images in log likelihood scores, denoising performance and sample quality. We provide an analysis of what such a model learns from natural images as a function of number of mixture components \u2014 including covariance structure, contrast variation and intricate structures such as textures, boundaries and more. Finally, we show that the salient properties of the GMM learned from natural images can be derived from a simplified Dead Leaves model which explicitly models occlusion, explaining its surprising success relative to other models."

Our approach uses a cascade of convolutional networks within a Laplacian pyramid framework to generate images in a coarse-to-fine fashion. At each level of the pyramid, a separate generative convnet model is trained using the Generative Adversarial Nets (GAN) approach [11]. Samples drawn from our model are of significantly higher quality than alternate approaches. In a quantitative assessment by human evaluators, our CIFAR10 samples were mistaken for real images around 40% of the time, compared to 10% for samples drawn from a GAN baseline model. We also show samples from models trained on the higher resolution images of the LSUN scene dataset."

In terms of log likelihood on real-valued data they are comparable with the best performing techniques published, easily outperforming more advanced ones, such as deep belief networks. They can be applied to various image processing tasks, such as image denoising, deblurring and inpainting, where they improve on other generic prior methods, such as sparse coding and field of experts. Based on this we propose the use of another, even richer mixture model based image prior: the Student-t mixture model (STM). We demonstrate that it convincingly surpasses GMMs in terms of log likelihood, achieving performance competitive with the state of the art in image patch modeling. We apply both the GMM and STM to the task of lossy and lossless image compression, and propose efficient coding schemes that can easily be extended to other unsupervised machine learning models. Finally, we show that the suggested techniques outperform JPEG, with results comparable to or better than JPEG 2000."

Our model uses an encoder LSTM to map an input sequence into a fixed length representation. This representation is decoded using single or multiple decoder LSTMs to perform different tasks, such as reconstructing the input sequence, or predicting the future sequence. We experiment with two kinds of input sequences - patches of image pixels and high-level representations (\"percepts\") of video frames extracted using a pretrained convolutional net. We explore different design choices such as whether the decoder LSTMs should condition on the generated output. We analyze the outputs of the model qualitatively to see how well the model can extrapolate the learned video representation into the future and into the past. We further evaluate the representations by finetuning them for a supervised learning problem - human action recognition on the UCF-101 and HMDB-51 datasets. We show that the representations help improve classification accuracy, especially when there are only few training examples. Even models pretrained on unrelated datasets (300 hours of YouTube videos) can help action recognition performance."

Our main contribution is a thorough evaluation of networks of increasing depth using an architecture with very small (3x3) convolution filters, which shows that a significant improvement on the prior-art configurations can be achieved by pushing the depth to 16-19 weight layers. These findings were the basis of our ImageNet Challenge 2014 submission, where our team secured the first and the second places in the localisation and classification tracks respectively. We also show that our representations generalise well to other datasets, where they achieve state-of-the-art results. We have made our two best-performing ConvNet models publicly available to facilitate further research on the use of deep visual representations in computer vision."

Particular emphasis is placed on statistical image modeling, where overcomplete models have played an important role in discovering sparse representations. Our Gibbs sampler is faster than general purpose sampling schemes while also requiring no tuning as it is free of parameters. Using the Gibbs sampler and a persistent variant of expectation maximization, we are able to extract highly sparse distributions over latent sources from data. When applied to natural images, our algorithm learns source distributions which resemble spike-and-slab distributions. We evaluate the likelihood and quantitatively compare the performance of the overcomplete linear model to its complete counterpart as well as a product of experts model, which represents another overcomplete generalization of the complete linear model. In contrast to previous claims, we find that overcomplete representations lead to significant improvements, but that the overcomplete linear model still underperforms other models."

Developing probabilistic models of these statistics offers a powerful means both to understanding biological vision and to designing successful computer vision applications. A long-standing hypothesis about biological sensory processing states that neural systems try to represent inputs as efficiently as possible by adapting to environmental regularities. With natural image models, it is possible to test specific predictions of this hypothesis and thereby reveal insights into biological mechanisms of sensory processing and learning. In computer vision, natural image models can be applied to a variety of problems from image restoration to higher-level classification tasks. The chapter is divided into four major sections. First, we introduce some statistical qualities of natural images and discuss why it is interesting to model them. Second, we describe several models including the state-of-the-art. Third, we discuss examples of how natural image models impact computer vision applications. And fourth, we discuss experimental examples of how biological systems are adapted to natural images."

Each modality is characterized by having distinct statistical properties. We propose a Deep Boltzmann Machine for learning a generative model of such multimodal data. We show that the model can be used to create fused representations by combining features across modalities. These learned representations are useful for classification and information retrieval. By sampling from the conditional distributions over each data modality, it is possible to create these representations even when some data modalities are missing. We conduct experiments on bimodal image-text and audio-video data. The fused representation achieves good classification results on the MIR-Flickr data set matching or outperforming other deep models as well as SVM based models that use Multiple Kernel Learning. We further demonstrate that this multimodal model helps classification and retrieval even when only unimodal data is available at test time."

We formulate a method that generates an independent sample via a single feedforward pass through a multilayer perceptron, as in the recently proposed generative adversarial networks (Goodfellow et al., 2014). Training a generative adversarial network, however, requires careful optimization of a difficult minimax program. Instead, we utilize a technique from statistical hypothesis testing known as maximum mean discrepancy (MMD), which leads to a simple objective that can be interpreted as matching all orders of statistics between a dataset and samples from the model, and can be trained by backpropagation. We further boost the performance of this approach by combining our generative network with an auto-encoder network, using MMD to learn to generate codes that can then be decoded to produce samples. We show that the combination of these techniques yields excellent generative models compared to baseline approaches as measured on MNIST and the Toronto Face Database."

Learning priors and optimizing over whole images can lead to tremendous computational challenges. In contrast, when we work with small image patches, it is possible to learn priors and perform patch restoration very efficiently. This raises three questions - do priors that give high likelihood to the data also lead to good performance in restoration? Can we use such patch based priors to restore a full image? Can we learn better patch priors? In this work we answer these questions. We compare the likelihood of several patch models and show that priors that give high likelihood to data perform better in patch restoration. Motivated by this result, we propose a generic framework which allows for whole image restoration using any patch based prior for which a MAP (or approximate MAP) estimate can be calculated. We show how to derive an appropriate cost function, how to optimize it and how to use it to restore whole images. Finally, we present a generic, surprisingly simple Gaussian Mixture prior, learned from a set of natural images. When used with the proposed framework, this Gaussian Mixture Model outperforms all other generic prior methods for image denoising, deblurring and inpainting."

We revisit the approach to semi-supervised learning with generative models and develop new models that allow for effective generalisation from small labelled data sets to large unlabelled ones. Generative approaches have thus far been either inflexible, inefficient or non-scalable. We show that deep generative models and approximate Bayesian inference exploiting recent advances in variational methods can be used to provide significant improvements, making generative approaches highly competitive for semi-supervised learning."

The canonical measure to quantitatively assess and compare the performance of statistical models is given by the likelihood. One class of statistical models which has recently gained increasing popularity and has been applied to a variety of complex data is formed by deep belief networks. Analyses of these models, however, have often been limited to qualitative analyses based on samples due to the computationally intractable nature of their likelihood. Motivated by these circumstances, the present article introduces a consistent estimator for the likelihood of deep belief networks which is computationally tractable and simple to apply in practice. Using this estimator, we quantitatively investigate a deep belief network for natural image patches and compare its performance to the performance of other models for natural image patches. We find that the deep belief network is outperformed with respect to the likelihood even by very simple mixture models."

Our generic tasks may differ significantly from the originally trained tasks and there may be insufficient labeled or unlabeled data to conventionally train or adapt a deep architecture to the new tasks. We investigate and visualize the semantic clustering of deep convolutional features with respect to a variety of such tasks, including scene recognition, domain adaptation, and fine-grained recognition challenges. We compare the efficacy of relying on various network levels to define a fixed feature, and report novel results that significantly outperform the state-of-the-art on several important vision challenges.

These models use a fixed, arbitrary ordering of the data dimensions. One can easily condition on variables at the beginning of the ordering, and marginalize out variables at the end of the ordering, however other inference tasks require approximate inference. In this work we introduce an efficient procedure to simultaneously train a NADE model for each possible ordering of the variables, by sharing parameters across all these models. We can thus use the most convenient model for each inference task at hand, and ensembles of such models with different orderings are immediately available. Moreover, unlike the original NADE, our training procedure scales to deep models. Empirically, ensembles of Deep NADE models obtain state of the art density estimation performance."

We introduce a stochastic variational inference and learning algorithm that scales to large datasets and, under some mild differentiability conditions, even works in the intractable case. Our contributions is two-fold. First, we show that a reparameterization of the variational lower bound yields a lower bound estimator that can be straightforwardly optimized using standard stochastic gradient methods. Second, we show that for i.i.d. datasets with continuous latent variables per datapoint, posterior inference can be made especially efficient by fitting an approximate inference model (also called a recognition model) to the intractable posterior using the proposed lower bound estimator. Theoretical advantages are reflected in experimental results."

On the test data, we achieved top-1 and top-5 error rates of 37.5% and 17.0%, respectively, which is considerably better than the previous state-of-the-art. The neural network, which has 60 million parameters and 650,000 neurons, consists of five convolutional layers, some of which are followed by max-pooling layers, and three fully connected layers with a final 1000-way softmax. To make training faster, we used non-saturating neurons and a very efficient GPU implementation of the convolution operation. To reduce overfitting in the fully connected layers we employed a recently developed regularization method called \"dropout\" that proved to be very effective. We also entered a variant of this model in the ILSVRC-2012 competition and achieved a winning top-5 test error rate of 15.3%, compared to 26.2% achieved by the second-best entry."

Here, we develop an approach that simultaneously achieves both flexibility and tractability. The essential idea, inspired by non-equilibrium statistical physics, is to systematically and slowly destroy structure in a data distribution through an iterative forward diffusion process. We then learn a reverse diffusion process that restores structure in data, yielding a highly flexible and tractable generative model of the data. This approach allows us to rapidly learn, sample from, and evaluate probabilities in deep generative models with thousands of layers or time steps, as well as to compute conditional and posterior probabilities under the learned model. We additionally release an open source reference implementation of the algorithm."

The training procedure for G is to maximize the probability of D making a mistake. This framework corresponds to a minimax two-player game. In the space of arbitrary functions G and D, a unique solution exists, with G recovering the training data distribution and D equal to \u00bd everywhere. In the case where G and D are defined by multilayer perceptrons, the entire system can be trained with backpropagation. There is no need for any Markov chains or unrolled approximate inference networks during either training or generation of samples. Experiments demonstrate the potential of the framework through qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the generated samples."

Using complementary priors, we derive a fast, greedy algorithm that can learn deep, directed belief networks one layer at a time, provided the top two layers form an undirected associative memory. The fast, greedy algorithm is used to initialize a slower learning procedure that fine-tunes the weights using a contrastive version of the wake-sleep algorithm. After fine-tuning, a network with three hidden layers forms a very good generative model of the joint distribution of handwritten digit images and their labels. This generative model gives better digit classification than the best discriminative learning algorithms. The low-dimensional manifolds on which the digits lie are modeled by long ravines in the free-energy landscape of the top-level associative memory, and it is easy to explore these ravines by using the directed connections to display what the associative memory has in mind."

Though sometimes these priors can be specified by hand, this becomes difficult in large models, which has motivated learning these models from data. However, maximum likelihood learning of undirected models is extremely difficult- essentially all known methods require approximations and/or high computational cost. Conversely, directed models are essentially trivial to learn from data, but have not received much attention for low-level vision. We compare the two formalisms of directed and undirected models, and conclude that there is no a priori reason to believe one better represents low-level vision quantities. We formulate two simple directed priors, for natural images and stereo disparity, to empirically test if the undirected formalism is superior. We find in both cases that a simple directed model can achieve results similar to the best learnt undirected models with significant speedups in training time, suggesting that directed models are an attractive choice for tractable learning."

This model is inspired by the restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM), which has been shown to be a powerful model of such distributions. However, an RBM typically does not provide a tractable distribution estimator, since evaluating the probability it assigns to some given observation requires the computation of the so-called partition function, which itself is intractable for RBMs of even moderate size. Our model circumvents this diculty by decomposing the joint distribution of observations into tractable conditional distributions and modeling each conditional using a non-linear function similar to a conditional of an RBM. Our model can also be interpreted as an autoencoder wired such that its output can be used to assign valid probabilities to observations. We show that this new model outperforms other multivariate binary distribution estimators on several datasets and performs similarly to a large (but intractable) RBM."

Although DNNs work well whenever large labeled training sets are available, they cannot be used to map sequences to sequences. In this paper, we present a general end-to-end approach to sequence learning that makes minimal assumptions on the sequence structure. Our method uses a multilayered Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to map the input sequence to a vector of a fixed dimensionality, and then another deep LSTM to decode the target sequence from the vector. Our main result is that on an English to French translation task from the WMT-14 dataset, the translations produced by the LSTM achieve a BLEU score of 34.8 on the entire test set, where the LSTM's BLEU score was penalized on out-of-vocabulary words. Additionally, the LSTM did not have difficulty on long sentences. For comparison, a phrase-based SMT system achieves a BLEU score of 33.3 on the same dataset. When we used the LSTM to rerank the 1000 hypotheses produced by the aforementioned SMT system, its BLEU score increases to 36.5, which is close to the previous state of the art. The LSTM also learned sensible phrase and sentence representations that are sensitive to word order and are relatively invariant to the active and the passive voice. Finally, we found that reversing the order of the words in all source sentences (but not target sentences) improved the LSTM's performance markedly, because doing so introduced many short term dependencies between the source and the target sentence which made the optimization problem easier."

Whereas feed-forward networks only exploit a fixed context length to predict the next word of a sequence, conceptually, standard recurrent neural networks can take into account all of the predecessor words. On the other hand, it is well known that recurrent networks are difficult to train and therefore are unlikely to show the full potential of recurrent models. These problems are addressed by a the Long Short-Term Memory neural network architecture. In this work, we analyze this type of network on an English and a large French language modeling task. Experiments show improvements of about 8 % relative in perplexity over standard recurrent neural network LMs. In addition, we gain considerable improvements in WER on top of a state-of-the-art speech recognition system."

A tractable likelihood allows direct comparison with other methods and training by standard gradient-based optimizers.

This leads to the emergence of oriented linear filters that have simultaneous localization in space and in frequency, thus resembling Gabor functions and simple cell receptive fields. In this article, we show that the same principle of independence maximization can explain the emergence of phase- and shift-invariant features, similar to those found in complex cells. This new kind of emergence is obtained by maximizing the independence between norms of projections on linear subspaces (instead of the independence of simple linear filter outputs). The norms of the projections on such independent feature subspaces then indicate the values of invariant features."

Histograms of spatial frequency bandwidth, orientation tuning bandwidth, aspect ratio and length of the receptive fields match well. This indicates that simple cells are well tuned to the expected statistics of natural stimuli. There is no match, however, in calculated and measured distributions for the peak of the spatial frequency response: the filters produced by ICA do not vary their spatial scale as much as simple cells do, but are fixed to scales close to the finest ones allowed by the sampling lattice. Possible ways to resolve this discrepancy are discussed."

We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O. 1. Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms."

                "text": "In September 1998, the UK Applied Vision Association held its first meeting on the topic of `\u0300 Natural Images''. The meeting, which was held at University of Bristol attracted seven submitted papers, together with an invited lecture by David Tolhurst. In discussion, the idea arose that the topics of the papers might be suitable for a Special Issue of Perception. Here is the Special Issue, after a suitable gestation period. There was sustained interest in the topic, with a further meeting in 1999 attracting nine papers, and a third meeting in September 2000, as an adjunct to the British Machine Vision Conference, also attracting nine papers. Why this interest in natural images? There seem to be several reasons. First, it is clear that the human visual system normally deals with images of greater complexity then are traditionally used in psychophysical or physiological studies. The reason for using simplified stimuli is (a) that they are easier to generate, and (b) that experimental control is easier. However, there has been considerable progress, both in computer technology/software, and also in the underlying mathematics. This means that such complex images can now be used as stimuli in a controlled manner and with a good idea of what the information content of the images actually is. The main aim of this issue is to give the reader an idea of how such experimentation can proceed. This also entails looking at the underlying theoretical issues, and these are dealt with in most of the papers in rather different ways. There is, of course, a problem. By the time the reader receives this issue the work is somewhat out of date, and in a rapidly changing field recent developments are therefore not covered. It will be apparent, for example, that the majority of scenes in these papers are monochrome and static\u00f6which is clearly not the case for real-world scenes. These topics have been aired in later meetings, but the present issue presents a selection of topics which are still very much relevant. Interested readers are encouraged to submit material and to attend the Natural Images Symposium at ECVP 2001, which is the successor to the AVA meeting.. So\u00f6how can experiments be carried out in this field? The first question concerns the independent variable: the information content of the images. How can this be succinctly summarised? A common approach to this has been to look at the secondorder statistics of the image. Typically, these are represented by the power spectrum and the phase spectrum. Until recently, the power spectrum has been the most popular measure of information content due primarily to its conceptual tractability. However, as some of the present papers demonstrate, this is changing. While the power spectrum remains an important consideration, the phase spectrum is receiving more attention. This phase spectrum is a complicated variable, and to tease out an understanding of what it is, there is an increasing tendency to tease it apart by considering `higher-order' statistics. The second problem in carrying out research in this field is to know what hypotheses to adopt and how to test them. A way of beginning to tackle this is to suppose that human vision is somehow optimised to encode the critically important information in natural scenes. All that is needed is a method of varying the information content, and a dependent measure which allows an assessment of the efficiency with which an observer can carry out a visual task. The first paper in this issue, by Willmore, Watters, and Tolhurst, provides a good introduction to the issue of what the independent Guest editorial Perception, 2000, volume 29, pages 1013 ^ 1015"

These theoretical results can be used to guide the construction of more efficient algorithms. For the practical use of Markov chain methods, standard simulation methodology provides several variance reduction techniques and also gives guidance on the choice of sample size and allocation"

                "text": "As the title indicates, this book discusses using the likelihood function for both modeling and inference. It is written as a textbook with a fair number of examples. The author conveniently provides code using the statistical package R for all relevant examples on his web site. He assumes a list of prerequisites that would typically be covered in the \u008e rst year of a master\u2019s degree in statistics (or possibly in a solid undergraduate program in statistics). A good background in probability and theory of statistics, familiarity with applied statistics (such as tests of hypotheses, con\u008e dence intervals, least squares and p values), and calculus are prerequisites for using this book. The author presents interesting philosophical discussions in Chapters 1 and 7. In Chapter 1 he explains the differences between a Bayesian versus frequentist approach to statistical inference. He states that the likelihood approach is a compromise between these two approaches and that it could be called a Fisherian approach. He argues that the likelihood approach is non-Bayesian yet has Bayesians aspects and that it has frequentist features but also some nonfrequentist aspects. He references Fisher throughout the book. In Chapter 7 the author discusses the controversial informal likelihood principle, \u201ctwo datasets (regardless of experimental source) with the same likelihood should lead to the same conclusions.\u201d It is hard to be convinced that how data were collected does not affect conclusions. Chapters 2 and 3 provide de\u008e nitions and properties for likelihood functions. Some advanced technical topics are addressed in Chapters 8, 9, and 12, including score function, Fisher information, minimum variance unbiased estimation, consistency of maximum likelihood estimators, goodness-of-\u008e t tests, and the EM algorithm. Six chapters deal with modeling. Chapter 4 presents the basic models, binomial and Poisson, with some applications. Chapter 6 focuses on regression models, including normal linear, logistic, Poisson, nonnormal, and exponential family, and deals with the related issues of deviance, iteratively weighted least squares, and the Box\u2013Cox transformations. Chapter 11 covers models with complex data structure, including models for time series data, models for survival data, and some specialized Poisson models. Chapter 14 examines quasi-likelihood models, Chapter 17 covers random and mixed effects models, and Chapter 18 introduces the concept of nonparametric smoothing. The remaining chapters put more emphasis on inference. Chapter 5 deals with frequentist properties including bias of point estimates, p values, con\u008e dence intervals, con\u008e dence intervals via bootstrapping, and exact inference for binomial and Poisson models. Chapter 10 handles nuisance parameters using marginal and conditional likelihood, modi\u008e ed pro\u008e le likelihood, and estimated likelihood methods. Chapter 13 covers the robustness of a speci\u008e ed likelihood. Chapter 15 introduces empirical likelihood concepts, and Chapter 16 addresses random parameters. This book works \u008e ne as a textbook, providing a nice introduction to a variety of topics. For engineers, this book can also serve as a good initial exposure to possibly new concepts without overwhelming them with details. But when applying a speci\u008e c topic covered in this book to real problems, a more specialized book with greater depth and/or more practical examples may be desired."
