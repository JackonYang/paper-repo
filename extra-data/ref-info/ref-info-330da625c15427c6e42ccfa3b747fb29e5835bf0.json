However, most of these models are built with only local context and one representation per word. This is problematic because words are often polysemous and global context can also provide useful information for learning word meanings. We present a new neural network architecture which 1) learns word embeddings that better capture the semantics of words by incorporating both local and global document context, and 2) accounts for homonymy and polysemy by learning multiple embeddings per word. We introduce a new dataset with human judgments on pairs of words in sentential context, and evaluate our model on it, showing that our model outperforms competitive baselines and other neural language models."

In this paper we present several extensions that improve both the quality of the vectors and the training speed. By subsampling of the frequent words we obtain significant speedup and also learn more regular word representations. We also describe a simple alternative to the hierarchical softmax called negative sampling. \n \nAn inherent limitation of word representations is their indifference to word order and their inability to represent idiomatic phrases. For example, the meanings of \"Canada\" and \"Air\" cannot be easily combined to obtain \"Air Canada\". Motivated by this example, we present a simple method for finding phrases in text, and show that learning good vector representations for millions of phrases is possible."

In this paper, we examine the vector-space word representations that are implicitly learned by the input-layer weights. We find that these representations are surprisingly good at capturing syntactic and semantic regularities in language, and that each relationship is characterized by a relation-specific vector offset. This allows vector-oriented reasoning based on the offsets between words. For example, the male/female relationship is automatically learned, and with the induced vector representations, \u201cKing Man + Woman\u201d results in a vector very close to \u201cQueen.\u201d We demonstrate that the word vectors capture syntactic regularities by means of syntactic analogy questions (provided with this paper), and are able to correctly answer almost 40% of the questions. We demonstrate that the word vectors capture semantic regularities by using the vector offset method to answer SemEval-2012 Task 2 questions. Remarkably, this method outperforms the best previous systems."

This is intrinsically difficult because of the curse of dimensionality: a word sequence on which the model will be tested is likely to be different from all the word sequences seen during training. Traditional but very successful approaches based on n-grams obtain generalization by concatenating very short overlapping sequences seen in the training set. We propose to fight the curse of dimensionality by learning a distributed representation for words which allows each training sentence to inform the model about an exponential number of semantically neighboring sentences. The model learns simultaneously (1) a distributed representation for each word along with (2) the probability function for word sequences, expressed in terms of these representations. Generalization is obtained because a sequence of words that has never been seen before gets high probability if it is made of words that are similar (in the sense of having a nearby representation) to words forming an already seen sentence. Training such large models (with millions of parameters) within a reasonable time is itself a significant challenge. We report on experiments using neural networks for the probability function, showing on two text corpora that the proposed approach significantly improves on state-of-the-art n-gram models, and that the proposed approach allows to take advantage of longer contexts."

We investigate the behaviour of the algorithm on the Penn Treebank corpus and show that it reduces the training times by more than an order of magnitude without affecting the quality of the resulting models. The algorithm is also more efficient and much more stable than importance sampling because it requires far fewer noise samples to perform well. \n \nWe demonstrate the scalability of the proposed approach by training several neural language models on a 47M-word corpus with a 80K-word vocabulary, obtaining state-of-the-art results on the Microsoft Research Sentence Completion Challenge dataset."

Instead of exploiting man-made input features carefully optimized for each task, our system learns internal representations on the basis of vast amounts of mostly unlabeled training data. This work is then used as a basis for building a freely available tagging system with good performance and minimal computational requirements."

The main advantage of these architectures is that they learn an embedding for words (or other symbols) in a continuous space that helps to smooth the language model and provide good generalization even when the number of training examples is insufficient. However, these models are extremely slow in comparison to the more commonly used n-gram models, both for training and recognition. As an alternative to an importance sampling method proposed to speed-up training, we introduce a hierarchical decomposition of the conditional probabilities that yields a speed-up of about 200 both during training and recognition. The hierarchical decomposition is a binary hierarchical clustering constrained by the prior knowledge extracted from the WordNet semantic hierarchy."

We present a model that uses a mix of unsupervised and supervised techniques to learn word vectors capturing semantic term--document information as well as rich sentiment content. The proposed model can leverage both continuous and multi-dimensional sentiment information as well as non-sentiment annotations. We instantiate the model to utilize the document-level sentiment polarity annotations present in many online documents (e.g. star ratings). We evaluate the model using small, widely used sentiment and subjectivity corpora and find it out-performs several previously introduced methods for sentiment classification. We also introduce a large dataset of movie reviews to serve as a more robust benchmark for work in this area."

We propose three new probabilistic language models that define the distribution of the next word in a sequence given several preceding words by using distributed representations of those words. We show how real-valued distributed representations for words can be learned at the same time as learning a large set of stochastic binary hidden features that are used to predict the distributed representation of the next word from previous distributed representations. Adding connections from the previous states of the binary hidden features improves performance as does adding direct connections between the real-valued distributed representations. One of our models significantly outperforms the very best n-gram models."

This work takes a step towards addressing this issue. We present the MSR Sentence Completion Challenge Data, which consists of 1,040 sentences, each of which has four impostor sentences, in which a single (fixed) word in the original sentence has been replaced by an impostor word with similar occurrence statistics. For each sentence the task is then to determine which of the five choices for that word is the correct one. This dataset was constructed from Project Gutenberg data. Seed sentences were selected from five of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle\u2019s Sherlock Holmes novels, and then imposter words were suggested with the aid of a language model trained on over 500 19th century novels. The language model was used to compute 30 alternative words for a given low frequency word in a sentence, and human judges then picked the 4 best impostor words, based on a set of provided guidelines. Although the data presented here will not be changed, this is still a work in progress, and we plan to add similar datasets based on other sources. This technical report is a living document and will be updated appropriately as new datasets are constructed and new results on existing datasets (for example, using human subjects) are reported."

The entire network is trained jointly on all these tasks using weight-sharing, an instance of multitask learning. All the tasks use labeled data except the language model which is learnt from unlabeled text and represents a novel form of semi-supervised learning for the shared tasks. We show how both multitask learning and semi-supervised learning improve the generalization of the shared tasks, resulting in state-of-the-art-performance."

Traditional techniques for estimating these models are based on N gram counts. Despite known weaknesses of N -grams and huge efforts of research communities across many fields (speech recognition, machine translation, neuroscience, artificial intelligence, natural language processing, data compression, psychology etc.), N -grams remained basically the state-of-the-art. The goal of this thesis is to present various architectures of language models that are based on artificial neural networks. Although these models are computationally more expensive than N -gram models, with the presented techniques it is possible to apply them to state-of-the-art systems efficiently. Achieved reductions of word error rate of speech recognition systems are up to 20%, against stateof-the-art N -gram model. The presented recurrent neural network based model achieves the best published performance on well-known Penn Treebank setup.

The main drawback of NPLMs is their extremely long training and testing times. Morin and Bengio have proposed a hierarchical language model built around a binary tree of words, which was two orders of magnitude faster than the non-hierarchical model it was based on. However, it performed considerably worse than its non-hierarchical counterpart in spite of using a word tree created using expert knowledge. We introduce a fast hierarchical language model along with a simple feature-based algorithm for automatic construction of word trees from the data. We then show that the resulting models can outperform non-hierarchical neural models as well as the best n-gram models."

In order to obtain high accuracy on this task, thorough syntactic and semantic analysis of the two statements is needed. We introduce a method for paraphrase detection based on recursive autoencoders (RAE). Our unsupervised RAEs are based on a novel unfolding objective and learn feature vectors for phrases in syntactic trees. These features are used to measure the word- and phrase-wise similarity between two sentences. Since sentences may be of arbitrary length, the resulting matrix of similarity measures is of variable size. We introduce a novel dynamic pooling layer which computes a fixed-sized representation from the variable-sized matrices. The pooled representation is then used as input to a classifier. Our method outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches on the challenging MSRP paraphrase corpus."

LRA measures similarity in the semantic relations between two pairs of words. When two pairs have a high degree of relational similarity, they are analogous. For example, the pair cat:meow is analogous to the pair dog:bark. There is evidence from cognitive science that relational similarity is fundamental to many cognitive and linguistic tasks (e.g., analogical reasoning). In the Vector Space Model (VSM) approach to measuring relational similarity, the similarity between two pairs is calculated by the cosine of the angle between the vectors that represent the two pairs. The elements in the vectors are based on the frequencies of manually constructed patterns in a large corpus. LRA extends the VSM approach in three ways: (1) patterns are derived automatically from the corpus, (2) Singular Value Decomposition is used to smooth the frequency data, and (3) synonyms are used to reformulate word pairs. This paper describes the LRA algorithm and experimentally compares LRA to VSM on two tasks, answering college-level multiple-choice word analogy questions and classifying semantic relations in noun-modifier expressions. LRA achieves state-of-the-art results, reaching human-level performance on the analogy questions and significantly exceeding VSM performance on both tasks."

We present a new SemEval task based on identifying the degree of prototypicality for instances within a given class.

Speech recognition experiments show around 18% reduction of word error rate on the Wall Street Journal task when comparing models trained on the same amount of data, and around 5% on the much harder NIST RT05 task, even when the backoff model is trained on much more data than the RNN LM.

One approach is to represent time implicitly by its effects on processing rather than explicitly (as in a spatial representation). The current report develops a proposal along these lines first described by Jordan (1986) which involves the use of recurrent links in order to provide networks with a dynamic memory. In this approach, hidden unit patterns are fed back to themselves; the internal representations which develop thus reflect task demands in the context of prior internal states. A set of simulations is reported which range from relatively simple problems (temporal version of XOR) to discovering syntactic/semantic features for words. The networks are able to learn interesting internal representations which incorporate task demands with memory demands; indeed, in this approach the notion of memory is inextricably bound up with task processing. These representations reveal a rich structure, which allows them to be highly context-dependent while also expressing generalizations across classes of items. These representations suggest a method for representing lexical categories and the type/token distinction."

In this work, we show approaches that lead to more than 15 times speedup for both training and testing phases. Next, we show importance of using a backpropagation through time algorithm. An empirical comparison with feedforward networks is also provided. In the end, we discuss possibilities how to reduce the amount of parameters in the model. The resulting RNN model can thus be smaller, faster both during training and testing, and more accurate than the basic one."

                "text": "Given a \u0302 network of simple computing elements and some entities to be represented, the most straightforward scheme is to use one computing element for each entity. This is called a local representation. It is easy to understand and easy to implement because the structure of the physical network mirrors the structure of the knowledge it contains. This report describes a different type of representation that is less familiar and harder to think about than local representations. Each entity is represented by a pattern of activity distributed over many computing elements, and each computing element is involved in representing many different entities. The strength of this more complicated kind of representation does not lie in its notational convenience or its ease of implementation in a conventional computer, but rather in the efficiency with which it makes use of the processing abilities of networks of simple, neuron-like computing elements. Every representational scheme has its good and bad points. Distributed representations are no exception. Some desirable properties like content-addressable memory and automatic generalization arise very naturally from the use of patterns of activity as representations. Other properties, like the ability to temporarily store a large set of arbitrary associations, are much harder to achieve. The best psychological evidence for distributed representations is the degree to which their strengths and weaknesses match those of the human mind. ^This research was supported by a grant from the System Development Foundation.

We argue that in order to progress toward this goal, the Machine Learning community must endeavor to discover algorithms that can learn highly complex functions, with minimal need for prior knowledge, and with minimal human intervention. We present mathematical and empirical evidence suggesting that many popular approaches to non-parametric learning, particularly kernel methods, are fundamentally limited in their ability to learn complex high-dimensional functions. Our analysis focuses on two problems. First, kernel machines are shallow architectures, in which one large layer of simple template matchers is followed by a single layer of trainable coefficients. We argue that shallow architectures can be very inefficient in terms of required number of computational elements and examples. Second, we analyze a limitation of kernel machines with a local kernel, linked to the curse of dimensionality, that applies to supervised, unsupervised (manifold learning) and semi-supervised kernel machines. Using empirical results on invariant image recognition tasks, kernel methods are compared with deep architectures, in which lower-level features or concepts are progressively combined into more abstract and higher-level representations. We argue that deep architectures have the potential to generalize in non-local ways, i.e., beyond immediate neighbors, and that this is crucial in order to make progress on the kind of complex tasks required for artificial intelligence."

In this paper, we consider the problem of training a deep network with billions of parameters using tens of thousands of CPU cores. We have developed a software framework called DistBelief that can utilize computing clusters with thousands of machines to train large models. Within this framework, we have developed two algorithms for large-scale distributed training: (i) Downpour SGD, an asynchronous stochastic gradient descent procedure supporting a large number of model replicas, and (ii) Sandblaster, a framework that supports a variety of distributed batch optimization procedures, including a distributed implementation of L-BFGS. Downpour SGD and Sandblaster L-BFGS both increase the scale and speed of deep network training. We have successfully used our system to train a deep network 30x larger than previously reported in the literature, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet, a visual object recognition task with 16 million images and 21k categories. We show that these same techniques dramatically accelerate the training of a more modestly- sized deep network for a commercial speech recognition service. Although we focus on and report performance of these methods as applied to training large neural networks, the underlying algorithms are applicable to any gradient-based machine learning algorithm."

Metaphorically, the adaptation allows us to find needles in haystacks in the form of very predictive but rarely seen features. Our paradigm stems from recent advances in stochastic optimization and online learning which employ proximal functions to control the gradient steps of the algorithm. We describe and analyze an apparatus for adaptively modifying the proximal function, which significantly simplifies setting a learning rate and results in regret guarantees that are provably as good as the best proximal function that can be chosen in hindsight. We give several efficient algorithms for empirical risk minimization problems with common and important regularization functions and domain constraints. We experimentally study our theoretical analysis and show that adaptive subgradient methods outperform state-of-the-art, yet non-adaptive, subgradient algorithms."
