This methodology involves (1) a common set of 40 laser range finder images and 40 structured light scanner images that have manually specified ground truth and (2) a set of defined performance metrics for instances of correctly segmented, missed, and noise regions, over- and under-segmentation, and accuracy of the recovered geometry. A tool is used to objectively compare a machine generated segmentation against the specified ground truth. Four research groups have contributed to evaluate their own algorithm for segmenting a range image into planar patches."

The basic measure of performance is a visual rating score which indicates the perceived quality of the edges for identifying an object. The process of evaluating edge detection algorithms with this performance measure requires the collection of a set of gray-scale images, optimizing the input parameters for each algorithm, conducting visual evaluation experiments and applying statistical analysis methods. The novel aspect of this work is the use of a visual task and real images of complex scenes in evaluating edge detectors. The method is appealing because, by definition, the results agree with visual evaluations of the edge images."

Rather than focusing on local features and their consistencies in the image data, our approach aims at extracting the global impression of an image. We treat image segmentation as a graph partitioning problem and propose a novel global criterion, the normalized cut, for segmenting the graph. The normalized cut criterion measures both the total dissimilarity between the different groups as well as the total similarity within the groups. We show that an efficient computational technique based on a generalized eigenvalue problem can be used to optimize this criterion. We have applied this approach to segmenting static images and found results very encouraging."

Their statistics are important not only in image compression but also for the study of sensory processing in biology, which can be viewed as satisfying certain \u2018design criteria\u2019. This review summarizes previous work on image statistics and presents our own data. Perhaps the most notable property of natural images is an invariance to scale. We present data to support this claim as well as evidence for a hierarchical invariance in natural scenes. These symmetries provide a powerful description of natural images as they greatly restrict the class of allowed distributions."

In the existing performance evaluation methods, two crucial components are usually missing: 1) automatic training of algorithms with free parameters and 2) statistical and error analysis of experimental results. We use the following five-step methodology to quantitatively compare the performance of page segmentation algorithms: 1) first, we create mutually exclusive training and test data sets with groundtruth, 2) we then select a meaningful and computable performance metric, 3) an optimization procedure is then used to search automatically for the optimal parameter values of the segmentation algorithms on the training data set, 4) the segmentation algorithms are then evaluated on the test data set, and, finally, 5) a statistical and error analysis is performed to give the statistical significance of the experimental results. In particular, instead of the ad hoc and manual approach typically used in the literature for training algorithms, we pose the automatic training of algorithms as an optimization problem and use the simplex algorithm to search for the optimal parameter value. A paired-model statistical analysis and an error analysis are then conducted to provide confidence intervals for the experimental results of the algorithms. This methodology is applied to the evaluation of live page segmentation algorithms of which, three are representative research algorithms and the other two are well-known commercial products, on 978 images from the University of Washington III data set. It is found that the performance indices of the Voronoi, Docstrum, and Caere segmentation algorithms are not significantly different from each other, but they are significantly better than that of ScanSoft's segmentation algorithm, which, in turn, is significantly better than that of X-Y cut."

Local edge cues, implemented by filters, provide information about the likely positions of edges which can be used as input to higher-level models. Different edge cues can be evaluated by the statistical effectiveness of their corresponding filters evaluated on a dataset of 100 presegmented images. We use information theoretic measures to determine the effectiveness of a variety of different edge detectors working at multiple scales on black and white and color images. Our results give quantitative measures for the advantages of multi-level processing, for the use of chromaticity in addition to greyscale, and for the relative effectiveness of different detectors."

The basic computational module of the technique is an old pattern recognition procedure: the mean shift. For discrete data, we prove the convergence of a recursive mean shift procedure to the nearest stationary point of the underlying density function and, thus, its utility in detecting the modes of the density. The relation of the mean shift procedure to the Nadaraya-Watson estimator from kernel regression and the robust M-estimators; of location is also established. Algorithms for two low-level vision tasks discontinuity-preserving smoothing and image segmentation - are described as applications. In these algorithms, the only user-set parameter is the resolution of the analysis, and either gray-level or color images are accepted as input. Extensive experimental results illustrate their excellent performance."

In order to make large-scale retrieval feasible, we index the blob descriptions usinga tree.

Histograms of spatial frequency bandwidth, orientation tuning bandwidth, aspect ratio and length of the receptive fields match well. This indicates that simple cells are well tuned to the expected statistics of natural stimuli. There is no match, however, in calculated and measured distributions for the peak of the spatial frequency response: the filters produced by ICA do not vary their spatial scale as much as simple cells do, but are fixed to scales close to the finest ones allowed by the sampling lattice. Possible ways to resolve this discrepancy are discussed."

By viewing curve organization as a statistical estimation problem, we suggest that it can. In particular, the classical Gestalt perceptual organization cues of proximity and good continuation\u2014the basis of many current curve organization systems\u2014can be statistically measured in images. As a prior for our estimation approach we introduce the curve indicator random field. In contrast to other techniques that require contour closure or are based on a sparse set of detected edges, the curve indicator random field emphasizes the short-distance, dense nature of organizing curve elements into (possibly) open curves. Its explicit formulation allows the calculation of its properties such as its autocorrelation. On the one hand, the curve indicator random field leads us to introduce the oriented Wiener filter, capturing the blur and noise inherent in the edge measurement process. On the other, it suggests we seek such correlations in natural images. We present the results of some initial edge correlation measurements that not only confirm the presence of Gestalt cues, but also suggest that curvature has a role in curve organization."

This paper shows that support vector machines (SVM's) can generalize well on difficult image classification problems where the only features are high dimensional histograms. Heavy-tailed RBF kernels of the form K(x, y) = e(-rho)Sigma(i)/xia-yia/b with a < or = 1 and b < or = 2 are evaluated on the classification of images extracted from the Corel stock photo collection and shown to far outperform traditional polynomial or Gaussian radial basis function (RBF) kernels. Moreover, we observed that a simple remapping of the input x(i)-->x(i)(a) improves the performance of linear SVM's to such an extend that it makes them, for this problem, a valid alternative to RBF kernels."

Pairs of wavelet coefficients, corresponding to basis functions at adjacent spatial locations, orientations, and scales, are found to be non-Gaussian in both their marginal and joint statistical properties. Specifically, their marginals are heavy-tailed, and although they are typically decorrelated, their magnitudes are highly correlated. We propose a Markov model that explains these dependencies using a linear predictor for magnitude coupled with both multiplicative and additive uncertainties, and show that it accounts for the statistics of a wide variety of images including photographic images, graphical images, and medical images. In order to directly demonstrate the power of the model, we construct an image coder called EPWIC (embedded predictive wavelet image coder), in which subband coefficients are encoded one bitplane at a time using a nonadaptive arithmetic encoder that utilizes conditional probabilities calculated from the model. Bitplanes are ordered using a greedy algorithm that considers the MSE reduction per encoded bit. The decoder uses the statistical model to predict coefficient values based on the bits it has received. Despite the simplicity of the model, the rate-distortion performance of the coder is roughly comparable to the best image coders in the literature."

                "text": "| We illustrate the sensitivity of trace driven simulation results to the completeness of the input trace data. This is done by comparing cache simulation results obtained using traces similar to many found in the published literature with those obtained using a hardware monitor which we have developed. Cache miss rates from single process traces without operating system references are shown to be in error by as much as a factor of 50. Published synthetic multiprogram workloads are then shown to result in simulated cache miss rates which are in error by factors that range from 0:9 to 110. Finally, it is shown that errors of this magnitude yield misleading performance estimates. Introduction and Background Trace driven simulation has been used for many years to predict the performance of computer systems. This method of simulation may provide useful estimates of system performance, but is dependent on the quality of both the simulation model and the input trace data. While the generation of complete address traces has been the subject of previous work [ASH86], little has been done to compare simulation results using them with those obtained using the incomplete and suspect [Gai91] traces used in published studies [OMB91, WHK91]. We have constructed a hardware monitor capable of producing long and complete traces on a variety of hardware and software platforms. Using these highly accurate traces we quantify the error in system performance predictions which result from the use of incomplete trace data. For this study, we de ne complete address traces to be those traces containing all CPU generated references including those produced by interrupts, system calls, exception handlers, other supervisor activities, and user processes. First, we describe our trace gathering technique and its advantages over other reported methods. We also discuss and quantify the dilation e ects present in our traces. We then examine traces resulting from the execution of a single process by itself. We demonstrate that not only does the cache miss rate vary widely from one portion of a program to another (as previously reported in [BKW90]), but that the majority of cache misses in large sections of the program are due to system code such as interrupts and system calls and that user code is insigni cant in these sections. We show that miss rates predicted from our complete traces are as much as 50 times higher than those predicted from \\user code only\" traces, similar to those used in many previously published studies. We then turn to multiprogram trace generation. Using complete multiprogram traces collected with our monitor we demonstrate that proposed synthetic trace generation methods for multiprogram workloads may give results little better than those obtained by simply concatenating a collection of single-process traces together. Indeed, we show that more complex schemes which attempt to accurately model context switch intervals are no better than simpler methods and may result in cache miss rate predictions in error by as much as a factor of 110. Finally, we use a simple memory hierarchy performance model to demonstrate how small miss rate prediction errors can result in substantial errors in the estimation of e ective access times. Trace Gathering Technique The most accurate way to collect address and data reference streams is to use a hardware monitoring device. Limitations of this technique as pointed out by Agarwal et al. [ASH86] are its complexity and limited capacity. We have built a hardware monitor which, in conjunction with limited software support, overcomes these limitations. It is capable of collecting traces which include all references generated by the CPU: user references, system call references, interrupt routine references, exception handler references, instruction prefetches, and"

However, existing tracing techniques produce traces inadequate for some studies: they do not usually record operating system references, and they produce relatively short traces. The paper explores the impact of these trace distortions on the performance estimates of uniprocessor memory hierarchies using multiprogramming workloads. We used a hardware monitor to capture traces under a variety of workloads and operating systems. Our monitor captures every reference and can. Record arbitrarily long traces. We quantify memory hierarchy performance using traces of the SPEC SDM1.1 benchmark suite executing on an i486 CPU. To evaluate variations due to operating systems, we compare these results under both Mach 3.0 and UNIX Sys V R4. We conclude that for current uniprocessors, long but incomplete traces result in modest errors in estimated performance, but for proposed architectures with large delays to main memory, the errors can be significant."

Existing trace collection methods have serious drawbacks: trap-driven methods often slow down program execution by more than 1000 times, significantly perturbing program behavior; microcode modification is faster, but the technique is neither general nor portable.\nThis paper describes a new tool, called MPTRACE, for collecting traces of multithreaded parallel programs executing on shared-memory multiprocessors. MPTRACE requires no hardware or microcode modification; it collects complete program traces; it is portable; and it reduces execution-time dilation to less than a factor 3. MPTRACE is based on inline tracing, in which a program is automatically modified to produce trace information as it executes. We show how the use of compiler flow analysis techniques can reduce the amount of data collected and therefore the runtime dilation of the traced program. We also discuss problematic issues concerning buffering and writing of trace data on a multiprocessor."

In the past, researchers have collected instruction traces through various techniques, including single-stepping, instruction inlining, hardware monitoring, and processor simulation. These approaches, however, fail to produce accurate traces because they interfere with the processor's normal execution.Because processors are deterministic machines, their behavior can be predicted if their initial states and external inputs are known. We have developed a technique, called \"CITCAT,\" which exploits this fact to generate nearly perfect instruction traces through trace-driven simulation. CITCAT combines the best features of instruction inlining, hardware monitoring, and processor simulation to produce long, accurate instruction traces without perturbing the system being traced. Because CITCAT instruction traces are computed, rather than stored, this hybrid technique delivers not just accurate traces, but also an extremely efficient trace compression algorithm."
