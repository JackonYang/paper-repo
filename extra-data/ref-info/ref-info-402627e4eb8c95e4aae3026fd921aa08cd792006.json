The central idea is an extension of Winston's (Winston 1975) program that learned the structural descriptions of blocks world scenes. In the new research, English verbs take the place of blocks world objects like ARCH and TOWER, with frame-based descriptions of causal relationships serving as the structural descriptions. Syntactic constraints derived from the parsing of story plots are used to drive an analogical matching procedure. Analogical matching gives a way to compare descriptions of known words to unknown words. The \"meaning\" of a new verb is learned by matching pan of the causal network description of a story precis containing the unknown word to a set of such descriptions derived from similar stories that contain only known words. The best match forges an assignment between objects and relations such that the unknown verb is matched to a known verb, with the assignment being guided by syntactic constraints. The causal network surrounding the unknown item is then used as a scaffolding to construct a network representing the use of the novel word in a particular context. Words (and their associated stories) that are \"best matches\" are grouped together into a similarity network, according to the match score."

In this article we review accounts based on similarity, feature correlations, and various theories of categorization. We find that each theory provides an inadequate account of conceptual coherence (or no account at all) because none provides enough constraints on possible concepts. We propose that concepts are coherent to the extent that they fit people's background knowledge or naive theories about the world. These theories help to relate the concepts in a domain and to structure the attributes that are internal to a concept. Evidence of the influence of theories on various conceptual tasks is presented, and the possible importance of theories in cognitive development is discussed."

This paper provides empirical support for the co-occurrence hypothesis in a corpus analysis of all high-frequency adjectives and their antonyms and of a major group of morphologically derived antonyms (e.g., impossible, un-happy). We show that very high co-occurrence rates do appear to characterize all antonymous adjective pairs, supporting the precondition for the formation of the association; and we find that the syntactic contexts of these co-occurrences raise the intrinsic associability of antonyms when they do co-occur. We show that via one of these patterns, mutual substitution within otherwise repeated phrases in a sentence, the co-occurrences hypothesis captures the generalizations that were the basis for the substitutability hypothesis for the formation of antonymic associations."

A total of 352 students in third, fifth, and seventh grades read either expository or narrative passages selected from grade-level textbooks, and after six days were tested on their knowledge of difficult words from the passages. Small but reliable gains in knowledge of words from the passages read were found at all grade and ability levels. Effects of word and text properties on learning from context were examined in some detail. Word properties investigated included length, morphological complexity, and part of speech. Text properties included the strength of contextual support for each word, readability as measured by standard formulas, and several measures of density of difficult words. Among the word properties, only conceptual difficulty was significantly related to learning from context. Among the text properties, learning from context was most strongly influenced by the proportion of unfamiliar words that were conceptually difficult and by the average length of unfamiliar words."

One of the earliest answers is to the effect that two predicates have the same meaning if they stand for the same real Essence or Platonic Idea; but this does not seem to help very much unless we know, as I am afraid we do not, how to find out whether two terms stand for the same Platonic Idea."

                "text": "The meaning of an English word can vary widely depending on which sense is intended. Does a fireman feed fires or put them out? It depends on whether or not he is on a steam locomotive. I am trying to decide automatically which sense of a word is intended (in written English) by using machine readable dictionaries, and looking for words in the sense definitions that overlap words in the definition of nearby words. The problem of deciding which sense of a word was intended by the writer is an important problem in information retrieval systems. At present most retrieval systems rely on manual indexing; if this is to be replaced with automatic text processing, it would be very desirable to recognize the correct sense of each word as often as possible. Previous work has generally either suggested (a) detailed frames describing the particular word senses,t*\u2019 or (b) global statistics about the word occurrences.3 The first has not yet been made available in any real application, and the second may give the wrong answer in specific local instances. This procedure uses available dictionaries, so that it will process any text; and uses solely the immediate context. To consider the example in the title, look at the definition of pine in the Oxford Advanced Learner\u2019s Dictionary of Current English: there are, of course, two major senses. \u201ckind of evergreen tree with needle-shaped leaves.. .\u201d and \u201cwaste away through sorrow or illness...\u201d And cone has three separate definitions: \u201csolid body which narrows to a\u2019 point . . . . *\u2019 \u201csomething of this shape w-hether solid or hollow...,\u201d and \u201cfruit of certain evergreen trees...\u201d Note that both evergreen and tree are common to two of the sense definitions: thus a program could guess that if the two words pine cone appear together, the likely senses are those of the tree and its fruit"

Linguists describe language instead, using a discontinuous or discrete mathematics called \u201clinguistics.\u201d The nature of this odd calculus is outlined and justified here. It treats speech communication as having a telegraphic structure. (Non\u2010linguists normally fail to orient themselves in this field because they treat speech as analogous to telephony.) The telegraph\u2010code structure of language is examined from top to bottom, and at each of its several levels of complexity (compared to the two levels of Morse code) its structure is shown to be defined by possibilities and impossibilities of combination among the units of that level. Above the highest level we find, instead of such absolute restrictions, conditional probabilities of occurrence: this is the semantic field, outside linguistics, where sociologists can work. Below the lowest level we find, instead of such absolute restrictions, conditional probabilities of phonetic quality: this is the phonetic field, outside linguistics, where physicists can work. Thus linguistics is peculiar among mathematical systems in that it abuts upon reality in two places instead of one. This statement is equivalent to defining a language as a symbolic system; that is, as a code."

The other dogma is reductionism: the belief that each meaningful statement is equivalent to some logical construct upon terms which refer to immediate experience. Both dogmas, I shall argue, are ill-founded. One effect of abandoning them is, as we shall see, a blurring of the supposed boundary between speculative metaphysics and natural science. Another effect is a shift toward pragmatism."
