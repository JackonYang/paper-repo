Descriptions of texture are formalized from natural language descriptions; local descriptors are obtained from the directional and nondirectional components of the Fourier transform power spectrum. Analytic expressions are obtained for orientation, contrast, size, spacing, and in periodic cases, the locations of the choice of sizes is made by a simple higher-level program. The process of region growing is represented by a sheaf-theoretical model which formalizes the operation of pasting local structure (over a window) into global structure (over a region). Programs were implemented which form regions of similar color and similar texture with respect to the local descriptors."

The algorithms which will be examined are the spatial gray level dependence method (SGLDM), the gray level run length method (GLRLM), the gray level difference method (GLDM), and the power spectral method (PSM). The evaluation procedure employed does not depend on the set of features used with each algorithm or the pattern recognition scheme. Rather, what is examined is the amount of texturecontext information contained in the spatial gray level dependence matrices, the gray level run length matrices, the gray level difference density functions, and the power spectrum. The comparison will be performed in two steps. First, only Markov generated textures will be considered. The Markov textures employed are similar to the ones used by perceptual psychologist B. Julesz in his investigations of human texture perception. These Markov textures provide a convenient mechanism for generating certain example texture pairs which are important in the analysis process. In the second part of the analysis the results obtained by considering only Markov textures will be extended to all textures which can be represented by translation stationary random fields of order two. This generalization clearly includes a much broader class of textures than Markovian ones. The results obtained indicate that the SGLDM is the most powerful algorithm of the four considered, and that the GLDM is more powerful than the PSM."

This paper describes some easily computable textural features based on gray-tone spatial dependancies, and illustrates their application in category-identification tasks of three different kinds of image data: photomicrographs of five kinds of sandstones, 1:20 000 panchromatic aerial photographs of eight land-use categories, and Earth Resources Technology Satellite (ERTS) multispecial imagery containing seven land-use categories. We use two kinds of decision rules: one for which the decision regions are convex polyhedra (a piecewise linear decision rule), and one for which the decision regions are rectangular parallelpipeds (a min-max decision rule). In each experiment the data set was divided into two parts, a training set and a test set. Test set identification accuracy is 89 percent for the photomicrographs, 82 percent for the aerial photographic imagery, and 83 percent for the satellite imagery. These results indicate that the easily computable textural features probably have a general applicability for a wide variety of image-classification applications."

Such texture pairs could not be discriminated from each other by the human visual system without scrutiny. Unfortunately, Markov processes are inherently one-dimensional while the general processes underlying visual texture discrimination are two-dimensional. Here three new methods are introduced that generate two-dimensional non-Markovian textures with different third-order but identical first- and second-order statistics. All three methods generate texture pairs that cannot be discriminated from each other. The lack of texture discrimination is the more astonishing since the individual elements that form the texture pair are clearly perceived as being very different. However, a counterexample was found that yields discrimination although the texture pair has approximately identical second-order statistics. This case can be explained by assuming that early feature extractors do some preprocessing. These new demonstrations give support to a model of texture discrimination in which the stimulus is first analyzed by local feature extractors that can detect only simple features such as dots and edges of given sizes and orientations. Then the outputs of these simple extractors are evaluated by a global processor that can compute only second- or first-order statistics (that is can compare at most two such outputs)."

This grammar, once obtained, may serve as an abstract representation for the images in question. Conversely, images may be regenerated from their grammatical representations. Images regenerated in this manner, however, may contain samples that are not found in the set of original images from which the grammatical representation was developed. A method for evaluating the quality of regenerated images with respect to the set of original images is discussed. Let I be the set of original images and O be the set of images regenerated from the abstract representation of I. Set O consists of two mutually exclusive subsets, A and B. A is the set of images found in I, and B is the set of images not found in I. It is shown that the clustering behavior of set B determines the quality of the regenerated images in the mean-square sense. By defining a scatter matrix for B, several factors that influence the image quality with respect to I are derived. Experimental results on the abstract representation and regeneration of a subset of the Munson data are demonstrated. An interesting application of this regeneration model to pattern recognition in storage-restricted environments is also presented."

A manually operated writing pen senses a composite electrostatic field representing instantaneous X and Y dimension position information on a writing surface. The field components are generated by the wires of a grid beneath the writing surface, the wires of each dimension being driven in a predetermined phase distributed pattern. A phase locked loop for each dimension channel is resolved to minimum phase shift such that its frequency of operation directly represents position information in the dimension. The phase locked loops operate at sufficiently diverse frequencies as to avoid crosstalk and also permit derivation of a single composite signal by frequency modulating the higher frequency signal with the lower frequency signal which, itself, may be shifting in frequency. In the receive mode, the incoming signal is frequency and/or phase compared in the higher frequency phase locked loop to develop a signal having a d-c level representative of pen position in that dimension and also an a-c component representative of pen position in the lower frequency dimension. The latter signal is frequency and/or phase compared in the lower frequency phase locked loop to develop a signal having a d-c level representative of pen position in that dimension. The two d-c signals drive X and Y servo amplifiers which determine the position of a reproducing pen on the writing surface. Logic means provide for the establishment of a master/slave relationship in which, once one system has assumed the transmit mode, all others are locked in a receive mode. If none of the linked systems are in either the transmit or receive mode, normal aural communication may be carried out over the link."
