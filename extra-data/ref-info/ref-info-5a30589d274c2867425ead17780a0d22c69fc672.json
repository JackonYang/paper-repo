We have shown that this technique can be used to determine the most probable objects in a scene, independent of the object's position, image-plane orientation and scale. The present paper describes experiments to evaluate the robustness of multidimensional receptive eld histograms to 2D (image plane) rotation as well as 3D (scene) rotations. We present results with experiments using the Columbia image database [MN95] to determine the robustness of the approach to changes in view-point. In these experiments we examine the performance of di erent lter combinations, histogrammatching functions and design parameter of the multidimensional histograms. The rst part of the paper summarizes the mathematical foundations of the technique. The paper then presents results of experiments with image{plane rotation and view point changes (3D{rotation)."

The effectiveness of this and other approaches that match color distributions, however, depends on the approximate constancy of the scene illumination.

Recently, for example, a technique called color indexing due to Swain and Ballard [6] used color histograms for the efficient recognition of objects from a large database in the presence of changes in scene geometry and occlusion. The effectiveness of this and other approaches that match color distributions, however, depends on the approximate constancy of the scene illumination. In this paper, we develop color histogram descriptors that are invariant to changes in the intensity and spectral distribution of the illumination. We present a set of experiments that dernonstrate the effectiveness of these descriptors for object recognition in the presence of changes in illuminant spectral power distribution."

Since the ratios of color RGB triples from neighboring locations are relatively insensitive to changes in the incident illumination, this circumvents the need for color constancy preprocessing.

The authors show how to design and steer the filters and present examples of their use in the analysis of orientation and phase, angularly adaptive filtering, edge detection, and shape from shading. One can also build a self-similar steerable pyramid representation. The same concepts can be generalized to the design of 3-D steerable filters. >"

The robot is equipped with a heterogeneous sampled imaging system, a fovea, resembling the varying resolution in a human retina. The relation between the fovea and multiresolution image processing is discussed together with implications for image operations.A stereo algorithm based on local phase differences is presented both as a stand alone algorithm and as apart of a vergence control system for the robot above. The algorithm is fast and can handle !arge disparities and still give subpixel accuracy. The algorithm uses a wavelet approach beginning at a coarse resolution and refining the disparity estimates while increasing the resolution. The method produces robust and accurate estimates of displacement on synthetic as well as real life stereo images. Disparity filter design is discussed anda number of filters are tested e.g. Gabor filters and lognorm quadrature filters. A special disparity filter designed to have only one phase cycle is also presented.A theory for sequentially defined, data modified focus of attention, based on nested regions of interest is presented. The theory is applied to preattentive gaze control system consisting of three control levels: camera vergence, edge tracking and object finding. The object finder uses circular symmetries as indications on possible object and directs the fixation point accordingly. The edge tracker make the fixation point follow the structures in the scene and the camera vergence control assures that both eyes are fixating the same point. The coordination between the levels is handled with potential fields in the robot parameter space."
