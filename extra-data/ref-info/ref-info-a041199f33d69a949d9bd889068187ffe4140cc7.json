The technique determines the statistics of the points over a collection of example shapes. The mean positions of the points give an average shape and a number of modes of variation are determined describing the main ways in which the example shapes tend to deform from the average. In this way allowed variation in shape can be included in the model. The method produces a compact flexible \u2018Point Distribution Model\u2019 with a small number of linearly independent parameters, which can be used during image search. We demonstrate the application of the Point Distribution Model in describing two classes of shapes."

The method can be applied to a given image interpretation problem simply by training a Point Distribution Model (PDM), using a set of examples of the image structure to be located. A local optimisation technique, developed for use with PDMs, has been incorporated into the GA search with the aim of improving the speed of convergence and optimality of solution. We present results, from three practical applications, demonstrating that the new method offers significant improvements when compared to previously reported approaches to flexible template matching. The benefits include the ability to deal with different domains of application using a standard method, the ability to deal with complex multi-part models and improved search performance."

The method uses flexible models derived from sets of training examples. These models, known as Point Distribution Models, represent objects as sets of labelled points. An initial estimate of the location of the model points in an image is improved by attempting to move each point to a better position nearby. Adjustments to the pose variables and shape parameters are calculated. Limits are placed on the shape parameters ensuring that the example can only deform into shapes conforming to global constraints imposed by the training set. An iterative procedure deforms the model example to find the best fit to the image object. Results of applying the method are described. The technique is shown to be a powerful method for refining estimates of object shape and location."
