This creates cubically many parameters, which form a three-dimensional interaction tensor. We describe a low-rank approximation to this interaction tensor that uses a sum of factors, each of which is a three-way outer product. This approximation allows efficient learning of transformations between larger image patches. Since each factor can be viewed as an image filter, the model as a whole learns optimal filter pairs for efficiently representing transformations. We demonstrate the learning of optimal filter pairs from various synthetic and real image sequences. We also show how learning about image transformations allows the model to perform a simple visual analogy task, and we show how a completely unsupervised network trained on transformations perceives multiple motions of transparent dot patterns in the same way as humans."

Using complementary priors, we derive a fast, greedy algorithm that can learn deep, directed belief networks one layer at a time, provided the top two layers form an undirected associative memory. The fast, greedy algorithm is used to initialize a slower learning procedure that fine-tunes the weights using a contrastive version of the wake-sleep algorithm. After fine-tuning, a network with three hidden layers forms a very good generative model of the joint distribution of handwritten digit images and their labels. This generative model gives better digit classification than the best discriminative learning algorithms. The low-dimensional manifolds on which the digits lie are modeled by long ravines in the free-energy landscape of the top-level associative memory, and it is easy to explore these ravines by using the directed connections to display what the associative memory has in mind."

The generative models can be learned one layer at a time and when learning is complete they have a very fast inference procedure for computing a good approximation to the posterior distribution in all of the hidden layers. Each hidden layer has its own MRF whose energy function is modulated by the top-down directed connections from the layer above. To generate from the model, each layer in turn must settle to equilibrium given its top-down input. We show that this type of model is good at capturing the statistics of patches of natural images."

Scaling such models to full-sized, high-dimensional images remains a difficult problem. To address this problem, we present the convolutional deep belief network, a hierarchical generative model which scales to realistic image sizes. This model is translation-invariant and supports efficient bottom-up and top-down probabilistic inference. Key to our approach is probabilistic max-pooling, a novel technique which shrinks the representations of higher layers in a probabilistically sound way. Our experiments show that the algorithm learns useful high-level visual features, such as object parts, from unlabeled images of objects and natural scenes. We demonstrate excellent performance on several visual recognition tasks and show that our model can perform hierarchical (bottom-up and top-down) inference over full-sized images."

It is, in principle, an excellent dataset for unsupervised training of deep generative models, but previous researchers who have tried this have found it dicult to learn a good set of lters from the images. We show how to train a multi-layer generative model that learns to extract meaningful features which resemble those found in the human visual cortex. Using a novel parallelization algorithm to distribute the work among multiple machines connected on a network, we show how training such a model can be done in reasonable time. A second problematic aspect of the tiny images dataset is that there are no reliable class labels which makes it hard to use for object recognition experiments. We created two sets of reliable labels. The CIFAR-10 set has 6000 examples of each of 10 classes and the CIFAR-100 set has 600 examples of each of 100 non-overlapping classes. Using these labels, we show that object recognition is signicantly improved by pre-training a layer of features on a large set of unlabeled tiny images."

We present a new model, based on the CRBM that preserves its most important computational properties and includes multiplicative three-way interactions that allow the effective interaction weight between two units to be modulated by the dynamic state of a third unit. We factor the three-way weight tensor implied by the multiplicative model, reducing the number of parameters from O(N3) to O(N2). The result is an efficient, compact model whose effectiveness we demonstrate by modeling human motion. Like the CRBM, our model can capture diverse styles of motion with a single set of parameters, and the three-way interactions greatly improve the model's ability to blend motion styles or to transition smoothly among them."

In contrast to the causal generative extensions of ICA which maintain marginal independence of sources, we define features as deterministic (linear) functions of the inputs. This assumption results in marginal dependencies among the features, but conditional independence of the features given the inputs. By assigning energies to the features a probability distribution over the input states is defined through the Boltzmann distribution. Free parameters of this model are trained using the contrastive divergence objective (Hinton, 2002). When the number of features is equal to the number of input dimensions this energy-based model reduces to noiseless ICA and we show experimentally that the proposed learning algorithm is able to perform blind source separation on speech data. In additional experiments we train overcomplete energy-based models to extract features from various standard data-sets containing speech, natural images, hand-written digits and faces."

Recent progress in machine learning shows that it is possible to learn deep hierarchies without requiring any labelled data. The feature detectors are learned one layer at a time and the goal of the learning procedure is to form a good generative model of images, not to predict the class of each image. The learning procedure only requires the pairwise correlations between the activations of neuron-like processing units in adjacent layers. The original version of the learning procedure is derived from a quadratic \u2018energy\u2019 function but it can be extended to allow third-order, multiplicative interactions in which neurons gate the pairwise interactions between other neurons. A technique for factoring the third-order interactions leads to a learning module that again has a simple learning rule based on pairwise correlations. This module looks remarkably like modules that have been proposed by both biologists trying to explain the responses of neurons and engineers trying to create systems that can recognize objects."

                "text": "T h e Boltzmann machine is a nonlinear network of stochastic binary processing units t ha t interact pairwise through symmetric connection strengths. In a third-order Boltzmann machine, triples of units interact through symmetric conjunctive interactions. The Boltzmann learning algorithm is generalized t o higher-order interactions. The rate of learning for internal representations in a higher-order Boltzmann machine should be much faster t han for a second-order Boltzmann machine based on pairwise interactions. I N T R O D U C T I O N Thousands of hours of practice are required by humans t o become experts in domains such as chess, mathematics and physics1. Learning in these domains requires the mastery of a large number of highly interrelated ideas, and a deep understanding requires generalization as well as memorization. There are two traditions in the literature on learning in neural network models. One class of models is based on the problem of content-addressable memory and emphasizes a fast, one-shot form of learning. The second class of models uses slow, incremental learning, which requires many repetitions of examples. I t is difficult in humans t o s tudy fast and slow learning in isolation. In some amnesics, however, the long-term retention of facts is severely impaired, but the slow acquisition of skills, including cognitive skills, is spared2. Thus, it is possible tha t separate memory mechanisms are used t o implement fast learning and slow learning. Long practice is required t o become a n expert, bu t expert performance is swift and difficult to analyze; with more practice there is faster performance1. Why is slow learning so slow? One possibility is t h a t the expert develops internal representations tha t allow fast parallel searches for solutions t o problems in the task domain, in contrast t o a novice who must apply knowledge piecemeal. An internal representation is a mental model of the task domain; t h a t is, internal degrees of freedom between the sensory inputs and motor outputs t h a t efficiently encode the variables relevant t o the solution of the problem. This approach can be made more precise by specifying neural network models and showing how they incorporate internal representations. L E A R N I N G IN NETWORK M O D E L S Network models of fast learning include linear correlation-matrix m o d e l ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ l ~ and the more recent nonlinear autoassociative m o d e ~ s ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ' ~ . These models use the Hebb learning rule t o store information t h a t can be retrieved by the completion of partially specified input patterns. New patterns are stored by imposing the pattern on the network and altering the connection strengths between the pairs of units that are above threshold. The information that is stored therefore concerns the correlations, .or second-order relationships between the components of the pattern. The internal model is built from correlations. Network models of slow learning include the perceptronll and adaline12. These networks can classify input patterns given only examples of inputs and desired outputs. The connection strengths are changed incrementally during the training and the network gradually converges to a set of weights tha t solves the problem if such as set of weights exists. Unfortunately, there are many difficult problems that cannot be solved with these networks, such as the prediction of parity'3. The perceptron and adaline are limited because they have only one layer of modifiable connection strengths and can only implement linear discriminant functions. Higher-order problems like parity cannot be solved by storing the desired patterns using the class of contentaddressable algorithms based on the Hebb learning rule. These models are limited because the metric of similarity is based on Hamming distance and only correlations can be used t o access patterns. The first network model to demonstrably learn t o solve higher-order problems was the Boltzmann machine, which overcame the limitations of previous network models by introducing hidden units14*15116. Hidden units are added t o the network t o mediate between the input and output units; they provide the extra internal degrees of freedom needed t o form internal representations. The Boltzmann learning algorithm incrementally modifies internal connections in the network to build higher-order pattern detectors. The hidden units can be recruited t o form internal representations for any problem; however, the learning may require an extremely large number of training examples and can be excessively slow. One way t o speed up the learning is to use hidden units that have higher-order interactions with other units. THIRD-ORDER BOLTZMANN MACHINES Consider a Boltzmann machine with a cubic global energy function: where si is the state of the i t h binary unit and w;p is a weight between triples of units. This type of interaction generalizes the pairwise interactions in Hopfield networkslo and Boltzmann machines, which contribute a quadratic term t o the energy. Fig. 1 shows an interpretation of the cubic term as conjunctive synapses. Each unit in the network updates its binary state asynchronously with probability where T is a parameter the i t h unit is given by analagous t o the temperature and the total input to If wijk is symmetric on all pairs of indices then the energy of the network is nonincreasing. It can be shown that in equilibrium the probabilities of global states P, follow a Boltzmann distribution Fig. 1. Third-order interactions between three units. In the diagram the lines between units represent reciprocal interactions that are activated only when the third unit is in the on state. The third unit acts presynaptically to conjunctively control the painvise interactions. There are two forms of the Boltzmann learning algorithm, one for networks with inputs and outputs treated identically, and a second for networks where the input units are always clamped15. The former learning algorithm will be generalized for third-order interactions. The learning metric on weight space remains the same: where P , is the probability of a global state with both the inputs and outputs clamped, and Pd, is the probability of a global state when the network is allowed to run freely. I t can be shown that the gradient of G is given by where p i jk is the ensemble average probability of three units all being in the on state when the input and output units are clamped, and pi;k is the corresponding probability when the network is running freely. T o minimize G , it is sufficient to measure the time averaged triple co-occurence probabilities when the network is in equilibrium under the two conditions and t o change each weight according to where c scales the size of each weight change. HIGHER-ORDER BOLTZMANN MACHINES Define the energy of a k -th order Boltzmann machine as where w 7172 . . . 7t is a k -dimensional weight indices. The G matrix can be minimized by matrix symmetric on all pairs of gradient descent: where P ~ , ~ . . . is the probability of the k-tuple co-occurence of the I (s 71 ,S 72 , . . s 7r ) when the inputs and outputs are clamped, and p 7172. . . 7L is the corresponding probability when the network is freely running. In general, the energy for a Boltzmann machine is the sum over all orders of interaction and the learning algorithm is a linear combination of terms from each order. This is a Markov random field with polynomial interactions17."

Using patches of natural scenes, we demonstrate that our approach represents a viable alternative to independent component analysis as an interpretive model of biological visual systems. Although the two approaches are similar in flavor, there are also important differences, particularly when the representations are overcomplete. By constraining the interactions within our model, we are also able to study the topographic organization of Gabor-like receptive fields that our model learns.

Given an appropriate network architecture, gradient-based learning algorithms can be used to synthesize a complex decision surface that can classify high-dimensional patterns, such as handwritten characters, with minimal preprocessing. This paper reviews various methods applied to handwritten character recognition and compares them on a standard handwritten digit recognition task. Convolutional neural networks, which are specifically designed to deal with the variability of 2D shapes, are shown to outperform all other techniques. Real-life document recognition systems are composed of multiple modules including field extraction, segmentation recognition, and language modeling. A new learning paradigm, called graph transformer networks (GTN), allows such multimodule systems to be trained globally using gradient-based methods so as to minimize an overall performance measure. Two systems for online handwriting recognition are described. Experiments demonstrate the advantage of global training, and the flexibility of graph transformer networks. A graph transformer network for reading a bank cheque is also described. It uses convolutional neural network character recognizers combined with global training techniques to provide record accuracy on business and personal cheques. It is deployed commercially and reads several million cheques per day."

Essential to this process is the formation of abstract representations that generalize from specific instances of visual input. A common view holds that neurons in the early visual system signal conjunctions of image features, but how these produce invariant representations is poorly understood. Here we propose that to generalize over similar images, higher-level visual neurons encode statistical variations that characterize local image regions. We present a model in which neural activity encodes the probability distribution most consistent with a given image. Trained on natural images, the model generalizes by learning a compact set of dictionary elements for image distributions typically encountered in natural scenes. Model neurons show a diverse range of properties observed in cortical cells. These results provide a new functional explanation for nonlinear effects in complex cells and offer insight into coding strategies in primary visual cortex (V1) and higher visual areas."

Using a variety of non-parametric methods, we explore this world with the aid of a large dataset of 79,302,017 images collected from the Internet. Motivated by psychophysical results showing the remarkable tolerance of the human visual system to degradations in image resolution, the images in the dataset are stored as 32 x 32 color images. Each image is loosely labeled with one of the 75,062 non-abstract nouns in English, as listed in the Wordnet lexical database. Hence the image database gives a comprehensive coverage of all object categories and scenes. The semantic information from Wordnet can be used in conjunction with nearest-neighbor methods to perform object classification over a range of semantic levels minimizing the effects of labeling noise. For certain classes that are particularly prevalent in the dataset, such as people, we are able to demonstrate a recognition performance comparable to class-specific Viola-Jones style detectors."

In recent years, \u201cnatural\u201d images have become popular in the study of vision and have been used to show apparently impressive progress in building such models. Here, we challenge the use of uncontrolled \u201cnatural\u201d images in guiding that progress. In particular, we show that a simple V1-like model\u2014a neuroscientist's \u201cnull\u201d model, which should perform poorly at real-world visual object recognition tasks\u2014outperforms state-of-the-art object recognition systems (biologically inspired and otherwise) on a standard, ostensibly natural image recognition test. As a counterpoint, we designed a \u201csimpler\u201d recognition test to better span the real-world variation in object pose, position, and scale, and we show that this test correctly exposes the inadequacy of the V1-like model. Taken together, these results demonstrate that tests based on uncontrolled natural images can be seriously misleading, potentially guiding progress in the wrong direction. Instead, we reexamine what it means for images to be natural and argue for a renewed focus on the core problem of object recognition\u2014real-world image variation."

The resulting feature extractor consists of multiple convolution filters, followed by a feature-pooling layer that computes the max of each filter output within adjacent windows, and a point-wise sigmoid non-linearity. A second level of larger and more invariant features is obtained by training the same algorithm on patches of features from the first level. Training a supervised classifier on these features yields 0.64% error on MNIST, and 54% average recognition rate on Caltech 101 with 30 training samples per category. While the resulting architecture is similar to convolutional networks, the layer-wise unsupervised training procedure alleviates the over-parameterization problems that plague purely supervised learning procedures, and yields good performance with very few labeled training samples."

This way of combining individual expert models makes it hard to generate samples from the combined model but easy to infer the values of the latent variables of each expert, because the combination rule ensures that the latent variables of different experts are conditionally independent when given the data. A product of experts (PoE) is therefore an interesting candidate for a perceptual system in which rapid inference is vital and generation is unnecessary. Training a PoE by maximizing the likelihood of the data is difficult because it is hard even to approximate the derivatives of the renormalization term in the combination rule. Fortunately, a PoE can be trained using a different objective function called contrastive divergence whose derivatives with regard to the parameters can be approximated accurately and efficiently. Examples are presented of contrastive divergence learning using several types of expert on several types of data."

Methods for efficiently searching this incredibly rich resource are vital for a large number of applications. These include object recognition, computer graphics, personal photo collections, online image search tools. In this paper, our goal is to develop efficient image search and scene matching techniques that are not only fast, but also require very little memory, enabling their use on standard hardware or even on handheld devices. Our approach uses recently developed machine learning techniques to convert the Gist descriptor (a real valued vector that describes orientation energies at different scales and orientations within an image) to a compact binary code, with a few hundred bits per image. Using our scheme, it is possible to perform real-time searches with millions from the Internet using a single large PC and obtain recognition results comparable to the full descriptor. Using our codes on high quality labeled images from the LabelMe database gives surprisingly powerful recognition results using simple nearest neighbor techniques."

Here we present a statistical model that learns a nonlinear representation from the data that reflects abstract, invariant properties of the signal without making requirements about the kind of signal that can be processed. The model has a hierarchy of two layers, with the first layer broadly corresponding to Independent Component Analysis (ICA) and a second layer to represent higher order structure. We estimate the model using the mathematical framework of Score Matching (SM), a novel method for the estimation of non-normalized statistical models. The model incorporates a squaring nonlinearity, which we propose to be suitable for forming a higher-order code of invariances. Additionally the squaring can be viewed as modelling subspaces to capture residual dependencies, which linear models cannot capture."

Markov chain Monte Carlo methods typically take a long time to converge on unbiased estimates, but Hinton (2002) showed that if the Markov chain is only run for a few steps, the learning can still work well and it approximately minimizes a different function called \u201ccontrastive divergence\u201d (CD). CD learning has been successfully applied to various types of random fields. Here, we study the properties of CD learning and show that it provides biased estimates in general, but that the bias is typically very small. Fast CD learning can therefore be used to get close to an ML solution and slow ML learning can then be used to fine-tune the CD solution. Consider a probability distribution over a vector x (assumed discrete w.l.o.g.) and with parameters W p(x;W) = 1 Z(W) e (1) where Z(W) = \u2211 x e \u2212E(x;W) is a normalisation constant and E(x;W) is an energy function. This class of random-field distributions has found many practical applications (Li, 2001; Winkler, 2002; Teh et al., 2003; He et al., 2004). Maximum-likelihood (ML) learning of the parameters W given an iid sample X = {xn}n=1 can be done by gradient ascent: W = W + \u03b7 \u2202L(W;X ) \u2202W \u2223"

We do not assume that the unlabeled data follows the same class labels or generative distribution as the labeled data. Thus, we would like to use a large number of unlabeled images (or audio samples, or text documents) randomly downloaded from the Internet to improve performance on a given image (or audio, or text) classification task. Such unlabeled data is significantly easier to obtain than in typical semi-supervised or transfer learning settings, making self-taught learning widely applicable to many practical learning problems. We describe an approach to self-taught learning that uses sparse coding to construct higher-level features using the unlabeled data. These features form a succinct input representation and significantly improve classification performance. When using an SVM for classification, we further show how a Fisher kernel can be learned for this representation."

Our system's architecture is motivated by a quantitative model of visual cortex. We show that our approach exhibits excellent recognition performance and outperforms several state-of-the-art systems on a variety of image datasets including many different object categories. We also demonstrate that our system is able to learn from very few examples. The performance of the approach constitutes a suggestive plausibility proof for a class of feedforward models of object recognition in cortex."

This book demonstrates how Bayesian methods allow complex neural network models to be used without fear of the \"overfitting\" that can occur with traditional training methods. Insight into the nature of these complex Bayesian models is provided by a theoretical investigation of the priors over functions that underlie them. A practical implementation of Bayesian neural network learning using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods is also described, and software for it is freely available over the Internet. Presupposing only basic knowledge of probability and statistics, this book should be of interest to researchers in statistics, engineering, and artificial intelligence."

Pixel gray levels and the presence and orientation of edges are viewed as states of atoms or molecules in a lattice-like physical system. The assignment of an energy function in the physical system determines its Gibbs distribution. Because of the Gibbs distribution, Markov random field (MRF) equivalence, this assignment also determines an MRF image model. The energy function is a more convenient and natural mechanism for embodying picture attributes than are the local characteristics of the MRF. For a range of degradation mechanisms, including blurring, nonlinear deformations, and multiplicative or additive noise, the posterior distribution is an MRF with a structure akin to the image model. By the analogy, the posterior distribution defines another (imaginary) physical system. Gradual temperature reduction in the physical system isolates low energy states (``annealing''), or what is the same thing, the most probable states under the Gibbs distribution. The analogous operation under the posterior distribution yields the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the image given the degraded observations. The result is a highly parallel ``relaxation'' algorithm for MAP estimation. We establish convergence properties of the algorithm and we experiment with some simple pictures, for which good restorations are obtained at low signal-to-noise ratios."

First, the marginal densities of the coefficients have extended heavy tails. Second, the joint densities exhibit variance dependencies not captured by second-order models. We examine properties of the class of Gaussian scale mixtures, and show that these densities can accurately characterize both the marginal and joint distributions of natural image wavelet coefficients. This class of model suggests a Markov structure, in which wavelet coefficients are linked by hidden scaling variables corresponding to local image structure. We derive an estimator for these hidden variables, and show that a nonlinear \"normalization\" procedure can be used to Gaussianize the coefficients."

The first stage is often composed of three main modules: (1) a bank of filters (often oriented edge detectors); (2) a non-linear transform, such as a point-wise squashing functions, quantization, or normalization; (3) a spatial pooling operation which combines the outputs of similar filters over neighboring regions. We propose a method that automatically learns such feature extractors in an unsupervised fashion by simultaneously learning the filters and the pooling units that combine multiple filter outputs together. The method automatically generates topographic maps of similar filters that extract features of orientations, scales, and positions. These similar filters are pooled together, producing locally-invariant outputs. The learned feature descriptors give comparable results as SIFT on image recognition tasks for which SIFT is well suited, and better results than SIFT on tasks for which SIFT is less well suited."

The procedure is based on a very low dimensional representation of the scene, that we term the Spatial Envelope. We propose a set of perceptual dimensions (naturalness, openness, roughness, expansion, ruggedness) that represent the dominant spatial structure of a scene. Then, we show that these dimensions may be reliably estimated using spectral and coarsely localized information. The model generates a multidimensional space in which scenes sharing membership in semantic categories (e.g., streets, highways, coasts) are projected closed together. The performance of the spatial envelope model shows that specific information about object shape or identity is not a requirement for scene categorization and that modeling a holistic representation of the scene informs about its probable semantic category."

While \u201cline-process\u201d models of discontinuities have received a great deal of attention, there has been recent interest in the use of robust statistical techniques to account for discontinuities. This paper unifies the two approaches. To achieve this we generalize the notion of a \u201cline process\u201d to that of an analog \u201coutlier process\u201d and show how a problem formulated in terms of outlier processes can be viewed in terms of robust statistics. We also characterize a class of robust statistical problems for which an equivalent outlier-process formulation exists and give a straightforward method for converting a robust estimation problem into an outlier-process formulation. We show how prior assumptions about the spatial structure of outliers can be expressed as constraints on the recovered analog outlier processes and how traditional continuation methods can be extended to the explicit outlier-process formulation. These results indicate that the outlier-process approach provides a general framework which subsumes the traditional line-process approaches as well as a wide class of robust estimation problems. Examples in surface reconstruction, image segmentation, and optical flow are presented to illustrate the use of outlier processes and to show how the relationship between outlier processes and robust statistics can be exploited. An appendix provides a catalog of common robust error norms and their equivalent outlier-process formulations."

At present, the feature set of CUDAMat is biased towards providing functionality useful for implementing standard machine learning algorithms, however, it is general enough to be useful in other elds. We have used CUDAMat to implement several common machine learning algorithms on GPUs oering speedups of up to 50x over numpy and MATLAB implementations."
