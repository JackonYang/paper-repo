The recognition is based on the characteristic motion of the legs of a pedestrian walking parallel to the image plane. Each image is segmented into region-like image parts by clustering pixels in a combined color/position feature space. The proposed clustering technique implies matching of corresponding clusters in consecutive frames and therefore allows clusters to be tracked over a sequence of images. Based on the observation of clusters over time a two-stage classifier extracts those clusters which most likely represent the legs of pedestrians. A fast polynomial classifier performs a rough preselection of clusters by evaluating temporal changes of a shape-dependent clusters feature. The final classification is done by a time delay neural network (TDNN) with spatio-temporal receptive fields."

To choose effective multi-dimensional features for infrared-image-based detection, the paper first investigates the possibilities of reusing available features for visible images by analyzing the different properties of infrared images and visible images. To take advantage of unique properties of infrared images, we propose the following novel features: special projection feature for segmentation, and two-axis pixel-distribution feature for classification. The segmentation based on new features does not depend on many assumptions and is shape-independent, thus avoiding brute-force multiple templates and multi-scale pyramid searching. The novel classification features include histogram feature and inertial feature that are independent and complimentary, thus the two-dimensional fusion-based classification significantly improves detection accuracy. These proposed features are independent from conventional pixel-array feature, and can be further fused with other general pedestrian detection features to improve simplicity, speed, and reliability."

The proposed method detects moving objects whose motions are not consistent with the movement of the background and is considered to be complementary to shape-based approaches. In this paper, two new techniques are introduced for this task for night vision, namely a two-stage method for stereo correspondence and motion detection without explicit ego-motion calculation. These techniques make use of characteristics of night-vision video data, in which humans appear as hotspots. This method works well in cases where the camera motion has a dominant translational motion with a small amount of rotational motion, which is suitable for the camera on the vehicle. Error analysis as well as experimental results are presented to validate our approach and comparisons have been carried out between our approach and frame-by-frame based pattern-recognition approaches."

The method uses a template hierarchy to capture the variety of object shapes; efficient hierarchies can be generated offline for given shape distributions using stochastic optimization techniques (i.e. simulated annealing). Online, matching involves a simultaneous coarse-to-fine approach over the shape hierarchy and over the transformation parameters. Very large speed-up factors are typically obtained when comparing this approach with the equivalent brute-force formulation; we have measured gains of several orders of magnitudes. We present experimental results on the real-time detection of traffic signs and pedestrians from a moving vehicle. Because of the highly time sensitive nature of these vision tasks, we also discuss some hardware-specific implementations of the proposed method as far as SIMD parallelism is concerned."

Our PROTECTOR system combines pedestrian detection, trajectory estimation, risk assessment and driver warning. The paper pursues a \"system approach\" related to the detection component. An optimization scheme models the system as a succession of individual modules and finds a good overall parameter setting by combining individual ROCs using a convex-hull technique. On the experimental side, we present a methodology for the validation of the pedestrian detection performance in an actual vehicle setting. We hope this test methodology to contribute towards the establishment of benchmark testing, enabling this application to mature. We validate the PROTECTOR system using the proposed methodology and present interesting quantitative results based on tens of thousands of images from hours of driving. Although results are promising, more research is needed before such systems can be placed at the hands of ordinary vehicle drivers."

We use a detection style algorithm that scans a detector over two consecutive frames of a video sequence. The detector is trained (using AdaBoost) to take advantage of both motion and appearance information to detect a walking person. Past approaches have built detectors based on motion information or detectors based on appearance information, but ours is the first to combine both sources of information in a single detector. The implementation described runs at about 4 frames/second, detects pedestrians at very small scales (as small as 20 \u00d7 15 pixels), and has a very low false positive rate.Our approach builds on the detection work of Viola and Jones. Novel contributions of this paper include: (i) development of a representation of image motion which is extremely efficient, and (ii) implementation of a state of the art pedestrian detection system which operates on low resolution images under difficult conditions (such as rain and snow)."

In the proposed method, a wavelet transform is computed on the video frames, and multistage template matching is used to determine whether or not a pedestrian is present in the frame. Motion detection and localization is used to reduce the computational requirements. Experimental results are presented for several different video sequences.

Probabilistic mechanisms are attractive because they handle fusion of information, especially temporal fusion, in a principled manner. Exemplars are selected representatives of raw training data, used here to represent probabilistic mixture distributions of object configurations. Their use avoids tedious hand-construction of object models and problems with changes of topology. Using exemplars in place of a parameterized model poses several challenges, addressed here with what we call the \"Metric Mixture\" (M/sup 2/) approach. The M/sup 2/ model has several valuable properties. Principally, it provides alternatives to standard learning algorithms by allowing the use of metrics that are not embedded in a vector space. Secondly, it uses a noise model that is learned from training data. Lastly, it eliminates any need for an assumption of probabilistic pixelwise independence. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the M/sup 2/ model in two domains tracking walking people using chamfer distances on binary edge images and tracking mouth movements by means of a shuffle distance."

The technique is demonstrated by developing a system that locates people in cluttered scenes. The system is structured with four distinct example-based detectors that are trained to separately find the four components of the human body: the head, legs, left arm, and right arm. After ensuring that these components are present in the proper geometric configuration, a second example-based classifier combines the results of the component detectors to classify a pattern as either a \"person\" or a \"nonperson.\" We call this type of hierarchical architecture, in which learning occurs at multiple stages, an adaptive combination of classifiers (ACC). We present results that show that this system performs significantly better than a similar full-body person detector. This suggests that the improvement in performance is due to the component-based approach and the ACC data classification architecture. The algorithm is also more robust than the full-body person detection method in that it is capable of locating partially occluded views of people and people whose body parts have little contrast with the background."

This paper presents an in-depth experimental study on pedestrian classification; multiple feature-classifier combinations are examined with respect to their ROC performance and efficiency. We investigate global versus local and adaptive versus nonadaptive features, as exemplified by PCA coefficients, Haar wavelets, and local receptive fields (LRFs). In terms of classifiers, we consider the popular support vector machines (SVMs), feedforward neural networks, and k-nearest neighbor classifier. Experiments are performed on a large data set consisting of 4,000 pedestrian and more than 25,000 nonpedestrian (labeled) images captured in outdoor urban environments. Statistically meaningful results are obtained by analyzing performance variances caused by varying training and test sets. Furthermore, we investigate how classification performance and training sample size are correlated. Sample size is adjusted by increasing the number of manually labeled training data or by employing automatic bootstrapping or cascade techniques. Our experiments show that the novel combination of SVMs with LRF features performs best. A boosted cascade of Haar wavelets can, however, reach quite competitive results, at a fraction of computational cost. The data set used in this paper is made public, establishing a benchmark for this important problem"

The first is based upon the motion epipolar constraint\u2014translational motion produces a flow field radially expanding from a \u201cfocus of expansion\u201d (FOE).

The Condensation tracking algorithm is appealing for its generality and potential for real-time implementation. However, the conventional Condensation tracker is known to have difficulty with high-dimensional state spaces and unknown motion models. This paper presents an improved algorithm that addresses these problems by using a simplified motion model, and employing quasi-Monte Carlo techniques to efficiently sample the resulting tracking problem in the high-dimensional state space. For N sample points, these techniques achieve sampling errors of O(N-1), as opposed to O(N-1/2) for conventional Monte Carlo techniques. We illustrate the algorithm by tracking objects in both synthetic and real sequences, and show that it achieves reliable tracking and significant speed-ups over conventional Monte Carlo techniques."

Experiments were performed to evaluate our system and estimate the trade-off between number of images in walking sequences and performance."

The system derives much of its power from a representation that describes an object class in terms of an overcomplete dictionary of local, oriented, multiscale intensity differences between adjacent regions, efficiently computable as a Haar wavelet transform. This example-based learning approach implicitly derives a model of an object class by training a support vector machine classifier using a large set of positive and negative examples. We present results on face, people, and car detection tasks using the same architecture. In addition, we quantify how the representation affects detection performance by considering several alternate representations including pixels and principal components. We also describe a real-time application of our person detection system as part of a driver assistance system."

It is more problematic to apply modelbased methods to images of objects whose appearance can vary, though a number of approaches based on the use of flexible templates have been proposed. The problem with existing methods is that they sacrifice model specificity in order to accommodate variability, thereby compromising robustness during image interpretation. We argue that a model should only be able to deform in ways characteristic of the class of objects it represents. We describe a method for building models by learning patterns of variability from a training set of correctly annotated images. These models can be used for image search in an iterative refinement algorithm analogous to that employed by Active Contour Models (Snakes). The key difference is that our Active Shape Models can only deform to fit the data in ways consistent with the training set. We show several practical examples where we have built such models and used them to locate partially occluded objects in noisy, cluttered images. Q 199s A&& prrss, IN."

In building an optimal cascade we considered three heuristics: (1) use of a frontier-following approximation, (2) controlling error rates, and (3) weighting. Simulations of synthetic data with various underlying distributions were carried out. We found that a weighting heuristic is optimal in terms of both computational complexity and error rates. We initiate a systematic comparison of several potential heuristics that can be utilized in building a hierarchical model. A range of discussions regarding the implications and the promises of cascade architecture as well as of techniques that can be integrated into this framework is provided. The optimum heuristic--weighting algorithms--was applied to an IR data set. It was found that these algorithms outperform some state-of-the-art approaches that utilize the same type of simple classifier."

We propose a tree-based representation of the distribution, where the leaves define a partition of the state space with piecewise constant density. The advantage of this representation is that regions with low probability mass can be rapidly discarded in a hierarchical search, and the distribution can be approximated to arbitrary precision. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the technique by using it for tracking 3D articulated and nonrigid motion in front of cluttered background. More specifically, we are interested in estimating the joint angles, position and orientation of a 3D hand model in order to drive an avatar."

A major difficulty with these methods is acquiring and trading the requisite feature points, which are generally specific joints such as knees or angles. This requires previous recognition and/or part segmentation of the actor. We show that the recognition of walking or any repetitive motion activity can be accomplished on the basis of bottom up processing, which does not require the prior identification of specific parts, or classification of the actor. In particular, we demonstrate that repetitive motion is such a strong cue, that the moving actor can be segmented, normalized spatially and temporally, and recognized by matching against a spatiotemporal template of motion features. We have implemented a real-time system that can recognize and classify repetitive motion activities in normal gray-scale image sequences.<<ETX>>"

A method is described for generating a similar flexible shape model automatically from real image data. A cubic B-spline is used as the shape vector for training the model. Large training sets are used to generate a robust model of the human profile for use in the labelling and tracking of pedestrians in real-world scenes.

The associated parameter search space is extremely large and nonsmooth; moreover, the optimal choices of the parameters are usually mutually dependent on each other. In this paper we offer a Bayesian network-based probabilistic formalism, which we call the parameter dependence networks (PDNs), to model, abstract, and analyze the parameter space behavior of vision systems. The various algorithm parameters are the nodes of the PDN and are associated with probabilistic beliefs about the optimality of their respective values. The links between the nodes capture the direct dependencies between them and are quantified by conditional belief functions. The PDN structure captures the interdependence among the parameters in a concise and explicit manner. We define information theoretic measures, based on these PDNs, to quantify the global parameter sensitivity and the strength of the interdependence of the parameters. These measures predict the general ease of parameter tuning and performance stability of the system. The PDNs can also be used to stochastically sample the parameter space, to select optimal parameter sets (e.g., in performance evaluation studies), and to choose parameters, given constraints on the choice of some parameters. We also offer a strategy based on stochastic learning automata to generate training data to automatically build these PDNs. The team of learning automata stochastically samples the parameter space in a nonuniform manner with more samples near optimal values. These nonuniform samples are used to infer both the dependency structure and the conditional probabilities of the PDN. We demonstrate the process of construction of the PDN for an isolated vision module with 4 parameters (an edge detector), a coupling of two vision modules with a total of 7 parameters (a small edge grouping module), and a combination of three vision modules with 21 parameters (a complex perceptual organization module)."

Cascade learning is aided by the modularity of the architecture in which nodes are chained together to form a cascade. In this paper we present two new cascade learning results which address the decoupled nature of the cascade learning task. First, we introduce a cascade indifference curve framework, which connects the learning objectives for a node to the overall cascade performance. We derive a new cost function for node learning, which yields fully-automatic stopping conditions and improved detection performance. Second, we introduce the concept of perturbation bias, which leverages the statistical differences between target and non-target classes in a detection problem to obtain improved performance and robustness. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions for the success of the method and present experimental results."

This uncertainty makes building robust classification systems problematic. We show that it is possible to build a hybrid classifier that will perform at least as well as the best available classifier for any target conditions. In some cases, the performance of the hybrid actually can surpass that of the best known classifier. This robust performance extends across a wide variety of comparison frameworks, including the optimization of metrics such as accuracy, expected cost, lift, precision, recall, and workforce utilization. The hybrid also is efficient to build, to store, and to update. The hybrid is based on a method for the comparison of classifier performance that is robust to imprecise class distributions and misclassification costs. The ROC convex hull (ROCCH) method combines techniques from ROC analysis, decision analysis and computational geometry, and adapts them to the particulars of analyzing learned classifiers. The method is efficient and incremental, minimizes the management of classifier performance data, and allows for clear visual comparisons and sensitivity analyses. Finally, we point to empirical evidence that a robust hybrid classifier indeed is needed for many real-world problems."

Both algorithms represent each node classifier of a cascade using a high-level abstraction model and attempt to jointly optimize the setting of the thresholding parameters of all the node classifiers within the cascade. We applied both algorithms to optimize the famous Viola and Jones face detector and one of them in particular greatly improved the performance. We believe both algorithms can serve as a useful post-processing process for general cascaded classifier design."
