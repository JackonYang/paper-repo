                "text": "THE visual recognition of three-dimensional (3-D) objects on the basis of their shape poses at least two difficult problems. First, there is the problem of variable illumination, which can be addressed by working with relatively stable features such as intensity edges rather than the raw intensity images1,2. Second, there is the problem of the initially unknown pose of the object relative to the viewer. In one approach to this problem, a hypothesis is first made about the viewpoint, then the appearance of a model object from such a viewpoint is computed and compared with the actual image3\u20137. Such recognition schemes generally employ 3-D models of objects, but the automatic learning of 3-D models is itself a difficult problem8,9. To address this problem in computational vision, we have developed a scheme, based on the theory of approximation of multivariate functions, that learns from a small set of perspective views a function mapping any viewpoint to a standard view. A network equivalent to this scheme will thus 'recognize' the object on which it was trained from any viewpoint."

In this paper, we apply this approach to the problem of representing three-dimensional shapes for the purpose of recognition. 1. Three criteria, accessibility, scope and uniqueness, and stability and sensitivity, are presented for judging the usefulness of a representation for shape recognition. 2. Three aspects of a representation\u2019s design are considered, (i) the representation\u2019s coordinate system, (ii) its primitives, which are the primary units of shape information used in the representation, and (iii) the organization the representation imposes on the information in its descriptions. 3. In terms of these design issues and the criteria presented, a shape representation for recognition should: (i) use an object-centred coordinate system, (ii) include volumetric primitives of varied sizes, and (iii) have a modular organization. A representation based on a shape\u2019s natural axes (for example the axes identified by a stick figure) follows directly from these choices. 4. The basic process for deriving a shape description in this representation must involve: (i) a means for identifying the natural axes of a shape in its image and (ii) a mechanism for transforming viewer-centred axis specifications to specifications in an object-centred coordinate system. 5. Shape recognition involves: (i) a collection of stored shape descriptions, and (ii) various indexes into the collection that allow a newly derived description to be associated with an appropriate stored description. The most important of these indexes allows shape recognition to proceed conservatively from the general to the specific based on the specificity of the information available from the image. 6. New constraints supplied by a conservative recognition process can be used to extract more information from the image. A relaxation process for carrying out this constraint analysis is described."

The dynamic link architecture exploits correlations in the fine-scale temporal structure of cellular signals to group neurons dynamically into higher-order entities. These entities represent a rich structure and can code for high-level objects. To demonstrate the capabilities of the dynamic link architecture, a program was implemented that can recognize human faces and other objects from video images. Memorized objects are represented by sparse graphs, whose vertices are labeled by a multiresolution description in terms of a local power spectrum, and whose edges are labeled by geometrical distance vectors. Object recognition can be formulated as elastic graph matching, which is performed here by stochastic optimization of a matching cost function. The implementation on a transputer network achieved recognition of human faces and office objects from gray-level camera images. The performance of the program is evaluated by a statistical analysis of recognition results from a portrait gallery comprising images of 87 persons. >"

One way to address this question is to explore the ability of the human visual system to generalize recognition from familiar to unfamiliar views of three-dimensional objects. Three recently proposed theories of object recognition--viewpoint normalization or alignment of three-dimensional models [Ullman, S. (1989) Cognition 32, 193-254], linear combination of two-dimensional views [Ullman, S. & Basri, R. (1990) Recognition by Linear Combinations of Models (Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge), A. I. Memo No. 1152], and view approximation [Poggio, T. & Edelman, S. (1990) Nature (London) 343, 263-266]--predict different patterns of generalization to unfamiliar views. We have exploited the conflicting predictions to test the three theories directly in a psychophysical experiment involving computer-generated three-dimensional objects. Our results suggest that the human visual system is better described as recognizing these objects by two-dimensional view interpolation than by alignment or other methods that rely on object-centered three-dimensional models."

This finding opens up the possibility of compressing data bases significantly by disposing of the data which is not important for the solution of a given task. \n \nIn addition, we show that the theory allows us to predict the classifier that will have the best generalization ability, based solely on performance on the training set and characteristics of the learning machines. This finding is important for cases where the amount of available data is limited."
