Department of Mathematics, Dart-NONLINEAR WAVELET METHODS 203 Andrew Bruce and Carl Taswell for many discussions about wavelet software. The NMR datasets were provided by Chris Raphael (Figure 1) and Jee Hoch (Figure 11), the ESCA dataset by Jean-Paul Bib erian, the image dataset by Ingrid Daubechies, the seismic dataset by Paul Donoho. Many thanks to Tina Sharp for intense last-minute editorial work. Consider now a simple recursive nonlinear multiresolution scheme based on decimating by factors of 3. The ne-to-coarse mapping is obtained by grouping the signal in triplets of successive points, and replacing each group of three by a single number { the median of the group of 3. (This is a sort of nonlinear Haar analysis, since dyadic Haar wavelets correspond to grouping data in pairs and keeping only the mean of each pair.) This triadic nonlinear coarsening operator gives rise in an obvious way to a telescoping nonlinear multiresolution decomposition. Figure 28 shows the result of setting to zero the ne scale coeecients of this nonlinear triadic transform applied to the noisy data in Figure 26(b). This clearly performs much better than the linear recovery in Figure 27. Theoretical work to date on nonlinear multiresolution analysis has been done by Ron DeVore (S. Carolina) and Bradley Lucier (Purdue). Interesting applied work with mammograms has been done by Rich Richardson (Univ. of Texas at along with the author, have developed a variety of algorithms based on ideas from robust statistics. Acknowledgements. It is a pleasure to thank Iain Johnstone, G erard Kerkyacharian, and Dominique Picard, with whom much of the theory described here has been developed , and to thank Yves Meyer, Ronald Coifman, and Ingrid Daubechies for encouragement at key moments. Speciic inspirations provided by the work of Ronald DeVore and Bjj orn Jawerth are also gratefully acknowledged, as well as stimulating conversations with Albert Cohen and Bradley Lucier. Thanks to NONLINEAR WAVELET METHODS 201 Of course, in Figure 25 we are showing what happens when the wavelet transform is segmented exactly at the point of discontinuity. How are we to obtain, in analyzing noisy data, information about the proper segmentation point? Viewing the collection of segmented wavelet transforms with diierent values of t as a collection of bases B (t) , this is really a problem of selecting a best basis. Therefore we propose a best-basis segmentation SURE(y; \u2026"

The properties of the operator which approximates a signal at a given resolution were studied. It is shown that the difference of information between the approximation of a signal at the resolutions 2/sup j+1/ and 2/sup j/ (where j is an integer) can be extracted by decomposing this signal on a wavelet orthonormal basis of L/sup 2/(R/sup n/), the vector space of measurable, square-integrable n-dimensional functions. In L/sup 2/(R), a wavelet orthonormal basis is a family of functions which is built by dilating and translating a unique function psi (x). This decomposition defines an orthogonal multiresolution representation called a wavelet representation. It is computed with a pyramidal algorithm based on convolutions with quadrature mirror filters. Wavelet representation lies between the spatial and Fourier domains. For images, the wavelet representation differentiates several spatial orientations. The application of this representation to data compression in image coding, texture discrimination and fractal analysis is discussed. >"

Wavelet transforms are also unstable with respect to dilations of the input signal and, in two dimensions, rotations of the input signal. The authors formalize these problems by defining a type of translation invariance called shiftability. In the spatial domain, shiftability corresponds to a lack of aliasing; thus, the conditions under which the property holds are specified by the sampling theorem. Shiftability may also be applied in the context of other domains, particularly orientation and scale. Jointly shiftable transforms that are simultaneously shiftable in more than one domain are explored. Two examples of jointly shiftable transforms are designed and implemented: a 1-D transform that is jointly shiftable in position and scale, and a 2-D transform that is jointly shiftable in position and orientation. The usefulness of these image representations for scale-space analysis, stereo disparity measurement, and image enhancement is demonstrated. >"

                "text": "A number of recent attempts have been made to describe early sensory coding in terms of a general information processing strategy. In this paper, two strategies are contrasted. Both strategies take advantage of the redundancy in the environment to produce more effective representations. The first is described as a compact coding scheme. A compact code performs a transform that allows the input to be represented with a reduced number of vectors (cells) with minimal RMS error. This approach has recently become popular in the neural network literature and is related to a process called Principal Components Analysis (PCA). A number of recent papers have suggested that the optimal compact code for representing natural scenes will have units with receptive field profiles much like those found in the retina and primary visual cortex. However, in this paper, it is proposed that compact coding schemes are insufficient to account for the receptive field properties of cells in the mammalian visual pathway. In contrast, it is proposed that the visual system is near to optimal in representing natural scenes only if optimality is defined in terms of sparse distributed coding. In a sparse distributed code, all cells in the code have an equal response probability across the class of images but have a low response probability for any single image. In such a code, the dimensionality is not reduced. Rather, the redundancy of the input is transformed into the redundancy of the firing pattern of cells. It is proposed that the signature for a sparse code is found in the fourth moment of the response distribution (i.e., the kurtosis). In measurements with 55 calibrated natural scenes, the kurtosis was found to peak when the bandwidths of the visual code matched those of cells in the mammalian visual cortex. Codes resembling wavelet transforms are proposed to be effective because the response histograms of such codes are sparse (i.e., show high kurtosis) when presented with natural scenes. It is proposed that the structure of the image that allows sparse coding is found in the phase spectrum of the image. It is suggested that natural scenes, to a first approximation, can be considered as a sum of self-similar local functions (the inverse of a wavelet). Possible reasons for why sensory systems would evolve toward sparse coding are presented."
