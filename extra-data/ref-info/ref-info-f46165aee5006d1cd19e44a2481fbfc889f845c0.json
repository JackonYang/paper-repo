It is intended to assist other workers in Artificial Intelligence (AI) who need to develop manipulators for their own use. A discussion is presented of the constraints and requirements imposed on the manipulator which led to the basic design, which was developed by Stanford University's Artificial Intelligence Project. Further, detail is presented on the implementation of the basic configuration. The end result is a manipulator which reproduces the flexibility and speed of a human arm. \n \nThe manipulator is designed to be integrated with a vehicle and is completely computer controlled. Human commands are injected only at the gross instruction level, with a digital computer generating the control level commands. The JPL requirements are for the manipulator to pick up irregular objects from the laboratory working area, or surface, and move them to an arbitrary position either on or off the vehicle, while avoiding any obstacles. \n \nThe manipulator (Fig.1) has 6 degrees of freedom which allow the grasping device (hand) to be placed in any a rbitrary position with great flexibility. The joints from the base to the hand consist of two rotary joints, one linear joint and three rotary joints (2R, 1L, 3R using the nomenclature of Ref. 1). This allows the human waist, shoulder, arm and wrist motions to be reproduced. \n \nManipulator reach is a maximum of 52\" and an object of about 5 pounds may be lifted. The manipulator may reach an object in any part of a sphere that is not occupied (i.e., by the vehicle, floor, etc.). System response allows a maximum motion to be accomplished in about 5 seconds. \n \nPower is supplied by 6 permanent magnet DC torque motors geared directly to each link. For the first four inner rotary joints, harmonic drive gearing is used, with rack and pinion drive for the linear joint. For the outer rotary joint, spur gearing is used. DC power is provided through analog DC amplifiers to minimize electrical noise. Analog position and rate feedback information is provided. Brakes are used in each joint to provide holding torque."

Useful reviews of this field with extensivebibliographies have been given by Deutsch and Heer [1] and by Johnsen andCorliss[2]. Although it is possible to approach the dexterity of a humanin doing complex manipulations, a characteristic of such operations is that theyare extremely slow. One of the reasons is that satisfactory machine substitutesfor the sense of touch do not as yet exist.Some previous work has involved sensing during the critical grasping phase ofa manipulation. Bliss, [3] and his co-workers conducted experiments in whichtactile sensor outputs were used to stimulate the operator's fingertips. Others[4, 5] have also discussed the subject of tactile sensing in this context.Howev.er, the possibilities of a noncontact or proximity sensor have not beenexplored.The purpose of this paper is to describe an optical. proximity sensor withpotential for local control of a manipulator at the point of grasping. The deviceproduces an output signal whenever a diffusely reflecting surface enters asensitive volume having a fixed location with respect to the sensor. Themagnitude of the output depends approximately on the position of the surface.The sensing head itself can easily be built small enough that several could beplaced on a manipulator hand (effector).JPL Technical Memorandum 33-612 1"

The most importemt feature of the new hand is the two level control. The movements of the hand can be controlled by signals produced by man as well as by external stimuli. For this purpose simple pressure sensitive transducers are placed in the hand to provide the control signals for reflexive-type movements. An adaptive control circuit is present for automatic weight adjustment. All these features are incorporated into the hand using simple and standard servocomponents. Use of appropriate feedback loops eliminates the need for complicated mechanical parts."

Virtually all of this development has been concentrated in languages and systems oriented to list processing. As the efforts of Artificial Intelligence researchers began to turn from purely symbolic problems toward interaction with the real world, certain features of algebraic languages became desirable. There were several attempts (notably LISP2 and FORMULA ALGOL) to combine the best features of both kinds of language. At the same time, designers of algebraic languages began to include features for non-numerical computation. No new general purpose language without some sort of list processing facility has been suggested for several years. We have followed a tack somewhat different from either of these in the design of SAIL and in its subsequent modifications."

                "text": "A procedure for determining whether two graphs are isomorphic is described. During the procedure, from any given graph two graphs, the representative graph and the reordered graph, are derived. The representative graph is a homomorphic image of the original graph; the reordered graph is constructed from the representative graph to be isomorphic to the given graph. Unique labels are assigned to the vertices of both derived graphs. It follows that two repre- sentative graphs or two reordered graphs are isomorphic if and only if they are identical. A conjecture states that the representative graphs exhibit the automorphism partitioning of the given graph. The representative graphs form a necessity condition for isomorphism; namely, if the representative graphs are not identical, then the given graphs are not isomorphic. The converse is true for trees and follows from the conjecture for other types of graphs. It is also shown that the reordered graphs form a sufficiency condition for isomorphism; namely, if the reordered graphs are identical, then the given graphs are isomorphic. The converse follows from the conjecture. The time required to determine both derived graphs depends on a power of n, the order of the given graph. This power is a function of an adjacency property known as the strong regu- larity of the given graph. For graphs that do not contain a strongly regular transitive sub- graph, the power is, at worst, five."
