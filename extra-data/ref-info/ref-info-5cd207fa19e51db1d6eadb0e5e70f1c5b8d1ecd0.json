A generic model is designed to support the different stages of tabular composition, including the editing of logical structure, the specification of layout structure, and the formatting of concrete tables. The model separates table's logical structure from its layout structure, which consists of tabular topology and typographic style. The notion of an abstract table, which describes the logical relationships among tabular items, is formally defined and a set of logical operations is proposed to manipulate tables based on these logical relationships. An abstract table can be visualized through a layout structure specified by a set of topological rules, which determine the relative placement of tabular items in two dimensions, and a set of style rules, which determine the final appearance of different items. The absolute placement of a concrete table can be automatically generated by applying a layout specification to an abstract line. An NP-complete problem arises in the formatting process that uses automatic line breaking and determines the physical dimension of a table to satisfy user-specified size constraints. An algorithm has been designed to solve the formatting problem in polynomial time for typical tables. Based on the tabular model, a prototype tabular composition system has been implemented in a UNIX, X Windows environment. This prototype provides an interactive interface to edit the logical structure, the topology and the styles of tables. It allows us to manipulate tables based on the logical relationships tabular items, regardless of where the items are placed in the layout structure, and capable of presenting a table in different topologies and styles so that we can select a high-quality layout structure."

Bruce Croft Center for Intelligent Information Retrieval Dept. of Computer Science University of Massachusetts Amherst, MA 01003 {pyreddy,croft}@cs.umass.edu} Tables form an important kind of data element in text retrieval. Often, the gist of an entire news article or other exposition can be concisely captured in tabular form. In this paper, we examine the utility of exploiting information other than the key words in a digital document to provide the users with more flexible and powerful query capabilities. More specifically, we exploit the structural information in a document to identify tables and their component fields and let the users query based on these fields. Our empirical results have demonstrated that heuristic method based table extraction and component tagging can be performed effectively and efficiently. Moreover, our experiments in retrieval using the TINTIN system have strongly indicated that such structural decomposition can facilitate better representation of user''s information needs and hence more effective retrieval of tables."

In these tables, textual data are presented in record lines made up of fixed-width fields. Tables often do not rely on line-art (ruled lines) to delimit fields, and in this way differ crucially from fixed forms. Our system performs these steps: copes with multiple tables per page; identifies records within tables; segments records into fields; and recognizes characters within fields, constrained by field-specific contextual knowledge. Obstacles to good performance on tables include small print, tight line-spacing, poor-quality text (such as photocopies), and line-art or background patterns that touch the text. Precise skew-correction and pitch-estimation, and high-performance OCR using neural nets proved crucial in overcoming these obstacles. The most significant technical advances in this work appear to be algorithms for identifying and segmenting records with known layout, and integration of these algorithms with a graphical user interface (GUI) for defining new layouts. This GUI has been ergonomically designed to make efficient and intuitive use of exemplary images, so that the skill and manual effort required to retarget the system to new table layouts are held to a minimum. The system has been applied in this way to more than 400 distinct tabular layouts. During the last three years the system has read over fifty million records with high accuracy."

It is very important to be able to classify table and figure areas automatically. Furthermore, in tables, the column and row in which a character string is located are very important pieces of information. To detect and analyze table areas, the following method is applied: First, areas that may contain tables or figures are distinguished from text areas by the presence of horizontal and vertical lines. Next, the areas are assumed to be table areas and are analyzed as such. A judgment is made on whether each of the areas can in fact be a table area or not; in this way, the actual table areas are detected. Finally, the structures of the areas are analyzed and character strings in the areas are arranged by using the DP matching method. This method was applied to sixty-five pages of Japanese technical papers, magazines, manuals for software programs, and pages including 34 table areas, 48 line drawing areas, and 35 image areas. As a result, 96.6 percent of the areas were detected correctly and 91.7 percent of the tables were analyzed and arranged correctly."

More specifically, we exploit the structural information in a document to identify tables and their component fields and let the users query based on these fields. Our empirical results have demonstrated that heuristic method based table extraction and component tagging can be performed effectively and efficiently. Moreover, our experiments in retrieval using the TINTIN system have strongly indicated that such structural decomposition can facilitate better representation of user\u2019s information needs and hence more effective retrieval of tables."

These tables include records of cable counts, cables in service, assignment charts, and cable running and wiring lists. An interesting problem in these drawings is that the changes to the data are occasionally recorded by crossing out entries and appending the changes rather than redrawing the entire documents. The objective of the work described here is the extraction of information contained in these table structured documents to facilitate the creation of a computer database. Our software system makes use of contextual information in these drawings (e.g., a particular line pattern is used to represent repeated entries, ignore crossed-out entries, etc.). The system uses features like inter-line spacing, length of lines, line orientation, and start and end locations of the lines to detect the diagonal lines and vertical lines with demarcations. Experimental results are also included."

However, these approaches are applicable to only the same kind of documents because they are based on the paradigm that specifies the structure definition information in advance so as to be able to analyze a particular class of documents intelligently. In this paper, the authors propose a method to recognize the layout structures of multi-kinds of table-form document images. For this purpose, the authors introduce a classification tree to manage the relationships among different classes of layout structures. The authors' recognition system has two modes: layout knowledge acquisition and layout structure recognition. In the layout knowledge acquisition mode, table-form document images are distinguished according to this. Classification tree and then the structure description trees which specify the logical structures of table-form documents are generated automatically. While, in the layout structure recognition mode, individual item fields in the table-form document images are extracted and classified successfully by searching the classification tree and interpreting the structure description tree. >"

This paper describes a general solution for detecting tables based on computing an optimal partitioning of a document into some number of tables. A dynamic programming algorithm is given to solve the resulting optimization problem. This high-level framework is independent of any particular table quality measure and independent of the document medium. Moreover, it does not rely on the presence of ruling lines or other table delimiters. We also present table quality measures based on white space correlation and vertical connected component analysis. These measures can be applied equally well to ASCII text and scanned images. We report on some preliminary experiments using this method to detect tables in both ASCII text and scanned images, yielding promising results. We present detailed evaluation of these results using three different criteria which by themselves pose interesting research questions."

The resulting T-Recs system takes word bounding box information as input, and outputs the corresponding logical text block units. Starting with an arbitrary word as block seed the algorithm recursively expands this block to all words that interleave with their vertical neighbors. Since even smallest gaps of table columns prevent their words from mutual interleaving, this initial segmentation is able to identify and isolate such columns. In order to deal with some inherent segmentation errors caused by isolated lines, overhanging words, or cells spawning more than one column, a series of postprocessing steps is added. These steps benefit form a very simple distinction between type 1 and type 2 blocks: type 1 blocks are those of at most one word per line, all others are of type 2. This distinction allows the selective application of heuristics to each group of blocks. The conjoint decomposition of column blocks into subsets of table cells leads to the final block segmentation of a homogeneous abstraction level. These segments serve the final layout analysis which identifies table environments and cells that are stretching over several rows and/or columns."

We have developed a method for recognizing and extracting tabular data, inthis case financial tables. Tables are extracted using a version of the LR(k) parsing algorithm adapted for this purpose. Because of sloppiness in the construction of tables, somewhat less than 100% of the tables can be retrieved automatically; a method has been found to integrate the parsing algorithm into amodule analogous to a programming language debugger that allows operators to quickly correct defects in the source document. This paper describes an application in commercial use."

For vertical lines, the image is transposed using an efficient method we developed, and the algorithm for horizontal lines is applied again. Using the information about the lines, the tabular structures are extracted by finding biconnected components on the graph formed by the lines and their intersections. A methodology has also been developed for the representation of end access to the entries inside the tables."

It was found that most formats could be used equally well to make conversions bi-directionally, i.e. from A to B and from 13 to A. A fully redundant table, one that required no additional arithmetic operations, could be used more quickly than a schematic table, and in schematic tables it was more important to have each of the major units given directly rather than each of the minor units. A matrix, although fully redundant, was much more difficult to use than the corresponding table of lists. Many subjects clearly did not understand the principles of matrix format. Measures of incidental learning suggested that practice at using a table resulted in only slight knowledge of the content of the table, even though much of each table could be generated from a single rule"

Simple rules for analysis of table structure cover majority of real life tables. The system is implemented, rested, and is now extensively used in FineReader OCR product."

Managing and updating this paper based information is a costly and tedious process. There are commercially available CAD-based systems which allow management of this information in a more easy and efficient way, but the large number of drawings in every company makes the manual conversion of the paper drawings to these systems infeasible. Therefore, efficient interpretation systems must be developed to perform this task. \nUtility company drawings usually consist of graphical structures formed by intersecting horizontal and vertical line segments. In this research, techniques for the construction of interpretation systems for drawings with such characteristics have been developed. The methodology is based on the use of the spatial relation between the different types of intersections formed by orthogonal line segments to describe the graphical objects. With this purpose, efficient algorithms for the extraction of intersection features and detection of lines between pairs of intersections have been developed. Techniques for the efficient manipulation in memory of the large image files that result from scanning the paper drawings have also been developed. \nUsing these techniques, interpretation systems for central office front equipment drawings and central office assignment table drawings from NYNEX, one of the local telephone companies in the U.S., have been constructed. \nAn evaluation of the algorithms for the extraction of the intersection primitives and the detection of lines has been performed. The interpretation systems developed are also tested using real central office drawings provided by NYNEX."

Each cell of a table is arranged regularly in two dimensions and is represented by a row-column pair. Even in the absence of ruled lines, its coordinates are explicitly found. Thus, it is assumed that an arrangement of textblocks defines the table structure, which is an arrangement of rows and columns, and ruled lines make clear their relationship. This process is composed of two procedures: the expansion of cell bounding boxes and the assignment of row-column numbers to each edge.

The method involves matching optical character recognition (OCR) results from a page with typesetting files for an entire book. Public domain software used to derive the ground truth is provided in the form of Perl scripts and C source code, and includes new, more efficient string alignment technology and a word- level scoring package. With this ground truthing technology, it is now feasible to produce much larger data sets, at much lower cost, than was ever possible with previous labor- intensive, manual data collection projects. Using this method, NIST has produced a new document image database for evaluating Document Analysis and Recognition technologies and Information Retrieval systems. The database produced contains scanned images, SGML-tagged ground truth text, commercial OCR results, and image quality assessment results for pages published in the 1994 Federal Register. These data files are useful in a wide variety of experiments and research. There were roughly 250 issues, comprised of nearly 69,000 pages, published in the Federal Register in 1994. This volume of the database contains the pages of 20 books published in January of that year. In all, there are 4711 page images provided, with 4519 of them having corresponding ground truth. This volume is distributed on two ISO-9660 CD- ROMs. Future volumes may be released, depending on the level of interest."

GLG method emphasizes the global layout structure analysis and has higher accuracy. It is robust for treating with the accidental direct adjacent relationship between two irrelated cells.

Yet e-mail is one of the most difficult types of text to deal with, since it is both highly structured -frequently containing elements such as tables, signatures, \"artwork\" and quotations from previous messages; and at the same time often lacks any reliable unambiguous indicators for such structure. This paper describes Emu, an e-mail mark-up and rendering program that preprocesses e-mail for TTS. We discuss algorithms for detecting regions of interest in the input text; for \"normalizing\" the input; and for actually rendering the input through the Bell Labs TTS system."

The method was motivated by the need for quick and reliable detection of horizontal lines in an interactive drawing conversion system for telephone company drawings. At the core of the algorithm are the processes of filtering run lengths, assembling filtered run lengths, generating top silhouette, and thresholding the gradient of the top silhouette to extract one horizontal line at a time. The method is robust in the presence of distortion; it can tolerate significant skew and warping, both local and global, and can bridge significant breaks in lines without too many false positive lines."

After obtaining the straight lines, Hough directions are used to detect the real segments in the image. Segments can correspond either to continuous line, or to black parts of dashed or dotted lines. So, the segments are grouped together and classified between both adjacent line crossing points. Items are located by searching the minimum cycles of the graph constructed from the line intersection points. The last step consists of verifying the line classes based on the homogeneity hypothesis of item sides."
