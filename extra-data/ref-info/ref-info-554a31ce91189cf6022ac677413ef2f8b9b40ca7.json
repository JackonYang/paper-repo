We discuss how the corpus can be usefully employed in evaluating paraphrase systems automatically (e.g., by measuring precision, recall, and F1) and also in developing linguistically rich paraphrase models based on syntactic structure."

For these language pairs a huge portion of phrases encountered at run-time will be unknown. We show how techniques from paraphrasing can be used to deal with these otherwise unknown source language phrases. Our results show that augmenting a state-of-the-art SMT system with paraphrases leads to significantly improved coverage and translation quality. For a training corpus with 10,000 sentence pairs we increase the coverage of unique test set unigrams from 48% to 90%, with more than half of the newly covered items accurately translated, as opposed to none in current approaches."

We define a paraphrase probability that allows paraphrases extracted from a bilingual parallel corpus to be ranked using translation probabilities, and show how it can be refined to take contextual information into account. We evaluate our paraphrase extraction and ranking methods using a set of manual word alignments, and contrast the quality with paraphrases extracted from automatic alignments."

Two techniques are employed: (1) simple string edit distance, and (2) a heuristic strategy that pairs initial (presumably summary) sentences from different news stories in the same cluster. We evaluate both datasets using a word alignment algorithm and a metric borrowed from machine translation. Results show that edit distance data is cleaner and more easily-aligned than the heuristic data, with an overall alignment error rate (AER) of 11.58% on a similarly-extracted test set. On test data extracted by the heuristic strategy, however, performance of the two training sets is similar, with AERs of 13.2% and 14.7% respectively. Analysis of 100 pairs of sentences from each set reveals that the edit distance data lacks many of the complex lexical and syntactic alternations that characterize monolingual paraphrase. The summary sentences, while less readily alignable, retain more of the non-trivial alternations that are of greatest interest learning paraphrase relationships."

The corpora are represented as a graph in which a node corresponds to a phrase, and an edge exists between two nodes if their corresponding phrases are aligned in a phrase table. We sample random walks to compute the average number of steps it takes to reach a ranking of paraphrases with better ones being \"closer\" to a phrase of interest. This approach allows \"feature\" nodes that represent domain knowledge to be built into the graph, and incorporates truncation techniques to prevent the graph from growing too large for efficiency. Current approaches, by contrast, implicitly presuppose the graph to be bipartite, are limited to finding paraphrases that are of length two away from a phrase, and do not generally permit easy incorporation of domain knowledge. Manual evaluation of generated output shows that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art system of Callison-Burch (2008)."

We generate candidate translations for 100 English words in each of 42 foreign languages using Wikipedia and a lexicon induction framework. We evaluate the MTurk annotations by using positive and negative control candidate translations. Additionally, we evaluate the annotations by adding pairs to our seed dictionaries, providing a feedback loop into the induction system. MTurk workers are more successful in annotating some languages than others and are not evenly distributed around the world or among the world's languages. However, in general, we find that MTurk is a valuable resource for gathering cheap and simple annotations for most of the languages that we explored, and these annotations provide useful feedback in building a larger, more accurate lexicon."

The method is best when the system will eventually be evaluated using the same metric, but in reality, most MT evaluations have a human-based component. Although performing MERT with a human-based metric seems like a daunting task, we describe a new metric, Rypt, which takes human judgments into account, but only requires human input to build a database that can be reused over and over again, hence eliminating the need for human input at tuning time. In this investigative study, we analyze the diversity (or lack thereof) of the candidates produced during MERT, we describe how this redundancy can be used to our advantage, and show that Rypt is a better predictor of translation quality than Bleu."

However, MTurk offers only limited control over who is allowed to particpate in a particular task. This is particularly problematic for tasks requiring free-form text entry. Unlike multiple-choice tasks there is no correct answer, and therefore control items for which the correct answer is known cannot be used. Furthermore, MTurk has no effective built-in mechanism to guarantee workers are proficient English writers. We describe our experience in creating corpora of images annotated with multiple one-sentence descriptions on MTurk and explore the effectiveness of different quality control strategies for collecting linguistic data using Mechanical MTurk. We find that the use of a qualification test provides the highest improvement of quality, whereas refining the annotations through follow-up tasks works rather poorly. Using our best setup, we construct two image corpora, totaling more than 40,000 descriptive captions for 9000 images."

In approaching this phenomenon, one may choose to examine the portioning of narrative content into discourse units (Chafe, Chapter 1), the selection of a prominent referent to take on the role of subject in a clause (Bernardo, Chapter 6), or the influence of the larger cultural context on the expression of events and evaluations (Tannen, Chapter 2). Or, one may focus on a phenomenon of narrower scope: the verbalization of characters and objects within the discourse. This is the domain of the essays that Downing and Clancy contributed to this book and of the present chapter. Though apparently narrow, the topic has two distinct aspects. On the one hand, one may consider the static aspect of nominal verbalization. The speaker is confronted by an object whose semantic substance requires expression. He must draw on his cultural knowledge and his understanding of his addressee in order to decide what is salient and hence worthy of verbalization, and he employs his semantic knowledge in the expression of the appropriate categorization. Downing deals with this facet ofthe problem. But"

Having proper labels associated with each image on the Web would allow for more accurate image search, improve the accessibility of sites (by providing descriptions of images to visually impaired individuals), and help users block inappropriate images. Our system makes a significant contribution because of its valuable output and because of the way it addresses the image-labeling problem.

We asked naive subjects to report in a free-form format what they saw when looking at briefly presented real-life photographs. Our subjects received no specific information as to the content of each stimulus. Thus, our paradigm differs from previous studies where subjects were cued before a picture was presented and/or were probed with multiple-choice questions. In the first stage, 90 novel grayscale photographs were foveally shown to a group of 22 native-English-speaking subjects. The presentation time was chosen at random from a set of seven possible times (from 27 to 500 ms). A perceptual mask followed each photograph immediately. After each presentation, subjects reported what they had just seen as completely and truthfully as possible. In the second stage, another group of naive individuals was instructed to score each of the descriptions produced by the subjects in the first stage. Individual scores were assigned to more than a hundred different attributes. We show that within a single glance, much object- and scene-level information is perceived by human subjects. The richness of our perception, though, seems asymmetrical. Subjects tend to have a propensity toward perceiving natural scenes as being outdoor rather than indoor. The reporting of sensory- or feature-level information of a scene (such as shading and shape) consistently precedes the reporting of the semantic-level information. But once subjects recognize more semantic-level components of a scene, there is little evidence suggesting any bias toward either scene-level or object-level recognition."
