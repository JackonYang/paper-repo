We incorporate statistical natural language processing in order to deal with free text. We demonstrate the current system on a difficult dataset, namely 10000 images of work from the Fine Arts Museum of San Francisco. The images include line drawings, paintings, and pictures of sculpture and ceramics. Many of the images have associated free text which varies greatly from physical description to interpretation and mood. We use WordNet to provide semantic grouping information and to help disambiguate word senses, as well as emphasize the hierarchical nature of semantic relationships. This allows us to impose a natural structure on the image collection that reflects semantics to a considerable degree. Our method produces a joint probability distribution for words and picture elements. We demonstrate that this distribution can be used: (a) to provide illustrations for given captions, and (b) to generate words for images outside the training set. Results from this annotation process yield a quantitative study of our method. Finally, the annotation process can be seen as a form of object recognizer that has been learned through a partially supervised process."

The storyline of a video describes causal relationships between actions. Beyond recognition of individual actions, discovering causal relationships helps to better understand the semantic meaning of the activities. We present an approach to learn a visually grounded storyline model of videos directly from weakly labeled data. The storyline model is represented as an AND-OR graph, a structure that can compactly encode storyline variation across videos. The edges in the AND-OR graph correspond to causal relationships which are represented in terms of spatio-temporal constraints. We formulate an Integer Programming framework for action recognition and storyline extraction using the storyline model and visual groundings learned from training data."

For instance, a scene of a `polo game' consists of several visual objects such as `human', `horse', `grass', etc. In addition, it can be further annotated with a list of more abstract (e.g. `dusk') or visually less salient (e.g. `saddle') tags. Our generative model jointly explains images through a visual model and a textual model. Visually relevant objects are represented by regions and patches, while visually irrelevant textual annotations are influenced directly by the overall scene class. We propose a fully automatic learning framework that is able to learn robust scene models from noisy Web data such as images and user tags from Flickr.com. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework by automatically classifying, annotating and segmenting images from eight classes depicting sport scenes. In all three tasks, our model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms."

                "text": "In this paper, we present an image parsing to text description (I2T) framework that generates text descriptions of image and video content based on image understanding. The proposed I2T framework follows three steps: 1) input images (or video frames) are decomposed into their constituent visual patterns by an image parsing engine, in a spirit similar to parsing sentences in natural language; 2) the image parsing results are converted into semantic representation in the form of Web ontology language (OWL), which enables seamless integration with general knowledge bases; and 3) a text generation engine converts the results from previous steps into semantically meaningful, human readable, and query-able text reports. The centerpiece of the I2T framework is an and-or graph (AoG) visual knowledge representation, which provides a graphical representation serving as prior knowledge for representing diverse visual patterns and provides top-down hypotheses during the image parsing. The AoG embodies vocabularies of visual elements including primitives, parts, objects, scenes as well as a stochastic image grammar that specifies syntactic relations (i.e., compositional) and semantic relations (e.g., categorical, spatial, temporal, and functional) between these visual elements. Therefore, the AoG is a unified model of both categorical and symbolic representations of visual knowledge. The proposed I2T framework has two objectives. First, we use semiautomatic method to parse images from the Internet in order to build an AoG for visual knowledge representation. Our goal is to make the parsing process more and more automatic using the learned AoG model. Second, we use automatic methods to parse image/video in specific domains and generate text reports that are useful for real-world applications. In the case studies at the end of this paper, we demonstrate two automatic I2T systems: a maritime and urban scene video surveillance system and a real-time automatic driving scene understanding system."

Thus, we foresee the emergence of language-based 3D scene generation systems to let ordinary users quickly create 3D scenes without having to learn special software, acquire artistic skills, or even touch a desktop window-oriented interface. WordsEye is such a system for automatically converting text into representative 3D scenes. WordsEye relies on a large database of 3D models and poses to depict entities and actions. Every 3D model can have associated shape displacements, spatial tags, and functional properties to be used in the depiction process. We describe the linguistic analysis and depiction techniques used by WordsEye along with some general strategies by which more abstract concepts are made depictable."

Firstly, images are segmented into regions, which are classified into region types using a variety of features. A mapping between region types and keywords supplied with the images, is then learned, using a method based around EM. This process is analogous with learning a lexicon from an aligned bitext. For the implementation we describe, these words are nouns taken from a large vocabulary. On a large test set, the method can predict numerous words with high accuracy. Simple methods identify words that cannot be predicted well. We show how to cluster words that individually are difficult to predict into clusters that can be predicted well -- for example, we cannot predict the distinction between train and locomotive using the current set of features, but we can predict the underlying concept. The method is trained on a substantial collection of images. Extensive experimental results illustrate the strengths and weaknesses of the approach."

This challenging but important subject has mostly been ignored in the past due to several problems one of which is the lack of realistic and annotated video datasets. Our first contribution is to address this limitation and to investigate the use of movie scripts for automatic annotation of human actions in videos. We evaluate alternative methods for action retrieval from scripts and show benefits of a text-based classifier. Using the retrieved action samples for visual learning, we next turn to the problem of action classification in video. We present a new method for video classification that builds upon and extends several recent ideas including local space-time features, space-time pyramids and multi-channel non-linear SVMs. The method is shown to improve state-of-the-art results on the standard KTH action dataset by achieving 91.8% accuracy. Given the inherent problem of noisy labels in automatic annotation, we particularly investigate and show high tolerance of our method to annotation errors in the training set. We finally apply the method to learning and classifying challenging action classes in movies and show promising results."

However, MTurk offers only limited control over who is allowed to particpate in a particular task. This is particularly problematic for tasks requiring free-form text entry. Unlike multiple-choice tasks there is no correct answer, and therefore control items for which the correct answer is known cannot be used. Furthermore, MTurk has no effective built-in mechanism to guarantee workers are proficient English writers. We describe our experience in creating corpora of images annotated with multiple one-sentence descriptions on MTurk and explore the effectiveness of different quality control strategies for collecting linguistic data using Mechanical MTurk. We find that the use of a qualification test provides the highest improvement of quality, whereas refining the annotations through follow-up tasks works rather poorly. Using our best setup, we construct two image corpora, totaling more than 40,000 descriptive captions for 9000 images."

It has recently been shown that visual analysis of the faces in images returned on a text-based query over captions can significantly improve search results. The underlying idea to improve the text-based results is that although this initial result is imperfect, it will render the queried person to be relatively frequent as compared to other people, so we can search for a large group of highly similar faces. The performance of such methods depends strongly on this assumption: for people whose face appears in less than about 40% of the initial text-based result, the performance may be very poor. The contribution of this paper is to improve search results by exploiting faces of other people that co-occur frequently with the queried person. We refer to this process as `query expansion'. In the face analysis we use the query expansion to provide a query-specific relevant set of `negative' examples which should be separated from the potentially positive examples in the text-based result set. We apply this idea to a recently-proposed method which filters the initial result set using a Gaussian mixture model, and apply the same idea using a logistic discriminant model. We experimentally evaluate the methods using a set of 23 queries on a database of 15.000 captioned news stories from Yahoo! News. The results show that (i) query expansion improves both methods, (ii) that our discriminative models outperform the generative ones, and (iii) our best results surpass the state-of-the-art results by 10% precision on average."

Most approaches use co-occurrence of \"nouns\" and image features over large datasets to determine the correspondence, but many correspondence ambiguities remain. We further constrain the correspondence problem by exploiting additional language constructs to improve the learning process from weakly labeled data. We consider both \"prepositions\" and \"comparative adjectives\" which are used to express relationships between objects. If the models of such relationships can be determined, they help resolve correspondence ambiguities. However, learning models of these relationships requires solving the correspondence problem. We simultaneously learn the visual features defining \"nouns\" and the differential visual features defining such \"binary-relationships\" using an EM-based approach."

It has recently been shown that visual analysis of the faces in images returned on a text-based query over captions can significantly improve search results. The underlying idea to improve the text-based results is that although this initial result is imperfect, it will render the queried person to be relatively frequent as compared to other people, so we can search for a large group of highly similar faces. The performance of such methods depends strongly on this assumption: for people whose face appears in less than about 40% of the initial text-based result, the performance may be very poor. The contribution of this paper is to improve search results by exploiting faces of other people that co-occur frequently with the queried person. We refer to this process as \u2018query expansion\u2019. In the face analysis we use the query expansion to provide a query-specific relevant set of \u2018negative\u2019 examples which should be separated from the potentially positive examples in the text-based result set. We apply this idea to a recently-proposed method which filters the initial result set using a Gaussian mixture model, and apply the same idea using a logistic discriminant model. We experimentally evaluate the methods using a set of 23 queries on a database of 15.000 captioned news stories from Yahoo! News . The results show that (i) query expansion improves both methods, (ii) that our discriminative models outperform the generative ones, and (iii) our best results surpass the state-of-the-art results by 10% precision on average."

The procedure is based on a very low dimensional representation of the scene, that we term the Spatial Envelope. We propose a set of perceptual dimensions (naturalness, openness, roughness, expansion, ruggedness) that represent the dominant spatial structure of a scene. Then, we show that these dimensions may be reliably estimated using spectral and coarsely localized information. The model generates a multidimensional space in which scenes sharing membership in semantic categories (e.g., streets, highways, coasts) are projected closed together. The performance of the spatial envelope model shows that specific information about object shape or identity is not a requirement for scene categorization and that modeling a holistic representation of the scene informs about its probable semantic category."

It involves understanding scene or event, analyzing human movements, recognizing manipulable objects, and observing the effect of the human movement on those objects. While each of these perceptual tasks can be conducted independently, recognition rate improves when interactions between them are considered. Motivated by psychological studies of human perception, we present a Bayesian approach which integrates various perceptual tasks involved in understanding human-object interactions. Previous approaches to object and action recognition rely on static shape or appearance feature matching and motion analysis, respectively. Our approach goes beyond these traditional approaches and applies spatial and functional constraints on each of the perceptual elements for coherent semantic interpretation. Such constraints allow us to recognize objects and actions when the appearances are not discriminative enough. We also demonstrate the use of such constraints in recognition of actions from static images without using any motion information."

This has paved the way for a large number of new techniques and systems, and a growing interest in associated fields to support such systems. Likewise, digital imagery has expanded its horizon in many directions, resulting in an explosion in the volume of image data required to be organized. In this paper, we discuss some of the key contributions in the current decade related to image retrieval and automated image annotation, spanning 120 references. We also discuss some of the key challenges involved in the adaptation of existing image retrieval techniques to build useful systems that can handle real-world data. We conclude with a study on the trends in volume and impact of publications in the field with respect to venues/journals and sub-topics."

We define an event in a static image as a human activity taking place in a specific environment. In this paper, we use a number of sport games such as snow boarding, rock climbing or badminton to demonstrate event classification. Our goal is to classify the event in the image as well as to provide a number of semantic labels to the objects and scene environment within the image. For example, given a rowing scene, our algorithm recognizes the event as rowing by classifying the environment as a lake and recognizing the critical objects in the image as athletes, rowing boat, water, etc. We achieve this integrative and holistic recognition through a generative graphical model. We have assembled a highly challenging database of 8 widely varied sport events. We show that our system is capable of classifying these event classes at 73.4% accuracy. While each component of the model contributes to the final recognition, using scene or objects alone cannot achieve this performance."

Our system achieves a two-fold improvement in average precision over the best performance in the 2006 PASCAL person detection challenge. It also outperforms the best results in the 2007 challenge in ten out of twenty categories. The system relies heavily on deformable parts. While deformable part models have become quite popular, their value had not been demonstrated on difficult benchmarks such as the PASCAL challenge. Our system also relies heavily on new methods for discriminative training. We combine a margin-sensitive approach for data mining hard negative examples with a formalism we call latent SVM. A latent SVM, like a hidden CRF, leads to a non-convex training problem. However, a latent SVM is semi-convex and the training problem becomes convex once latent information is specified for the positive examples. We believe that our training methods will eventually make possible the effective use of more latent information such as hierarchical (grammar) models and models involving latent three dimensional pose."

While each of these can be conducted independently, recognition improves when interactions between these elements are considered. Motivated by psychological studies of human perception, we present a Bayesian approach which unifies the inference processes involved in object classification and localization, action understanding and perception of object reaction. Traditional approaches for object classification and action understanding have relied on shape features and movement analysis respectively. By placing object classification and localization in a video interpretation framework, we can localize and classify objects which are either hard to localize due to clutter or hard to recognize due to lack of discriminative features. Similarly, by applying context on human movements from the objects on which these movements impinge and the effects of these movements, we can segment and recognize actions which are either too subtle to perceive or too hard to recognize using motion features alone."

Usually, these priors are used post-hoc in the process of resolving feature matches and obtaining final scene estimates, via `first get candidate matches, then resolve' consensus algorithms such as RANSAC. In this paper we show that the dramatically different approach of using priors dynamically to guide a feature by feature matching search can achieve global matching with much fewer image processing operations and lower overall computational cost. Essentially, we put image processing into the loopof the search for global consensus. In particular, our approach is able to cope with significant image ambiguity thanks to a dynamic mixture of Gaussians treatment. In our fully Bayesian algorithm, the choice of the most efficient search action at each step is guided intuitively and rigorously by expected Shannon information gain. We demonstrate the algorithm in feature matching as part of a sequential SLAM system for 3D camera tracking. Robust, real-time matching can be achieved even in the previously unmanageable case of jerky, rapid motion necessitating weak motion modelling and large search regions."

                "text": "Detecting objects in cluttered scenes and estimating articulated human body parts are two challenging problems in computer vision. The difficulty is particularly pronounced in activities involving human-object interactions (e.g. playing tennis), where the relevant object tends to be small or only partially visible, and the human body parts are often self-occluded. We observe, however, that objects and human poses can serve as mutual context to each other \u2013 recognizing one facilitates the recognition of the other. In this paper we propose a new random field model to encode the mutual context of objects and human poses in human-object interaction activities. We then cast the model learning task as a structure learning problem, of which the structural connectivity between the object, the overall human pose, and different body parts are estimated through a structure search approach, and the parameters of the model are estimated by a new max-margin algorithm. On a sports data set of six classes of human-object interactions [12], we show that our mutual context model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art in detecting very difficult objects and human poses."

Numerous applications in computer vision can be naturally interpreted as instanciations of this fundamental problem. Recently, a non-iterative discrete approach, tensor voting, has been introduced to solve this problem and has been applied successfully to various applications. As an alternative, we propose a variational formulation of this problem in the continuous setting and derive an iterative algorithm which approximates its solutions. This method and tensor voting are somewhat the differential and integral form of one another. Although iterative methods are slower in general, the strength of the suggested method is that it can easily be applied when the ambient space is not Euclidean, which is important in many applications. The algorithm consists in solving a partial differential equation that performs a special anisotropic diffusion on an implicit representation of the known set of points. This results in connecting isolated neighbouring points. This approach is very simple, mathematically sound, robust and powerful since it handles in a homogeneous way manifolds of arbitrary dimension and topology, embedded in Euclidean or non-Euclidean spaces, with or without border. We shall present this approach and demonstrate both its benefits and shortcomings in two different contexts: (i) data visual analysis, (ii) skin detection in color images."

                "text": "Maximum margin structured learning (MMSL) has recently gained recognition within the machine learning community as a tractable method for large scale learning. However, most current methods are limited in terms of scalability, convergence, or memory requirements. The original Structured SMO method proposed in (Taskar et al., 2003) is slow to converge, particularly for Markov networks of even medium treewidth. Similarly, dual exponentiated gradient techniques suffer from sublinear convergence as well as often large memory requirements. Recently, (Taskar et al., 2006) have looked into saddle-point methods for optimization and have succeeded in efficiently solving several problems that would have otherwise had intractable memory requirements. We propose an alternative gradient based approach using a regularized risk formulation of MMSL derived by placing the constraints into the objective to create a convex function in w. This objective is then optimized by a direct generalization of gradient descent, popular in convex optimization, called the subgradient method (Shor, 1985). The abundance of literature on subgradient methods makes this algorithm a decidedly convenient choice. In this case, it is well known that the subgradient method is guaranteed linear convergence when the stepsize is chosen to be constant. Furthermore, this algorithm becomes the well-studied Greedy Projection algorithm of (Zinkevich, 2003) in the online setting. Using tools developed in (Hazan et al., 2006), we can show that the risk of this online algorithm with respect to the prediction loss grows only sublinearly in time. Perhaps more importantly, the implementation of this algorithm is simple and has intuitive appeal since an integral part of the computation comes from running the inference algorithm being trained in the inner loop. In what follows, we review the basic formulation of maximum margin structured learning as a convex programming problem before deriving the convex objective and showing how its subgradients can be computed utilizing the specialized inference algorithm inherent to the problem. We finish with theoretical guarantees and some experimental results in two domains: sequence labeling for optical character recognition; and imitation learning for path planning in mobile robot navigation. The former problem is well known to MMSL, but the latter is new to this domain. Indeed, although there is a tractable polynomial sized quadratic programming representation for the problem (Ratliff et al., 2006), solving it directly using one of the previously proposed methods would be intractable practically for reasons similar to those that arise in directly solving the linear programming formulation of Markov Decision Processes."

The analysis was conducted on 24 papers that report identification performance on frontal facial images and used either the FERET or ORL database in their experiments. The analysis shows that control scores are predictive of performance of novel algorithms at statistically significant levels. The analysis identified three methodological areas for improvement in automatic face recognition. First, the majority of papers report experimental results for face recognition problems that are already solved. Second, authors do not adequately document their experiments. Third, performance results for novel or experimental algorithms need to be accompanied by control algorithm performance scores."
