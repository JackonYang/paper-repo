Traditional systems in this area have relied on elaborate models incorporating carefully hand-engineered features or large amounts of prior knowledge. In this paper, we take a different route and combine the representational power of large, multilayer neural networks together with recent developments in unsupervised feature learning, which allows us to use a common framework to train highly-accurate text detector and character recognizer modules. Then, using only simple off-the-shelf methods, we integrate these two modules into a full end-to-end, lexicon-driven, scene text recognition system that achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks, namely Street View Text and ICDAR 2003."

The problem is significantly more challenging than reading text in scanned documents, and has only recently gained attention from the computer vision community. Sub-components of the problem, such as text detection and cropped image word recognition, have been studied in isolation [7, 4, 20]. However, what is unclear is how these recent approaches contribute to solving the end-to-end problem of word recognition. We fill this gap by constructing and evaluating two systems. The first, representing the de facto state-of-the-art, is a two stage pipeline consisting of text detection followed by a leading OCR engine. The second is a system rooted in generic object recognition, an extension of our previous work in [20]. We show that the latter approach achieves superior performance. While scene text recognition has generally been treated with highly domain-specific methods, our results demonstrate the suitability of applying generic computer vision methods. Adopting this approach opens the door for real world scene text recognition to benefit from the rapid advances that have been taking place in object recognition."

In this paper, we propose a novel scene text recognition method using part-based tree-structured character detection. Different from conventional multi-scale sliding window character detection strategy, which does not make use of the character-specific structure information, we use part-based tree-structure to model each type of character so as to detect and recognize the characters at the same time. While for word recognition, we build a Conditional Random Field model on the potential character locations to incorporate the detection scores, spatial constraints and linguistic knowledge into one framework. The final word recognition result is obtained by minimizing the cost function defined on the random field. Experimental results on a range of challenging public datasets (ICDAR 2003, ICDAR 2011, SVT) demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods significantly both for character detection and word recognition."

Contrary to recognition of printed documents, recognizing scene text is a challenging problem. We focus on the problem of recognizing text extracted from natural scene images and the web. Significant attempts have been made to address this problem in the recent past. However, many of these works benefit from the availability of strong context, which naturally limits their applicability. In this work we present a framework that uses a higher order prior computed from an English dictionary to recognize a word, which may or may not be a part of the dictionary. We show experimental results on publicly available datasets. Furthermore, we introduce a large challenging word dataset with five thousand words to evaluate various steps of our method exhaustively. The main contributions of this work are: (1) We present a framework, which incorporates higher order statistical language models to recognize words in an unconstrained manner (i.e. we overcome the need for restricted word lists, and instead use an English dictionary to compute the priors). (2) We achieve significant improvement (more than 20%) in word recognition accuracies without using a restricted word list. (3) We introduce a large word recognition dataset (atleast 5 times larger than other public datasets) with character level annotation and benchmark it."

Our approach combines local likelihood and pairwise positional consistency priors with higher order priors that enforce consistency of characters (lexicon) and their attributes (font and colour). Unlike traditional stage-based methods, word recognition in our framework is performed by estimating the maximum a posteriori (MAP) solution under the joint posterior distribution of the model. MAP inference in our model is performed through the use of weighted finite-state transducers (WFSTs). We show how the efficiency of certain operations on WFSTs can be utilized to find the most likely word under the model in an efficient manner. We evaluate our method on a range of challenging datasets (ICDAR'03, SVT, ICDAR'11). Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods for cropped word recognition."

At one end of the spectrum, Optical Character Recognition (OCR) applied to scanned pages of well formatted printed text is one of the most successful applications of computer vision to date. At the other extreme lie visual CAPTCHAs - text that is constructed explicitly to fool computer vision algorithms. Both tasks involve recognizing text, yet one is nearly solved while the other remains extremely challenging. In this work, we argue that the appearance of words in the wild spans this range of difficulties and propose a new word recognition approach based on state-of-the-art methods from generic object recognition, in which we consider object categories to be the words themselves. We compare performance of leading OCR engines - one open source and one proprietary - with our new approach on the ICDAR Robust Reading data set and a new word spotting data set we introduce in this paper: the Street View Text data set. We show improvements of up to 16% on the data sets, demonstrating the feasibility of a new approach to a seemingly old problem."

On the Char74k dataset, a recognition rate of 72% is achieved, 18% higher than the state-of-the-art. The paper is first to report both text detection and recognition results on the standard and rather challenging ICDAR 2003 dataset.

With the rapid growth in research over thelast few years on recognizing text in natural scenes, thereis an urgent need to establish some common benchmarkdatasets, and gain a clear understanding of the current stateof the art. We use the term robust reading to refer to text imagesthat are beyond the capabilities of current commercialOCR packages. We chose to break down the robust readingproblem into three sub-problems, and run competitionsfor each stage, and also a competition for the best overallsystem. The sub-problems we chose were text locating,character recognition and word recognition.By breaking down the problem in this way, we hope togain a better understanding of the state of the art in eachof the sub-problems. Furthermore, our methodology involvesstoring detailed results of applying each algorithm toeach image in the data sets, allowing researchers to study indepth the strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm. Thetext locating contest was the only one to have any entries.We report the results of this contest, and show cases wherethe leading algorithms succeed and fail."

In particular, we focus on recognizing characters in situations that would traditionally not be handled well by OCR techniques. We present an annotated database of images containing English and Kannada characters. The database comprises of images of street scenes taken in Bangalore, India using a standard camera. The problem is addressed in an object cateogorization framework based on a bag-of-visual-words representation. We assess the performance of various features based on nearest neighbour and SVM classification. It is demonstrated that the performance of the proposed method, using as few as 15 training images, can be far superior to that of commercial OCR systems. Furthermore, the method can benefit from synthetically generated training data obviating the need for expensive data collection and annotation."

Based on a specific architecture of convolutional neural networks, the proposed system automatically learns how to recognize characters without making any assumptions, without applying any preprocessing or post-processing and without using tunable parameters. For this purpose, we use a training set of scene text images extracted from the ICDAR 2003 public training database. The proposed method is compared to recent character recognition techniques for scene images based on the ICDAR 2003 public samples dataset in order to contribute to the state-of-the-art method comparison efforts initiated in ICDAR 2003. Experimental results show an encouraging average recognition rate of 84.53%, ranging from 93.47% for clear images to 67.86% for seriously distorted images."

An alternative way to evaluate the fit is to use a feed-forward neural network that takes several frames of coefficients as input and produces posterior probabilities over HMM states as output. Deep neural networks (DNNs) that have many hidden layers and are trained using new methods have been shown to outperform GMMs on a variety of speech recognition benchmarks, sometimes by a large margin. This article provides an overview of this progress and represents the shared views of four research groups that have had recent successes in using DNNs for acoustic modeling in speech recognition."

Our detection technique is based on a cascade of boosted ensemble and localizer uses standard image processing techniques. We propose a small set of features (39 in total) capable of detecting various type of text in grey level natural scene images. Two weak learners, linear discriminant function and log likelihood-ratio test under gaussian assumption, are evaluated. Single features and combination of features are used to form weak classifiers. The proposed scheme is evaluated on ICDAR 2003 robust reading and text locating database. The results are encouraging and the detector can process an images of 640 times 480 pixels in less than 2 seconds."

The algorithm is intended for use by blind and visually impaired subjects walking through city scenes. We first obtain a dataset of city images taken by blind and normally sighted subjects. From this dataset, we manually label and extract the text regions. Next we perform statistical analysis of the text regions to determine which image features are reliable indicators of text and have low entropy (i.e. feature response is similar for all text images). We obtain weak classifiers by using joint probabilities for feature responses on and off text. These weak classifiers are used as input to an AdaBoost machine learning algorithm to train a strong classifier. In practice, we trained a cascade with 4 strong classifiers containg 79 features. An adaptive binarization and extension algorithm is applied to those regions selected by the cascade classifier. An commercial OCR software is used to read the text or reject it as a non-text region. The overall algorithm has a success rate of over 90% (evaluated by complete detection and reading of the text) on the test set and the unread text is typically small and distant from the viewer."

Conditional random fields have advantages over generative approaches to this problem, such as pair HMMs or the work of Ristad and Yianilos, because as conditionally-trained methods, they enable the use of complex, arbitrary actions and features of the input strings. As in generative models, the training data does not have to specify the edit sequences between the given string pairs.

Given an appropriate network architecture, gradient-based learning algorithms can be used to synthesize a complex decision surface that can classify high-dimensional patterns, such as handwritten characters, with minimal preprocessing. This paper reviews various methods applied to handwritten character recognition and compares them on a standard handwritten digit recognition task. Convolutional neural networks, which are specifically designed to deal with the variability of 2D shapes, are shown to outperform all other techniques. Real-life document recognition systems are composed of multiple modules including field extraction, segmentation recognition, and language modeling. A new learning paradigm, called graph transformer networks (GTN), allows such multimodule systems to be trained globally using gradient-based methods so as to minimize an overall performance measure. Two systems for online handwriting recognition are described. Experiments demonstrate the advantage of global training, and the flexibility of graph transformer networks. A graph transformer network for reading a bank cheque is also described. It uses convolutional neural network character recognizers combined with global training techniques to provide record accuracy on business and personal cheques. It is deployed commercially and reads several million cheques per day."

This \"overfitting\" is greatly reduced by randomly omitting half of the feature detectors on each training case. This prevents complex co-adaptations in which a feature detector is only helpful in the context of several other specific feature detectors. Instead, each neuron learns to detect a feature that is generally helpful for producing the correct answer given the combinatorially large variety of internal contexts in which it must operate. Random \"dropout\" gives big improvements on many benchmark tasks and sets new records for speech and object recognition."

A widely-used notion of string similarity is the edit distance: the minimum number of insertions, deletions, and substitutions required to transform one string into the other. In this report, we provide a stochastic model for string-edit distance. Our stochastic model allows us to learn a string-edit distance function from a corpus of examples. We illustrate the utility of our approach by applying it to the difficult problem of learning the pronunciation of words in conversational speech. In this application, we learn a string-edit distance with nearly one-fifth the error rate of the untrained Levenshtein distance. Our approach is applicable to any string classification problem that may be solved using a similarity function against a database of labeled prototypes."

In the approach described, the ANN outputs constitute the sequence of observation vectors for the HMM. An algorithm is proposed for global optimization of all the parameters.

In this paper, we propose a novel text detection algorithm, which employs edge-enhanced Maximally Stable Extremal Regions as basic letter candidates. These candidates are then filtered using geometric and stroke width information to exclude non-text objects. Letters are paired to identify text lines, which are subsequently separated into words. We evaluate our system using the ICDAR competition dataset and our mobile document database. The experimental results demonstrate the excellent performance of the proposed method."

This work is distinguished by three key contributions. The first is the introduction of a new image representation called the \"integral image\" which allows the features used by our detector to be computed very quickly. The second is a learning algorithm, based on AdaBoost, which selects a small number of critical visual features from a larger set and yields extremely efficient classifiers. The third contribution is a method for combining increasingly more complex classifiers in a \"cascade\" which allows background regions of the image to be quickly discarded while spending more computation on promising object-like regions. The cascade can be viewed as an object specific focus-of-attention mechanism which unlike previous approaches provides statistical guarantees that discarded regions are unlikely to contain the object of interest. In the domain of face detection the system yields detection rates comparable to the best previous systems. Used in real-time applications, the detector runs at 15 frames per second without resorting to image differencing or skin color detection."

However, the application to large spatial databases rises the following requirements for clustering algorithms: minimal requirements of domain knowledge to determine the input parameters, discovery of clusters with arbitrary shape and good efficiency on large databases. The well-known clustering algorithms offer no solution to the combination of these requirements. In this paper, we present the new clustering algorithm DBSCAN relying on a density-based notion of clusters which is designed to discover clusters of arbitrary shape. DBSCAN requires only one input parameter and supports the user in determining an appropriate value for it. We performed an experimental evaluation of the effectiveness and efficiency of DBSCAN using synthetic data and real data of the SEQUOIA 2000 benchmark. The results of our experiments demonstrate that (1) DBSCAN is significantly more effective in discovering clusters of arbitrary shape than the well-known algorithm CLARANS, and that (2) DBSCAN outperforms CLARANS by a factor of more than 100 in terms of efficiency."

The standard algorithm makes use of a union-find data structure and takes quasi-linear time in the number of pixels. The new algorithm provides exactly identical results in true worst-case linear time. Moreover, the new algorithm uses significantly less memory and has better cache-locality, resulting in faster execution. Our CPU implementation performs twice as fast as a state-of-the-art FPGA implementation based on the standard algorithm. \n \nThe new algorithm is based on a different computational ordering of the pixels, which is suggested by another immersion analogy than the one corresponding to the standard connected-component algorithm. With the new computational ordering, the pixels considered or visited at any point during computation consist of a single connected component of pixels in the image, resembling a flood-fill that adapts to the grey-level landscape. The computation only needs a priority queue of candidate pixels (the boundary of the single connected component), a single bit image masking visited pixels, and information for as many components as there are grey-levels in the image. This is substantially more compact in practice than the standard algorithm, where a large number of connected components must be considered in parallel. The new algorithm can also generate the component tree of the image in true linear time. The result shows that MSER detection is not tied to the union-find data structure, which may open more possibilities for parallelization."

A new set of image elements that are put into correspondence, the so called extremal regions, is introduced. Extremal regions possess highly desirable properties: the set is closed under 1. continuous (and thus projective) transformation of image coordinates and 2. monotonic transformation of image intensities. An efficient (near linear complexity) and practically fast detection algorithm (near frame rate) is presented for an affinely-invariant stable subset of extremal regions, the maximally stable extremal regions (MSER). A new robust similarity measure for establishing tentative correspondences is proposed. The robustness ensures that invariants from multiple measurement regions (regions obtained by invariant constructions from extremal regions), some that are significantly larger (and hence discriminative) than the MSERs, may be used to establish tentative correspondences. The high utility of MSERs, multiple measurement regions and the robust metric is demonstrated in wide-baseline experiments on image pairs from both indoor and outdoor scenes. Significant change of scale (3.5\u00d7), illumination conditions, out-of-plane rotation, occlusion , locally anisotropic scale change and 3D translation of the viewpoint are all present in the test problems. Good estimates of epipolar geometry (average distance from corresponding points to the epipolar line below 0.09 of the inter-pixel distance) are obtained."
