However, the first-layer Gaussian-Bernoulli Restricted Boltzmann Machine (GRBM) has an important limitation, shared with mixtures of diagonal-covariance Gaussians: GRBMs treat different components of the acoustic input vector as conditionally independent given the hidden state. The mean-covariance restricted Boltzmann machine (mcRBM), first introduced for modeling natural images, is a much more representationally efficient and powerful way of modeling the covariance structure of speech data. Every configuration of the precision units of the mcRBM specifies a different precision matrix for the conditional distribution over the acoustic space. In this work, we use the mcRBM to learn features of speech data that serve as input into a standard DBN. The mcRBM features combined with DBNs allow us to achieve a phone error rate of 20.5%, which is superior to all published results on speaker-independent TIMIT to date."

In the original DBNs, only framelevel information was used for training DBN weights while it has been known for long that sequential or full-sequence information can be helpful in improving speech recognition accuracy. In this paper we investigate approaches to optimizing the DBN weights, state-to-state transition parameters, and language model scores using the sequential discriminative training criterion. We describe and analyze the proposed training algorithm and strategy, and discuss practical issues and how they affect the final results. We show that the DBNs learned using the sequence-based training criterion outperform those with frame-based criterion using both threelayer and six-layer models, but the optimization procedure for the deeper DBN is more difficult for the former criterion."

We describe a pre-trained deep neural network hidden Markov model (DNN-HMM) hybrid architecture that trains the DNN to produce a distribution over senones (tied triphone states) as its output. The deep belief network pre-training algorithm is a robust and often helpful way to initialize deep neural networks generatively that can aid in optimization and reduce generalization error. We illustrate the key components of our model, describe the procedure for applying CD-DNN-HMMs to LVSR, and analyze the effects of various modeling choices on performance. Experiments on a challenging business search dataset demonstrate that CD-DNN-HMMs can significantly outperform the conventional context-dependent Gaussian mixture model (GMM)-HMMs, with an absolute sentence accuracy improvement of 5.8% and 9.2% (or relative error reduction of 16.0% and 23.2%) over the CD-GMM-HMMs trained using the minimum phone error rate (MPE) and maximum-likelihood (ML) criteria, respectively."

Although HMMs are a natural choice to warp the time axis and model the temporal phenomena in the speech signal, their conditional independence properties limit their ability to model spectral phenomena well. In this paper, a new acoustic modeling paradigm based on augmented conditional random fields (ACRFs) is investigated and developed. This paradigm addresses some limitations of HMMs while maintaining many of the aspects which have made them successful. In particular, the acoustic modeling problem is reformulated in a data driven, sparse, augmented space to increase discrimination. Acoustic context modeling is explicitly integrated to handle the sequential phenomena of the speech signal. We present an efficient framework for estimating these models that ensures scalability and generality. In the TIMIT phone recognition task, a phone error rate of 23.0% was recorded on the full test set, a significant improvement over comparable HMM-based systems."

Large margin GMMs have many parallels to support vector machines (SVMs) but use ellipsoids to model classes instead of half-spaces. Model parameters are trained discriminatively to maximize the margin of correct classification, as measured in terms of Mahalanobis distances. The required optimization is convex over the model's parameter space of positive semidefinite matrices and can be performed efficiently. Large margin GMMs are naturally suited to large problems in multiway classification; we apply them to phonetic classification and recognition on the TIMIT database. On both tasks, we obtain significant improvement over baseline systems trained by maximum likelihood estimation. For the problem of phonetic classification, our results are competitive with other state-of-the-art classifiers, such as hidden conditional random fields"

Using complementary priors, we derive a fast, greedy algorithm that can learn deep, directed belief networks one layer at a time, provided the top two layers form an undirected associative memory. The fast, greedy algorithm is used to initialize a slower learning procedure that fine-tunes the weights using a contrastive version of the wake-sleep algorithm. After fine-tuning, a network with three hidden layers forms a very good generative model of the joint distribution of handwritten digit images and their labels. This generative model gives better digit classification than the best discriminative learning algorithms. The low-dimensional manifolds on which the digits lie are modeled by long ravines in the free-energy landscape of the top-level associative memory, and it is easy to explore these ravines by using the directed connections to display what the associative memory has in mind."

The formulation of this generalized HTM is presented in the generative-modeling framework, enabling efficient computation of the joint likelihood for both static and delta cepstral sequences as the acoustic features given the model. The parameter estimation techniques for the new model are developed and presented, giving closed-form estimation formulas after the use of vector Taylor series approximation. We show principled generalization from the earlier static-cepstra HTM to the new static/delta-cepstra HTM not only in terms of model formulations but also in terms of their respective analytical forms in (monophone) parameter estimation. Experimental results on the standard TIMIT phonetic recognition task demonstrate recognition accuracy improvement over the earlier best HTM system, both significantly better than state-of-the-art triphone HMM systems."

This problem is to design a speech-recognition system which can extract from the speech waveform as much information as possible about the corresponding word sequence. The information extraction process is broken down into two steps: a signal processing step which converts a speech waveform into a sequence of information bearing acoustic feature vectors, and a step which models such a sequence. This thesis is primarily concerned with the use of hidden Markov models to model sequences of feature vectors which lie in a continuous space such as R sub N. It explores the trade-off between packing a lot of information into such sequences and being able to model them accurately. The difficulty of developing accurate models of continuous parameter sequences is addressed by investigating a method of parameter estimation which is specifically designed to cope with inaccurate modeling assumptions."

Analogous to structured language models where syntactic structure is exploited to represent long-distance relationships among words , the structured speech model described in this paper makes use of the dynamic structure in the hidden vocal tract resonance space to characterize long-span contextual influence among phonetic units. A general overview is provided first on hierarchically classified types of dynamic speech models in the literature. A detailed account is then given for a specific model type called the hidden trajectory model, and we describe detailed steps of model construction and the parameter estimation algorithms. We show how the use of resonance target parameters and their temporal filtering enables joint modeling of long-span coarticulation and phonetic reduction effects. Experiments on phonetic recognition evaluation demonstrate superior recognizer performance over a modern hidden Markov model-based system. Error analysis shows that the greatest performance gain occurs within the sonorant speech class"

This problem can be relieved by composing a triphone model from less context-dependent models. This paper introduces a new statistical framework, derived from the Bayesian principle, to perform such a composition. The potential power of this new framework is explored, both algorithmically and experimentally, by an implementation with hidden Markov modeling techniques. This implementation is applied to the recognition of the 39-phone set on the TIMIT database. The new model achieves 74.4% and 75.6% accuracy, respectively, on the core and complete test sets."

First, heterogeneous acoustic measurements are chosen in order to maximize the acoustic-phonetic information extracted from the speech signal in preprocessing. Second, classifier systems are presented for successfully utilizing high-dimensional acoustic measurement spaces. The techniques used for achieving these two goals can be broadly categorized as hierarchical, committeebased, or a hybrid of these two. This paper presents committeebased and hybrid approaches. In context-independent classification and context-dependent recognition on the TIMIT core test set using 39 classes, the system achieved error rates of 18.3% and 24.4%, respectively. These error rates are the lowest we have seen reported on these tasks. In addition, experiments with a telephone-based weather information word recognition task led to word error rate reductions of 10\u201316%."

                "text": "Complexity theory of circuits strongly suggests that deep architectures can be much more efficient (sometimes exponentially) than shallow architectures, in terms of computational elements required to represent some functions. Deep multi-layer neural networks have many levels of non-linearities allowing them to compactly represent highly non-linear and highly-varying functions. However, until recently it was not clear how to train such deep networks, since gradient-based optimization starting from random initialization appears to often get stuck in poor solutions. Hinton et al. recently introduced a greedy layer-wise unsupervised learning algorithm for Deep Belief Networks (DBN), a generative model with many layers of hidden causal variables. In the context of the above optimization problem, we study this algorithm empirically and explore variants to better understand its success and extend it to cases where the inputs are continuous or where the structure of the input distribution is not revealing enough about the variable to be predicted in a supervised task. Our experiments also confirm the hypothesis that the greedy layer-wise unsupervised training strategy mostly helps the optimization, by initializing weights in a region near a good local minimum, giving rise to internal distributed representations that are high-level abstractions of the input, bringing better generalization."

In this framework, neural networks (and in particular, multilayer perceptrons or MLPs) have been restricted to well-defined subtasks of the whole system, i.e., HMM emission probability estimation and feature extraction. The book describes a successful five year international collaboration between the authors. The lessons learned form a case study that demonstrates how hybrid systems can be developed to combine neural networks with more traditional statistical approaches. The book illustrates both the advantages and limitations of neural networks in the framework of a statistical system. Using standard databases and comparing with some conventional approaches, it is shown that MLP probability estimation can improve recognition performance. Other approaches are discussed, though there is no such unequivocal experimental result for these methods. Connectionist Speech Recognition: A Hybrid Approach is of use to anyone intending to use neural networks for speech recognition or within the framework provided by an existing successful statistical approach. This includes research and development groups working in the field of speech recognition, both with standard and neural network approaches, as well as other pattern recognition and/or neural network researchers. This book is also suitable as a text for advanced courses on neural networks or speech processing."

We show how to train a multi-layer generative model that learns to extract meaningful features which resemble those found in the human visual cortex. Using a novel parallelization algorithm to distribute the work among multiple machines connected on a network, we show how training such a model can be done in reasonable time. A second problematic aspect of the tiny images dataset is that there are no reliable class labels which makes it hard to use for object recognition experiments. We created two sets of reliable labels. The CIFAR-10 set has 6000 examples of each of 10 classes and the CIFAR-100 set has 600 examples of each of 100 non-overlapping classes. Using these labels, we show that object recognition is signicantly improved by pre-training a layer of features on a large set of unlabeled tiny images."

Our model achieves 6.5% error on the test set, which is close to the best published result for NORB (5.9%) using a convolutional neural net that has built-in knowledge of translation invariance. It substantially outperforms shallow models such as SVMs (11.6%). DBNs are especially suited for semi-supervised learning, and to demonstrate this we consider a modified version of the NORB recognition task in which additional unlabeled images are created by applying small translations to the images in the database.

In order to assess the viability of this approach, we benchmark our performance on broad class recognition against a range of HMM-based approaches using the CMU Sphinx 3 system. We find our system to be competitive with this baseline and conclude by outlining various avenues for future development of our methodology."

Note in passing that we and many others have already taken advantage of processing techniques that incorporate information over long time ranges, for instance for normalization (by cepstral mean subtraction as stated in B. Atal (1974) or relative spectral analysis (RASTA) based in H. Hermansky and N. Morgan (1994)).

Markov chain Monte Carlo methods typically take a long time to converge on unbiased estimates, but Hinton (2002) showed that if the Markov chain is only run for a few steps, the learning can still work well and it approximately minimizes a different function called \u201ccontrastive divergence\u201d (CD). CD learning has been successfully applied to various types of random fields. Here, we study the properties of CD learning and show that it provides biased estimates in general, but that the bias is typically very small. Fast CD learning can therefore be used to get close to an ML solution and slow ML learning can then be used to fine-tune the CD solution. Consider a probability distribution over a vector x (assumed discrete w.l.o.g.) and with parameters W p(x;W) = 1 Z(W) e (1) where Z(W) = \u2211 x e \u2212E(x;W) is a normalisation constant and E(x;W) is an energy function. This class of random-field distributions has found many practical applications (Li, 2001; Winkler, 2002; Teh et al., 2003; He et al., 2004). Maximum-likelihood (ML) learning of the parameters W given an iid sample X = {xn}n=1 can be done by gradient ascent: W = W + \u03b7 \u2202L(W;X ) \u2202W \u2223"

These problems have (at least partially) been attributed to the negative phase in BM learning where a Gibbs sampling chain should be run to equilibrium. Hinton (1999, 2000) has introduced an alternative called contrastive divergence (CD) learning where the chain is run for only 1 step. In this paper we analyse the mean and variance of the parameter update obtained after steps of Gibbs sampling for a simple Gaussian BM. For this model our analysis shows that CD learning produces (as expected) a biased estimate of the true parameter update. We also show that the variance does usually increase with and quantify this behaviour."

This way of combining individual expert models makes it hard to generate samples from the combined model but easy to infer the values of the latent variables of each expert, because the combination rule ensures that the latent variables of different experts are conditionally independent when given the data. A product of experts (PoE) is therefore an interesting candidate for a perceptual system in which rapid inference is vital and generation is unnecessary. Training a PoE by maximizing the likelihood of the data is difficult because it is hard even to approximate the derivatives of the renormalization term in the combination rule. Fortunately, a PoE can be trained using a different objective function called contrastive divergence whose derivatives with regard to the parameters can be approximated accurately and efficiently. Examples are presented of contrastive divergence learning using several types of expert on several types of data."

Tieleman (2008) showed that better learning can be achieved by estimating the model's statistics using a small set of persistent \"fantasy particles\" that are not reinitialized to data points after each weight update. With sufficiently small weight updates, the fantasy particles represent the equilibrium distribution accurately but to explain why the method works with much larger weight updates it is necessary to consider the interaction between the weight updates and the Markov chain. We show that the weight updates force the Markov chain to mix fast, and using this insight we develop an even faster mixing chain that uses an auxiliary set of \"fast weights\" to implement a temporary overlay on the energy landscape. The fast weights learn rapidly but also decay rapidly and do not contribute to the normal energy landscape that defines the model."

This problem was studied exhaustively at Bell Labs between the years of 1918 and 1950 by Harvey Fletcher and his colleagues. The motivation for these studies was to quantify the quality of speech sounds in the telephone plant to both improve speech intelligibility and preference. To do this he and his group studied the effects of filtering and noise on speech recognition accuracy for nonsense consonant-vowel-consonant (CVC) syllables, words, and sentences. Fletcher used the term \"articulation\" as the probability of correct recognition for nonsense sounds, and \"intelligibility\" as the probability of correction recognition for words (sounds having meaning). In 1919, Fletcher found a way to transform articulation data for filtered speech into an additive density function D(f) and found a formula that accurately predicts the average articulation. The area under D(S) is called the \"articulation index.\" Fletcher then went on to find relationships between the recognition errors for the nonsense speech sounds, words, and sentences. This work has recently been reviewed and partially replicated by Boothroyd and by Bronkhorst, et al. (1980). Taken as a whole, these studies tell us a great deal about how humans process and recognize speech sounds. >"

                "text": "While research in large vocabulary continuous speech recognition (LVCSR) has sparked the development of many state of the art research ideas, research in this domain suffers from two main drawbacks. First, because of the large number of parameters and poorly labeled transcriptions, gaining insight into further improvements based on error analysis is very difficult. Second, LVCSR systems often take a significantly longer time to train and test new research ideas compared to small vocabulary tasks. A small vocabulary task like TIMIT provides a phonetically rich and hand-labeled corpus and offers a good test bed to study algorithmic improvements. However, oftentimes research ideas explored for small vocabulary tasks do not always provide gains on LVCSR systems. In this paper, we address these issues by taking the standard \u021crecipe\u021d used in typical LVCSR systems and applying it to the TIMIT phonetic recognition corpus, which provides a standard benchmark to compare methods. We find that at the speaker-independent (SI) level, our results offer comparable performance to other SI HMM systems. By taking advantage of speaker adaptation and discriminative training techniques commonly used in LVCSR systems, we achieve an error rate of 20%, the best results reported on the TIMIT task to date, moving us closer to the human reported phonetic recognition error rate of 15%. We propose the use of this system as the baseline for future research and believe that it will serve as a good framework to explore ideas that will carry over to LVCSR systems."

One specific case of this problem is the task of automatically detecting roads. This task is a difficult vision problem because of occlusions, shadows, and a wide variety of non-road objects. Despite 30 years of work on automatic road detection, no automatic or semi-automatic road detection system is currently on the market and no published method has been shown to work reliably on large datasets of urban imagery. We propose detecting roads using a neural network with millions of trainable weights which looks at a much larger context than was used in previous attempts at learning the task. The network is trained on massive amounts of data using a consumer GPU. We demonstrate that predictive performance can be substantially improved by initializing the feature detectors using recently developed unsupervised learning methods as well as by taking advantage of the local spatial coherence of the output labels.We show that our method works reliably on two challenging urban datasets that are an order of magnitude larger than what was used to evaluate previous approaches."

The author provides a coherent explication of probability as a language for reasoning with partial belief and offers a unifying perspective on other AI approaches to uncertainty, such as the Dempster-Shafer formalism, truth maintenance systems, and nonmonotonic logic. The author distinguishes syntactic and semantic approaches to uncertainty\u0097and offers techniques, based on belief networks, that provide a mechanism for making semantics-based systems operational. Specifically, network-propagation techniques serve as a mechanism for combining the theoretical coherence of probability theory with modern demands of reasoning-systems technology: modular declarative inputs, conceptually meaningful inferences, and parallel distributed computation. Application areas include diagnosis, forecasting, image interpretation, multi-sensor fusion, decision support systems, plan recognition, planning, speech recognition\u0097in short, almost every task requiring that conclusions be drawn from uncertain clues and incomplete information. \nProbabilistic Reasoning in Intelligent Systems will be of special interest to scholars and researchers in AI, decision theory, statistics, logic, philosophy, cognitive psychology, and the management sciences. Professionals in the areas of knowledge-based systems, operations research, engineering, and statistics will find theoretical and computational tools of immediate practical use. The book can also be used as an excellent text for graduate-level courses in AI, operations research, or applied probability."
