This paper describes a set of programs ca l led NGP (Noun Group Processor) which is an i n t e g r a l par t of ELI , the Engl ish Language In te rp re te r (Riesbeck and Schank 1976) which serves as the f r o n t end to three of the Yale na tu ra l language understanding systems, SAM, PAM and WEIS. SAM is a system capable of understanding s to r i es such as var ious newspaper repor ts by using s c r i p t s (Schank and Abelson 1975, 1977; Cu l l i ng fo rd 1975, 1977). PAM is an understanding system which uses general knowledge about peoples' goals and plans (Wilensky 1976). WEIS is a system which understands and c l a s s i f i e s a great v a r i e t y of i so la ted newspaper headlines on i n t e r n a t i o n a l r e l a t i o n s . Thus, our task was to process not only noun phrases of considerable complexity but also to i n t e r p r e t newspaper headl ines, which are not always grammatical ly c o r r e c t . The fo l l ow ing two examples i l l u s t r a t e the kind of sentences our system is able to handle. 1.

This work was supported in par t by the Advanced Research Projects Agency of the Department of Defense and monitored under the Of f i ce of Naval Research under cont rac t N00014-75-C-1111 To process such a la rge scope of sentences the program makes extensive use of i t s knowledge of the problem domain and the redundancy of n a t u r a l language expressions. This saves e f f o r t and permits co r rec t processing of such i r r e g u l a r i t i e s of input t ex t as missing commas and a r t i c l e s , or s l i g h t l y i nco r rec t word order. I t also provides f o r the a b i l i t y to ignore unknown words or ( i n some cases) to make p laus ib le i n t e r p r e t a t i o n s of unknown words. This knowledge is kept in the d i c t i o n a r y . The con t ro l mechanisms remain domain independent. NGP is a p roduc t i on l i ke system which uses expectat ions as i t s basic con t ro l mechanism. The problem wi th every p roduc t i on l i ke system is the tendency f o r the accumulation of a la rge number of expectat ions f i g h t i n g fo r a chance to be tes ted . In t h i s work I have t r i e d to develop a theory of how var ious expectat ions are organized and processed, which, I be l i eve , is in f ac t a theory of how people process na tu ra l language.

A theory of question answering has been proposed which relies on ideas in conceptual information processing and theories of human memory organization. This theory of question answering has been implemented in a computer program, QUALM, currently being used by two story understanding systems to complete a natural language processing system which reads stories and answers questions about what was read. The processes in QUALM are divided into 4 phases: (1) Conceptual categorization which guides subsequent processing by dictating which specific inference mechanisms and memory retrieval strategies should be invoked in the course of answering a question; (2) Inferential analysis which is responsible for understanding what the questioner really meant when a question should not be taken literally; (3) Content specification which determines how much of an answer should be returned in terms of detail and elaborations, and (4) Retrieval heuristics which do the actual digging to extract an answer from memory."
