This paper discusses how to estimate the probability of cooccurrences that do not occur in the training data. We present a method that makes local analogies between each specific unobserved cooccurrence and other cooccurrences that contain similar words, as determined by an appropriate word similarity metric. Our evaluation suggests that this method performs better than existing smoothing methods, and may provide an alternative to class based models."

For example, a speech recognizer may need to determine which of the two word combinations \"eat a peach\" and \"eat a beach\" is more likely. Statistical NLP methods determine the likelihood of a word combination according to its frequency in a training corpus. However, the nature of language is such that many word combinations are infrequent and do not occur in a given corpus. In this work we propose a method for estimating the probability of such previously unseen word combinations using available information on \"most similar\" words.We describe a probabilistic word association model based on distributional word similarity, and apply it to improving probability estimates for unseen word bigrams in a variant of Katz's back-off model. The similarity-based method yields a 20% perplexity improvement in the prediction of unseen bigrams and statistically significant reductions in speech-recognition error."

(Generally speaking, subjects respond quicker than normal to the word nurse if it follows a highly associated word such as doctor. ) We will extend the term to provide the basis for a statistical description of a variety of interesting linguistic phenomena, ranging from semantic relations of the doctor/nurse type (content word/content word) to lexico-syntactic co-occurrence constraints between verbs and prepositions (content word/function word). This paper will propose an objective measure based on the information theoretic notion of mutual information, for estimating word association norms from computer readable corpora. (The standard method of obtaining word association norms, testing a few thousand subjects on a few hundred words, is both costly and unreliable.) The proposed measure, the association ratio, estimates word association norms directly from computer readable corpora, making it possible to estimate norms for tens of thousands of words."

Words are represented by the relative frequency distributions of contexts in which they appear, and relative entropy between those distributions is used as the similarity measure for clustering. Clusters are represented by average context distributions derived from the given words according to their probabilities of cluster membership. In many cases, the clusters can be thought of as encoding coarse sense distinctions. Deterministic annealing is used to find lowest distortion sets of clusters: as the annealing parameter increases, existing clusters become unstable and subdivide, yielding a hierarchical \"soft\" clustering of the data. Clusters are used as the basis for class models of word coocurrence, and the models evaluated with respect to held-out test data."

Both quantitive and qualitative methods have been tried, but much of this work has been stymied by difficulties in acquiring appropriate lexical resources. The availability of this testing and training material has enabled us to develop quantitative disambiguation methods that achieve 92% accuracy in discriminating between two very distinct senses of a noun. In the training phase, we collect a number of instances of each sense of the polysemous noun. Then in the testing phase, we are given a new instance of the noun, and are asked to assign the instance to one of the senses. We attempt to answer this question by comparing the context of the unknown instance with contexts of known instances using a Bayesian argument that has been applied successfully in related tasks such as author identification and information retrieval. The proposed method is probably most appropriate for those aspects of sense disambiguation that are closest to the information retrieval task. In particular, the proposed method was designed to disambiguate senses that are usually associated with different topics."

Words are represented by the relative frequency distributions of contexts in which they appear, and relative entropy is used to measure the dissimilarity of those distributions. Clusters are represented by \"typical\" context distributions averaged from the given words according to their probabilities of cluster membership, and in many cases can be thought of as encoding coarse sense distinctions. Deterministic annealing is used to find lowest distortion sets of clusters. As the annealing parameter increases, existing clusters become unstable and subdivide, yielding a hierarchical \"soft\" clustering of the data."

                "text": "Word sense disambiguation has been recognized as a major problem in natural language processing research for over forty years. Much of this work has been stymied by difficulties in acquiring appropriate lexical resources, such as semantic networks and annotated corpora. Following the suggestion in Brown et al. (1991a) and Dagan et al. (1991), we have achieved considerable progress recently by taking advantage of a new source of testing and training materials. Rather than depending on small amounts of hand-labeled text, we have been making use of relatively large amounts of parallel text, text such as the Canadian Hansards (parliamentary debates), which are available in two (or more) languages. The translation can often be used in lieu of hand-labeling. For example, consider the polysemous word sentence, which has two major senses: (1) a judicial sentence, and (2), a syntactic sentence. We can collect a number of sense (1) examples by extracting instances that are translated as peine, and we can collect a number of sense (2) examples by extracting instances that are translated as phrase. In this way, we have been able to acquire a considerable amount of testing and training material for developing and testing our disambiguation algorithms. The availability of this testing and training material has enabled us to develop quantitative disambiguation methods that achieve 90% accuracy in discriminating between two very distinct senses of a noun such as sentence. In the training phase, we collect a number of instances of each sense of the polysemous noun. Then in the testing phase, we are given a new instance of the noun, and are asked to assign the instance to one of the senses. We attempt to answer this question by comparing the context of the unknown instance with contexts of known instances using a Bayesian argument that has been applied successfully in related applications such as author identification and information retrieval. The final section of the paper will describe a number of methodological studies which show that the training set need not be large and that it need not be free from errors. Perhaps most surprisingly, we find that the context should extend \u00b150 words, an order of magnitude larger than one typically finds in the literature. 1. Word-Sense Disambiguation Consider, for example, the word duty which has at least two quite distinct senses: (1) a tax and (2) an obligation. Three examples of each sense are given in Table 1 below. The classic disambiguation problem is to construct a means for discriminating between two or more sets of examples such as those shown in Table 1. This paper will focus on the methodology required to address the classic problem, and will have less to say about the details required for practical application of this methodology. Consequently, me reader should exercise some caution in interpreting the 90% figure reported here; this figure could easily be swamped out in a practical system by any number of factors that go beyond the scope of this paper. In particular, the Canadian Hansards, one of just the few currently available sources of parallel text, is extremely unbalanced, and is therefore severely limited as a basis for a practical disambiguation system."

When looking for a component, the main concern of users is the functionality of the desired component; implementation details are secondary. Software reuse would be enhanced with conceptually organized large libraries of software components. In this paper, we present GURU, a tool that allows automatical building of such large software libraries from documented software components. We focus here on GURU's indexing component which extracts conceptual attributes from natural language documentation. This indexing method is based on words' co-occurrences. It first uses EXTRACT, a co-occurrence knowledge compiler for extracting potential attributes from textual documents. Conceptually relevant collocations are then selected according to their resolving power, which scales down the noise due to context words. This fully automated indexing tool thus goes further than keyword-based tools in the understanding of a document without the brittleness of knowledge based tools. The indexing component of GURU is fully implemented, and some results are given in the paper."

                "text": "The 1990s have witnessed a resurgence of interest in 1950s-style empirical and statistical methods of language analysis. Empiricism was at its peak in the 1950s, dominat ing a broad set of fields ranging from psychology (behaviorism) to electrical engineering (information theory). At that time, it was common practice in linguistics to classify words not only on the basis of their meanings but also on the basis of their cooccurrence with other words. Firth, a leading figure in British linguistics during the 1950s, summar ized the approach with the memorable line: \"You shall know a word by the company it keeps\" (Firth 1957). Regrettably, interest in empiricism faded in the late 1950s and early 1960s with a number of significant events including Chomsky 's criticism of n-grams in Syntactic Structures (Chomsky 1957) and Minsky and Papert 's criticism of neural networks in Perceptrons (Minsky and Papert 1969). Perhaps the most immediate reason for this empirical renaissance is the availability of massive quantities of data: more text is available than ever before. Just ten years ago, the one-million word Brown Corpus (Francis and Ku~era, 1982) was considered large, but even then, there were much larger corpora such as the Birmingham Corpus (Sinclair et al. 1987; Sinclair 1987). Today, many locations have samples of text running into the hundreds of millions or even billions of words. Collections of this magni tude are becoming widely available, thanks to data collection efforts such as the Association for Computat ional Linguistics' Data Collection Initiative (ACL/DCI), the European Corpus Initiative (ECI), ICAME, the British National Corpus (BNC), the Linguistic Data Consort ium (LDC), the Consort ium for Lexical Research (CLR), Electronic Dictionary Research (EDR), and standardization efforts such as the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI). 1 The data-intensive approach to language, which is becoming known as Text Analysis, takes a pragmatic approach that is well suited to meet the recent emphasis on numerical evaluations and concrete deliverables. Text Analysis focuses on broad ( though possibly superficial) coverage of unrestricted text, rather than deep analysis of (artificially) restricted domains."

These constraints are important in blocking incorrect analyses in natural language processing systems. However, these constraints are domain-specific and hence must be developed anew when a system is ported to a new domain. A discovery procedure for selectional constraints is therefore essential in enhancing the portability of such systems.This paper describes a semi-automated procedure for collecting the co-occurrence patterns from a sample of texts in a domain, and then using these patterns as the basis for selectional constraints in analyzing further texts. We discuss some of the difficulties in automating the collection process, and describe two experiments that measure the completeness of these patterns and their effectiveness compared with manually-prepared patterns. We then describe and evaluate a procedure for selectional constraint relaxation, intended to compensate for gaps in the set of patterns. Finally, we suggest how these procedures could be combined with a system that queries a domain expert, in order to produce a more efficient discovery procedure."

They can involve two, three or more words, these words can be of different syntactic categories and they can be involved in more or less rigid ways. This leads to two main difficulties: collocational knowledge has to be acquired and it must be represented flexibly so that it can be used for language generation. We address both problems in this paper, focusing on the acquisition problem. We describe a program, Xtract, that automatically acquires a range of collocations from large textual corpora and we describe how they can be represented in a flexible lexicon using a unification based formalism."

Central to our approach is the Maximum Entropy (ME) Principle, allowing us to combine evidence from multiple sources, such as long-distance triggers and conventional short-distance trigrams. Given consistent statistical evidence, a unique ME solution is guaranteed to exist, and an iterative algorithm exists which is guaranteed to converge to it. Among the advantages of this approach are its simplicity, its generality, and its incremental nature. Among its disadvantages are its computational requirements. We describe a succession of ME models, culminating in our current Maximum Likelihood/Maximum Entropy (ML/ME) model. Preliminary results with the latter show a 27% perplexity reduction as compared to a conventional trigram model."

How the rate of transmission of this information over a system is limited by the distortion resulting from storage of energy is discussed from the transient viewpoint. The relation between the transient and steady state viewpoints is reviewed. It is shown that when the storage of energy is used to restrict the steady state transmission to a limited range of frequencies the amount of information that can be transmitted is proportional to the product of the width of the frequency-range by the time it is available. Several illustrations of the application of this principle to practical systems are included. In the case of picture transmission and television the spacial variation of intensity is analyzed by a steady state method analogous to that commonly used for variations with time."
