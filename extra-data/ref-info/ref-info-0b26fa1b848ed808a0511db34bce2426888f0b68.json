To extract information from the document history, trigger pairs are used as the basic information-bearing elements. To combine statistical evidence from multiple triggers, the principle of maximum entropy (ME) is used. To combine the trigger-based model with the static model, the latter is absorbed into the ME formalism. Given consistent statistical evidence, a unique ME solution is guaranteed to exist, and an iterative algorithm exists which is guaranteed to converge to it. Among the advantages of this approach are its simplicity, generality, and incremental nature. Among its disadvantages are its computational requirements. The model described here was trained on five million words of Wall Street Journal text. It used some 40000 unigram constraints, 200000 bigram constraints, 200000 trigram constraints, and 60000 trigger constraints. After 13 iterations, it produced a language model whose perplexity was 12% lower than that of a conventional trigram, as measured on independent data.<<ETX>>"

They begin with improved modeling of the grammar statistics, based on a combination of the backing-off technique and zero-frequency techniques. These are extended to be more amenable to the particular system considered here. The resulting technique is greatly simplified, more robust, and gives improved recognition performance over either of the previous techniques. The authors also consider the problem of robustness of a model based on a small training corpus by grouping words into obvious semantic classes. This significantly improves the robustness of the resulting statistical grammar. A technique that allows the estimation of a high-order model on modest computation resources is also presented. This makes it possible to run a 4-gram statistical model of a 50-million word corpus on a workstation of only modest capability and cost. Finally, the authors discuss results from applying a 2-gram statistical language model integrated in the HMM (hidden Markov model) search, obtaining a list of the N-best recognition results, and rescoring this list with a higher-order statistical model.<<ETX>>"

Central to our approach is the Maximum Entropy (ME) Principle, allowing us to combine evidence from multiple sources, such as long-distance triggers and conventional short-distance trigrams. Given consistent statistical evidence, a unique ME solution is guaranteed to exist, and an iterative algorithm exists which is guaranteed to converge to it. Among the advantages of this approach are its simplicity, its generality, and its incremental nature. Among its disadvantages are its computational requirements. We describe a succession of ME models, culminating in our current Maximum Likelihood/Maximum Entropy (ML/ME) model. Preliminary results with the latter show a 27% perplexity reduction as compared to a conventional trigram model."

The resulting static trigram language model (STLM) has fixed probabilities that are independent of the document being dictated. To improve the language model (LM), one can adapt the probabilities of the trigram language model to match the current document more closely. The partially dictated document provides significant clues about what words are more likely to be used next. Of many methods that can be used to adapt the LM, we describe in this paper a simple model based on the trigram frequencies estimated from the partially dictated document. We call this model a cache trigram language model (CTLM) since we are caching the recent history of words. We have found that the CTLM reduces the perplexity of a dictated document by 23%. The error rate of a 20,000-word isolated word recognizer decreases by about 5% at the beginning of a document and by about 24% after a few hundred words."

In the first, we identify a systematic overestimation in the traditional backoff model, and use statistical reasoning to correct it. Our modification results in up to 6% reduction in the perplexity of various tasks. Although the improvement is modest, it is achieved with hardly any increase in the complexity of the model. Both analysis and empirical data suggest that the modification is most suitable when training data is sparse.In the second attempt, we propose a new type of adaptive language model. Existing adaptive models use a dynamic cache, based on the history of the document seen up to that point. But another source of information in the history, within-document word sequence correlations, has not yet been tapped. We describe a model that attempts to capture this information, using a framework where one word sequence triggers another, causing its estimated probability to be raised. We discuss various issues in the design of such a model, and describe our first attempt at building one. Our preliminary results include a perplexity reduction of between 10% and 32%, depending on the test set."

At the heart of our approach is a Maximum Entropy (ME) model, which incorporates many knowledge sources in a consistent manner. The other components are a selective unigram cache, a conditional bigram cache, and a conventional static trigram. We describe the knowledge sources used to build such a model with ARPA's official WSJ corpus, and report on perplexity and word error rate results obtained with it. Then, three different adaptation paradigms are discussed, and an additional experiment, based on AP wire data, is used to compare them."

Since the possible strings may be acoustically similar, a language model is required; given a word string, the model returns its linguistic probability. Several Markov language models are discussed. A novel kind of language model which reflects short-term patterns of word use by means of a cache component (analogous to cache memory in hardware terminology) is presented. The model also contains a 3g-gram component of the traditional type. The combined model and a pure 3g-gram model were tested on samples drawn from the Lancaster-Oslo/Bergen (LOB) corpus of English text. The relative performance of the two models is examined, and suggestions for the future improvements are made. >"

After a brief review of two classical models (TriPOS and Trigram), the authors present a refinement of the morphological language model (Trilemma). They give the different methods used to evaluate performances. They discuss combination experiments between two of these three building blocks and present a model which takes advantage of all three models through a backing-off strategy. Assuming the same vocabulary (20000 forms), experiments show equivalent results using either a classical trigram language model or a trilemma model. The second model can be extended to a full dictionary containing all the inflected forms of each lemma, whereas the first needs a large amount of data to perform such a task.<<ETX>>"

The proposed language model uses the dependencies within adjacent words as local constraints in the same way as conventional word N-gram models. To capture the global constraints between non-contiguous words, we take into account the sequence of the function words and that of the content words which are expected to represent, respectively, the syntactic and semantic relationships between words. Furthermore, we show that assuming an independence between local-and global constraints, the number of parameters to be estimated and stored is greatly reduced.The proposed language model is incorporated into a speech recognizer based on the time-synchronous Viterbi decoding algorithm, and compared with the word bigram model and trigram model. The proposed model gives a better recognition rate than the bigram model, though slightly worse than the trigram model, with only twice as many parameters as the bigram model."

From the acoustic modeling point of view, the language-constraint approach makes it possible to focus on acoustic words for which language models lack enough discrimination capacity.

Experiments were made on an English 1.1-million word corpus and a German 100,000-word corpus. Compared to a word bigram model, the use of clustered equivalence classes in a bigram class model leads to a significant improvement, as measured by the perplexity. Depending on the size of the training material, the automatically clustered word classes are even better than manually determined categories."

A sequence of words is in the language of a link grammar if there is a way to draw links between words in such a way that (1) the local requirements of each word are satisfied, (2) the links do not cross, and (3) the words form a connected graph. We have encoded English grammar into such a system, and written a program (based on new algorithms) for efficiently parsing with a link grammar. The formalism is lexical and makes no explicit use of constituents and categories. The breadth of English phenomena that our system handles is quite large. A number of sophisticated and new techniques were used to allow efficient parsing of this very complex grammar. Our program is written in C, and the entire system may be obtained via anonymous ftp. Several other researchers have begun to use link grammars in their own research."

In this task, casual users are asked to obtain information from a database of air travel information. Users are not given a vocabulary, grammar or set of sentences to read. They compose queries themselves in a spontaneous manner. This task presents speech recognizers with many new problems compared to the Resource Management task. Not only is the speech not fluent, but the vocabulary and grammar are open. Also, the task is not just to produce a transcription, but to produce an action, retrieve data from the database. Taking such actions requires parsing and \"understanding\" the utterance. Word error rate is not as important as utterance understanding rate.Phoenix attempts to deal with phenomena that occur in spontaneous speech. Unknown words, restarts, repeats, and poorly formed or unusual grammar are common is spontaneous speech and are very disruptive to standard recognizers. These events lead to misrecognitions which often cause a total parse failure. Our strategy is to apply grammatical constraints at the phrase level and to use semantic rather than lexical grammars. Semantics provide more constraint than parts of speech and must ultimately be delt with in order to take actions. Applying constraints at the phrase level is more flexible than recognizing sentences as a whole while providing much more constraint than word-spotting. Restarts and repeats are most often between phase occurences, so individual phrases can still be recognized correctly. Poorly constructed grammar often consists of well-formed phrases, and is often semantically well-formed. It is only syntactically incorrect. We associate phrases by frame-based semantics. Phrases represent word strings that can fill slots in frames. The slots represent information which the frame is able to act on.The current Phoenix system uses a bigram language model with the Sphinx speech recognition system. The top-scoring word string is passed to a flexible frame-based parser. The parser assigns phrases (word strings) from the input to slots in frames. The slots represent information content needed for the frame. A beam of frame hypotheses is produced and the best scoring one is used to produce an SQL query."

The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) CSR Corpus described here is the newest addition to this valuable set of resources. In contrast to previous corpora, the WSJ corpus will provide DARPA its first general-purpose English, large vocabulary, natural language, high perplexity, corpus containing significant quantities of both speech data (400 hrs.) and text data (47M words), thereby providing a means to integrate speech recognition and natural language processing in application domains with high potential practical value. This paper presents the motivating goals, acoustic data design, text processing steps, lexicons, and testing paradigms incorporated into the multi-faceted WSJ CSR Corpus."

(Generally speaking, subjects respond quicker than normal to the word nurse if it follows a highly associated word such as doctor. ) We will extend the term to provide the basis for a statistical description of a variety of interesting linguistic phenomena, ranging from semantic relations of the doctor/nurse type (content word/content word) to lexico-syntactic co-occurrence constraints between verbs and prepositions (content word/function word). This paper will propose an objective measure based on the information theoretic notion of mutual information, for estimating word association norms from computer readable corpora. (The standard method of obtaining word association norms, testing a few thousand subjects on a few hundred words, is both costly and unreliable.) The proposed measure, the association ratio, estimates word association norms directly from computer readable corpora, making it possible to estimate norms for tens of thousands of words."

The WSJ-CSR tests consist of tests of large vocabulary (lexicons of 5,000 to more than 20,000 words) continuous speech recognition systems. The ATIS tests consist of tests of (1) ATIS-domain spontaneous speech (lexicons typically less than 2,000 words), (2) natural language understanding, and (3) spoken language understanding. These tests were reported on and discussed in detail at the Spoken Language Systems Technology Workshop held at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, January 20-22, 1993."

The algorithm is called the forward-backward search and is mathematically related to the Baum-Welch forward-backward training algorithm. It uses a simplified forward pass followed by a detailed backward search. The information stored in the forward pass is used to decrease the computation in the backward pass by a large factor. An increase in speed of a factor of 40 with no increase in search errors was observed. The authors also describe how they have incorporated this algorithm into a real-time speaker-independent spoken language understanding system. One version of this is based on the 1000 word Resource Management vocabulary and is directed by a statistical class grammar. Another version has been incorporated into a military transportation planning application called DART (Dynamic Analysis Re-planning Tool).<<ETX>>"

Furthermore, each test component in the evaluation was designed as an experiment to extract as much information as possible from the results.The evaluation was centered around a large vocabulary speaker-independent (SI) baseline test, which was required of every participating site. This test was dubbed the 'Hub' since it was common to all sites and formed the basis for controlled inter-system comparisons.The Hub test was augmented with a variety of problem-specific optional tests designed to explore a variety of important problems in CSR, mostly involving some kind of mismatch between the training and test conditions. These tests were known as the 'Spokes' since they all could be informatively compared to the Hub, but were otherwise independent.In the first trial of this evaluation paradigm in November, 1993, 11 research groups participated, yielding a rich array of comparative and contrastive results, all calibrated to the current state of the art in large vocabulary CSR."

SPHINX is based on discrete hidden Markov models (HMMs) with LPC- (linear-predictive-coding) derived parameters. To provide speaker independence, knowledge was added to these HMMs in several ways: multiple codebooks of fixed-width parameters, and an enhanced recognizer with carefully designed models and word-duration modeling. To deal with coarticulation in continuous speech, yet still adequately represent a large vocabulary, two new subword speech units are introduced: function-word-dependent phone models and generalized triphone models. With grammars of perplexity 997, 60, and 20, SPHINX attained word accuracies of 71, 94, and 96%, respectively, on a 997-word task. >"

The search consists of two parts: a forward, time-synchronous, trellis search and a backward, time asynchronous, tree search. In the first module the well known Viterbi algorithm is used for finding the best hypothesis and for preparing a map of all partial paths scores time synchronously. In the second module a tree search is used to grow partial paths backward and time asynchronously. Each partial path in the backward tree search is rank ordered in a stack by the corresponding full path score, which is computed by adding the partial path score with the best possible score of the remaining path obtained from the trellis path map. In each path growing cycle, the current best partial path, which is at the top of the stack, is extended by one arc (word). The new tree-trellis search is different from the traditional time synchronous Viterbi search in its ability for finding not just the best but the N-best paths of different word content. The new search is also different from the A algorithm, or the stack algorithm, in its capability for providing an exact, full path score estimate of any given partial (i.e., incomplete) path before its completion. When compared with the best candidate Viterbi search, the search complexities for finding the N-best strings are rather low, i.e., only a fraction more computation is needed."

As a function of constraint length the performance of optimal convolutional codes is shown to be superior to that of block codes of the same length, the relative improvement increasing with rate.
