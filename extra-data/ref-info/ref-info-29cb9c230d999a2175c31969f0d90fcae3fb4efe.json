The model consists of three stages: (1) The image is convolved with a bank of even-symmetric linear filters followed by half wave rectification to give a set of responses (models outputs of V1 simple cells). (2) Inhibition, localized in space, within and among the neural response profiles which results in the suppressions of weak responses when there are strong responses at the same or nearby location (models intracortical inhibition in V1), and (3) texture boundary detection using peaks in the gradients of the inhibited response profiles. Unlike previous attempts along these lines, our model is precisely specified, equally applicable to grey scale and binary textures, and is motivated by detailed comparison with psychophysics and physiology. We interpret experimental results on phase discrimination to show that in stage (1) responses of (a) center-surround mechanisms of differing orientations and widths which are even-symmetric about their A computer implementation of this model has been tested on a large number of the ''classic'' stimuli from psychophysical literature. Our model makes predictions about the degree of descriminability of different texture pairs which match very well with experimental measurements of discriminability in human observers due to Krowe and Gurnsey & Browse. From a machine vision point of view our scheme is a high quality texture edge detector which works equally well on images of artificial and natural scenes. The algorithm makes use of simple, local and parallel operations which makes it potentially realtime."

Eye movements are prevented by a very brief presentation of the stimulus, and the inspection interval is terminated by a presentation of a masking pattern. It is shown that detection of a single vertical target line segment, embedded in an array of differently oriented background segments, improves with the increase of mask delay. The reduction of the area in which the target may lie reduces the inspection time that is required to determine the target's presence or absence. The phenomena are invariant under changes of the spatial scale within the fovea and parafovea. These results are interpreted in the context of a model in which the diameter of the area which can be searched in parallel is proportional to the distance in a feature space between the target and background elements. The geometry of this feature space is similar to the functional architecture of the visual cortex. A theory of texture perception based on a qualitative all-or-none feature space of textons is described. A quantitative model that is shown to be essentially equivalent to the previous theory in the limiting case of very large feature differences is proposed."

Significant differences in the density, orientation, size, or contrast of line segments or other small features in an image have been shown to cause immediate perception of texture boundaries. However, the psychological theories, which are based on the perception of synthetic images composed of lines and symbols, neglect two important issues. First, how can textons be computed from grey-level images of natural scenes? And second, how, exactly, can texture boundaries be found? Our analysis of these two issues has led to an algorithm that is fully implemented and which successfully detects boundaries in natural images5. We propose that blobs computed by a centre-surround operator are useful as texture elements, and that a simple non-parametric statistic can be used to compare local distributions of blob attributes to locate texture boundaries. Although designed for natural images, our computation agrees with some psycho-physical findings, in particular, those of Adelson and Bergen (described in the preceding article6), which cast doubt on the hypothesis that line segment crossings or termination points are textons."

                "text": "Texture perception has frequently been studied using textures constructed by repeated placement of micropatterns or texture elements. Theories have been developed to explain the discrimina-bility of such textures in terms of specific features within the micropatterns themselves. For example, Beck1,2 observed that a region filled with vertical Ts is readily distinguished from one filled with tilted Ts but not from one filled with vertical Ls. He attributed this to the different distribution of oriented line segments present in the former case but not in the latter. However, Bergen and Julesz3 found that a region of randomly oriented Xs segregated from one filled with randomly oriented Ls, in spite of the identical distribution of oriented line segments in the two cases. They suggested that this discrimination might be based on the density of such features as terminators, corners, and intersections within the patterns. We note here that simpler, lower-level mechanisms tuned for size may be sufficient to explain this discrimination. We tested this by varying the relative sizes of the Xs and the Ls; when they produce equal responses in size-tuned mechanisms they are hard to discriminate, and when they produce different size-tuned responses they are easy to discriminate."

The elements were arranged in a striped pattern in the top and bottom regions and in a checked pattern in the center region. Observers rated the degree to which the three regions were seen as distinct. When the elements were squares or lines, perceived segregation resulting from differences in element size could be canceled by differences in element contrast. Minimal perceived segregation occurred when the products of the area and the contrast (areal contrasts) of the elements were equal. This dependence of perceived segregation on the areal contrasts of the elements is consistent with a simple model based on the hypothesis that the perceived segregation of the regions is a function of their differential stimulation of spatial-frequency channels. Two aspects of the data were not consistent with quantitative predictions of the model. First, as the size difference between the large and small elements increased, the ratings at the point of minimum perceived segregation increased. Second, some effects of changing the fundamental frequency of the textures were not predicted by the model. These discrepancies may be explained by a more complex model in which a rectification or similar nonlinearity occurs between two stages of orientation- and spatial-frequency-selective linear filters."

We measured the responses of 247 neurons recorded from the striate cortex of monkeys and cats as a function of the contrast intensity of luminance-modulated spatialtemporal sine-wave grating patterns to provide a qualitative description and a quantitative mathematical formulation of the contast response function (CRF). 2. Qualitatively, it is possible to provide a general description of the contrast response function for the majority of cells as follows: as the luminance contrast of a pattern increases, the response increases in a relatively linear fashion over approximately 50-607o of the response range (generally less than I log unit along the contrast range), the slope of the function then begins a rapid compression to an asymptotic maximum-saturation response level. There is, however, a great deal of variation. from cell to cell, in the exact shape and location of the CRF. 3. Quantitatively, the responses of each cell were analyzed in terms of the leastsquares (parameter optimized) best fit using four different mathematical functions: linear, logarithmic power, and hyperbolic ratio. The results of this procedure showed that, across the range of contrasts measured ( 1.4567o), the hypcrbolic ratio (H ratio) provided the best fit for the vast majority of striate cells: some 7O9o f the cells were best fitted by the H ratio and further, averaged across all cells, the H ratio produced the least average residual variance. 4. The contrast response function is an important factor when considering the spatial properties of cortical cells; nonlinearities in the CRF (compression and saturation) will necessarily influence the spatial tuning. We therefore measured the CRF at different spatial frequencies and used the parameters of the H ratio to test the predictions of two general classes of models. If the overall gain, compression, and saturation are set by the absolute response level (response-set gain), then the CRFs measured at different frequencies should shift horizontally along the contrast axis. Results show that the measured CRFs (tested on the same cell using different spatial frequencies) were shifted primarily vertically, suggesting that the gain, compression, and saturation were set by the absolute contrast level (contrast-set gain), relatively independent of spatial frequency; in terms of the H ratio, the semisaturation contrast and the exponent were relatively constant in comparison to the asymptotic saturation response. Thus, the spatial frequency response functions are relatively constant when measured at different stimulus contrasts. 5. There is a great deal of variation in the location of the dynamic response range, from cell to cell, along the contrast axis: some cells distribute their dynamic response range over the first lOVo of contrast, others the second, etc. (relatively independent of preferred spatial frequency). One might expect this range variation to be an important factor in behavioral contrast discrimination. To provide an indication of the average population response as a function of contrast, all cells were averaged together (percent response relative to each cell 's maximum): the slope of the bcst-fitt ing [nwer function (0.77) falls well within the range of estimates found for human psychophysical contrast discrimination functions."

                "text": "The time course of the response of a single cortical neuron to counterphase-grating stimulation may vary as a function of stimulation parameters, as shown in the preceding paper (19). The poststimulus-time histograms of the response amplitudes against time are single or double peaked, and where double peaked, the two peaks are of equal or unequal amplitudes. Furthermore, the spatial-phase dependence of cortical complex-cell responses may be a function of spatial frequency, so that the receptive field appears to have linear spatial summation at some spatial frequencies and nonlinear spatial summation at others (19). In the first part of this paper, we analyze a model receptive field that displays this behavior, and in the second part experimental data are presented and analyzed with regard to the model. The model cortical receptive field in its simplest form contains (two rows) of geniculate X-cell-like, DOG (difference-of-Gaussians)-shaped, center-surround antagonistic, circular-input subunits. We propose nonlinear summation between these two subunits, by introducing a half-wave rectification stage before pooling. The model is tested for the responses it predicts for the application of counterphase-grating stimulation. This simple model predicts the appearance of three response forms as a function of counterphase-stimulation parameters. At periodic spatial frequencies the expected-response histogram has a single peak, whose amplitude has a sinusoidal dependence on spatial phase. At spatial frequencies halfway between these, the expected-response histogram has two equal peaks whose amplitudes have a full-wave rectified sinusoidal dependence on spatial phase. At all intermediate spatial frequencies the expected-response histogram has a \"mixed\" form; the histogram appears sometimes with one peak, sometimes with two equal peaks, and generally with two peaks of unequal amplitude, as a function of spatial phase. Null responses are expected to appear at specific spatial phases only for the periodic spatial frequencies that give \"pure\" response time courses as in paragraph 5 above, and not in the more common mixed response case of paragraph 6. The analysis procedure described in the preceding paper (19) is used, separating the odd and even Fourier components of the response histograms reflecting the receptive-field intrasubunit linear summation and intersubunit nonlinear summation, respectively. We propose that this model may be used as a working hypothesis for the analysis of these aspects of the various cortical receptive-field types. Experimental data are described and discussed in terms of the model.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

                "text": "Mechanisms supporting orientation selectivity of cat striate cortical cells were studied by stimulation with two superimposed sine-wave gratings of different orientations. One grating (base) generated a discharge of known amplitude which could be modified by the second grating (mask). Masks presented at nonoptimal orientations usually reduced the base-generated response, but the degree of reduction varied widely between cells. Cells with narrow orientation tuning tended to be more susceptible to mask presence than broadly tuned cells; similarly, simple cells generally showed more response reduction than did complex cells. The base and mask stimuli were drifted at different temporal frequencies which, in simple cells, permitted the identification of individual response components from each stimulus. This revealed that the reduction of the base response by the mask usually did not vary regularly with mask orientation, although response facilitation from the mask was orientation selective. In some sharply tuned simple cells, response reduction had clear local maxima near the limits of the cell's orientation-tuning function. Response reduction resulted from a nearly pure rightward shift of the response versus log contrast function. The lowest mask contrast yielding reduction was within 0.1-0.3 log unit of the lowest contrast effective for excitation. The temporal-frequency bandpass of the response-reduction mechanism resembled that of most cortical cells. The spatial-frequency bandpass was much broader than is typical for single cortical cells, spanning essentially the entire visual range of the cat. These findings are compatible with a model in which weak intrinsic orientation-selective excitation is enhanced in two stages: (1) control of threshold by nonorientation-selective inhibition that is continuously dependent on stimulus contrast; and (2) in the more narrowly tuned cells, orientation-selective inhibition that has local maxima serving to increase the slope of the orientation-tuning function."

Marr, Julesz, and others have proposed that texture is represented by small lines or blobs, called 'textons' by Julesz (1981a), together with their attributes, such as orientation, elongation, and intensity. Psychophysical studies suggest that texture boundaries are perceived where distributions of attributes over neighborhoods of textons differ significantly. However, these studies, which deal with synthetic images, neglect to consider two important questions: How can these textons be extracted from images of natural scenes? And how, exactly, are texture boundaries then found? This thesis proposes answers to these questions by presenting an algorithm for computing blobs from natural images and a statistic for measuring the difference between two sample distributions of blob attributes. As part of the blob detection algorithm, methods for estimating image noise are presented, which are applicable to edge detection as well."

The theory states that effortless visual texture discrimination may occur between two regions only if they differ in texton density, irrespective of the spatial relationships among textons. It is argued here that line-crossing and terminator textons have not been demonstrated to function independently of configurational differences between micropatterns. Four experiments tested whether line crossings and terminators actually elicit effortless discrimination independently of configurational differences. Subjects were required to detect a disparate textured region embedded in an unpredictable quandrant of a textural display. The textural displays were presented for brief durations, ranging from 67 to 167 msec, and followed by a random dot mask. In general, when configuration was controlled, micropatterns differing in terminators and line crossings elicited relatively poor discrimination. Ease of discrimination, as measured by the probability of a correct detection, was largely associated with differences in micropattern size (measured by the minimum enclosing circle). In addition, for certain texture pairs, ease of discrimination depended crucially upon which member of the pair formed the embedded region and which formed the background. This foregroundVbackground asymmetry was also related to size differences between micropatterns forming the textures. In many cases, performance improved at longer stimulus durations, although the rate of increase and absolute level of performance depended on the particular texture pair being tested. Qualitative differences in performance between naive subjects and a highly practiced subject were also observed."

                "text": "This dissertation reports a collection of new results involving the analysis of roles of image texture in finding the boundaries of surfaces in an image, estimating local surface shape, and determining intrinsic properties of an imaged surface. \nFirst, I introduce a formal framework for the boundary-finding problem which permits the isolation of the choice of an image description function as an important subproblem. I propose that functions which are vector-valued, shift-invariant, and polynomial in image irradiance values with local support constitute a general class of image description functions. I prove that there is a polynomial shift-invariant (PSI) image description operator of degree d that discriminates two image regions if, and only if, the regions differ in their d -point autocorrelation functions, and use this result to compare various existing texture discrimination techniques and to treat, to some extent, the problem of designing new ones. I also present a theorem and empirical evidence which suggest that PSI description operators of degree 2 are likely to be adequate for discriminating differently textured image regions. \nSecond, I analyze several approaches to the problem of determining local surface shape from image contours and texture, concentrating on a class of probabilistic estimation methods. Previous implementations of these methods have characteristically overestimated the slant of imaged surfaces. I identify four causes of this problem and use the analysis to construct a new probabilistic estimator. I prove a theorem and present the results of experiments which show the superiority of the new estimator. \nThird, I investigate the problem of determining the properties of fractional Brownian surfaces from their images; the problem has not previously been addressed for this class of surface models, though they are of widespread use in computer graphics. I use a finite-difference approximation to the partial derivatives of the surface and the leading terms of the Taylor series expansion of the surface reflectance map to investigate the spectral properties of the resulting image. I show that, under certain stated assumptions, the fractal dimension and average slant of the surface, as well as the direction of the ambient light source, can be determined."

                "text": "Responses to single and multiple spatial frequency gratings were recorded from eighty\u2010eight cat striate cortex cells. A cell's response to a grating of its optimum spatial frequency (f) was examined both alone and in the presence of gratings of 1/4, 1/3, 1/2, 2, 3 and 4f, respectively. Some 97% (thirty\u2010seven of thirty\u2010eight) of all simple cells showed significant inhibition of f by one or more of the other frequencies. This inhibition was usually fairly narrowly tuned, with only one or two spatial frequencies producing significant inhibition. Thirty\u2010four simple cells were maximally inhibited by a higher frequency, three by a lower spatial frequency. By far the most common interaction was a considerable inhibition of f by 2f and/or 3f. Of the thirty\u2010seven simple cells showing inhibition to a complex grating, seventeen responded in a manner dependent on the relative phases of the two components. Some showed only inhibition of f; in others, the response to f was either increased or decreased, depending on the relative phase of the two frequencies. The other twenty simple cells showed phase\u2010independent inhibition: the inhibition was of approximately equal amplitude regardless of the relative phase angle of the two grating components. Such phase\u2010independent inhibition cannot be accounted for by linear summation within classical cortical receptive fields. Only eighteen of forty\u2010eight (38%) of the complex cells showed significant inhibition of f by one or more other spatial frequencies. Fourteen of these (29%) were maximally inhibited by a higher spatial frequency, four (8%) by a lower spatial frequency. Inhibitory interactions in complex cells were never dependent on the relative phase of the two component gratings. Six simple cells (16%) and fourteen complex cells (29%) showed significant facilitation of the response to f by one or more (most often lower) spatial frequencies. This enhanced response was greater than the sum of the responses to each component alone, was usually broadly tuned for spatial frequency, and did not depend on the relative phase of the two components. It thus differs from the increased response sometimes seen in a phase\u2010dependent interaction. Some of the observed spatial\u2010frequency\u2010specific interactions are incompatible with either a strictly hierarchical model of cortical architecture or a simple linear filter model of visual cortical processing. The asymmetry of inhibition suggests that it subserves some function other than (or in addition to) the narrowing of spatial frequency tuning functions."

                "text": "We studied the response time course and amplitude dependence on stimulation parameters in cat cortical visual neurons to determine their receptive-field spatial-summation characteristics. Response poststimulus time (PST) histograms of cortical simple cells to contrast-reversal grating stimulation generally have a single peak for each stimulus temporal cycle, though the responses appear rectified. In response to contrast-reversal grating stimulation the general PST histogram time course for complex cells is two peaks, though often these peaks are of different amplitudes. The time course of complex-cell responses, and the ratio of these two response peaks often varies with stimulation parameters. The appearance of a single response peak in simple cells is reflected in the dominance of the odd harmonic Fourier portion, whereas the half-wave rectification leads to a considerable even harmonic portion. Still, this even portion is never significantly greater than the odd portion. When complex cell PST histograms have two nearly equal peaks, Fourier transformation reveals almost only even harmonic components. When the histogram contains two peaks of unequal amplitude Fourier analysis reveals large odd and even components. An even:odd Fourier harmonic portion ratio larger than 1 may be seen as a defining characteristic of complex cells, differentiating them from simple cells. Histograms with two unequal peaks appear \"mixed,\" containing something of the \"pure\" single-peaked response and something of the pure double-peaked response. The degree to which the response is mixed may be measured by the ratio of the even:odd portion amplitudes. There is a great degree of variability with stimulation parameters (both spatial phase and spatial frequency) of the time course of mixed responses as opposed to the case of responses that have two equal peaks independent of stimulation grating phase and frequency. In both simple and complex cells there is a close coincidence of the spatial frequency ranges over which the even and odd portions are substantial, though many complex cells show a periodic variation of the even:odd portions ratio. This spatial-frequency dependence differs from that of LGN Y-cells where the odd portion dominates at low spatial frequencies and the even portion at high spatial frequencies. The ratio of even-to-odd portion cut-off is close to 3:1 in all Y-cells, a characteristic we did not find in cortical simple or complex cells. We suggest, therefore, that the nonlinearity of these complex cells does not derive from that of Y-cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
