However, many real-world domains are best described by relational models in which instances of multiple types are related to each other in complex ways. For example, in a scientific paper domain, papers are related to each other via citation, and are also related to their authors. In this case, the label of one entity (e.g., the topic of the paper) is often correlated with the labels of related entities. We propose a general class of models for classification and clustering in relational domains that capture probabilistic dependencies between related instances. We show how to learn such models efficiently from data. We present empirical results on two real world data sets. Our experiments in a transductive classification setting indicate that accuracy can be significantly improved by modeling relational dependencies. Our algorithm automatically induces a very natural behavior, where our knowledge about one instance helps us classify related ones, which in turn help us classify others. In an unsupervised setting, our models produced coherent clusters with a very natural interpretation, even for instance types that do not have any attributes."

Learning the joint distribution of image regions and words has many applications. We consider in detail predicting words associated with whole images (auto-annotation) and corresponding to particular image regions (region naming). Auto-annotation might help organize and access large collections of images. Region naming is a model of object recognition as a process of translating image regions to words, much as one might translate from one language to another. Learning the relationships between image regions and semantic correlates (words) is an interesting example of multi-modal data mining, particularly because it is typically hard to apply data mining techniques to collections of images. We develop a number of models for the joint distribution of image regions and words, including several which explicitly learn the correspondence between regions and words. We study multi-modal and correspondence extensions to Hofmann's hierarchical clustering/aspect model, a translation model adapted from statistical machine translation (Brown et al.), and a multi-modal extension to mixture of latent Dirichlet allocation (MoM-LDA). All models are assessed using a large collection of annotated images of real scenes. We study in depth the difficult problem of measuring performance. For the annotation task, we look at prediction performance on held out data. We present three alternative measures, oriented toward different types of task. Measuring the performance of correspondence methods is harder, because one must determine whether a word has been placed on the right region of an image. We can use annotation performance as a proxy measure, but accurate measurement requires hand labeled data, and thus must occur on a smaller scale. We show results using both an annotation proxy, and manually labeled data."

However, manual image annotation is an expensive and labor intensive procedure and hence there has been great interest in coming up with automatic ways to retrieve images based on content. Here, we propose an automatic approach to annotating and retrieving images based on a training set of images. We assume that regions in an image can be described using a small vocabulary of blobs. Blobs are generated from image features using clustering. Given a training set of images with annotations, we show that probabilistic models allow us to predict the probability of generating a word given the blobs in an image. This may be used to automatically annotate and retrieve images given a word as a query. We show that relevance models allow us to derive these probabilities in a natural way. Experiments show that the annotation performance of this cross-media relevance model is almost six times as good (in terms of mean precision) than a model based on word-blob co-occurrence model and twice as good as a state of the art model derived from machine translation. Our approach shows the usefulness of using formal information retrieval models for the task of image annotation and retrieval."

A multinet is a probabilistic network of multijects which accounts for the interaction between concepts. The main contribution of this paper is a Bayesian multinet which enhances the detection probability of individual multijects, provides a unified framework for integrating multiple modalities and supports inference of unobservable concepts based on their relation with observable concepts. We develop multijects for detecting sites (locations) in video and integrate the multijects using a multinet in the form of a Bayesian network.

Video query by semantic keywords is one of the most difficult problems in multimedia data retrieval. The difficulty lies in the mapping between low-level video representation and high-level semantics. We therefore formulate the multimedia content access problem as a multimedia pattern recognition problem. We propose a probabilistic framework for semantic video indexing, which call support filtering and retrieval and facilitate efficient content-based access. To map low-level features to high-level semantics we propose probabilistic multimedia objects (multijects). Examples of multijects in movies include explosion, mountain, beach, outdoor, music etc. Semantic concepts in videos interact and to model this interaction explicitly, we propose a network of multijects (multinet). Using probabilistic models for six site multijects, rocks, sky, snow, water-body forestry/greenery and outdoor and using a Bayesian belief network as the multinet we demonstrate the application of this framework to semantic indexing. We demonstrate how detection performance can be significantly improved using the multinet to take interconceptual relationships into account. We also show how the multinet can fuse heterogeneous features to support detection based on inference and reasoning."

Our approach approximates full posterior distributions over model parameters and structures, as well as latent variables, in an analytical manner. These posteriors fall out of a free-form optimization procedure, which naturally incorporates conjugate priors. Unlike in large sample approximations, the posteriors are generally non-Gaussian and no Hessian needs to be computed. Predictive quantities are obtained analytically. The resulting algorithm generalizes the standard Expectation Maximization algorithm, and its convergence is guaranteed. We demonstrate that this approach can be applied to a large class of models in several domains, including mixture models and source separation."

We then introduce variational methods, which exploit laws of large numbers to transform the original graphical model into a simplified graphical model in which inference is efficient. Inference in the simpified model provides bounds on probabilities of interest in the original model. We describe a general framework for generating variational transformations based on convex duality. Finally we return to the examples and demonstrate how variational algorithms can be formulated in each case."

                "text": "Introduction Interest in image retrieval has increased in large part due to the rapid growth of the World Wide Web. According to a recent study (Lawrence & Giles, 1999) there are 180 million images on the publicly indexable Web, a total amount of image data of about 3Tb [terabytes], and an astounding one million or more digital images are being produced every day (Jain, 93). The need to find a desired image from a collection is shared by many groups, including journalists, engineers, historians, designers, teachers, artists, and advertising agencies. Image needs and uses across users in these groups vary considerably. Users may require access to images based on primitive features such as color, texture or shape or users may require access to images based on abstract concepts and symbolic imagery. The technology to access these images has also accelerated phenomenally and at present surpasses our understanding of how users interact with visual information. This paper provides an overview of current research in image information retrieval and provides an outline of areas for future research. The approach is broad and interdisciplinary and focuses on three aspects of image research (IR): text-based retrieval, content-based retrieval, and user interactions with image information retrieval systems. The review concludes with a call for image retrieval evaluation studies similar to TREC. Text-Based Image Retrieval Research Most existing IR systems are text-based, but images frequently have little or no accompanying textual information. The solution historically has been to develop text-based ontologies and classification schemes for image description. Text-based indexing has many strengths including the ability to represent both general and specific instantiations of an object at varying levels of complexity. Reviews of the literature pertaining primarily to text-based approaches include Rasmussen (1997) Lancaster (1998) Lunin (1987) and Cawkell (1993). Long before images could be digitized, access to image collections was provided by librarians, curators, and archivists through text descriptors or classification codes. These indexing schemes were often developed in-house and reflect the unique characteristics of a particular collection or clientele. This is still common practice and recently Zheng (1999) and Goodrum & Martin (1997) have reported on the hybridization of multiple schemas for classifying collections of historic costume collections. Hourihane (1989) has also reviewed a number of these unique systems for image classification. To date, very little research has been conducted on the relative effectiveness of these various approaches to image indexing in electronic environments. Attempts to provide general systems for image indexing include the Getty's Art and Architecture Thesaurus (AAT), which consists of over 120,000 terms for the description of art, art history, architecture, and other cultural objects, and the Library of Congress Thesaurus of Graphic Materials (LCTGM). The AAT currently provides access to thirty-three hierarchical categories of image description using seven broad facets (Associated Concepts, Physical Attributes, Styles and Periods, Agents, Activities, Materials, and Objects). The approach in many collections, particularly general library environments, has been to apply an existing cataloging system like the Dewey Decimal System to image description using the LCTGM, or ICONCLASS. Assignment of terms to describe images is not solved entirely by the use of controlled vocabularies or classification schemes however. The textual representation of images is problematic because images convey information relating to what is actually depicted in the image as well as what the image is about. Shatford (1986) posits this discussion within a framework based on Panofsky's approach to analyzing iconographical levels of meaning in images (1955). \u2026"

Rather than focusing on local features and their consistencies in the image data, our approach aims at extracting the global impression of an image. We treat image segmentation as a graph partitioning problem and propose a novel global criterion, the normalized cut, for segmenting the graph. The normalized cut criterion measures both the total dissimilarity between the different groups as well as the total similarity within the groups. We show that an efficient computational technique based on a generalized eigenvalue problem can be used to optimize this criterion. We have applied this approach to segmenting static images and found results very encouraging."
