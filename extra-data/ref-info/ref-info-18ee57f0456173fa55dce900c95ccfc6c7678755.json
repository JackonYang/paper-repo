This method is implemented in an electronic library system named CyberMagazine, where document images are sequentially converted into database tuples by block segmentation, rough classification, and syntactic analysis. CyberMagazine's image understanding method combines the use of decision tree classification and syntactic analysis using a newly presented matrix grammar. In order to combine the classification and the syntactic analysis steps, the authors propose an augmentation technique for carrying out decision tree classification. Experimental results subsequently demonstrate that high understanding accuracy is obtained by adequate augmentation."

An innovative method (called \"CLAWS\") was recently developed by those working with the Lancaster-Oslo/Bergen Corpus of British English. This algorithm uses a systematic calculation based upon the probabilities of co-occurrence of particular tags. Its accuracy is high, but it is very slow, and it has been manually augmented in a number of ways. The effects upon accuracy of this manual augmentation are not individually known.The current paper presents an algorithm for disambiguation that is similar to CLAWS but that operates in linear rather than in exponential time and space, and which minimizes the unsystematic augments. Tests of the algorithm using the million words of the Brown Standard Corpus of English are reported; the overall accuracy is 96%. This algorithm can provide a fast and accurate front end to any parsing or natural language processing system for English."

The main novelty of these experiments is the use of untagged text in the training of the model. We have used a simple triclass Markov model and are looking for the best way to estimate the parameters of this model, depending on the kind and amount of training data provided. Two approaches in particular are compared and combined:using text that has been tagged by hand and computing relative frequency counts,using text without tags and training the model as a hidden Markov process, according to a Maximum Likelihood principle.Experminents show that the best training is obtained by using as much tagged text as possible. They also show that Maximum Likelihood training, the procedure that is routinely used to estimate hidden Markov models parameters from training data, will not necessarily improve the tagging accuracy. In fact, it will generally degrade this accuracy, except when only a limited amount of hand-tagged text is available."

In this paper, we present a simple rule-based part of speech tagger which automatically acquires its rules and tags with accuracy comparable to stochastic taggers. The rule-based tagger has many advantages over these taggers, including: a vast reduction in stored information required, the perspicuity of a small set of meaningful rules, ease of finding and implementing improvements to the tagger, and better portability from one tag set, corpus genre or language to another. Perhaps the biggest contribution of this work is in demonstrating that the stochastic method is not the only viable method for part of speech tagging. The fact that a simple rule-based tagger that automatically learns its rules can perform so well should offer encouragement for researchers to further explore rule-based tagging, searching for a better and more expressive set of rule templates and other variations on the simple but effective theme described below."

The unknown words are tagged using an experimentally proven stochastic hypothesis that links the stochastic behavior of the unknown words with that of the less probable known words. A fully automatic training and tagging program has been implemented on an IBM PC-compatible 80386-based computer. Measurements of error rate, time response, and memory requirements have shown that the taggers' performance is satisfactory, even though a small training text is available. The error rate is improved when new texts are used to update the stochastic model parameters."

This paper reports our experiments in predicting parts of speech of highly ambiguous words, predicting the intended interpretation of an utterance when more than one interpretation satisfies all known syntactic and semantic constraints, and learning caseframe informationfor verbsfrom example uses.From these experiments, we are convinced that probabilistic models based on annotated corpora can effectively reduce the ambiguity in processing text and can be used to acquire lexical informationfrom a corpus, by supplementing knowledge-based techniques.Based on the results of those experiments, we have constructed a new natural language system (PLUM) for extracting data from text, e.g., newswire text."

The prototype takes advantage of fast hardware, multimedia workstations, and broadband networks to process scientific and technical journals for users and to offer a service that: alerts them to the arrival of new journal articles matching their interest profiles; lets them immediately examine images of pages in the alerted articles and browse through other articles in the database; and enables them to order paper copies of any articles in the database. The system runs on a local area network that connects one or more scanning stations, a centralized document database server and multiple user stations running X Windows servers. The RightPages interface runs as an X Windows application on Sun workstations or X terminals. The system's image and document processing, including noise reduction, document layout analysis, text processing, and display processing are discussed.<<ETX>>"
