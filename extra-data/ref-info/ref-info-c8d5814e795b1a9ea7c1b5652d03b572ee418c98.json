A key issue is the lack of a common access method to retrieval systems, such as SQL for relational databases. The Multimedia Retrieval Mark-up Language (MRML) solves this problem by standardizing access to CBIR systems (CBIRSs). Other difficult problems are also shortly addressed, such as obtaining relevance judgments and choosing a database for performance comparison. In this article we present a fully automated benchmark for CBIRSs based on MRML, which can be adapted to any image database and almost any kind of relevance judgment. The test evaluates the performance of positive and negative relevance feedback, which can be generated automatically from the relevance judgments. To illustrate our purpose, a freely available, non-copyright image collection is used to evaluate our CBIRS, Viper. All scripts described here are also freely available for download."

Most frequently, the underlying hypothesis is that image similarity can be characterized by low-level image features, without further abstraction. This assumes that there is sufficient agreement between machine and human measures of image similarity for the database to be useful. We wish to assess the veracity of this assumption. To this end, we develop measures of the agreement between two partitionings of an image set; we show that it is vital to take chance agreements into account. We then use these measures to assess the agreement between human subjects and a variety of machine clustering techniques on a set of images. The results can be used to select and refine image distance measures for querying and organizing image databases."

We present a new image representation that provides a transformation from the raw pixel data to a small set of image regions that are coherent in color and texture. This \"Blobworld\" representation is created by clustering pixels in a joint color-texture-position feature space. The segmentation algorithm is fully automatic and has been run on a collection of 10,000 natural images. We describe a system that uses the Blobworld representation to retrieve images from this collection. An important aspect of the system is that the user is allowed to view the internal representation of the submitted image and the query results. Similar systems do not offer the user this view into the workings of the system; consequently, query results from these systems can be inexplicable, despite the availability of knobs for adjusting the similarity metrics. By finding image regions that roughly correspond to objects, we allow querying at the level of objects rather than global image properties. We present results indicating that querying for images using Blobworld produces higher precision than does querying using color and texture histograms of the entire image in cases where the image contains distinctive objects."

The user-labelled relevant and irrelevant images are regarded as positive and negative training samples, based on which a classifier is trained dynamically. Then the classifier in turn classifies all images in the database. In practice, the number of training samples is very small because the users are often impatient. On the other hand, the positive samples usually are not representative since they are the nearest ones to the query and thus less informative. The insufficiency of training samples both in quantities and varieties constrains the generalization ability of the classifier significantly. In this paper, we propose a novel relevance feedback approach, which aims to collect more representative samples and hence improve the performance of classifier. Image labeling and classifier training are conducted in two complementary image feature spaces. Since the samples distribute differently in two spaces, the positive samples may be more informative in one feature space than in another. The two complementary feature spaces are alternated iteratively during the feedback process. To choose appropriate complementary feature spaces, we present two methods to measure the complementarities between two feature spaces quantitatively. Our experimental result on 10,000 images indicates that the proposed feedback approach significantly improves image retrieval performance."

In this method, image similarity measure is based on the region importance learned from users' feedback. The region importance that coincides that human perception con not only be used in a query session, but also be memorized and cumulated for future queries.

Over short times scales, it enables the integration of information from successive queries assuring faster convergence to the desired target images. Over long time scales (retrieval sessions) it allows the retrieval system to tailor itself to the preferences of particular users. We address the issue of learning by formulating retrieval as a problem of Bayesian inference. The new formulation is shown to have various advantages over previous approaches: it leads to the minimization of the probability of retrieval error, enables region-based queries without prior image segmentation, and suggests elegant procedures for combining multiple user specifications. As a consequence of all this, it enables the design of short and long-term learning mechanisms that are simple, intuitive, and extremely efficient in terms of computational and storage requirements. We introduce two such algorithms and present experimental evidence illustrating the clear advantages of learning for CBIR."

This paper describes our recent work on developing an image segmentation algorithm which is useful for processing large and diverse collections of image data. A compact color feature representation which is more appropriate for these segmented regions is also proposed. By using the color and texture features and a region-based search, we achieve a very good retrieval performance compared to the entire image based search."

In this framework, keyblocks, which are analogous to keywords in text document retrieval, can be constructed by exploiting the method of Vector Quantization (VQ). Then an image can be represented as a list of keyblocks similar to a text document which can be considered as a list of keywords. Based on this image representation, various feature models can be constructed for supporting image retrieval. In this paper, we present a new feature representation model which use the keyblock-keyblock correlation matrix, termed keyblock-thesaurus, to facilitate the image retrieval. The feature vectors of this new model incorporate the effect of correlation between keyblocks, thus being more effective in representing image content."

An image is represented by a set of regions, roughly corresponding to objects, which are characterized by color, texture, shape, and location. The system classifies images into semantic categories. Potentially, the categorization enhances retrieval by permitting semantically-adaptive searching methods and narrowing down the searching range in a database. A measure for the overall similarity between images is developed using a region-matching scheme that integrates properties of all the regions in the images. The application of SIMPLIcity to several databases has demonstrated that our system performs significantly better and faster than existing ones. The system is fairly robust to image alterations."

                "text": "ness of query refinement, there exists no work on how to implement query refinement efficiently in a multimedia database system. We explore such approaches in this paper. The proposed approaches are independent of the refinement model used (e.g., QPM or QEX) and hence work for all models. We assume that each feature is indexed using a multidimensional index structure (called the F-index). A similarity query can then be answered by executing a k-NN query on each F-index and merging the individual feature results to obtain the final results. Our first contribution is to generalize the notion of similarity queries and allow multiple query points in a query (referred to as multipoint queries). This generalization is necessary since refined queries cannot be always expressed as single point queries. We develop a k-NN algorithm that can handle multipoint queries and show that it performs significantly better than the naive approach (i.e. execute several single point queries using the \u2018single-point\u2019 kNN algorithm and merge results). The second and the main problem we address is how to evaluate refined queries efficiently. A naive approach is to treat a refined query just like a starting query and execute it from scratch. We observe that the refined queries are not modified drastically from one iteration to another. As a result, most of the execution cost can be saved by appropriately exploiting the information generated during the previous iterations of the query. We propose 3 techniques, namely Reuse (RU), Full Reconstruction (FR) and Selective Reconstruction (SR), that cache certain information during the execution of the previous iterations of the query and use that cached information to save the execution cost (both I/O and CPU costs) during the subsequent iterations. We define notions of I/O optimality and CPU optimality and evaluate the three schemes in terms of these criteria. We find that although RU is significantly better than the naive approach, it is not I/O optimal. So we propose FR and show that it is I/O optimal and is significantly more efficient compared to RU. However, FR is not CPU optimal. We finally propose SR and show that SR, like FR, is I/O optimal, and, under certain conditions, also CPU optimal. Even though SR is not always CPU optimal, it is always better than FR in terms of CPU cost and is hence the best technique. Our experiments show that the above techniques speed up the execution of refined queries by several orders of magnitude compared to the naive technique."

In this paper, we concentrate on the retrieval subsystem of MARS and its support for content-based queries over image databases. Content-based retrieval techniques have been extensively studied for textual documents in the area of automatic information retrieval. This paper describes how these techniques can be adapted for ranked retrieval over image databases. Specifically, we discuss the ranking and retrieval algorithms developed in MARS based on the Boolean retrieval model and describe the results of our experiments that demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed model for image retrieval."

I would also express my appreciation to the Principal and Senate of the College of Aeronautics for agreeing to my taking part in this project while continuing my normal duties.

                "text": "This article describes a framework for distributed multimedia retrieval which permits the connection of compliant user interfaces with a variety of multimedia retrieval engines via an open communication protocol, MRML (Multi Media Retrieval Markup Language). It allows the choice of image collection, feature set and query algorithm during run-time, permitting multiple users to query a system adapted to their needs, using the query paradigm adapted to their problem such as query by example (QBE), browsing queries, or query by annotation. \n \nUser interaction is implemented over several levels and in diverse ways. Relevance feedback is implemented using positive and negative example images that can be used for a best-match QBE query. In contrast, browsing methods try to approach the searched image by giving overviews of the entire collection and by successive refinement. In addition to these query methods, Long term off line learning is implemented. It allows feature preferences per user, user domain or over all users to be learned automatically. \n \nWe present the Viper multimedia retrieval system as the core of the framework and an example of an MRML-compliant search engine. Viper uses techniques adapted from traditional information retrieval (IR) to retrieve multimedia documents, thus benefiting from the many years of IR research. As a result, textual and visual features are treated in the same way, facilitating true multimedia retrieval. \n \nThe MRML protocol also allows other applications to make use of the search engines. This can for example be used for the design of a benchmark test suite, querying several search engines in the same way and comparing the results. This is motivated by the fact that the content-based image retrieval community really lacks such a benchmark as it already exists in text retrieval."

Since its formation, in 1947, the Association has adhered to the originally established policy of informality. That is, meetings and discussions were encouraged and information was generally put out in mimeographed form and more formal publications were discouraged. The function of the organization was to maintain a mailing list of members paying only such dues as were necessary to cover the cost of printing or mimeographing and mailing. Such an organization served its purpose excellently, but times have changed.\nPrior to the formation of the Association, the automatic computing field, as such, hardly existed. Probably the first meeting of those interested in the field was held at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1945. The occasion was to introduce the differential analyzer, designed by Dr. Vannevar Bush and Dr. Samuel H. Caldwell, to the public. This machine is a refinement of the original machine built by Dr. Bush in 1925. The earlier machine served as a pattern for several machines which were in operation in 1945, including those at the Aberdeen Proving Ground, the Moore School of Electrical Engineering, the General Electric Company and in Manchester, England.\nIt is interesting to note that, at the time of this first meeting, other analog type machines were in operation. Network analyzers were employed to simulate power distribution systems and aid in their study. None of these machines employed digital representation but represented the values in analog form, such as voltage, current or angular position. Digital computation was possible only by hand operated calculators or by some business machines.\n Although automatic digital computation by machinery was the goal Charles Babbage strove to reach, it was not until the Hollerith rotary counter was suggested in 1890 and the International Business Machines Corporation began producing machines employing such counters for accounting purposes in the period from 1903 to 1905, that such goal was reached. The automatic multiplying punch machine was not produced until 1931.\nComputation by means of telephone relays was first introduced in the Bell System Complex Computer, known as Model I, in 1939. The method of employing the relays was suggested by Dr. George R. Stibitz and the machine was designed by Samuel B. Williams. This was not a fully automatic machine.
