The random walk representation exploits any low dimensional structure in the data in a robust, probabilistic manner. We develop and compare several estimation criteria/algorithms suited to this representation. This includes in particular multi-way classification with an average margin criterion which permits a closed form solution. The time scale of the random walk regularizes the representation and can be set through a margin-based criterion favoring unambiguous classification. We also extend this basic regularization by adapting time scales for individual examples. We demonstrate the approach on synthetic examples and on text classification problems."

Under the assumption that the data lie on a submanifold in a high dimensional space, we develop an algorithmic framework to classify a partially labeled data set in a principled manner. The central idea of our approach is that classification functions are naturally defined only on the sub-manifold in question rather than the total ambient space. Using the Laplace Beltrami operator one produces a basis for a Hilbert space of square integrable functions on the submanifold. To recover such a basis, only unlabeled examples are required. Once a basis is obtained, training can be performed using the labeled data set. Our algorithm models the manifold using the adjacency graph for the data and approximates the Laplace Beltrami operator by the graph Laplacian. Practical applications to image and text classification are considered."

Semi-supervised, multi-view algorithms, which reduce the amount of labeled data required for learning, rely on the assumptions that the views are compatible and uncorrelated (i.e., every example is identically labeled by the target concepts in each view; and, given the label of any example, its descriptions in each view are independent). As these assumptions are unlikely to hold in practice, it is crucial to understand the behavior of multi-view algorithms on problems with incompatible, correlated views. We address this issue by studying several algorithms on a parameterized family of text classification problems in which we control both view correlation and incompatibility. We first show that existing semi-supervised algorithms are not robust over the whole spectrum of parameterized problems. Then we introduce a new multi-view algorithm, Co-EMT, which combines semi-supervised and active learning. Co-EMT outperforms the other algorithms both on the parameterized problems and on two additional real world domains. Our experiments suggest that Co-EMT\u2019s robustness comes from active learning compensating for the correlation of the views."

We also show that our algorithm can be efficiently used in very high dimensional spaces using kernel functions. We performed some experiments using our algorithm, and some variants of it, for classifying images of handwritten digits.

Based on simple probabilistic models, they render interpretable results and can be embedded in Bayesian frameworks for model selection, feature selection, etc. In this paper, by applying the PAC-Bayesian theorem of McAllester (1999a), we prove distribution-free generalisation error bounds for a wide range of approximate Bayesian GP classification techniques. We also provide a new and much simplified proof for this powerful theorem, making use of the concept of convex duality which is a backbone of many machine learning techniques. We instantiate and test our bounds for two particular GPC techniques, including a recent sparse method which circumvents the unfavourable scaling of standard GP algorithms. As is shown in experiments on a real-world task, the bounds can be very tight for moderate training sample sizes. To the best of our knowledge, these results provide the tightest known distribution-free error bounds for approximate Bayesian GPC methods, giving a strong learning-theoretical justification for the use of these techniques."

Instead of using a randomly selected training set, the learner has access to a pool of unlabeled instances and can request the labels for some number of them. We introduce a new algorithm for performing active learning with support vector machines, i.e., an algorithm for choosing which instances to request next.

Local belief propagation rules of the sort proposed by Pearl (1988) are guaranteed to converge to the correct posterior probabilities in singly connected graphs. Recently, good performance has been obtained by using these same rules on graphs with loops, a method we refer to as loopy belief propagation. Perhaps the most dramatic instance is the near Shannon-limit performance of Turbo codes, whose decoding algorithm is equivalent to loopy propagation. Except for the case of graphs with a single loop, there has been little theoretical understanding of loopy propagation. Here we analyze belief propagation in networks with arbitrary topologies when the nodes in the graph describe jointly gaussian random variables. We give an analytical formula relating the true posterior probabilities with those calculated using loopy propagation. We give sufficient conditions for convergence and show that when belief propagation converges, it gives the correct posterior means for all graph topologies, not just networks with a single loop. These results motivate using the powerful belief propagation algorithm in a broader class of networks and help clarify the empirical performance results."

Rather than focusing on local features and their consistencies in the image data, our approach aims at extracting the global impression of an image. We treat image segmentation as a graph partitioning problem and propose a novel global criterion, the normalized cut, for segmenting the graph. The normalized cut criterion measures both the total dissimilarity between the different groups as well as the total similarity within the groups. We show that an efficient computational technique based on a generalized eigenvalue problem can be used to optimize this criterion. We have applied this approach to segmenting static images and found results very encouraging."

Query-by-Committee is used to actively select documents for labeling, then EM with a naive Bayes model further improves classiication accuracy by concurrently estimating probabilistic labels for the remaining unlabeled documents and using them to improve the model. We also present a metric for better measuring disagreement among committee members; it accounts for the strength of their disagreement and for the distribution of the documents. Experimental results show that our method of combining EM and active learning requires only half as many labeled training examples to achieve the same accuracy as either EM or active learning alone."

The major restriction is that the energy function's smoothness term must only involve pairs of pixels. We propose two algorithms that use graph cuts to compute a local minimum even when very large moves are allowed. The first move we consider is an /spl alpha/-/spl beta/-swap: for a pair of labels /spl alpha/,/spl beta/, this move exchanges the labels between an arbitrary set of pixels labeled a and another arbitrary set labeled /spl beta/. Our first algorithm generates a labeling such that there is no swap move that decreases the energy. The second move we consider is an /spl alpha/-expansion: for a label a, this move assigns an arbitrary set of pixels the label /spl alpha/. Our second algorithm, which requires the smoothness term to be a metric, generates a labeling such that there is no expansion move that decreases the energy. Moreover, this solution is within a known factor of the global minimum. We experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on image restoration, stereo and motion."

By imposing uniformity condition on the constraints, we restrict the feasible space to one of smooth solutions. A subspace projection method is developed to solve this constrained eigenproblem. We demonstrate that simple priors can greatly improve image segmentation results."

Unfortunately, the level of abstraction of current mathematics often makes it difficult for anyone but an expert to appreciate this fact. In this work we will look at the interplay of physics and mathematics in terms of an example where the mathematics involved is at the college level. The example is the relation between elementary electric network theory and random walks. Central to the work will be Polya\u2019s beautiful theorem that a random walker on an infinite street network in d-dimensional space is bound to return to the starting point when d = 2, but has a positive probability of escaping to infinity without returning to the starting point when d \u2265 3. Our goal will be to interpret this theorem as a statement about electric networks, and then to prove the theorem using techniques from classical electrical theory. The techniques referred to go back to Lord Rayleigh, who introduced them in connection with an investigation of musical instruments. The analog of Polya\u2019s theorem in this connection is that wind instruments are possible in our three-dimensional world, but are not possible in Flatland (Abbott [1]). The connection between random walks and electric networks has been recognized for some time (see Kakutani [12], Kemeny, Snell, and"

Each image was scanned from mail in a working post office at 300 pixels/in in 8-bit gray scale on a high-quality flat bed digitizer. The data were unconstrained for the writer, style, and method of preparation. These characteristics help overcome the limitations of earlier databases that contained only isolated characters or were prepared in a laboratory setting under prescribed circumstances. Also, the database is divided into explicit training and testing sets to facilitate the sharing of results among researchers as well as performance comparisons. >"

That such algorithms should give consistent answers is surely a desideratum, and in this paper, we address the question of when they can be expected to give stable rankings under small perturbations to the hyperlink patterns. Using tools from matrix perturbation theory and Markov chain theory, we provide conditions under which these methods are stable, and give specific examples of instability when these conditions are violated. We also briefly describe a modification to HITS that improves its stability."

These methods typically assume that the labeled data set is given and fixed. In practice, it may make sense to utilize active learning in conjunction with semi-supervised learning. That is, we might allow the learning algorithm to pick a set of unlabeled instances to be labeled by a domain expert, which will then be used as (or to augment) the labeled data set. In other words, if we have to label a few instances for semisupervised learning, it may be attractive to let the learning algorithm tell us which instances to label, rather than selecting them randomly. We will limit the range of query selection to the unlabeled data set, a practice known as poolbased active learning or selective sampling. There has been a great deal of research in active learning. For example, Tong and Koller (2000) select queries to minimize the version space size for support vector machines; Cohn et al."
