Unlike classical semantic segmentation, we require individual object instances. We build on recent work that uses convolutional neural networks to classify category-independent region proposals (R-CNN [16]), introducing a novel architecture tailored for SDS. We then use category-specific, top-down figure-ground predictions to refine our bottom-up proposals. We show a 7 point boost (16% relative) over our baselines on SDS, a 5 point boost (10% relative) over state-of-the-art on semantic segmentation, and state-of-the-art performance in object detection. Finally, we provide diagnostic tools that unpack performance and provide directions for future work."

The best-performing methods are complex ensemble systems that typically combine multiple low-level image features with high-level context. In this paper, we propose a simple and scalable detection algorithm that improves mean average precision (mAP) by more than 30% relative to the previous best result on VOC 2012 -- achieving a mAP of 53.3%. Our approach combines two key insights: (1) one can apply high-capacity convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to bottom-up region proposals in order to localize and segment objects and (2) when labeled training data is scarce, supervised pre-training for an auxiliary task, followed by domain-specific fine-tuning, yields a significant performance boost. Since we combine region proposals with CNNs, we call our method R-CNN: Regions with CNN features. We also present experiments that provide insight into what the network learns, revealing a rich hierarchy of image features. Source code for the complete system is available at http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~rbg/rcnn."

Inspired by data-driven methods, we propose an exemplar-based approach to the task of instance segmentation, in which a set of reference image/shape masks is used to find multiple objects. We design a novel CRF framework that jointly models object appearance, shape deformation, and object occlusion. To tackle the challenging MAP inference problem, we derive an alternating procedure that interleaves object segmentation and shape/appearance adaptation. We evaluate our method on two datasets with instance labels and show promising results."

This work brings together methods from DCNNs and probabilistic graphical models for addressing the task of pixel-level classification (also called \"semantic image segmentation\"). We show that responses at the final layer of DCNNs are not sufficiently localized for accurate object segmentation. This is due to the very invariance properties that make DCNNs good for high level tasks. We overcome this poor localization property of deep networks by combining the responses at the final DCNN layer with a fully connected Conditional Random Field (CRF). Qualitatively, our \"DeepLab\" system is able to localize segment boundaries at a level of accuracy which is beyond previous methods. Quantitatively, our method sets the new state-of-art at the PASCAL VOC-2012 semantic image segmentation task, reaching 71.6% IOU accuracy in the test set. We show how these results can be obtained efficiently: Careful network re-purposing and a novel application of the 'hole' algorithm from the wavelet community allow dense computation of neural net responses at 8 frames per second on a modern GPU."

In this paper, we propose an algorithm to recover the occlusion boundaries and depth ordering of free-standing structures in the scene. Rather than viewing the problem as one of pure image processing, our approach employs cues from an estimated surface layout and applies Gestalt grouping principles using a conditional random field (CRF) model. We propose a hierarchical segmentation process, based on agglomerative merging, that re-estimates boundary strength as the segmentation progresses. Our experiments on the Geometric Context dataset validate our choices for features, our iterative refinement of classifiers, and our CRF model. In experiments on the Berkeley Segmentation Dataset, PASCAL VOC 2008, and LabelMe, we also show that the trained algorithm generalizes to other datasets and can be used as an object boundary predictor with figure/ground labels."

We show that convolutional networks by themselves, trained end-to-end, pixels-to-pixels, improve on the previous best result in semantic segmentation. Our key insight is to build \u201cfully convolutional\u201d networks that take input of arbitrary size and produce correspondingly-sized output with efficient inference and learning. We define and detail the space of fully convolutional networks, explain their application to spatially dense prediction tasks, and draw connections to prior models. We adapt contemporary classification networks (AlexNet, the VGG net, and GoogLeNet) into fully convolutional networks and transfer their learned representations by fine-tuning to the segmentation task. We then define a skip architecture that combines semantic information from a deep, coarse layer with appearance information from a shallow, fine layer to produce accurate and detailed segmentations. Our fully convolutional networks achieve improved segmentation of PASCAL VOC (30% relative improvement to 67.2% mean IU on 2012), NYUDv2, SIFT Flow, and PASCAL-Context, while inference takes one tenth of a second for a typical image."

We formulate the problem as the one of inference in a binary Markov random field which exploits appearance models, stereo and/or noisy point clouds, a repository of 3D CAD models as well as topological constraints. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in the context of autonomous driving, and show that we can segment cars with the accuracy of 86% intersection-over-union, performing as well as highly recommended MTurkers!"

Our main contribution is a thorough evaluation of networks of increasing depth using an architecture with very small (3x3) convolution filters, which shows that a significant improvement on the prior-art configurations can be achieved by pushing the depth to 16-19 weight layers. These findings were the basis of our ImageNet Challenge 2014 submission, where our team secured the first and the second places in the localisation and classification tracks respectively. We also show that our representations generalise well to other datasets, where they achieve state-of-the-art results. We have made our two best-performing ConvNet models publicly available to facilitate further research on the use of deep visual representations in computer vision."

We study the more challenging problem of learning DCNNs for semantic image segmentation from either (1) weakly annotated training data such as bounding boxes or image-level labels or (2) a combination of few strongly labeled and many weakly labeled images, sourced from one or multiple datasets. We develop Expectation-Maximization (EM) methods for semantic image segmentation model training under these weakly supervised and semi-supervised settings. Extensive experimental evaluation shows that the proposed techniques can learn models delivering competitive results on the challenging PASCAL VOC 2012 image segmentation benchmark, while requiring significantly less annotation effort.

In this paper, we propose a framework which jointly optimizes for both tasks and implicitly provides detection hypotheses and corresponding segmentations. Our novel approach is attachable to any of the available generalized Hough voting methods. We introduce Hough Regions by formulating the problem of Hough space analysis as Bayesian labeling of a random field. This exploits provided classifier responses, object center votes and low-level cues like color consistency, which are combined into a global energy term. We further propose a greedy approach to solve this energy minimization problem providing a pixel-wise assignment to background or to a specific category instance. This way we bypass the parameter sensitive non-maximum suppression that is required in related methods. The experimental evaluation demonstrates that state-of-the-art detection and segmentation results are achieved and that our method is inherently able to handle overlapping instances and an increased range of articulations, aspect ratios and scales."

We develop Expectation-Maximization (EM) methods for semantic image segmentation model training under these weakly supervised and semi-supervised settings. Extensive experimental evaluation shows that the proposed techniques can learn models delivering competitive results on the challenging PASCAL VOC 2012 image segmentation benchmark, while requiring significantly less annotation effort.

Building on previous benchmark criteria for object detection and image segmentation, we define a novel score that evaluates both class and instance segmentation. We evaluate our system on the PASCAL 2009 and 2010 segmentation challenge data sets and show good test results with state-of-the-art performance in several categories, including segmenting humans."

In this paper we propose a learning-based framework for depth ordering inference. Boundary and junction characteristics are important clues for this task, and we have developed new features based on these attributes. Although each feature individually can produce reasonable depth ordering results, each still has limitations, and we can achieve better performance by combining them. In practice, local depth ordering inferences can be contradictory. Therefore, we propose a Markov Random Field model with terms that are more global than previous work, and use graph optimization to encourage a globally consistent ordering. In addition, to produce better object segmentation for the task of depth ordering, we propose to explicitly enforce closed loops and long edges for the occlusion boundary detection. We collect a new depth-order dataset for this problem, including more than a thousand human-labeled images with various daily objects and configurations. The proposed algorithm shows promising performance over conventional methods on both synthetic and real scenes."

Learning and inference in our model are efficient as we reason at the segment level, and introduce auxiliary variables that allow us to decompose the inherent high-order potentials into pairwise potentials between a few variables with small number of states (at most the number of classes). Inference is done via a convergent message-passing algorithm, which, unlike graph-cuts inference, has no submodularity restrictions and does not require potential specific moves. We believe this is very important, as it allows us to encode our ideas and prior knowledge about the problem without the need to change the inference engine every time we introduce a new potential. Our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art on the MSRC-21 benchmark, while being much faster. Importantly, our holistic model is able to improve performance in all tasks."

Our approach takes advantage of large-scale crowd-sourced maps to generate dense geographic, geometric and semantic priors by rendering the 3D world. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our holistic model on the challenging KITTI dataset [13], and show significant improvements over the baselines in all metrics and tasks."

We show how a multiscale and sliding window approach can be efficiently implemented within a ConvNet. We also introduce a novel deep learning approach to localization by learning to predict object boundaries. Bounding boxes are then accumulated rather than suppressed in order to increase detection confidence. We show that different tasks can be learned simultaneously using a single shared network. This integrated framework is the winner of the localization task of the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge 2013 (ILSVRC2013) and obtained very competitive results for the detection and classifications tasks.

Starting with an initial pixel labeling and a set of candidate object masks for a given test image, we select a subset of objects that explain the image well and have valid overlap relationships and occlusion ordering. This is done by minimizing an integer quadratic program either using a greedy method or a standard solver. Then we alternate between using the object predictions to refine the pixel labels and vice versa. The proposed system obtains promising results on two challenging subsets of the LabelMe and SUN datasets, the largest of which contains 45, 676 images and 232 classes."

We believe that the amazing ability of humans to reason about occlusions from one image is based on an intrinsically 3D interpretation. In this paper, our goal is to recover the occlusion boundaries and depth ordering of free-standing structures in the scene. Our approach is to learn to identify and label occlusion boundaries using the traditional edge and region cues together with 3D surface and depth cues. Since some of these cues require good spatial support (i.e., a segmentation), we gradually create larger regions and use them to improve inference over the boundaries. Our experiments demonstrate the power of a scene-based approach to occlusion reasoning."

Our main focus is to unify contributions from the 1970s with recent advances in object detection: use local keypoint detectors to find candidate poses and score global alignment of each candidate pose to the image. Moreover, we also provide a new dataset containing fine-aligned objects with their exactly matched 3D models, and a set of models for widely used objects. We also evaluate our algorithm both on object detection and fine pose estimation, and show that our method outperforms state-of-the art algorithms."

Towards this goal, we propose a branch and bound algorithm which is guaranteed to retrieve the global optimum of the joint problem. The main difficulty resides in taking into account occlusion in order to not over-count the evidence. We introduce a new decomposition method, which generalizes integral geometry to triangular shapes, and allows us to bound the different terms in constant time. We exploit both geometric cues and object detectors as image features and show large improvements in 2D and 3D object detection over state-of-the-art deformable part-based models."

As the object (human or otherwise) moves about the scene, it reveals pairwise depth-ordering or occlusion cues. The goal of this work is to use these sparse occlusion cues along with monocular depth occlusion cues to densely segment the scene into depth layers. We cast the problem of depth-layer segmentation as a discrete labeling problem on a spatio-temporal Markov Random Field (MRF) that uses the motion occlusion cues along with monocular cues and a smooth motion prior for the moving object. We quantitatively show that depth ordering produced by the proposed combination of the depth cues from object motion and monocular occlusion cues are superior to using either feature independently, and using a naive combination of the features."

The next challenge is to integrate all these algorithms and address the problem of scene understanding. This paper is a step towards this goal. We present a probabilistic framework for reasoning about regions, objects, and their attributes such as object class, location, and spatial extent. Our model is a Conditional Random Field defined on pixels, segments and objects. We define a global energy function for the model, which combines results from sliding window detectors, and low-level pixel-based unary and pairwise relations. One of our primary contributions is to show that this energy function can be solved efficiently. Experimental results show that our model achieves significant improvement over the baseline methods on CamVid and PASCAL VOC datasets."

Recent approaches have attempted to harness the capabilities of deep learning techniques for image recognition to tackle pixel-level labelling tasks. One central issue in this methodology is the limited capacity of deep learning techniques to delineate visual objects. To solve this problem, we introduce a new form of convolutional neural network that combines the strengths of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Conditional Random Fields (CRFs)-based probabilistic graphical modelling. To this end, we formulate Conditional Random Fields with Gaussian pairwise potentials and mean-field approximate inference as Recurrent Neural Networks. This network, called CRF-RNN, is then plugged in as a part of a CNN to obtain a deep network that has desirable properties of both CNNs and CRFs. Importantly, our system fully integrates CRF modelling with CNNs, making it possible to train the whole deep network end-to-end with the usual back-propagation algorithm, avoiding offline post-processing methods for object delineation. We apply the proposed method to the problem of semantic image segmentation, obtaining top results on the challenging Pascal VOC 2012 segmentation benchmark."

In this paper, we propose a novel object representation, 3D Voxel Pattern (3DVP), that jointly encodes the key properties of objects including appearance, 3D shape, viewpoint, occlusion and truncation. We discover 3DVPs in a data-driven way, and train a bank of specialized detectors for a dictionary of 3DVPs. The 3DVP detectors are capable of detecting objects with specific visibility patterns and transferring the meta-data from the 3DVPs to the detected objects, such as 2D segmentation mask, 3D pose as well as occlusion or truncation boundaries. The transferred meta-data allows us to infer the occlusion relationship among objects, which in turn provides improved object recognition results. Experiments are conducted on the KITTI detection benchmark [17] and the outdoor-scene dataset [41]. We improve state-of-the-art results on car detection and pose estimation with notable margins (6% in difficult data of KITTI). We also verify the ability of our method in accurately segmenting objects from the background and localizing them in 3D."

We demonstrate our technique in cases where past methods fail (non-translating cameras and dynamic scenes). Our technique is applicable to single images as well as videos. For videos, we use local motion cues to improve the inferred depth maps, while optical flow is used to ensure temporal depth consistency. For training and evaluation, we use a Kinect-based system to collect a large data set containing stereoscopic videos with known depths. We show that our depth estimation technique outperforms the state-of-the-art on benchmark databases. Our technique can be used to automatically convert a monoscopic video into stereo for 3D visualization, and we demonstrate this through a variety of visually pleasing results for indoor and outdoor scenes, including results from the feature film Charade."

Given a monocular image, our aim is to localize the objects in 3D by enclosing them with tight oriented 3D bounding boxes. We propose a novel approach that extends the well-acclaimed deformable part-based model [1] to reason in 3D. Our model represents an object class as a deformable 3D cuboid composed of faces and parts, which are both allowed to deform with respect to their anchors on the 3D box. We model the appearance of each face in fronto-parallel coordinates, thus effectively factoring out the appearance variation induced by viewpoint. Our model reasons about face visibility patters called aspects. We train the cuboid model jointly and discriminatively and share weights across all aspects to attain efficiency. Inference then entails sliding and rotating the box in 3D and scoring object hypotheses. While for inference we discretize the search space, the variables are continuous in our model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in indoor and outdoor scenarios, and show that our approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art in both 2D [1] and 3D object detection [2]."

In this paper, we provide a framework for placing local object detection in the context of the overall 3D scene by modeling the interdependence of objects, surface orientations, and camera viewpoint. Most object detection methods consider all scales and locations in the image as equally likely. We show that with probabilistic estimates of 3D geometry, both in terms of surfaces and world coordinates, we can put objects into perspective and model the scale and location variance in the image. Our approach reflects the cyclical nature of the problem by allowing probabilistic object hypotheses to refine geometry and vice-versa. Our framework allows painless substitution of almost any object detector and is easily extended to include other aspects of image understanding.

In this paper, we propose to use a similar process in order to parse a scene. We model a scene as a collage of warped, layered objects sampled from labeled, reference images. Each object is related to the rest by a set of support constraints. Scene parsing is achieved through analysis-by-synthesis. Starting with a dataset of labeled exemplar scenes, we retrieve a dictionary of candidate object segments that match a query image. We then combine elements of this set into a \"scene collage\" that explains the query image. Beyond just assigning object labels to pixels, scene collaging produces a lot more information such as the number of each type of object in the scene, how they support one another, the ordinal depth of each object, and, to some degree, occluded content. We exploit this representation for several applications: image editing, random scene synthesis, and image-to-anaglyph."

We present a hierarchical scene model for learning and reasoning about complex indoor scenes which is computationally tractable, can be learned from a reasonable amount of training data, and avoids oversimplification. At the core of this approach is the 3D Geometric Phrase Model which captures the semantic and geometric relationships between objects which frequently co-occur in the same 3D spatial configuration. Experiments show that this model effectively explains scene semantics, geometry and object groupings from a single image, while also improving individual object detections."

The work draws together two powerful formulations: pictorial structures (PS) and Markov random fields (MRFs) both of which have efficient algorithms for their solution. The resulting combination, which we call the object category specific MRF, suggests a solution to the problem that has long dogged MRFs namely that they provide a poor prior for specific shapes. In contrast, our model provides a prior that is global across the image plane using the PS. We develop an efficient method, OBJ CUT, to obtain segmentations using this model. Novel aspects of this method include an efficient algorithm for sampling the PS model, and the observation that the expected log likelihood of the model can be increased by a single graph cut. Results are presented on two object categories, cows and horses. We compare our methods to the state of the art in object category specific image segmentation and demonstrate significant improvements."

Perhaps one of the main reasons for this is the lack of demanding benchmarks that mimic such scenarios. In this paper, we take advantage of our autonomous driving platform to develop novel challenging benchmarks for the tasks of stereo, optical flow, visual odometry/SLAM and 3D object detection. Our recording platform is equipped with four high resolution video cameras, a Velodyne laser scanner and a state-of-the-art localization system. Our benchmarks comprise 389 stereo and optical flow image pairs, stereo visual odometry sequences of 39.2 km length, and more than 200k 3D object annotations captured in cluttered scenarios (up to 15 cars and 30 pedestrians are visible per image). Results from state-of-the-art algorithms reveal that methods ranking high on established datasets such as Middlebury perform below average when being moved outside the laboratory to the real world. Our goal is to reduce this bias by providing challenging benchmarks with novel difficulties to the computer vision community. Our benchmarks are available online at: www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti."

We show that we can recognize the three dimensional structure of the interior of a building, even in the presence of occluding objects. Several physically valid structure hypotheses are proposed by geometric reasoning and verified to find the best fitting model to line segments, which is then converted to a full 3D model. Our experiments demonstrate that our structure recovery from line segments is comparable with methods using full image appearance. Our approach shows how a set of rules describing geometric constraints between groups of segments can be used to prune scene interpretation hypotheses and to generate the most plausible interpretation."

Using the \"chair\" class as a running example, we propose an exemplar-based 3D category representation, which can explicitly model chairs of different styles as well as the large variation in viewpoint. We develop an approach to establish part-based correspondences between 3D CAD models and real photographs. This is achieved by (i) representing each 3D model using a set of view-dependent mid-level visual elements learned from synthesized views in a discriminative fashion, (ii) carefully calibrating the individual element detectors on a common dataset of negative images, and (iii) matching visual elements to the test image allowing for small mutual deformations but preserving the viewpoint and style constraints. We demonstrate the ability of our system to align 3D models with 2D objects in the challenging PASCAL VOC images, which depict a wide variety of chairs in complex scenes."

We show that exploiting the box like geometric structure of furniture and constraints provided by the scene, allows us to recover the extent of major furniture objects in 3D. Our \u201cboxy\u201d detector localizes box shaped objects oriented parallel to the scene across different scales and object types, and thus blocks out the occupied space in the scene. To localize the objects more accurately in 3D we introduce a set of specially designed features that capture the floor contact points of the objects. Image based metrics are not very indicative of performance in 3D. We make the first attempt to evaluate single view based occupancy estimates for 3D errors and propose several task driven performance measures towards it. On our dataset of 592 indoor images marked with full 3D geometry of the scene, we show that: (a) our detector works well using image based metrics; (b) our refinement method produces significant improvements in localization in 3D; and (c) if one evaluates using 3D metrics, our method offers major improvements over other single view based scene geometry estimation methods."

Towards this goal, we first parse the sentential descriptions into a semantic graph, which is then matched to visual concepts using a generalized bipartite matching algorithm. Our approach exploits object appearance, motion and spatial relations, and learns the importance of each term using structure prediction. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a new dataset designed for semantic search in the context of autonomous driving, which exhibits complex and highly dynamic scenes with many objects. We show that our approach is able to locate a major portion of the objects described in the query with high accuracy, and improve the relevance in video retrieval."

Our approach leverages datasets of images and their sentence descriptions to learn about the inter-modal correspondences between language and visual data. Our alignment model is based on a novel combination of Convolutional Neural Networks over image regions, bidirectional Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) over sentences, and a structured objective that aligns the two modalities through a multimodal embedding. We then describe a Multimodal Recurrent Neural Network architecture that uses the inferred alignments to learn to generate novel descriptions of image regions. We demonstrate that our alignment model produces state of the art results in retrieval experiments on Flickr8K, Flickr30K and MSCOCO datasets. We then show that the generated descriptions outperform retrieval baselines on both full images and on a new dataset of region-level annotations. Finally, we conduct large-scale analysis of our RNN language model on the Visual Genome dataset of 4.1 million captions and highlight the differences between image and region-level caption statistics."

An AdaBoost detection scheme is employed with pixel lookup features for fast detection. The analysis provides insight into the design of a robust vehicle detection system, showing promise in terms of detection performance and orientation estimation accuracy."
