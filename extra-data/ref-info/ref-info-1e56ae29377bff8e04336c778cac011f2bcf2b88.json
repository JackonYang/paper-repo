An equally correct statement is that we present a tree-growing method whose performance can be analysed in the framework of Adaboost. We argue that Adaboost can be improved by presenting the input to a sequence of weak classifiers, each one tuned to the conditional probability determined by the output of previous weak classifiers. As a result, the final classifier has a tree structure, rather than being linear, thus the name \"Adatree\". One of the consequences of the tree structure is that different input data may have different processing time. Early experimentation shows a reduced computation cost with respect to Adaboost. One of our intended applications is real-time detection, where cascades of boosted detectors have recently become successful. The reduced computation cost of the proposed method shows some potential for being used directly in detection problems, without need of a cascade."

Boosting works by sequentially applying a classification algorithm to reweighted versions of the training data and then taking a weighted majority vote of the sequence of classifiers thus produced. For many classification algorithms, this simple strategy results in dramatic improvements in performance. We show that this seemingly mysterious phenomenon can be understood in terms of well-known statistical principles, namely additive modeling and maximum likelihood. For the two-class problem, boosting can be viewed as an approximation to additive modeling on the logistic scale using maximum Bernoulli likelihood as a criterion. We develop more direct approximations and show that they exhibit nearly identical results to boosting. Direct multiclass generalizations based on multinomial likelihood are derived that exhibit performance comparable to other recently proposed multiclass generalizations of boosting in most situations, and far superior in some. We suggest a minor modification to boosting that can reduce computation, often by factors of 10 to 50. Finally, we apply these insights to produce an alternative formulation of boosting decision trees. This approach, based on best-first truncated tree induction, often leads to better performance, and can provide interpretable descriptions of the aggregate decision rule. It is also much faster computationally, making it more suitable to large-scale data mining applications."

The discriminative random fields offer several advantages over the conventional Markov random field (MRF) framework. First, the DRFs allow to relax the strong assumption of conditional independence of the observed data generally used in the MRF framework for tractability. This assumption is too restrictive for a large number of applications in vision. Second, the DRFs derive their classification power by exploiting the probabilistic discriminative models instead of the generative models used in the MRF framework. Finally, all the parameters in the DRF model are estimated simultaneously from the training data unlike the MRF framework where likelihood parameters are usually learned separately from the field parameters. We illustrate the advantages of the DRFs over the MRF framework in an application of man-made structure detection in natural images taken from the Corel database."

The parsing algorithm optimizes the posterior probability and outputs a scene representation as a \u201cparsing graph\u201d, in a spirit similar to parsing sentences in speech and natural language. The algorithm constructs the parsing graph and re-configures it dynamically using a set of moves, which are mostly reversible Markov chain jumps. This computational framework integrates two popular inference approaches\u2014generative (top-down) methods and discriminative (bottom-up) methods. The former formulates the posterior probability in terms of generative models for images defined by likelihood functions and priors. The latter computes discriminative probabilities based on a sequence (cascade) of bottom-up tests/filters. In our Markov chain algorithm design, the posterior probability, defined by the generative models, is the invariant (target) probability for the Markov chain, and the discriminative probabilities are used to construct proposal probabilities to drive the Markov chain. Intuitively, the bottom-up discriminative probabilities activate top-down generative models. In this paper, we focus on two types of visual patterns\u2014generic visual patterns, such as texture and shading, and object patterns including human faces and text. These types of patterns compete and cooperate to explain the image and so image parsing unifies image segmentation, object detection, and recognition (if we use generic visual patterns only then image parsing will correspond to image segmentation (Tu and Zhu, 2002. IEEE Trans. PAMI, 24(5):657\u2013673). We illustrate our algorithm on natural images of complex city scenes and show examples where image segmentation can be improved by allowing object specific knowledge to disambiguate low-level segmentation cues, and conversely where object detection can be improved by using generic visual patterns to explain away shadows and occlusions."

We show that the multiplicative weight-update Littlestone?Warmuth rule can be adapted to this model, yielding bounds that are slightly weaker in some cases, but applicable to a considerably more general class of learning problems. We show how the resulting learning algorithm can be applied to a variety of problems, including gambling, multiple-outcome prediction, repeated games, and prediction of points in Rn. In the second part of the paper we apply the multiplicative weight-update technique to derive a new boosting algorithm. This boosting algorithm does not require any prior knowledge about the performance of the weak learning algorithm. We also study generalizations of the new boosting algorithm to the problem of learning functions whose range, rather than being binary, is an arbitrary finite set or a bounded segment of the real line."

Traditional approaches require applying a battery of different classifiers to the image, at multiple locations and scales. This can be slow and can require a lot of training data since each classifier requires the computation of many different image features. In particular, for independently trained detectors, the (runtime) computational complexity and the (training-time) sample complexity scale linearly with the number of classes to be detected. We present a multitask learning procedure, based on boosted decision stumps, that reduces the computational and sample complexity by finding common features that can be shared across the classes (and/or views). The detectors for each class are trained jointly, rather than independently. For a given performance level, the total number of features required and, therefore, the runtime cost of the classifier, is observed to scale approximately logarithmically with the number of classes. The features selected by joint training are generic edge-like features, whereas the features chosen by training each class separately tend to be more object-specific. The generic features generalize better and considerably reduce the computational cost of multiclass object detection"

The salient ones for separating particular shapes are determined by inductive learning during the construction of classification trees. There is a feature for every possible geometric arrangement of local topographic codes. The arrangements express coarse constraints on relative angles and distances among the code locations and are nearly invariant to substantial affine and nonlinear deformations. They are also partially ordered, which makes it possible to narrow the search for informative ones at each node of the tree. Different trees correspond to different aspects of shape. They are statistically and weakly dependent due to randomization and are aggregated in a simple way. Adapting the algorithm to a shape family is then fully automatic once training samples are provided. As an illustration, we classified handwritten digits from the NIST database; the error rate was 0.7 percent."

Objects are modeled as flexible constellations of parts. A probabilistic representation is used for all aspects of the object: shape, appearance, occlusion and relative scale. An entropy-based feature detector is used to select regions and their scale within the image. In learning the parameters of the scale-invariant object model are estimated. This is done using expectation-maximization in a maximum-likelihood setting. In recognition, this model is used in a Bayesian manner to classify images. The flexible nature of the model is demonstrated by excellent results over a range of datasets including geometrically constrained classes (e.g. faces, cars) and flexible objects (such as animals)."

This problem has received considerable attention in the areas of pattern recognition and machine learning, and many distinct methods have been proposed in literature. We make a comparative study of six well-known pruning methods with the aim of understanding their theoretical foundations, their computational complexity, and the strengths and weaknesses of their formulation. Comments on the characteristics of each method are empirically supported. In particular, a wide experimentation performed on several data sets leads us to opposite conclusions on the predictive accuracy of simplified trees from some drawn in the literature. We attribute this divergence to differences in experimental designs. Finally, we prove and make use of a property of the reduced error pruning method to obtain an objective evaluation of the tendency to overprune/underprune observed in each method."

Starting from training examples, we recursively find larger and larger arrangements which are \u201cdecomposable,\u201d which implies the probability of an arrangement appearing on an object decays slowly with its size. Detection means finding a sufficient number of arrangements of each size along a decreasing sequence of pose cells. At the beginning, the tests are simple and universal, accommodating many poses simultaneously, but the false alarm rate is relatively high. Eventually, the tests are more discriminating, but also more complex and dedicated to specific poses. As a result, the spatial distribution of processing is highly skewed and detection is rapid, but at the expense of (isolated) false alarms which, presumably, could be eliminated with localized, more intensive, processing."

It makes an attempt to provide one way of combining bottom-up and top-down approaches. In image segmentation, it generalizes the Swendsen-Wang cut algorithm (SWC) by Barbu and Zhu (2003) to make both 2-way and m-way cuts, and includes topology change processes (graph repartitioning and boundary diffusion). The method directly works at a low temperature without using annealing. We show that it is much faster than the DDMCMC approach (Tu and Zhu, 2002) and more robust than the SWC method. The results are demonstrated on the Berkeley data set. In perceptual grouping, it integrates discriminative model learning/computing, a belief propagation algorithm (BP) by Yedidia et al. (2000), and SWC into a three-layer computing framework. These methods are realized as different levels of approximation to an \"ideal\" generative model. We demonstrate the algorithm on the problem of human body configuration."

FloatBoost learning uses a backtrack mechanism after each iteration of AdaBoost learning to minimize the error rate directly, rather than minimizing an exponential function of the margin as in the traditional AdaBoost algorithms. A second contribution of the paper is a novel statistical model for learning best weak classifiers using a stagewise approximation of the posterior probability. These novel techniques lead to a classifier which requires fewer weak classifiers than AdaBoost yet achieves lower error rates in both training and testing, as demonstrated by extensive experiments. Applied to face detection, the FloatBoost learning method, together with a proposed detector pyramid architecture, leads to the first real-time multiview face detection system reported."

A large dataset comprising stereo image pairs of 50 uniform-colored toys under 36 azimuths, 9 elevations, and 6 lighting conditions was collected (for a total of 194,400 individual images). The objects were 10 instances of 5 generic categories: four-legged animals, human figures, airplanes, trucks, and cars. Five instances of each category were used for training, and the other five for testing. Low-resolution grayscale images of the objects with various amounts of variability and surrounding clutter were used for training and testing. Nearest neighbor methods, support vector machines, and convolutional networks, operating on raw pixels or on PCA-derived features were tested. Test error rates for unseen object instances placed on uniform backgrounds were around 13% for SVM and 7% for convolutional nets. On a segmentation/recognition task with highly cluttered images, SVM proved impractical, while convolutional nets yielded 16/7% error. A real-time version of the system was implemented that can detect and classify objects in natural scenes at around 10 frames per second."

Out of millions of face-sized windows in an input image, for example, only a few will typically contain a face. Viola and Jones recently proposed a cascade architecture for face detection which successfully addresses the rare event nature of the task. A central part of their method is a feature selection algorithm based on AdaBoost. We present a novel cascade learning algorithm based on forward feature selection which is two orders of magnitude faster than the Viola-Jones approach and yields classifiers of equivalent quality. This faster method could be used for more demanding classification tasks, such as on-line learning."

We point out that formulating a problem as Bayesian inference implies specifying a probability distribution on the ensemble of problem instances. This ensemble can be used for analyzing the expected complexity of algorithms and also the algorithm-independent limits of inference. We illustrate this problem by analyzing the complexity of tree search. In particular, we study the problem of road detection, as formulated by Geman and Jedynak (1996). We prove that the expected convergence is linear in the size of the road (the depth of the tree) even though the worst-case performance is exponential. We also put a bound on the constant of the convergence and place a bound on the error rates."

                "text": "Abstract This paper extends the face detection framework proposedby Viola and Jones 2001 to handle pro\ufb01le views and rotatedfaces. As in the work of Rowley et al 1998. and Schneider-man et al. 2000, we build different detectors for differentviews of the face. A decision tree is then trained to deter-mine the viewpoint class (such as right pro\ufb01le or rotated60 degrees) for a given window of the image being exam-ined. This is similar to the approach of Rowley et al. 1998.The appropriate detector for that viewpoint can then be runinstead of running all detectors on all windows. This tech-niqueyields goodresults and maintainsthe speed advantageof the Viola-Jones detector. 1. Introduction There are a number of techniques that can successfullydetect frontal upright faces in a wide variety of images[11, 7, 10, 12, 3, 6]. While the de\ufb01nition of \u201cfrontal\u201d and\u201cupright\u201dmayvaryfromsystem to system, the reality is thatmany natural images contain rotated or pro\ufb01le faces thatare not reliably detected. There are a small number of sys-tems which explicitly address non-frontal, or non-uprightface detection [8, 10, 2]. This paper describes progress to-ward a system which can detect faces regardless of posereliably and in real-time.This paperextendsthe frameworkproposedby Viola andJones [12]. This approach is selected because of its compu-tational ef\ufb01ciency and simplicity.One observation which is shared among all previous re-lated work is that a multi-view detector must be carefullyconstructed by combining a collection of detectors eachtrained for a single viewpoint. It appears that a monolithicapproach, where a single classi\ufb01er is trained to detect allposes of a face, is unlearnable with existing classi\ufb01ers. Ourinformal experiments lend support to this conclusion, sincea classi\ufb01er trained on all poses appears to be hopelessly in-accurate.This paper addresses two types of pose variation: non-frontal faces, which are rotated out of the image plane, andnon-upright faces, which are rotated in the image plane.In both cases the multi-view detector presented in this pa-per is a combination of Viola-Jones detectors, each detectortrained on face data taken from a single viewpoint.Reliable non-upright face detection was \ufb01rst presentedin a paper by Rowley, Baluja and Kanade [8]. They traintwo neural network classi\ufb01ers. The \ufb01rst estimates the poseof a face in the detection window. The second is a conven-tional face detector. Faces are detected in three steps: foreach image window the pose of \u201cface\u201d is \ufb01rst estimated; thepose estimate is then used to de-rotate the image window;the window is then classi\ufb01ed by the second detector. Fornon-face windows, the poses estimate must be consideredrandom. Nevertheless, a rotated non-faceshouldbe rejectedby the conventional detector. One potential \ufb02aw of such asystem is that the \ufb01nal detection rate is roughly the productof the correct classi\ufb01cation rates of the two classi\ufb01ers (sincethe errors of the two classi\ufb01ers are somewhat independent).One could adopt the Rowley et al. three step approachwhile replacingthe classi\ufb01ers with those of Viola andJones.The \ufb01nal system would be more ef\ufb01cient, but not signi\ufb01-cantly. Classi\ufb01cation by the Viola-Jones system is so ef\ufb01-cient, that derotation would dominate the computational ex-pense. In principle derotation is not strictly necessary sinceit should be possible to construct a detector for rotated facesdirectly. Detection becomes a two stage process. First thepose of the window is estimated and then one ofrotationspeci\ufb01c detectors is called upon to classify the window.In this paper detection of non-upright faces is handledusing the two stage approach. In the \ufb01rst stage the pose ofeach window is estimated using a decision tree constructedusing features like those described by Viola and Jones. Inthe second stage one ofpose speci\ufb01c Viola-Jones dete-tectors are used to classify the window.Oncepose speci\ufb01c detectors are trained and available,an alternative detection process can be tested as well. In thiscase alldetectors are evaluated and the union of their de-"

This principle consists of two parts. The first is the maximum entropy principle for feature binding (or fusion): for a given set of observed feature statistics, a distribution can be built to bind these feature statistics together by maximizing the entropy over all distributions that reproduce them. The second part is the minimum entropy principle for feature selection: among all plausible sets of feature statistics, we choose the set whose maximum entropy distribution has the minimum entropy. Computational and inferential issues in both parts are addressed; in particular, a feature pursuit procedure is proposed for approximately selecting the optimal set of features. The minimax entropy principle is then corrected by considering the sample variation in the observed feature statistics, and an information criterion for feature pursuit is derived. The minimax entropy principle is applied to texture modeling, where a novel Markov random field (MRF) model, called FRAME (filter, random field, and minimax entropy), is derived, and encouraging results are obtained in experiments on a variety of texture images. The relationship between our theory and the mechanisms of neural computation is also discussed."

However, the more challenging and important task of categorizing previously unseen objects remains largely unsolved. Traditionally, contour and shape based methods are regarded most adequate for handling the generalization requirements needed for this task. Appearance based methods, on the other hand, have been successful in object identification and detection scenarios. Today little work is done to systematically compare existing methods and characterize their relative capabilities for categorizing objects. In order to compare different methods we present a new database specifically tailored to the task of object categorization. It contains high-resolution color images of 80 objects from 8 different categories, for a total of 3280 images. It is used to analyze the performance of several appearance and contour based methods. The best categorization result is obtained by an appropriate combination of different methods."

The proposed system automatically synthesizes simple problem-specific feature extractors from a training set of face and nonface patterns, without making any assumptions or using any hand-made design concerning the features to extract or the areas of the face pattern to analyze. The face detection procedure acts like a pipeline of simple convolution and subsampling modules that treat the raw input image as a whole. We therefore show that an efficient face detection system does not require any costly local preprocessing before classification of image areas. The proposed scheme provides very high detection rate with a particularly low level of false positives, demonstrated on difficult test sets, without requiring the use of multiple networks for handling difficult cases. We present extensive experimental results illustrating the efficiency of the proposed approach on difficult test sets and including an in-depth sensitivity analysis with respect to the degrees of variability of the face patterns."

This algorithm sets up correspondence as an integer quadratic programming problem, where the cost function has terms based on similarity of corresponding geometric blur point descriptors as well as the geometric distortion between pairs of corresponding feature points. The algorithm handles outliers, and thus enables matching of exemplars to query images in the presence of occlusion and clutter. Given the correspondences, we estimate an aligning transform, typically a regularized thin plate spline, resulting in a dense correspondence between the two shapes. Object recognition is then handled in a nearest neighbor framework where the distance between exemplar and query is the matching cost between corresponding points. We show results on two datasets. One is the Caltech 101 dataset (Fei-Fei, Fergus and Perona), an extremely challenging dataset with large intraclass variation. Our approach yields a 48% correct classification rate, compared to Fei-Fei et al 's 16%. We also show results for localizing frontal and profile faces that are comparable to special purpose approaches tuned to faces."

A retinally connected neural network examines small windows of an image and decides whether each window contains a face. The system arbitrates between multiple networks to improve performance over a single network. We use a bootstrap algorithm for training the networks, which adds false detections into the training set as training progresses. This eliminates the difficult task of manually selecting non-face training examples, which must be chosen to span the entire space of non-face images. Comparisons with other state-of-the-art face detection systems are presented; our system has better performance in terms of detection and false-positive rates."
