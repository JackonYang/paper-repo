Because the images are not exact replicas, but rather noisy and perhaps geometrically distorted versions of the original scenes, it is necessary to develop a body of theory capable of providing answers to questions concerning effects of various types of error, and means for minimizing the effects of such errors. This paper presents a \"decision space\" approach to the problem for dealing with small amounts of noise and distortion, and a promising new technique for dealing with \"rubber sheet\" distortion."

Three classes of experiments are reported: 1) Gathering, analysis, and assessment of face-feature data for 255 faces. 2) Computer identification-studies. 3) Human identification-studies. A set of 22 features was evolved from an initially larger set to provide relevant, distinctive, relatively independent measures which can be judged reliably. Computer studies and a mathematical model established limits of performance of a person attempting to isolate a face from a population using feature descriptions. The model predicts that under certain conditions approximately 6 of an individual's features are required to isolate him from a population of 255. Human experiments under similar conditions showed unique identification occurred with an average of about 7 features. The model predicts that for a population of 4\u00d7106, only 14 feature-descriptions are required. These studies form a foundation for continuing research on real-time man-machine interaction for computer classification and identification of multidimensional vectors specified by noisy components."
