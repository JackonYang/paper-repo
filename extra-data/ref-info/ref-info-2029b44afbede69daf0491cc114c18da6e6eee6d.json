It is shown that this corresponds to fitting an axis in the Fourier domain of the n-dimensional neighborhood, the solution of which is a well known solution of a matrix eigenvalue problem. The eigenvalues are the variance or inertia with respect to the axes given by their respective eigen vectors. The orientation is taken as the axis given by the least eigenvalue. Moreover it is shown that the necessary computations can be pursued in the spatial domain without doing a Fourier transformation. An implementation for 2-D is presented. Two certainty measures are given corresponding to the orientation estimate. These are the relative or the absolute distances between the two eigenvalues, revealing whether the fitted axis is much better than an axis orthogonal to it. The result of the implementation is verified by experiments which confirm an accurate orientation estimation and reliable certainty measure in the presence of additive noise at high level as well as low levels."

An empirical evaluation method is applied to two texture measurement systems, co-occurrence statistics and augmented correlation statistics. A spatial-statistical class of texture measures is then defined and evaluated. It leads to a simple class of texture energy transforms, which perform better than any of the preceding methods. These transforms are very fast, and can be made invariant to changes in luminance, contrast, and rotation without histogram equalization or other preprocessing. Texture energy is measured by filtering with small masks, typically 5x5, then with a moving-window average of the absolute image values. This method, similar to human visual processing, is appropriate for textures with short coherence length or correlation distance. The filter masks are integer-valued and separable, and can be implemented with one-dimensional or 3x3 convolutions. The averaging operation is also very fast, with computing time independent of window size. Texture energy planes may be linearly combined to form a smaller number of discriminant planes. These principal component planes seem to represent natural texture dimensions, and to be more reliable texture measures than the texture energy planes. Texture segmentation or classification may be accomplished using either texture energy or principal component planes as input. This study classified 15x15 blocks of eight natural textures. Accuracies of 72% were achieved with co- occurrence statistics, 65% with augmented correlation statistics, and 94% with texture energy statistics."

It is shown that textures and fully textured images can be practically decomposed into, and synthesized from, a finite set of EFs. Textured-images can be synthesized from a set of EFs using an image coefficient library. Alternatively, texturing of contoured (cartoonlike) images is analogous to adding chromaticity information to contoured images. A method for texture discrimination and image segmentation using local features based on the Gabor approach is introduced. Features related to the EF's parameters provide efficient means for texture discrimination and classification. This method is invariant under rotation and translation. The performance of the classification appears to be robust with respect to noisy conditions. The results show the insensitivity of the discrimination to relatively high noise levels, comparable to the performances of the human observer.<<ETX>>"

Local texture properties are extracted using local linear transforms that have been optimized for maximal texture discrimination. Local statistics (texture energy measures) are estimated at the output of an equivalent filter bank by means of a nonlinear transformation (absolute value) followed by an iterative Gaussian smoothing algorithm. This procedure generates a multiresolution sequence of feature planes with a half-octave scale progression. A feature reduction technique is then applied to the data and is determined by simultaneously diagonalizing scatter matrices evaluated at two different spatial resolutions. This approach provides a good approximation of R.A. Fisher's (1950) multiple linear discriminants and has the advantage of requiring no a priori knowledge.

A second constraint is needed. A method for finding the optical flow pattern is presented which assumes that the apparent velocity of the brightness pattern varies smoothly almost everywhere in the image. An iterative implementation is shown which successfully computes the optical flow for a number of synthetic image sequences. The algorithm is robust in that it can handle image sequences that are quantized rather coarsely in space and time. It is also insensitive to quantization of brightness levels and additive noise. Examples are included where the assumption of smoothness is violated at singular points or along lines in the image."

Most research for establishing correspondence uses only two frames of a sequence to solve this problem. By using a sequence of frames, it is possible to exploit the fact that due to inertia the motion of an object cannot change instantaneously. By using smoothness of motion, it is possible to solve the correspondence problem for arbitrary motion of several nonrigid objects in a scene. We formulate the correspondence problem as an optimization problem and propose an iterative algorithm to find trajectories of points in a monocular image sequence. A modified form of this algorithm is useful in case of occlusion also. We demonstrate the efficacy of this approach considering synthetic, laboratory, and real scenes."

Most of these efforts have gone into improving the speed and the accuracy of correlation matching algorithms. Yet, the displacement fields produced by these algorithms are often incorrect in homogeneous areas of the image and in areas which are visible in one frame, but are occluded in the succeeding frames. Further, these displacement fields are often incorrect even at non-occluded areas that border occlusion boundaries. In this paper, we present a confidence measure which indicates the reliability of each displacement vector computed by a specific hierarchical correlation matching algorithm. We also provide an improved hierarchical matching algorithm which performs particularly well near occlusion boundaries. We demonstrate these with experiments performed on real image sequences taken in our robotics labaratory. A more detailed version of this work appears in (Anan84)."

Based on dynamics, a locally constant angular momentum (LCAM) model is introduced. The model is local in the sense that it is applied to a limited number of image frames at a time. Specifically, the model constrains the motion, over a local frame subsequence, to be a superposition of precession and translation. Thus, the instantaneous rotation axis of the object is allowed to change through the subsequence. The trajectory of the rotation center is approximated by a vector polynomial. The parameters of the model evolve in time so that they can adapt to long term changes in motion characteristics. The nature and parameters of short term motion can be estimated continuously with the goal of understanding motion through the image sequence. The estimation algorithm presented in this paper is linear, i.e., the algorithm consists of solving simultaneous linear equations. Based on the assumption that the motion is smooth, object positions and motion in the near future can be predicted, and short missing subsequences can be recovered. Noise smoothing is achieved by overdetermination and a leastsquares criterion. The framework is flexible in the sense that it allows both overdetermination in number of feature points and the number of image frames."

Fast relaxation algorithms can be used to integrate sparse data, resolve ambiguities in optic flow fields, and guide stereo matching algorithms. In the present paper, an alternative to multigrid relaxation which is much easier to implement is presented. This approach uses conjugate-gradient descent in conjunction with a hierarchical (multiresolution) set of basis functions. The resulting algorithm uses a pyramid to smooth the residual vector before the new direction is computed. Simulation results show the speed and its dependence on the choice of interpolator, the number of smoothing levels, and other factors. Also discussed is relationship of this approach to other multiresolution relaxation and representation schemes.<<ETX>>"

The author has analyzed the computations performed in the course of visual motion analysis. Workable schemes able to perform certain tasks performed by the visual system have been constructed and used as vehicles for investigating the problems faced by the visual system and its methods for solving them.Two major problems are treated: first, the correspondence problem, which concerns the identification of image elements that represent the same object at different times, thereby maintaining the perceptual identity of the object in motion or in change. The second problem is the three-dimensional interpretation of the changing image once a correspondence has been established.The author's computational approach to visual theory makes the work unique, and it should be of interest to psychologists working in visual perception and readers interested in cognitive studies in general, as well as computer scientists interested in machine vision, theoretical neurophysiologists, and philosophers of science."

This paper describes some easily computable textural features based on gray-tone spatial dependancies, and illustrates their application in category-identification tasks of three different kinds of image data: photomicrographs of five kinds of sandstones, 1:20 000 panchromatic aerial photographs of eight land-use categories, and Earth Resources Technology Satellite (ERTS) multispecial imagery containing seven land-use categories. We use two kinds of decision rules: one for which the decision regions are convex polyhedra (a piecewise linear decision rule), and one for which the decision regions are rectangular parallelpipeds (a min-max decision rule). In each experiment the data set was divided into two parts, a training set and a test set. Test set identification accuracy is 89 percent for the photomicrographs, 82 percent for the aerial photographic imagery, and 83 percent for the satellite imagery. These results indicate that the easily computable textural features probably have a general applicability for a wide variety of image-classification applications."

A fundamental theorem is established to relate such moment invariants to the well-known algebraic invariants. Complete systems of moment invariants under translation, similitude and orthogonal transformations are derived. Some moment invariants under general two-dimensional linear transformations are also included. Both theoretical formulation and practical models of visual pattern recognition based upon these moment invariants are discussed. A simple simulation program together with its performance are also presented. It is shown that recognition of geometrical patterns and alphabetical characters independently of position, size and orientation can be accomplished. It is also indicated that generalization is possible to include invariance with parallel projection."

A hierarchical parallel-processing scheme is used in which nodes compute a weighted sum of inputs from within a small spatio-temporal neighborhood. The resulting scheme is easily analyzed and provides mechanisms sensitive to narrow ranges of both image velocity and orientation. The hierarchical approach in combination with separability in the first levels yields an efficient implementation. >"

The model exploits constraints provided by human psychophysics, notably that motion-sensing elements appear tuned for two-dimensional spatial frequency, and by the frequency spectrum of a moving image, namely, that its support lies in the plane in which the temporal frequency equals the dot product of the spatial frequency and the image velocity. The first stage of the model is a set of spatial-frequency-tuned, direction-selective linear sensors. The temporal frequency of the response of each sensor is shown to encode the component of the image velocity in the sensor direction. At the second stage, these components are resolved in order to measure the velocity of image motion at each of a number of spatial locations and spatial frequencies. The model has been applied to several illustrative examples, including apparent motion, coherent gratings, and natural image sequences. The model agrees qualitatively with human perception."

Pixel gray levels and the presence and orientation of edges are viewed as states of atoms or molecules in a lattice-like physical system. The assignment of an energy function in the physical system determines its Gibbs distribution. Because of the Gibbs distribution, Markov random field (MRF) equivalence, this assignment also determines an MRF image model. The energy function is a more convenient and natural mechanism for embodying picture attributes than are the local characteristics of the MRF. For a range of degradation mechanisms, including blurring, nonlinear deformations, and multiplicative or additive noise, the posterior distribution is an MRF with a structure akin to the image model. By the analogy, the posterior distribution defines another (imaginary) physical system. Gradual temperature reduction in the physical system isolates low energy states (``annealing''), or what is the same thing, the most probable states under the Gibbs distribution. The analogous operation under the posterior distribution yields the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the image given the degraded observations. The result is a highly parallel ``relaxation'' algorithm for MAP estimation. We establish convergence properties of the algorithm and we experiment with some simple pictures, for which good restorations are obtained at low signal-to-noise ratios."

The matching uses the standard paradigm of hypothesis prediction and testing and exploits the constraint that objects and environment are rigid.

These properties concern the relationship between the organizational principle of a two-dimensional anisotropic spatial filter or neural receptive field (such as elongation, or concatenation of subunits, or differential operators mediated by lateral inhibition in neural laminae) and the resulting general consequences for spatial frequency and orientation selectivity. These properties are demonstrated without assuming particular two-dimensional filter functional forms; rather, they are shown as general principles associated with certain broad categories of two-dimensional filters. Such an analysis enhance theoretical understanding of the two-dimensional receptive field organization of neurons in the visual cortex and permits the rejection of some candidate organizational principles on two-dimensional spectral grounds."

In a scheme due to Gabor, an image is represented in terms of localized symmetrical and antisymmetrical elementary signals. Both measured receptive fields and measured spatial frequency tuning curves conform closely to the functional form of Gabor elementary signals. It is argued that the visual cortex representation corresponds closely to the Gabor scheme owing to its advantages in treating the subsequent problem of pattern recognition."

The DOLP is a reversible transform which converts an image into a set of bandpass images. A DOLP transform is shown to require O(N2) multiplies and produce O(N log(N)) samples from an N sample image. When Gaussian low-pass filters are used, the result is a set of images which have been convolved with difference of Gaussian (DOG) filters from an exponential set of sizes. A fast computation technique based on ``resampling'' is described and shown to reduce the DOLP transform complexity to O(N log(N)) multiplies and O(N) storage locations. A second technique, ``cascaded convolution with expansion,'' is then defined and also shown to reduce the computational cost to O(N log(N)) multiplies. Combining these two techniques yields an algorithm for a DOLP transform that requires O(N) storage cells and requires O(N) multiplies."

Because there is a family of physical motions of various directions and speeds that appear identical, the motion of the grating is ambiguous. In contrast, when two crossed moving gratings are superimposed, the resulting plaid pattern usually moves unambiguously and predictably. In certain cases, however, two gratings do not combine into a single coherent percept, but appear to slide across one another. We have studied the conditions under which coherence does and does not occur, and we report here that it depends on the relative contrasts, spatial frequencies and directions of motion of the gratings. These effects may reveal the previously unstudied properties of a higher order stage of motion analysis."

Patterns of alternating light and dark bars with a sinusoidal luminance profile across the bars\u2014sinusoidal gratings\u2014are commonly used to study spatial interactions in the visual system.

                "text": "In the central nervous system the visual pathway from retina to striate cortex provides an opportunity to observe and compare single unit responses at several distinct levels. Patterns of light stimuli most effective in influencing units at one level may no longer be the most effective at the next. From differences in responses at successive stages in the pathway one may hope to gain some understanding of the part each stage plays in visual perception. By shining small spots of light on the light-adapted cat retina Kuffler (1953) showed that ganglion cells have concentric receptive fields, with an 'on' centre and an 'off ' periphery, or vice versa. The 'on' and 'off' areas within a receptive field were found to be mutually antagonistic, and a spot restricted to the centre of the field was more effective than one covering the whole receptive field (Barlow, FitzHugh & Kuffler, 1957). In the freely moving lightadapted cat it was found that the great majority of cortical cells studied gave little or no response to light stimuli covering most of the animal's visual field, whereas small spots shone in a restricted retinal region often evoked brisk responses (Hubel, 1959). A moving spot of light often produced stronger responses than a stationary one, and sometimes a moving spot gave more activation for one direction than for the opposite. The present investigation, made in acute preparations, includes a study of receptive fields of cells in the cat's striate cortex. Receptive fields of the cells considered in this paper were divided into separate excitatory and inhibitory ('on' and 'off') areas. In this respect they resembled retinal ganglion-cell receptive fields. However, the shape and arrangement of excitatory and inhibitory areas differed strikingly from the concentric pattern found in retinal ganglion cells. An attempt was made to correlate responses to moving stimuli"

                "text": "1. We have examined the spatial and temporal tuning properties of 238 cortical neurones, recorded using conventional techniques from acutely prepared anaesthetized cats. We determined spatial and temporal frequency tuning curves using sinusoidal grating stimuli presented to each neurone's receptive field by a digital computer on a cathode ray tube. 2. We measured tuning curves either by determining response amplitude as a function of spatial or temporal frequency, or by measuring contrast sensitivity (the inverse of the contrast of the grating that just elicited a detectable response). The two measures give very similar tuning curves in all cases. 3. We recorded from 184 neurones in area 17; of these 156 had receptive fields within 5 degrees of the area centralis. The range of preferred spatial frequency for these neurones was 0.3\u2010\u20103 c/deg, and their spatial frequency tuning band widths varied from 0.7 to 3.2 octaves at half\u2010amplitude. The most common band width was roughly 1.3 octaves. Simple and complex cells in area 17 did not differ in their distributions of preferred spatial frequency, although complex cells were, on average, slightly less selective for spatial frequency than simple cells. 4. We recorded from fifty\u2010four neurones from area 18, and performed several experiments in which we recorded from corresponding portions of both area 17 and area 18 in the same electrode penetration. Neurones in area 18 preferred spatial frequencies that were, on average, one third as high as those preferred by area 17 neurones at the same retinal eccentricity. Thus the range of preferred spatial frequency in area eighteen cells having receptive fields within 5 deg of the area centralis was between less than 0.1 and 0.5 c/deg. The distributions of optimum spatial frequency in the two areas were practically non\u2010overlapping at eccentricities as high as 15 deg, the greatest eccentricity we examined. Neurones in area 18 were about as selective for spatial frequency as were neurones in area 17. 5. We determined temporal frequency tuning characteristics for some neurones from each area, using gratings that moved steadily across the screen. Neurones from area 17 all responded well to low temporal frequencies, and less well to higher frequencies (in excess of, usually, 2 or 4 Hz). In contrast, neurones recorded from area 18 sometimes had similar tuning properties, but more commonly showed a pronounced reduction in response as the temporal frequency was moved either above or below some optimum value (usually 2\u2010\u20108 Hz). 6. We conclude from these results that areas 17 and 18 act in parallel to process different aspects of the visual information relayed from the retina via the lateral geniculate complex. Some or all of the differences between the areas may be attributable to the predominance of Y cell input to area 18 and the predominance of X cell input to area 17..."

Although significant advances have been made in the finite element method since this book first appeared in 1984, the basics have remained the same, and this classic, well-written text explains these basics and prepares the reader for more advanced study. Useful as both a reference and a textbook, complete with examples and exercies, it remains as relevant today as it was when originally published. This book is written for advanced undergraduate and graduate students in the areas of numerical analysis, mathematics, and computer science, as well as for theoretically inclined practitioners in engineering and the physical science."
