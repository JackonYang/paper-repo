Central to our approach is the Maximum Entropy (ME) Principle, allowing us to combine evidence from multiple sources, such as long-distance triggers and conventional short-distance trigrams. Given consistent statistical evidence, a unique ME solution is guaranteed to exist, and an iterative algorithm exists which is guaranteed to converge to it. Among the advantages of this approach are its simplicity, its generality, and its incremental nature. Among its disadvantages are its computational requirements. We describe a succession of ME models, culminating in our current Maximum Likelihood/Maximum Entropy (ML/ME) model. Preliminary results with the latter show a 27% perplexity reduction as compared to a conventional trigram model."

In practice, we have found that maximum entropy models offer the following advantages: \nState-of-the-art accuracy. The probability models for all of the tasks discussed perform at or near state-of-the-art accuracies, or outperform competing learning algorithms when trained and tested under similar conditions. Methods which outperform those presented here require much more supervision in the form of additional human involvement or additional supporting resources. \nKnowledge-poor features. The facts used to model the data, or features, are linguistically very simple, or \"knowledge-poor\", but yet succeed in approximating complex linguistic relationships. \nReusable software technology. The mathematics of the maximum entropy framework are essentially independent of any particular task, and a single software implementation can be used for all of the probability models in this thesis. \nThe experiments in this thesis suggest that experimenters can obtain state-of-the-art accuracies on a wide range of natural language tasks, with little task-specific effort, by using maximum entropy probability models."

To extract information from the document history, trigger pairs are used as the basic information-bearing elements. To combine statistical evidence from multiple triggers, the principle of maximum entropy (ME) is used. To combine the trigger-based model with the static model, the latter is absorbed into the ME formalism. Given consistent statistical evidence, a unique ME solution is guaranteed to exist, and an iterative algorithm exists which is guaranteed to converge to it. Among the advantages of this approach are its simplicity, generality, and incremental nature. Among its disadvantages are its computational requirements. The model described here was trained on five million words of Wall Street Journal text. It used some 40000 unigram constraints, 200000 bigram constraints, 200000 trigram constraints, and 60000 trigger constraints. After 13 iterations, it produced a language model whose perplexity was 12% lower than that of a conventional trigram, as measured on independent data.<<ETX>>"

The task of these distributions is to predict the probability of a new word by looking at M or even all predecessor words. The conventional approach is to limit M to 1 or 2 and to interpolate the resulting bigram and trigram models with a unigram model in a linear fashion. However, there are many other structures that can be used to model the probabilistic dependences between the predecessor word and the word to be predicted. The structures considered in this paper are: nonlinear interpolation as an alternative to linear interpolation; equivalence classes for word histories and single words; cache memory and word associations. For the optimal estimation of nonlinear and linear interpolation parameters, the leaving-one-out method is systematically used. For the determination of word equivalence classes in a bigram model, an automatic clustering procedure has been adapted. To capture long-distance dependences, we consider various models for word-by-word dependences; the cache model may be viewed as a special type of self-association. Experimental results are presented for two text databases, a Germany database and an English database."

The learning paradigm builds increasingly complex fields by allowing potential functions, or features, that are supported by increasingly large subgraphs. Each feature has a weight that is trained by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the model and the empirical distribution of the training data. A greedy algorithm determines how features are incrementally added to the field and an iterative scaling algorithm is used to estimate the optimal values of the weights. The random field models and techniques introduced in this paper differ from those common to much of the computer vision literature in that the underlying random fields are non-Markovian and have a large number of parameters that must be estimated. Relations to other learning approaches, including decision trees, are given. As a demonstration of the method, we describe its application to the problem of automatic word classification in natural language processing."

While previous work assumed the effects of word co-occurrence statistics to be constant over a window of several hundred words, we show that their influence is nonstationary on a much smaller time scale. Empirical data drawn from English and Japanese text, as well as conversational speech, reveals that the \"attraction\" between words decays exponentially, while stylistic and syntactic contraints create a \"repulsion\" between words that discourages close co-occurrence. We show that these characteristics are well described by simple mixture models based on two-stage exponential distributions which can be trained using the EM algorithm. The resulting distance distributions can then be incorporated as penalizing features in an exponential language model."

                "text": "The trigram statistical language model is remarkably successful when used in such applications as speech recognition. However, the trigram model is static in that it only considers the previous two words when making a prediction about a future word. The work presented here attempts to improve upon the trigram model by considering additional contextual and longer distance information. This is frequently referred to in the literature as adaptive statistical language modelling because the model is thought of as adapting to the longer term information. This work considers the creation of topic specific models, statistical evidence from the presence or absence of triggers, or related words, in the document history (document triggers) and in the current sentence (in-sentence triggers), and the incorporation of the document cache, which predicts the probability of a word by considering its frequency in the document history. An important result of this work is that the presence of self-triggers, that is, whether or not the word itself occurred in the document history, is an extremely important piece of information. A maximum entropy (ME) approach will be used in many instances to incorporate information from different sources. Maximum entropy considers a model which maximizes entropy while satisfying the constraints presented by the information we wish to incorporate. The generalized iterative scaling (GIS) algorithm can be used to compute the maximum entropy solution. This work also considers various methods of smoothing the information in a maximum entropy model. An inportant result is that smoothing improves performance noticibly and that Good-Turing discounting is an effective method of smoothing.

While perplexities can be calculated efficiently and without access to a speech recognizer, they often do not correlate well with speech recognition word-error rates. In this research, we attempt to find a measure that like perplexity is easily calculated but which better predicts speech recognition performance. We investigate two approaches; first, we attempt to extend perplexity by using similar measures that utilize information about language models that perplexity ignores. Second, we attempt to imitate the word-error calculation without using a speech recognizer by artificially generating speech recognition lattices. To test our new metrics, we have built over thirty varied language models. We find that perplexity correlates with word-error rate remarkably well when only considering n-gram models trained on in-domain data. When considering other types of models, our novel metrics are superior to perplexity for predicting speech recognition performance. However, we conclude that none of these measures predict word-error rate sufficiently accurately to be effective tools for language model evaluation in speech recognition."

The probability scores are the novel contribution of this work. Probabilities are based on a noisy channel model. It is assumed that the typist knows what words he or she wants to type but some noise is added on the way to the keyboard (in the form of typos and spelling errors). Using a classic Bayesian argument of the kind that is popular in the speech recognition literature (Jelinek, 1985), one can often recover the intended correction, c, from a typo, t, by finding the correction c that maximizes Pr(c) Pr(t/c). The first factor, Pr(c), is a prior model of word probabilities; the second factor, Pr(t/c), is a model of the noisy channel that accounts for spelling transformations on letter sequences (e.g., insertions, delections, substitutions and reversals). Both sets of probabilities were trained on data collected from the Associated Press (AP) newswire. This text is ideally suited for this purpose since it contains a large number of typos (about two thousand per month)."

Increasing the corpus size often leads to better-performing language models, but no matter how large, the corpus is a static entity, unable to reflect information about events which postdate it. We introduce an online paradigm which interleaves the estimation and application of a language model. We present a Bayesian approach to online language modelling, in which the marginal probabilities of a static trigram model are dynamically updated to match the topic being dictated to the system. We also describe the architecture of a prototype we have implemented which uses the World Wide Web (WWW) as a source of information, and provide results from some initial proof of concept experiments."
