This paper discusses how to estimate the likelihood of co-occurrences that do not occur in the training data. We present a method that makes local analogies between each specific unobserved co-occurrence and other co-occurrences that contain similar words. These analogies are based on the assumption that similar word co-occurrences have similar values of mutual information. Accordingly, the word similarity metric captures similarities between vectors of mutual information values. Our evaluation suggests that this method performs better than existing, frequency-based, smoothing methods, and may provide an alternative to class-based models. A background survey is included, covering issues of lexical co-occurrence, data sparseness and smoothing, word similarity and clustering, and mutual information."

The characteristics of SLTAG are unique and novel since it is lexieally sensitive (as N-gram models or Hidden Markov Models) and yet hierarchical (as stochastic context-free grammars).Then, two basic algorithms for SLTAG arc introduced: an algorithm for computing the probability of a sentence generated by a SLTAG and an inside-outside-like iterative algorithm for estimating the parameters of a SLTAG given a training corpus.Finally, we should how SLTAG enables to define a lexicalized version of stochastic context-free grammars and we report preliminary experiments showing some of the advantages of SLTAG over stochastic context-free grammars."

Special field competences are field-specific knowledge, skills, and attitudes necessary for effective and productive conduct of teaching profession. The aim of the present article is to compare the opinions of Geography Education Department, and Geography Department students regarding the field knowledge, one of the special field competences of geography teaching. The study was based on survey method aimed to reveal an existing situation. However, face-to-face interviews were conducted with 20 students from the Faculty of Education in order to find the origin of results. The study was performed in the spring semester of 2014-2015 academic year with a total of 160 students from 3rd, 4th, and 5th grades of Geography Education Department and 3rd and 4th grades of Geography Department. Significant differences between the opinions of students were compared by ChiSquare analysis by their educational programs. The expressions of Faculty of Education students suggested that they were competent in 7 out of 13 fields, creating a significant difference. There was no significant difference in the opinions of Geography Department students regarding the geography field competences."
