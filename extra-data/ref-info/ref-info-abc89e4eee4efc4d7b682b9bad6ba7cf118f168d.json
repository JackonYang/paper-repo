                "text": "Many approaches have reported that knowledge-based layout recognition methods are very successful in classifying the meaningful data from document images automatically. However, these approaches are applicable to only the same kind of documents because they are based on the paradigm that specifies the structure definition information in advance so as to be able to analyze a particular class of documents intelligently. In this paper, the authors propose a method to recognize the layout structures of multi-kinds of table-form document images. For this purpose, the authors introduce a classification tree to manage the relationships among different classes of layout structures. The authors' recognition system has two modes: layout knowledge acquisition and layout structure recognition. In the layout knowledge acquisition mode, table-form document images are distinguished according to this. Classification tree and then the structure description trees which specify the logical structures of table-form documents are generated automatically. While, in the layout structure recognition mode, individual item fields in the table-form document images are extracted and classified successfully by searching the classification tree and interpreting the structure description tree. >"

Connected pattern components are extracted, and spatial interrelations between components are measured and grouped into meaningful character patterns. Stroke shapes are analyzed and a method of finding the touching positions that separates about 95% of connected numerals correctly is described. Ambiguities are handled by multiple hypotheses and verification by recognition. An extended form of pattern-oriented segmentation, tabular form recognition, is considered. Images of tabular forms are analyzed, and frames in the tabular structure are extracted. By identifying semantic relationships between label frames and data frames, information on the form can be properly recognized. >"

Nodes in the ARG represent the global image features, while the relations between those features are represented by attributed branches between their corresponding nodes. The extraction of ARG representation from images is achieved by a multilayer graph transducer scheme. This scheme is basically a rule-based system that uses a combination of model-driven and data-driven concepts in performing a hierarchical symbolic mapping of the image information content from the spatial-domain representation into a global representation. Further analysis and inter-pretation of the imagery data is performed on the extracted ARG representation. A distance measure between images is defined in terms of the distance between their respective ARG representations. The distance between two ARG's and the inexact matching of their respective components are calculated by an efficient dynamic programming technique. The system handles noise, distortion, and ambiguity in real-world images by two means, namely, through modeling and embedding them into the transducer's mapping rules, as well as through the appropriate cost of error-transformation for the inexact matching of the ARG image representation. Two illustrative experiments are presented to demonstrate some capabilities of the proposed system. Experiment I deals with locating objects in multiobject scenes, while Experiment II is concerned with target detection in SAR images."

A great deal of time, effort and money will be saved if they can be entered into the computer and processed automatically. According to the specific characteristics of financial documents, it can be concluded that it is possible to build a system for recognizing specific types of financial documents, instead of a complex and general one aiming at different kinds of documents. In this paper, a financial document recognition prototype system which can process bank cheques, payment slips and bills, is presented. It consists of four major parts: (a) document image acquisition including scanning and binarization, (b) fixed document processing subsystem based on the detection of staff lines, (c) flexible document processing subsystem operating in a form description language (FDL), and (d) character recognition. Numerous experimental results are presented and discussed. >"

In the learning phase, the operator performs a set of inspection operations on the image of the prototype piece, while in the test phase the system processes the image of a piece that belongs to the class considered in the learning phase. For this purpose, the position of the test piece has to be determined. The authors represent the prototype and test pieces by attributed relational graphs (ARG) in which the nodes describe closed contours while the arcs represent their mutual relationships. Positioning is obtained by means of a graph matching technique based on a hypothesize and verify cycle. The authors use a hierarchical approach for graph matching; first they look for node correspondences (operating on a contour matching level), then they find the graph match by hypothesizing an arc correspondence and evaluating its consequences on the whole graph.<<ETX>>"

This paper describes the document spectrum (or docstrum), which is a method for structural page layout analysis based on bottom-up, nearest-neighbor clustering of page components. The method yields an accurate measure of skew, within-line, and between-line spacings and locates text lines and text blocks. It is advantageous over many other methods in three main ways: independence from skew angle, independence from different text spacings, and the ability to process local regions of different text orientations within the same image. Results of the method shown for several different page formats and for randomly oriented subpages on the same image illustrate the versatility of the method. We also discuss the differences, advantages, and disadvantages of the docstrum with respect to other lay-out methods. >"

To remove this bottleneck, new document processing techniques must be introduced to automatically acquire knowledge from various types of documents. By presenting a survey on the techniques and problems involved, this paper aims at serving as a catalyst to stimulate research in automatic knowledge acquisition through document processing. In this study, a document is considered to have two structures: geometric structure and logical structure. These play a key role in the process of the knowledge acquisition, which can be viewed as a process of acquiring the above structures. Extracting the geometric structure from a document refers to document analysis; mapping the geometric structure into logical structure is regarded as document understanding. Both areas are described in this paper, and the basic concept of document structure and its measurement based on entropy analysis is introduced. Logical structure and geometric models are proposed. Both top-down and bottom-up approaches and their entropy analyses are presented. Different techniques are discussed with practical examples. Mapping methods, such as tree transformation, document formatting knowledge and document format description language, are described. >"

Examples of this ubiquitous problem in computer vision arise in tasks involving hand-eye coordination (such as assembling or sorting), inspection tasks, gauging operations, and in navigation and localization of mobile robots. This book describes an extended series of experiments into the role of geometry in the critical area of object recognition. It provides precise definitions of the recognition and localization problems, describes the methods used to address them, analyzes the solutions to these problems, and addresses the implications of this analysis.The solution to problems of object recognition are of fundamental importance in many real applications and versions of the techniques described here are already being used in industrial settings. Although a number of questions remain to be solved, the authors provide a valuable framework for understanding both the strengths and limitations of using object shape to guide recognition.W. Eric L.

                "text": "Many document image understanding problems require a more comprehensive examination of document features than is typically deemed necessary for recognition tasks. We believe that these problems require a detailed analysis of stroke and sub-stroke features in the document image with the goal of obtaining information about the environment or process which created the document and establishing a context for understanding. \nWe introduce the concept of recovery into the document domain. We provide a \"stroke platform\" representation which establishes a verifiable \"link to the pixels\" and demonstrate its usefulness for recovery tasks. This representation allows us to overcome many of the problems associated with the rapid, irreversible abstraction associated with traditional document processing methods and provides the basic framework for our analysis of handwritten documents. By obtaining a detailed description of the document and its properties, we are able to establish a context for analysis and validate assumptions about the domain. This dissertation presents our work on several document image understanding problems: (1) demonstrating the successful use of the stroke platform for the problem of interpreting and reconstructing junctions and endpoints, (2) exploring the effects of the handwriting process on the document by the development of a model for instrument grasp and a study of its effects on pressure features, (3) posing and providing an approach to the problem of recovering temporal information from static images of handwriting, (4) addressing various sub-tasks of the problem of processing form documents, and (5) extending the detailed analysis philosophy to demonstrate its feasibility in related document domains."

Because the Hough transform is computationally expensive, the amount of data within a document image is reduced through the computation of its horizontal and vertical black runlengths. Histograms of these runlengths are used to determine whether the document is in portrait or landscape orientation. A gray scale burst image is created from the black runlengths that are perpendicular to the text lines by placing the length of the run in the run's bottom-most pixel. By creating a burst image from the original document image, the processing time of the Hough transform can be reduced by a factor of as much as 7.4 for documents with gray-scale images. Because only small runlengths are input to the Hough transform and because the accumulator array is incremented by the runlength associated with a pixel rather than by a factor of 1, the negative effects of noise, black margins, and figures are avoided. Consequently, interline spacing can be determined more accurately.<<ETX>>"

Recognizing these objects facilitates the recognition of document classes. Some promising results have been achieved by using autoassociator-based artificial neural networks (AANN) in the presence of homogeneously distributed noise. However, the performance drops significantly when dealing with spot-noisy logos, where strips or blobs produce a partial obstruction of the pictures. We propose a new approach for training AANNs especially conceived for dealing with spot noise. The basic idea is to introduce new metrics for assessing the reproduction error in AANNs. The proposed algorithm, referred to as spot-backpropagation (S-BP), is significantly more robust with respect to spot-noise than classical Euclidean norm-based backpropagation (BP). Our experimental results are based on a database of 88 real logos that are artificially corrupted by spot-noise."

Establishing the essential properties of such models, such as completeness (expressive power) and calibration (closeness of fit to actual image populations) remain open research problems. Work-in-progress towards a parameterized model of local imaging defects is described, together with a variety of motivating theoretical arguments and empirical evidence. A pseudo-random image generator implementing the model has been built. Applications of the generator are described, including a polyfont classifier for ASCII and a single-font classifier for a large alphabet (Tibetan U-Chen), both of which which were constructed with a minimum of manual effort. Image defect models and their associated generators permit a new kind of image database which is explicitly parameterized and indefinitely extensible, alleviating some drawbacks of existing databases."

First, a general principle of time-normalization is given using time-warping function. Then, two time-normalized distance definitions, called symmetric and asymmetric forms, are derived from the principle. These two forms are compared with each other through theoretical discussions and experimental studies. The symmetric form algorithm superiority is established. A new technique, called slope constraint, is successfully introduced, in which the warping function slope is restricted so as to improve discrimination between words in different categories. The effective slope constraint characteristic is qualitatively analyzed, and the optimum slope constraint condition is determined through experiments. The optimized algorithm is then extensively subjected to experimental comparison with various DP-algorithms, previously applied to spoken word recognition by different research groups. The experiment shows that the present algorithm gives no more than about two-thirds errors, even compared to the best conventional algorithm."

This approach has been successfully applied to the recognition of handwritten zip code digits provided by the U.S. Postal Service. A single network learns the entire recognition operation, going from the normalized image of the character to the final classification."

The proposed approach allows us to recognize such items also in the presence of high noise, scaling, and rotation. This is accomplished by a hybrid model which performs graphic item location by morphological operations and connected component analysis, and item recognition by a proper connectionist model. Some very promising experimental results are reported to support the proposed algorithms."
