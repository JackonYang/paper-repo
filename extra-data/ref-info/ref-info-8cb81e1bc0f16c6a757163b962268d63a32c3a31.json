                "text": "Computational modules early in the human vision system typically generate sparse information about the shapes of visible surfaces in the scene. Moreover, visual processes such as stereopsis can provide such information at a number of levels spanning a range of resolutions. In this paper, we extend this multi-level structure to encompass the subsequent task of reconstructing full surface descriptions from the sparse information. The mathematical development proceeds in three steps. First, the surface most consistent with the sparse constraints is characterized as the solution to an equilibrium state of a thin flexible plate. Second, local, finite element representations of surfaces are introduced and, by applying the finite element method, the continuous variational principle is transformed into a discrete problem in the form of a large system of linear algebraic equations whose solution is computable by local-support, cooperative mechanisms. Third, to exploit the information available at each level of resolution, a hierarchy of discrete problems is formulated and a highly efficient multi-level algorithm, involving both intra-level relaxation processes and bi-directional inter-level algorithm, involving both intra- level relaxation processes and bidirectional inter-level local interpolation processes is applied to their simultaneous solution.. Examples of the generation of hierarchies of surface representations from stereo constraints are given. Finally, the basic surface approximation problem is revisited in a broader mathematical context whose implications are of relevance to vision."

                "text": "Computational theories of structure-from-motion and stereo vision only specify the computation of three-dimensional surface information at special points in the image. Yet the visual perception is clearly of complete surfaces. To account for this a computational theory of the interpolation of surfaces from visual information is presented. The problem is constrained by the fact that the surface must agree with the information from stereo or motion correspondence, and not vary radically between these points. Using the image irradiance equation, an explicit form of this surface consistency constraint can be derived. To determine which of two possible surfaces is more consistent with the surface consistency constraint, one must be able to compare the two surfaces. To do this, a functional from the space of possible functions to the real numbers is required. In this way, the surface most consistent with the visual information will be that which minimizes the functional. To ensure that the functional has a unique minimal surface, conditions on the form of the functional are derived. In particular, if the functional is a complete semi-norm that satisfies the parallelogram law, or the space of functions is a semi-Hilbert space and the functional is a semi-inner product, then there is a unique (to within possibly an element of the null space of the functional) surface that is most consistent with the visual information. It can be shown, based on the above conditions plus a condition of rotational symmetry, that there is a vector space of possible functionals that measure surface consistency, this vector space being spanned by the functional of quadratic variation and the functional of square Laplacian. Arguments based on the null spaces of the respective functionals are used to justify the choice of the quadratic variation as the optimal functional. Possible refinements to the theory, concerning the role of discontinuities in depth and the effects of applying the interpolation process to scenes containing more than one object, are discussed."

(i) The left and right images are each filtered with masks of four sizes that increase with eccentricity; the shape of these masks is given by delta 2G, the Laplacian of a Gaussian function. (ii) Zero crossings in the filtered images are found along horizontal scan lines. (iii) For each mask size, matching takes place between zero crossings of the same sign and roughly the same orientation in the two images, for a range of disparities up to about the width of the mask's central region. Within this disparity range, it can be shown that false targets pose only a simple problem. (iv) The output of the wide masks can control vergence movements, thus causing small masks to come into correspondence. In this way, the matching process gradually moves from dealing with large disparities at a low resolution to dealing with small disparities at a high resolution. (v) When a correspondence is achieved, it is stored in a dynamic buffer, called the 2 1/2-dimensional sketch. To support the adequacy of the Marr-Poggio model of human stereo vision, the implementation was tested on a wide range of stereograms from the human stereopsis literature. The performance of the implementation is illustrated and compared with human perception. Also statistical assumptions made by Marr & Poggio are supported by comparison with statistics found in practice. Finally, the process of implementing the theory has led to the clarification and refinement of a number of details within the theory; these are discussed in detail."

A description of this movement is not provided to our visual system directly, however; it must be inferred from the pattern of changing intensity that reaches the eye. This paper examines the problem of motion measurement, which we formulate as the computation of an instantaneous two-dimensional velocity field from the changing image. Initial measurements of motion take place at the location of significant intensity changes. These measurements provide only one component of local velocity, and must be integrated to compute the two-dimensional velocity field. A fundamental problem for this integration stage is that the velocity field is not determined uniquely from information available in the changing image. We formulate an additional constraint of smoothness of the velocity field, based on the physical assumption that surfaces are generally smooth, which allows the computation of a unique velocity field. A theoretical analysis of the conditions under which this computation yields the correct velocity field suggests that the solution is physically plausible. Empirical studies show the predictions of this computation to be consistent with human motion perception."

                "text": "A theory of edge detection is presented. The analysis proceeds in two parts. (1) Intensity changes, which occur in a natural image over a wide range of scales, are detected separately at different scales. An appropriate filter for this purpose at a given scale is found to be the second derivative of a Gaussian, and it is shown that, provided some simple conditions are satisfied, these primary filters need not be orientation-dependent. Thus, intensity changes at a given scale are best detected by finding the zero values of \u22072G(x, y)* I(x, y) for image I, where G(x, y) is a two-dimensional Gaussian distribution and \u22072 is the Laplacian. The intensity changes thus discovered in each of the channels are then represented by oriented primitives called zero-crossing segments, and evidence is given that this representation is complete. (2) Intensity changes in images arise from surface discontinuities or from reflectance or illumination boundaries, and these all have the property that they are spatially localized. Because of this, the zero-crossing segments from the different channels are not independent, and rules are deduced for combining them into a description of the image. This description is called the raw primal sketch. The theory explains several basic psychophysical findings, and the operation of forming oriented zero-crossing segments from the output of centre-surround \u22072G filters acting on the image forms the basis for a physiological model of simple cells (see Marr & Ullman 1979)."

The question addressed is how the three dimensional structure and motion of objects can be inferred from the two dimensional transformations of their projected images when no three dimensional information is conveyed by the individual projections. The following scheme is proposed: (i) divide the image into groups of four elements each; (ii) test each group for a rigid interpretation; (iii) combine the results obtained in (ii). It is shown that this scheme will correctly decompose scenes containing arbitrary rigid objects in motion, recovering their three dimensional structure and motion. The analysis is based primarily on the \u02bbstructure from motion\u2019 theorem which states that the structure of four non-coplanar points is recoverable from three orthographic projections. The interpretation scheme is extended to cover perspective projections, and its psychological relevance is discussed."

A fundamental problem of motion measurement in general is that the velocity field is not determined uniquely from the changing intensity patterns. They formulate the measurement of motion as the computation of the smoothest velocity field consistent with the changing contour. We analyse this Extremum principle and prove that it is closely related to a matching scheme for motion measurement which matches points on the moving contour that have similar tangent vectors. We then derive necessary and sufficient conditions for the principle to yield the correct velocity field. These results have possible implications for the design of computer visions systems, and for the study of human vision."

The foim of the solution derives from a number of premises, one of which Ullman calls \u201cthe locality hypothesis\u201d. \u2018Ihis is \u201cbased in part on cxpcrimcntal obscrvntions, and partly on a theoretical consideration\u201d ([I 51 ~2). \u2018I\u2019hc \u201ccxpcrimcntal observation\u201d rcfcrrcd to is the following: suppose that A\u2019 is a point near A on the filled-in contour AB as shown in Figure 1. If the process by which AB was constructed is applied to A\u2019B, it is claimed that it gcneratcs the portion of AJ3, bctwccn A\u2019 and B. Let us call this property \u201ccxtcnsibility\u201d. Ullman argues that cxtcnsibility, togcthcr with the propcrtics of isotropy, smoothness, and having minimal integral curvature, logically entails a solution consisting of two circles which meet smoothly. In the fit11 version of this paper, we analyze the two-cti solution and formulate the condition for minimal integral curvature. This can bc solved by any descent method such as Newton-Raphson. A program has been written which computes the minimum integral curvature two-circle solution given the boundary angles 4, 8, and AB, and which returns as a result the point at which they meet and at which the curvature is discontinuous (the \u2018knot point\u2019). A tortuous version of this simple proof and program recently appcarcd in [13]. We then show by example that the two circle solution is not in fact extensible."

We formulate a generalized ordering constraint, not restricted to epipolar lines. We prove several properties of the generalized ordering constraint and of the forbidden zone , the set of matches that would violate the constraint. We consider both the orthographic and the perspective projection case, the latter for a simplified but standard stereo geometry. The disparity gradient limit found in the human stereo system may be related to a form of the ordering constraint. To illustrate our analysis we outline a simple algorithm that exploits the generalized ordering constraint for matching contours of wireframe objects. We also show that the use of the generalized ordering constraint implies several other stereo matching constraints: (a) the ordering constraint along epipolar lines, (b) figural continuity, (c) Binford's cross-product constraint, (d) Mayhew and Frisby's figural continuity constraint. We finally discuss ways of extending the algorithm to arbitrary 3-D objects."

The proof assumes that the filtered signal can be represented as a polynomial of finite, albeit possibly high, order. The result applies to zero and level crossings of linear differential operators of Gaussian filters. In this case the signal is determined uniquely, modulus the null space of the linear operator. The theorem can be extended to two-dimensional functions. These results are reminiscent of Logan\u2019s theorem [ Bell Syst. Tech. J.56, 487 ( 1977)]. They imply that extrema of derivatives at different scales are a complete representation of a signal. They are especially relevant for computational vision in the case of the Laplacian operator acting on image intensities, and they suggest rigorous foundations for the primal sketch."
