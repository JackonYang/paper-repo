This algorithm allows a network to learn specified trajectories in state space in response to various input sequences. The network dynamics are described by a system of coupled differential equations that specify the continuous change of the unit activities and weights over time. The algorithm is nonlocal, in that a change in the connection weight between two units may depend on the values for some of the weights between different units. However, the operation of a learned network (fixed weights) is local. If the network units are specified to behave like electronic amplifiers, then an analog implementation of the learned network is straightforward. An example demonstrates the use of the algorithm in a completely connected network of four units. The network creates a limit cycle attractor in order to perform the specified task.<<ETX>>"

Here we use a series of simulation experiments to investigate the power and properties of this algorithm. In the recurrent networks studied here, any unit can be connected to any other, and any unit can receive external input. These networks run continually in the sense that they sample their inputs on every update cycle, and any unit can have a training target on any cycle. The storage required and computation time on each step are independent of time and are completely determined by the size of the network, so no prior knowledge of the temporal structure of the task being learned is required. The algorithm is nonlocal in the sense that each unit must have knowledge of the complete recurrent weight matrix and error vector.

This ability to perform highly nonlinear dynamic mappings makes these networks particularly interesting to study and potentially quite useful in tasks which have an important temporal component not easily handled through the use of simple tapped delay lines. Some examples are tasks involving recognition or generation of sequential patterns and sensorimotor control. This report examines a number of learning procedures for adjusting the weights in recurrent networks in order to train such networks to produce desired temporal behaviors from input-output stream examples. The procedures are all based on the computation of the gradient of performance error with respect to network weights, and a number of strategies for computing the necessary gradient information are described. Included here are approaches which are familiar and have been rst described elsewhere, along with several novel approaches. One particular purpose of this report is to provide uniform and detailed descriptions and derivations of the various techniques in order to emphasize how they relate to one another. Another important contribution of this report is a detailed analysis of the computational requirements of the various approaches discussed."

It is shown that the feedforward network (FFN) pattern learning rule is a first-order approximation of the FFN-batch learning rule. As a result, pattern learning is valid for nonlinear activation networks provided the learning rate is small. For recurrent types of networks (RecNs), RecN-pattern learning is different from RecN-batch learning. However, the difference can be controlled by using small learning rates. While RecN-batch learning is strict in a mathematical sense, RecN-pattern learning is simple to implement and can be implemented in a real-time manner. Simulation results agree very well with the theorems derived. It is shown by simulation that for system identification problems, recurrent networks are less sensitive to noise."

The network uses the pattern of activation over a set of hidden units from time-step t1, together with element t, to predict element t 1. When the network is trained with strings from a particular finite-state grammar, it can learn to be a perfect finite-state recognizer for the grammar. When the network has a minimal number of hidden units, patterns on the hidden units come to correspond to the nodes of the grammar, although this correspondence is not necessary for the network to act as a perfect finite-state recognizer. We explore the conditions under which the network can carry information about distant sequential contingencies across intervening elements. Such information is maintained with relative ease if it is relevant at each intermediate step; it tends to be lost when intervening elements do not depend on it. At first glance this may suggest that such networks are not relevant to natural language, in which dependencies may span indefinite distances. However, embeddings in natural language are not completely independent of earlier information. The final simulation shows that long distance sequential contingencies can be encoded by the network even if only subtle statistical properties of embedded strings depend on the early information."
