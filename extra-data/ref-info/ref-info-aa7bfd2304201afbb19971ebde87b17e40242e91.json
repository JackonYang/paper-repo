                "text": "Whereas before 2006 it appears that deep multilayer neural networks were not successfully trained, since then several algorithms have been shown to successfully train them, with experimental results showing the superiority of deeper vs less deep architectures. All these experimental results were obtained with new initialization or training mechanisms. Our objective here is to understand better why standard gradient descent from random initialization is doing so poorly with deep neural networks, to better understand these recent relative successes and help design better algorithms in the future. We first observe the influence of the non-linear activations functions. We find that the logistic sigmoid activation is unsuited for deep networks with random initialization because of its mean value, which can drive especially the top hidden layer into saturation. Surprisingly, we find that saturated units can move out of saturation by themselves, albeit slowly, and explaining the plateaus sometimes seen when training neural networks. We find that a new non-linearity that saturates less can often be beneficial. Finally, we study how activations and gradients vary across layers and during training, with the idea that training may be more difficult when the singular values of the Jacobian associated with each layer are far from 1. Based on these considerations, we propose a new initialization scheme that brings substantially faster convergence. 1 Deep Neural Networks Deep learning methods aim at learning feature hierarchies with features from higher levels of the hierarchy formed by the composition of lower level features. They include Appearing in Proceedings of the 13 International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics (AISTATS) 2010, Chia Laguna Resort, Sardinia, Italy. Volume 9 of JMLR: WC Weston et al., 2008). Much attention has recently been devoted to them (see (Bengio, 2009) for a review), because of their theoretical appeal, inspiration from biology and human cognition, and because of empirical success in vision (Ranzato et al., 2007; Larochelle et al., 2007; Vincent et al., 2008) and natural language processing (NLP) (Collobert & Weston, 2008; Mnih & Hinton, 2009). Theoretical results reviewed and discussed by Bengio (2009), suggest that in order to learn the kind of complicated functions that can represent high-level abstractions (e.g. in vision, language, and other AI-level tasks), one may need deep architectures. Most of the recent experimental results with deep architecture are obtained with models that can be turned into deep supervised neural networks, but with initialization or training schemes different from the classical feedforward neural networks (Rumelhart et al., 1986). Why are these new algorithms working so much better than the standard random initialization and gradient-based optimization of a supervised training criterion? Part of the answer may be found in recent analyses of the effect of unsupervised pretraining (Erhan et al., 2009), showing that it acts as a regularizer that initializes the parameters in a \u201cbetter\u201d basin of attraction of the optimization procedure, corresponding to an apparent local minimum associated with better generalization. But earlier work (Bengio et al., 2007) had shown that even a purely supervised but greedy layer-wise procedure would give better results. So here instead of focusing on what unsupervised pre-training or semi-supervised criteria bring to deep architectures, we focus on analyzing what may be going wrong with good old (but deep) multilayer neural networks. Our analysis is driven by investigative experiments to monitor activations (watching for saturation of hidden units) and gradients, across layers and across training iterations. We also evaluate the effects on these of choices of activation function (with the idea that it might affect saturation) and initialization procedure (since unsupervised pretraining is a particular form of initialization and it has a drastic impact)."

Utilizing recent advances in the Hessian-free optimization approach (Martens, 2010), together with a novel damping scheme, we successfully train RNNs on two sets of challenging problems. First, a collection of pathological synthetic datasets which are known to be impossible for standard optimization approaches (due to their extremely long-term dependencies), and second, on three natural and highly complex real-world sequence datasets where we find that our method significantly outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method for training neural sequence models: the Long Short-term Memory approach of Hochreiter and Schmidhuber (1997). Additionally, we offer a new interpretation of the generalized Gauss-Newton matrix of Schraudolph (2002) which is used within the HF approach of Martens."

Fortunately, recent advances in Hessian-free optimization have been able to overcome the difficulties associated with training RNNs, making it possible to apply them successfully to challenging sequence problems. In this paper we demonstrate the power of RNNs trained with the new Hessian-Free optimizer (HF) by applying them to character-level language modeling tasks. The standard RNN architecture, while effective, is not ideally suited for such tasks, so we introduce a new RNN variant that uses multiplicative (or \"gated\") connections which allow the current input character to determine the transition matrix from one hidden state vector to the next. After training the multiplicative RNN with the HF optimizer for five days on 8 high-end Graphics Processing Units, we were able to surpass the performance of the best previous single method for character-level language modeling \u2013 a hierarchical non-parametric sequence model. To our knowledge this represents the largest recurrent neural network application to date."

Deep multi-layer neural networks have many levels of non-linearities allowing them to compactly represent highly non-linear and highly-varying functions. However, until recently it was not clear how to train such deep networks, since gradient-based optimization starting from random initialization appears to often get stuck in poor solutions. Hinton et al. recently introduced a greedy layer-wise unsupervised learning algorithm for Deep Belief Networks (DBN), a generative model with many layers of hidden causal variables. In the context of the above optimization problem, we study this algorithm empirically and explore variants to better understand its success and extend it to cases where the inputs are continuous or where the structure of the input distribution is not revealing enough about the variable to be predicted in a supervised task. Our experiments also confirm the hypothesis that the greedy layer-wise unsupervised training strategy mostly helps the optimization, by initializing weights in a region near a good local minimum, giving rise to internal distributed representations that are high-level abstractions of the input, bringing better generalization."

This transformation aims at separating the problems of learning the linear and nonlinear parts of the whole input-output mapping, which has many benefits. We study the theoretical properties of the transformation by noting that they make the Fisher information matrix closer to a diagonal matrix, and thus standard gradient closer to the natural gradient. We experimentally confirm the usefulness of the transformations by noting that they make basic stochastic gradient learning competitive with state-of-the-art learning algorithms in speed, and that they seem also to help find solutions that generalize better. The experiments include both classification of small images and learning a lowdimensional representation for images by using a deep unsupervised auto-encoder network. The transformations were beneficial in all cases, with and without regularization and with networks from two to five hidden layers."

Through introduction of auxiliary variables, we show that the learning process can be described by a Markov process. For small learning parameters eta and momentum parameters alpha close to 1, such that gamma = eta /(1- alpha )2 is finite, the time-scales for the evolution of the weights and the auxiliary variables are the same. In this case Van Kampen's expansion can be applied in a straightforward manner. We obtain evolution equations for the average network state and the fluctuations around this average. These evolution equations depend (after rescaling a of the time and fluctuations) only on gamma : all combinations ( eta , alpha ) with the same value of gamma give rise to similar behaviour. The case with alpha constant and eta small requires a completely different analysis. There are two different time-scales: a fast time-scale on which the auxiliary variables equilibrate and a slow time-scale for the change of the weights. By projection on the space of slow variables the fast variables can be eliminated. We find that, for small learning parameters eta and finite momentum parameters alpha , learning with momentum is equivalent to learning without a momentum term with a rescaled learning parameter eta = eta /(1- alpha ). Simulations with the nonlinear Oja learning rule confirm the theoretical results."

On the test data, we achieved top-1 and top-5 error rates of 37.5% and 17.0%, respectively, which is considerably better than the previous state-of-the-art. The neural network, which has 60 million parameters and 650,000 neurons, consists of five convolutional layers, some of which are followed by max-pooling layers, and three fully connected layers with a final 1000-way softmax. To make training faster, we used non-saturating neurons and a very efficient GPU implementation of the convolution operation. To reduce overfitting in the fully connected layers we employed a recently developed regularization method called \"dropout\" that proved to be very effective. We also entered a variant of this model in the ILSVRC-2012 competition and achieved a winning top-5 test error rate of 15.3%, compared to 26.2% achieved by the second-best entry."

We use this formulation to (1) model the time evolution of the weight space densities during learning, (2) predict convergence regimes with and without momentum, and (3) develop a new efficient algorithm with few adjustable parameters which we call adaptive momentum. \nIn stochastic learning, the weights are updated at each iteration based on a single exemplar randomly chosen from the training set. Treating the learning dynamics as a Markov process, we show that the weight space probability density P(w,t) can be cast as a Kramers-Moyal series$${\\partial P(w,t)\\over\\partial t} = L\\sb{KM} P(w,t)\\eqno(0.1)\\cr$$where $L\\sb{KM}$ is an infinite-order linear differential operator, the terms of which involve powers of the learning rate $\\mu.$ We present several approaches for truncating this series so that approximate solutions can be obtained. One approach is the small noise expansion where the weights are modeled as a sum of a deterministic and noise component. However, in order to provide more accurate solutions, we also develop a perturbation expansion in $\\mu.$ We demonstrate the technique on equilibrium weight-space densities. \nUnlike batch learning, stochastic updates are noisy but fast to compute. The speed-up can be dramatic if training sets are highly redundant, and the noise can decrease the likelihood of becoming trapped in poor local minima. However, acceleration techniques based on estimating the local curvature of the cost surface can not be implemented stochastically because the estimates of second order effects are much too noisy. Disregarding such effects can greatly hinder learning in problems where the condition number of the hessian is large. A matrix of learning rates (the inverse hessian) that scales the stepsize according to the curvature along the different eigendirections of the hessian is needed. We propose adaptive momentum as a solution. It results in an effective learning rate matrix that approximates the inverse hessian. No explicit calculation of the hessian or its inverse is required. This algorithm is only ${\\cal O}(n)$ in both space and time, where n is the dimension of the weight vector."

Using complementary priors, we derive a fast, greedy algorithm that can learn deep, directed belief networks one layer at a time, provided the top two layers form an undirected associative memory. The fast, greedy algorithm is used to initialize a slower learning procedure that fine-tunes the weights using a contrastive version of the wake-sleep algorithm. After fine-tuning, a network with three hidden layers forms a very good generative model of the joint distribution of handwritten digit images and their labels. This generative model gives better digit classification than the best discriminative learning algorithms. The low-dimensional manifolds on which the digits lie are modeled by long ravines in the free-energy landscape of the top-level associative memory, and it is easy to explore these ravines by using the directed connections to display what the associative memory has in mind."

We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O. 1. Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms."

We describe a pre-trained deep neural network hidden Markov model (DNN-HMM) hybrid architecture that trains the DNN to produce a distribution over senones (tied triphone states) as its output. The deep belief network pre-training algorithm is a robust and often helpful way to initialize deep neural networks generatively that can aid in optimization and reduce generalization error. We illustrate the key components of our model, describe the procedure for applying CD-DNN-HMMs to LVSR, and analyze the effects of various modeling choices on performance. Experiments on a challenging business search dataset demonstrate that CD-DNN-HMMs can significantly outperform the conventional context-dependent Gaussian mixture model (GMM)-HMMs, with an absolute sentence accuracy improvement of 5.8% and 9.2% (or relative error reduction of 16.0% and 23.2%) over the CD-GMM-HMMs trained using the minimum phone error rate (MPE) and maximum-likelihood (ML) criteria, respectively."

One of the key challenges in sequence transduction is learning to represent both the input and output sequences in a way that is invariant to sequential distortions such as shrinking, stretching and translating. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are a powerful sequence learning architecture that has proven capable of learning such representations. However RNNs traditionally require a pre-defined alignment between the input and output sequences to perform transduction. This is a severe limitation since \\emph{finding} the alignment is the most difficult aspect of many sequence transduction problems. Indeed, even determining the length of the output sequence is often challenging. This paper introduces an end-to-end, probabilistic sequence transduction system, based entirely on RNNs, that is in principle able to transform any input sequence into any finite, discrete output sequence. Experimental results for phoneme recognition are provided on the TIMIT speech corpus."

We show that better phone recognition on the TIMIT dataset can be achieved by replacing Gaussian mixture models by deep neural networks that contain many layers of features and a very large number of parameters. These networks are first pre-trained as a multi-layer generative model of a window of spectral feature vectors without making use of any discriminative information. Once the generative pre-training has designed the features, we perform discriminative fine-tuning using backpropagation to adjust the features slightly to make them better at predicting a probability distribution over the states of monophone hidden Markov models."

The standard choices of the learning rate \u03b7 (both adaptive and fixed functions of time) often perform quite poorly. In contrast, our recently proposed class of \"search then converge\" learning rate schedules (Darken and Moody, 1990) display the theoretically optimal asymptotic convergence rate and a superior ability to escape from poor local minima. However, the user is responsible for setting a key parameter. We propose here a new methodology for creating the first completely automatic adaptive learning rates which achieve the optimal rate of convergence."

An alternati ve way to evaluate the fit is to use a feedforward neural network that takes several frames of coefficients a s input and produces posterior probabilities over HMM states as output. Deep neural networks with many hidden layers, that are trained using new methods have been shown to outperform Gaussian mixture models on a variety of speech rec ognition benchmarks, sometimes by a large margin. This paper provides an overview of this progress and repres nts the shared views of four research groups who have had recent successes in using deep neural networks for a coustic modeling in speech recognition."

Since SCO covers non-smooth, smooth and stochastic CP as certain special cases, a valid lower bound on the rate of convergence for solving these problems is known from the classic complexity theory of convex programming. Note however that the optimization algorithms that can achieve this lower bound had never been developed. In this paper, we show that the simple mirror-descent stochastic approximation method exhibits the best-known rate of convergence for solving these problems. Our major contribution is to introduce the accelerated stochastic approximation (AC-SA) algorithm based on Nesterov\u2019s optimal method for smooth CP (Nesterov in Doklady AN SSSR 269:543\u2013547, 1983; Nesterov in Math Program 103:127\u2013152, 2005), and show that the AC-SA algorithm can achieve the aforementioned lower bound on the rate of convergence for SCO. To the best of our knowledge, it is also the first universally optimal algorithm in the literature for solving non-smooth, smooth and stochastic CP problems. We illustrate the significant advantages of the AC-SA algorithm over existing methods in the context of solving a special but broad class of stochastic programming problems."

The importance of this paper, containing a new polynomial-time algorithm for linear op timization problems, was not only in its complexity bound. At that time, the most surprising feature of this algorithm was that the theoretical pre diction of its high efficiency was supported by excellent computational results. This unusual fact dramatically changed the style and direc tions of the research in nonlinear optimization. Thereafter it became more and more common that the new methods were provided with a complexity analysis, which was considered a better justification of their efficiency than computational experiments. In a new rapidly develop ing field, which got the name \"polynomial-time interior-point methods\", such a justification was obligatory. Afteralmost fifteen years of intensive research, the main results of this development started to appear in monographs [12, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19]. Approximately at that time the author was asked to prepare a new course on nonlinear optimization for graduate students. The idea was to create a course which would reflect the new developments in the field. Actually, this was a major challenge. At the time only the theory of interior-point methods for linear optimization was polished enough to be explained to students. The general theory of self-concordant functions had appeared in print only once in the form of research monograph [12]."
