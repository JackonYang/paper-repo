Two drawbacks of the available automatic indexing methods are the absence of reliable linguistic inputs during the indexing process and the lack of formal, analytical proofs concerning the effectiveness of the proposed methods. The precision weighting procedure described in the present study uses relevance criteria to weight the terms occurring in user queries as a function of the balance between relevant and nonrelevant documents in which these terms occur; this approximates a semantic know-how of term importance. Formal mathematical proofs are given under well-defined conditions of the effectiveness of the method."

This divides the file into retrieved and not\u2010retrieved references. An alternative is to assign each reference a score calculated from its index terms and to retrieve the N highest scoring references in the file. This scoring technique has several advantages in theory, and it performed slightly better in a retrieval test with N equal to the number of references retrieved by the corresponding Boolean search. In the test a minimum value of N = 10 was used, and when less than this number of references matched the Boolean search requirement, the Scoring technique successfully widened the scope of the search and retrieved twice as many relevant references as the Boolean searches."
