Specifically we seek to understand the structure of color cues that allows the express recognition of scene gists. Using the L*a*b* color space we examined the conditions under which chromatic cues concur with brightness to allow a viewer to recognize scenes at a glance. Using different methods, Experiments 1 and 2 tested the hypothesis that colors do contribute when they are diagnostic (i.e., predictive) of a scene category. Experiment 3 examined the structure of colored cues at different spatial scales that are responsible for the effects of color diagnosticity reported in Experiments 1 and 2. Together, the results suggest that colored blobs at a coarse spatial scale concur with luminance cues to form the relevant spatial layout that mediates express scene recognition."

Pictures were presented for 10, 30, 50, 75, 100, 150, 300, or 1000 ms and subjects were asked to determine if a probe was the portion of the scene which had appeared in that location. The probed sections had previously been rated on informativeness and high-, medium-, and low-rated areas were examined. Medium-informative sections were recognized better than high- or low-informative sections. A comparison of sections in the central and peripheral positions of the visual field indicated that medium-informative sections were recognized better in the periphery, while highly informative areas were recognized more accurately at central locations. These results are interpreted as supporting the concept that context develops prior to the identification of objects."

The procedure is based on a very low dimensional representation of the scene, that we term the Spatial Envelope. We propose a set of perceptual dimensions (naturalness, openness, roughness, expansion, ruggedness) that represent the dominant spatial structure of a scene. Then, we show that these dimensions may be reliably estimated using spectral and coarsely localized information. The model generates a multidimensional space in which scenes sharing membership in semantic categories (e.g., streets, highways, coasts) are projected closed together. The performance of the spatial envelope model shows that specific information about object shape or identity is not a requirement for scene categorization and that modeling a holistic representation of the scene informs about its probable semantic category."

The results of this measure are compared with humans analyzing seven \"teaser\" images to test its effectiveness for finding perceptually dominant orientations. The use of low-level orientation is then applied to a \"quick search\" problem important in image database applications. Since both pigeons and humans are able to perform coarse classification of certain kinds of scenes, e.g., city from country, without taking time or brain-power to solve the image understanding problem, the authors conjecture that the collective behavior of low-level textural features such as orientation may be doing most of the work. The authors demonstrate a simple test of global multiscale orientation for quickly searching a database of vacation photos for likely \"city/suburb\" shots. The orientation features achieve agreement with human classification in 91 out of 98 of the scenes."

This model consists of three stages: (1) convolution of the image with a bank of even-symmetric linear filters followed by half-wave rectification to give a set of responses modeling outputs of V1 simple cells, (2) inhibition, localized in space, within and among the neural-response profiles that results in the suppression of weak responses when there are strong responses at the same or nearby locations, and (3) texture-boundary detection by using wide odd-symmetric mechanisms. Our model can predict the salience of texture boundaries in any arbitrary gray-scale image. A computer implementation of this model has been tested on many of the classic stimuli from psychophysical literature. Quantitative predictions of the degree of discriminability of different texture pairs match well with experimental measurements of discriminability in human observers."

Eye movements are prevented by a very brief presentation of the stimulus, and the inspection interval is terminated by a presentation of a masking pattern. It is shown that detection of a single vertical target line segment, embedded in an array of differently oriented background segments, improves with the increase of mask delay. The reduction of the area in which the target may lie reduces the inspection time that is required to determine the target's presence or absence. The phenomena are invariant under changes of the spatial scale within the fovea and parafovea. These results are interpreted in the context of a model in which the diameter of the area which can be searched in parallel is proportional to the distance in a feature space between the target and background elements. The geometry of this feature space is similar to the functional architecture of the visual cortex. A theory of texture perception based on a qualitative all-or-none feature space of textons is described. A quantitative model that is shown to be essentially equivalent to the previous theory in the limiting case of very large feature differences is proposed."

B. Julesz (1981) introduced the term texton, analogous to a phoneme in speech recognition, but did not provide an operational definition for gray-level images. We re-invent textons as frequently co-occurring combinations of oriented linear filter outputs. These can be learned using a K-means approach. By mapping each pixel to its nearest texton, the image can be analyzed into texton channels, each of which is a point set where discrete techniques such as Voronoi diagrams become applicable. Local histograms of texton frequencies can be used with a /spl chi//sup 2/ test for significant differences to find texture boundaries. Natural images contain both textured and untextured regions, so we combine this cue with that of the presence of peaks of contour energy derived from outputs of odd- and even-symmetric oriented Gaussian derivative filters. Each of these cues has a domain of applicability, so to facilitate cue combination we introduce a gating operator based on a statistical test for isotropy of Delaunay neighbors. Having obtained a local measure of how likely two nearby pixels are to belong to the same region, we use the spectral graph theoretic framework of normalized cuts to find partitions of the image into regions of coherent texture and brightness. Experimental results on a wide range of images are shown."

Theories have been developed to explain the discrimina-bility of such textures in terms of specific features within the micropatterns themselves. For example, Beck1,2 observed that a region filled with vertical Ts is readily distinguished from one filled with tilted Ts but not from one filled with vertical Ls. He attributed this to the different distribution of oriented line segments present in the former case but not in the latter. However, Bergen and Julesz3 found that a region of randomly oriented Xs segregated from one filled with randomly oriented Ls, in spite of the identical distribution of oriented line segments in the two cases. They suggested that this discrimination might be based on the density of such features as terminators, corners, and intersections within the patterns. We note here that simpler, lower-level mechanisms tuned for size may be sufficient to explain this discrimination. We tested this by varying the relative sizes of the Xs and the Ls; when they produce equal responses in size-tuned mechanisms they are hard to discriminate, and when they produce different size-tuned responses they are easy to discriminate."

Two experiments tested the possibility that this spatial distortion occurs soon after picture perception. In Experiment 1, undergraduates viewed close-up or wide-angle photographs for 250 ms or 4 s. Recall and recognition tests followed. Brief presentations yielded as much boundary extension as long presentations. In Experiment 2, picture triads were presented at a rate of 333 ms per picture with no interstimulus interval. After 1 s, one picture repeated and remained in view while subjects indicated whether it was the same or showed more or less of the scene. Even when conditions mimicked a series of rapid eye fixations, boundary extension occurred. The presentation of a picture appears to activate a perceptual schema that allows observers to understand it in a larger context and this process distorts memory for its actual boundaries."

Natural images contain both textured and untextured regions, so the cues of contour and texture differences are exploited simultaneously. Contours are treated in the intervening contour framework, while texture is analyzed using textons. Each of these cues has a domain of applicability, so to facilitate cue combination we introduce a gating operator based on the texturedness of the neighborhood at a pixel. Having obtained a local measure of how likely two nearby pixels are to belong to the same region, we use the spectral graph theoretic framework of normalized cuts to find partitions of the image into regions of coherent texture and brightness. Experimental results on a wide range of images are shown."

We systematically studied the features of: histograms in the Ohta color space; multiresolution, simultaneous autoregressive model parameters; and coefficients of a shift-invariant DCT. We demonstrate that performance is improved by computing features on subblocks, classifying these subblocks, and then combining these results in a way reminiscent of stacking. State of the art single-feature methods are shown to result in about 75-86% performance, while the new method results in 90.3% correct classification, when evaluated on a diverse database of over 1300 consumer images provided by Kodak."

In this model the Gabor power spectrum of the micropatterns corresponding to different textures is calculated. A function that measures the difference between the spectrum of two micropatterns is introduced and its values are correlated with human performance in preattentive detection tasks. In addition, a two stage algorithm for texture segregation is presented. In the first stage the input image is transformed via Gabor filters into a representation image that allows discrimination between features by means of intensity differences. In the second stage the borders between areas of different textures are found using a Laplacian of Gaussian operator. This algorithm is sensitive to energy differences, rotation and spatial frequency and is insensitive to local translation. The model was tested by means of several simulations and was found to be in good correlation with known psychophysical characteristics as texton based texture segregation and micropattern density sensitivity. However, this simple model fails to predict human performance in discrimination tasks based on differences in the density of \u201cterminators\u201d. In this case human performance is better than expected."

In two experiments, sequences of 16 color photographs were presented at rates of 113, 167, or 333 msec per picture. In one group, subjects were given an immediate test of recognition memory for the pictures and in other groups they searched for a target picture. Even when the target had only been specified by a title (e.g., a boat) detection of a target was strikingly superior to recognition memory. Detection was slightly but significantly better for pictured than named targets. In a third experiment pictures were presented for 50, 70, 90 or 120 msec preceded and followed by a visual mask; at 120 msec recognition memory was as accurate as detection had been. The results, taken together with those in 1969 of Potter and Levy for slower rates of sequential presentation, suggest that on the average a scene is understood and so becomes immune to ordinary visual masking within about 100 msec but requires about 300 msec of further processing before the memory representation is resistant to conceptual masking from a following picture. Possible functions of a short-term conceptual memory, such as the control of eye fixations, are discussed."

After viewing 20 pictures for 15 s each, 37 undergraduates exhibited this striking distortion; 95% of their drawings included information that had not been physically present but that would have been likely to have existed just outside the camera's field of view (Experiment 1). To determine if boundary extension is limited to recall and drawing ability, Experiment 2 tested recognition memory for boundaries. Eighty-five undergraduates rated targets and distractors on a boundary-placement scale. Subjects rated target pictures as being closer up than before and frequently mistook extended-boundary distractors as targets. Results are discussed in terms of picture comprehension and memory. In addition to its theoretical value, discovery of the phenomenon demonstrates the importance of more widespread use of open-ended tests in picture-memory methodology."

                "text": "In general, frame theories are theories about the representation and use of knowledge for pattern recognition. In the present article, the general properties of frame theories are discussed with regard to their implications for psychological processes, and an experiment is presented which tests whether this approach yields viable predictions about the manner in which people comprehend and remember pictures of real-world scenes. Normative ratings were used to construct six target pictures, each of which contained both expected and unexpected objects. Eye movements were then recorded as subjects who anticipated a difficult recognition test viewed the targets for 30 sec each. Then, the subjects were asked to discriminate the target pictures from distractors in which either expected or unexpected objects had been changed. One consequence of the embeddedness of frame systems is that global frames may function as \"semantic pattern detectors,\" so that the perceptual knowledge in them could be used for relatively automatic pattern recognition and comprehension. Thus, subjects might be able to identify expected objects by using automatized encoding procedures that operate on global physical features. In contrast, identification of unexpected objects (i.e., objects not represented in the currently active frame) should generally require more analysis of local visual details. These hypotheses were confirmed with the fixation duration data: First fixations to the unexpected objects were approximately twice as long as first fixations to the expected objects. On the recognition test, subjects generally noticed only the changes that had been made to the unexpected objects, despite the fact that the proportions of correct rejections were made conditional on whether the target objects had been fixated. These data are again consistent with the idea that local visual details of objects represented in the frame are not neccesary for identification and are thus not generally encoded. Further, since subjects usually did not notice when expected objects were deleted or replaced with different expected objects, it was concluded that if two events instantiate the same frame, they may often be indistinguishable, as long as any differences between them are represented as arguments in the frame. Thus, for the most part, the only information about an event that is episodically \"tagged\" is information which distinguishes that particular event from others of the same general class. The data reinforce the utility of a frame theory approach to perception and memory."

The recognition test was two-alternative forced-choice in which the target/distractor relationship was manipulated in such a way that responding on the basis of one type of information or the other was required. The results indicated that following one fixation on a picture at the time of initial study, performance based on holistic information was superior to performance based on specific feature information, whereas the reverse was true following sufficient study time for multiple fixations.

The chapters are original essays and research reports that span a wide range of disciplinary approaches - from experimental psychophysics and psychobiology to mathematical analysis, to a spectrum of problems in visual processing. Further subjects covered include how the earliest stages of processing visual signals takes place, what the role of visual attention focusing is, and the high level problem of how we recognize familiar objects. Theoretical and empirical explorations of such general issues as the complexity of visual processing and the representation of visual knowledge are undertaken."

However, the specific function of each of these regions is not yet clear. Here we present evidence that a particular area within human parahippocampal cortex is involved in a critical component of navigation: perceiving the local visual environment. This region, which we name the \u2018parahippocampal place area\u2019 (PPA), responds selectively and automatically in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to passively viewed scenes, but only weakly to single objects and not at all to faces. The critical factor for this activation appears to be the presence in the stimulus of information about the layout of local space. The response in the PPA to scenes with spatial layout but no discrete objects (empty rooms) is as strong as the response to complex meaningful scenes containing multiple objects (the same rooms furnished) and over twice as strong as the response to arrays of multiple objects without three-dimensional spatial context (the furniture from these rooms on a blank background). This response is reduced if the surfaces in the scene are rearranged so that they no longer define a coherent space. We propose that the PPA represents places by encoding the geometry of the local environment."

Here a more complete version of the texton theory is presented, with emphasis on the critical distances within which the density of textons is determined by the preattentive system. Particularly some recent findings by Sagi and Julesz (1985a, b) influenced the current version of the texton theory. The stimuli are restricted to drawing composed of line segments that permit a precise definition of neighborhoods and distances to which the line segments and texture elements have to be confined in order to quality for preattentive texture discrimination. These critical distances and the aperture of focal attention are scaled by the average size of the texture elements. Furthermore, it is stressed that even when the stimuli are restricted to line segments, the blobs outlined by line segments behave like textons. The preattentive system ignores the exact shape of these blobs, but is sensitive to their average width, length, and orientation."

The present studies investigated the possibility that assessment of confidence is biased by attempts to justify one's chosen answer. These attempts include selectively focusing on evidence supporting the chosen answer and disregarding evidence contradicting it. Experiment 1 presented subjects with two-alternative questions and required them to list reasons for and against each of the alternatives prior to choosing an answer and assessing the probability of its being correct. This procedure produced a marked improvement in the appropriateness of confidence judgments. Experiment 2 simplified the manipulation by asking subjects first to choose an answer and then to list (a) one reason supporting that choice, (b) one reason contradicting it, or (c) one reason supporting and one reason contradicting. Only the listing of contradicting reasons improved the appropriateness of confidence. Correlational analyses of the data of Experiment 1 strongly suggested that the confidence depends on the amount and strength of the evidence supporting the answer chosen."

While the volume of scientific work within the general field of psychology and the neighbouring fringes of physiology, medicine, biology and physics has greatly increased within the past few years, publication has been severely restricted by lack of a journal devoted exclusively to these fields. Much work has appeared in journals representing other branches of science. The intention is to produce a small journal of high quality in which scientific psychological work, whether experimental or clinical, and whether carried out in psychological or in other research institutions, may find a focus and an outlet. The journal will be edited by R. C. Oldfield, of the Institute of Experimental Psychology, University of Oxford, who will be assisted by an editorial board of six other members of the Experimental Psychology Group, and it will be published by Messrs. W. Heffer and Sons, Ltd., Cambridge (subscription, 30s. a volume of four parts). It is hoped to produce the first part in March."
