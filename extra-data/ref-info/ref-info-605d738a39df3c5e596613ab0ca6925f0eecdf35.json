Using hierarchically organized modular subnetworks, which are trained separately and in parallel, the complexity of the task is reduced by effectively dividing it into subgoals. The system uses sequential natural language input and output and develops its own I/O representations for the words. The representations are stored in an external global lexicon and are adjusted in the course of training by all four subnetworks simultaneously, according to the FGREP-method. By concatenating a unique identification with the resulting representation, an arbitrary number of instances of the same word type can be created and used in the stories. The system is able to produce a fully expanded paraphrase of the story from only a few sentences, i.e. the unmentioned events are inferred. The word instances are correctly bound to their roles, and simple plausible inferences of the variable content of the story are made in the process.<<ETX>>"

It addresses two issues: Can connectionist models develop representations which possess internal structure and which provide the basis for productive and systematic behavior; and Can representations which are fundamentally context-sensitive support grammatical behavior which appears to be abstract and general? Results from two simulations are reported.. The simulations address problems in the distinction between type and token, the representation of lexical categories, and the representation of grammatical structure. The results suggest that connectionist representations can indeed possess internal structure and enable systematic behavior, and that a mechanism which is sensitive to context is capable of capturing generalizations of varying degrees of abstractness."

In a distributed neural network architecture each symbol is represented by activity in many units and each unit contributes to the representation of many symbols. Manipulating symbols using this type of distributed representation is not as easy as with a local representation whore each unit denotes one symbol, but there is evidence that the distributed approach is the one chosen by nature. We describe a working implementation of a production system interpreter in a neural network using distributed representations for both symbols and rules. The research provides a detailed account of two important symbolic reasoning operations, pattern matching and variable binding, as emergent properties of collections of neuron-like elements. The success of our production system implementation goes some way towards answering a common criticism of connectionist theories: that they aren't powerful enough to do symbolic reasoning."

The first describes a simulation of chunking in a connectionist network. The network applies context-sensitive rewrite rules to strings of symbols as they flow through its input buffer. Chunking is implemented as a form of self-supervised learning using back-propagation. Over time, the network improves its efficiency by replacing simple rule sequences with more complex chunks. The second paper describes the first implementation of Lakoff's new theory of cognitive phonology. His approach is based on a multilevel representation of utterances to which all rules apply in parallel. Cognitive phonology is free of the rule ordering constraints that make classical generative theories computationally p awkward. The connectionist implementation utilizes a novel many maps architecture that may explain certain constraints on phonological rules not adequately accounted for by more abstract models. Keywords: Cognitive phonology; Linguistics; Many-maps model; Voice communication."

                "text": "We explore a network architecture introduced by Elman (1990) for predicting successive elements of a sequence. The network uses the pattern of activation over a set of hidden units from time-step t-1, together with element t, to predict element t + 1. When the network is trained with strings from a particular finite-state grammar, it can learn to be a perfect finite-state recognizer for the grammar. When the net has a minimal number of hidden units, patterns on the hidden units come to correspond to the nodes of the grammar; however, this correspondence is not necessary for the network to act as a perfect finite-state recognizer. Next, we provide a detailed analysis of how the network acquires its internal representations. We show that the network progressively encodes more and more temporal context by means of a probability analysis. Finally, we explore the conditions under which the network can carry information about distant sequential contingencies across intervening elements to distant elements. Such information is maintained with relative ease if it is relevant at each intermediate step; it tends to be lost when intervening elements do not depend on it. At first glance this may suggest that such networks are not relevant to natural language, in which dependencies may span indefinite distances. However, embeddings in natural language are not completely independent of earlier information. The final simulation shows that long distance sequential contingencies can be encoded by the network even if only subtle statistical properties of embedded strings depend on the early information. The network encodes long-distance dependencies by shading internal representations that are responsible for processing common embeddings in otherwise different sequences. This ability to represent simultaneously similarities and differences between several sequences relies on the graded nature of representations used by the network, which contrast with the finite states of traditional automata. For this reason, the network and other similar architectures may be called Graded State Machines."

                "text": "Time underlies many interesting human behaviors. Thus, the question of how to represent time in connectionist models is very important. One approach is to represent time implicitly by its effects on processing rather than explicitly (as in a spatial representation). The current report develops a proposal along these lines first described by Jordan (1986) which involves the use of recurrent links in order to provide networks with a dynamic memory. In this approach, hidden unit patterns are fed back to themselves; the internal representations which develop thus reflect task demands in the context of prior internal states. A set of simulations is reported which range from relatively simple problems (temporal version of XOR) to discovering syntactic/semantic features for words. The networks are able to learn interesting internal representations which incorporate task demands with memory demands; indeed, in this approach the notion of memory is inextricably bound up with task processing. These representations reveal a rich structure, which allows them to be highly context-dependent while also expressing generalizations across classes of items. These representations suggest a method for representing lexical categories and the type/token distinction."

The memory representations for pronunciations are learned by practice and are shared among many processing units. The performance of NETtalk has some similarities with observed human performance. (i) The learning follows a power law. (ii) The more words the network learns, the better it is at generalizing and correctly pronouncing new words, (iii) The performance of the network degrades very slowly as connections in the network are damaged: no single link or processing unit is essential. (iv) Relearning after damage is much faster than learning during the original training. (v) Distributed or spaced practice is more effective for long-term retention than massed practice. Network models can be constructed that have the same performance and learning characteristics on a particular task, but differ completely at the levels of synaptic strengths and single-unit responses. However, hierarchical clustering techniques applied to NETtalk reveal that these different networks have similar internal representations of letter-to-sound correspondences within groups of processing units. This suggests that invariant internal representations may be found in assemblies of neurons intermediate in size between highly localized and completely distributed representations."

More recently, Fodor and Pylyshyn have made a sweeping claim the connectionist systems cannot incorporate systematicity and compositionality. These comments suggest that representing structured knowledge in a connectionist network and using this knowledge in a systematic way is considered difficult if not impossible. The work reported in this paper demonstrates that a connectionist system can not only represent structured knowledge and display systematic behavior, but it can also do so with extreme efficiency. The paper describes a connectionist system that can represent knowledge expressed as rules and facts involving multi-place predicates (i.e., n-ary relates), and draw limited, but sound, inferences based on this knowledge."

These hypotheses are shown to be incompatible with the hypotheses underlying traditional cognitive models. The connectionist models considered are massively parallel numerical computational systems that are a kind of continuous dynamical system. The numerical variables in the system correspond semantically to fine-grained features below the level of the concepts consciously used to describe the task domain. The level of analysis is intermediate between those of symbolic cognitive models and neural models. The explanations of behavior provided are like those traditional in the physical sciences, unlike the explanations provided by symbolic models. Higher-level analyses of these connectionist models reveal subtle relations to symbolic models. Parallel connectionist memory and linguistic processes are hypothesized to give rise to processes that are describable at a higher level as sequential rule application. At the lower level, computation has the character of massively parallel satisfaction of soft numerical constraints; at the higher level, this can lead to competence characterizable by hard rules. Performance will typically deviate from this competence since behavior is achieved not by interpreting hard rules but by satisfying soft constraints. The result is a picture in which traditional and connectionist theoretical constructs collaborate intimately to provide an understanding of cognition."

                "text": "Given a \u0302 network of simple computing elements and some entities to be represented, the most straightforward scheme is to use one computing element for each entity. This is called a local representation. It is easy to understand and easy to implement because the structure of the physical network mirrors the structure of the knowledge it contains. This report describes a different type of representation that is less familiar and harder to think about than local representations. Each entity is represented by a pattern of activity distributed over many computing elements, and each computing element is involved in representing many different entities. The strength of this more complicated kind of representation does not lie in its notational convenience or its ease of implementation in a conventional computer, but rather in the efficiency with which it makes use of the processing abilities of networks of simple, neuron-like computing elements. Every representational scheme has its good and bad points. Distributed representations are no exception. Some desirable properties like content-addressable memory and automatic generalization arise very naturally from the use of patterns of activity as representations. Other properties, like the ability to temporarily store a large set of arbitrary associations, are much harder to achieve. The best psychological evidence for distributed representations is the degree to which their strengths and weaknesses match those of the human mind. ^This research was supported by a grant from the System Development Foundation.

For all sorts of reasons, standard generative phonological theories cannot be implemented in connectionist frameworks. Lakoff's theory of cognitive phonology offers solutions to some of these problems in that it offers an alternative way to think about derivations and ordered rules, as well as eliminating the need for right-to-left iterative rule application. We will begin by describing our 'many maps' model and show how Lakoff's cross-level phonological constructions may be implemented. As will become clear, our basic assumption is that all phonological constructions should express correlations between levels and be satisfied in parallel, simultaneously, across the entire input domain. After describing the general properties of our model and how mappings between levels are actually implemented, we will consider a number of specific cases. In particular, we will focus on the those apparently involving iterative application of rules: Slovak shortening, Gidabal shortening, and vowel harmony in Yawelmani. Our challenge is obviously to provide alternative accounts of those cases involving intra-level rules in Lakoff's theory. We believe that the clustering mechanism allows us to do this. Finally, the complex rule interactions in Icelandic will be addressed, and we will show that our theory, though very tightly constrained, can handle this case as well.

I describe a framework called the interactive activation framework that embeds this key assumption among others, including the assumption that influences from different sources are combined non-linearly. This non-linearity means that information that may be decisive under some circumstances have little or no effect under other conditions. Two attempts to rule out an interactive account in favor of models in which individual components of the language processing system act autonomously are considered in light of the interactive activation framework. In both cases, the facts are as expected from the principles of interactive activation. In general, existing facts do not rule out an interactive account, but they do not require one either. To demonstrate that more definitive tests of interaction are possible. I describe an experiment that demonstrates a new kind of influence of a higher level factor (lexical membership) a lower level of processing (phoneme identification). The experiment illustrates one reason why feedback from higher levels is computationally desirable; it allows lower levels to be tuned by contextual factors so that they can supply more accurate information to higher levels."

Each word was presented repeatedly, and its presentation time (duration from the onset of the word) increased at each successive pass. After each pass, subjects were asked to write down the word being presented and to indicate how confident they were about each guess. In addition to replicating a frequency, a context, and a word-length effect, this \u201cgating\u201d paradigm allowed us to study more closely the narrowing-in process employed by listeners in the isolation and recognition of words: Some delay appears to exist between the moment a word is isolated from other word candidates and the moment it is recognized; word candidates differ in number and in type from one context to the other; and, like syntactic processing, word recognition is strewn with garden paths. The active direct access model proposed by Marslen-Wilson and Welsh is discussed in light of these findings."

If successful, these analyses of connectionist networks may provide us with a new vocabulary for understanding information processing. We may learn new ways in whch information can be explicit or implicit, and we may learn new notations for expressing the rules that underlie cognition. The notation of these new connectionist rules may look very different than that used in, for example, production rules. And we may expect that the notation will not lend itself to describing all types of regularity with equal facility. Thus, the potential important difference between connectionist models and Classical models will not be in whether one or the other systems contains rules, or whether one system encodes information explcitly and the other encodes it implicitly; the difference will lie in the nature of the rules, and in what kinds of information count as explicitly present. This potential difference brings us to the second issue: computational power. The issue divides into two considerations. Do connectionist models provide sufficient computational power (to account for cognitive phenomena); and do they provide the appropriate sort of computational power? The first question can be answered affirmatively with an important qualification. It can be shown that multilayer feedforward networks with as few as one hidden layer, with no squashing at the output and an arbitrary nonlinear activation function at the hidden layer, are capable of arbitrarily accurate approximation of arbitrary mappings. They thus belong to a class of universal approximators (Hornik, Stinchcombe, & White, in press; Stinchcombe & White, 1989). Pollack (1988) has also proven the Turing equivalence of neural networks. In principle, then, such networks are capable of implementing any function that the Classical system can implement. The important qualification to the above results is that sufficiently many hidden units be provided (or in the case of Pollack's proof, that weights be inifinite precision). What is not currently known is effect of limited resources on computational power. Since human cognition is carried out in a system with relatively fixed and limited resources, this question is of paramount interest. These limitations provide critical constraints on the nature of the functions which can be mapped; it is an important empirical question whether these constraints explain the specific form of human cognition. It is in this context that the question of the appropriateness of the computational power becomes interesting. Given limited resources, it is relevant to ask whether the kinds of operations and representations which are naturally made available are those which are likely to figure in human cognition. If one has a theory of cognition which requires sorting of randomly ordered information, e.g., word frequency fists in Forster's (1979) model of lexical access, then it becomes extremely important that the computational framework provide efficient support for the sort operation."

                "text": "Time is at the heart of many pattern recognition tasks (e.g., speech recognition). However, connectionist learning algorithms to date are not well-suited for dealing with time-varying input patterns. This chapter introduces a specialized connectionist architecture and corresponding specialization of the back-propagation learning algorithm that operates efficiently, both in computational time and space requirements, on temporal sequences. The key feature of the architecture is a layer of selfconnected hidden units that integrate their current value with the new input at each time step to construct a static representation of the temporal input sequence. This architecture avoids two deficiencies found in the back-propagation unfolding-intime procedure (Rumelhart, Hinton, & Williams, 1986) for handing sequence recognition tasks: first, it reduces the difficulty of temporal credit assignment by focusing the back-propagated error signal; second, it eliminates the need for a buffer to hold the input sequence and/or intermediate activity levels. The latter property is due to the fact that during the forward (activation) phase, incremental activity traces can be locally computed that hold all information necessary for back propagation in time. It is argued that this architecture should scale better than conventional recurrent architectures with respect to sequence length. The architecture has been used to implement a temporal version of Rumelhart and McClelland's (1986) verb past-tense model. The hidden units learn to behave something like Rumelhart and McClelland's \"Wickelphones,\" a rich and flexible representation of temporal information."

Linguistics, especially transformational grammar, has matured recently at an alarming rate, so that transformational grammarians may seem to have developed increasingly narrow interests and, moreover, to have become so embroiled in the muddy business of securing their own positions, digging themselves in on a narrow front, that whether they are involved in civil war or are continuing to extend the frontiers of linguistic knowledge is often very unclear-even to themselves. I fancy that scarcely a single transformationalist will bother to raise his head as Professor Chafe wings his way overhead firing enthusiastically but erratically in all directions. The outsider is much more likely to notice the high-flier, and he needs some help in assessing the significance of Chafe's sally-perhaps it would not be out of place to give him at the same time some reports from the transformational trenches, and to assure him that all is still well there. I shall assume that he is reasonably familiar with Chomsky's Syntactic Structures1 and the main developments in transformational grammar up to about 1965, when Chomsky published his Aspects of the Theory of Syntax.2 Not that I believe the college English teacher has any (narrow professional) reason to bother much about contemporary linguistics. On the contrary, recent developments in transformational grammar should make it perfectly clear that there is no hope whatever of making direct use of that approach to linguistics in English teaching-at any rate not along the lines of existing attempts. And Chafe's work seems even less relevant."

Such continuous semantic constraints were examined in two experiments in which subjects judged the likelihood of obtaining each of the interpretations of ambiguous sentences. The sentences were factorially generated by independently varying the degree to which semantic constraints for each interpretation were satisfied. In one experiment, the semantic constraints were manipulated by varying critical words within the ambiguous sentence; in the other experiment, a preceding context sentence was used. The results of both experiments supported the hypotheses that the judged likelihood was a direct function of the relative sensibleness of the interpretations, that semantic constraints determined the degree of sensibleness of each interpretation, and that these semantic constraints are continuous restrictions which are independent of each other and stable from sentence to sentence in which they occur."

                "text": "Over the last 10 years, the assimilation process referred to as vowel harmony has served as a test case for a number of proposals in phonological theory. Current autosegmental approaches successfully capture the intuition that vowel harmony is a dynamic process involving the interaction of a sequence of vowels; still, no theoretical analysis has offered a non-stipulative account of the inconsistent behavior of the so-called \u2018transparent\u2019, or disharmonic, segments. This paper proposes a connectionist processing account of the vowel harmony phenomenon, using data from Hungarian. The strength of this account is that it demonstrates that the same general principle of assimilation which underlies the behavior of the \u2018harmonic\u2019 forms accounts as well for the apparently exceptional \u2018transparent\u2019 cases, without stipulation. The account proceeds in three steps. After presenting the data and current theoretical analyses, the paper describes the model of sequential processing introduced by Jordan (1986), and motivates this as a model of assimilation processes in phonology. The paper then presents the results of a series of parametric studies that were run with this model, using arbitrary bit patterns as stimuli. These results establish certain conditions on assimilation in a network of this type. Finally, these findings are related to the Hungarian data, where the same conditions are shown to predict the correct pattern of behavior for both harmonic and transparent vowels."

The basic idea is to iteratively train the network to a certain performance criterion, compute a measure of relevance that identifies which input or hidden units are most critical to performance, and automatically trim the least relevant units. This skeletonization technique can be used to simplify networks by eliminating units that convey redundant information; to improve learning performance by first learning with spare hidden units and then trimming the unnecessary ones away, thereby constraining generalization; and to understand the behavior of networks in terms of minimal \"rules.\""

White (Univ. of California at San Diego, Dept. of Economics Discussion Paper, June 1988; to appear in Neural Networks) showed that multilayer feedforward networks with as few as one hidden layer, no squashing at the output layer, and arbitrary sigmoid activation function at the hidden layer are universal approximators: they are capable of arbitrarily accurate approximation to arbitrary mappings, provided sufficiently many hidden units are available. The present authors obtain identical conclusions but do not require the hidden-unit activation to be sigmoid. Instead, it can be a rather general nonlinear function. Thus, multilayer feedforward networks possess universal approximation capabilities by virtue of the presence of intermediate layers with sufficiently many parallel processors; the properties of the intermediate-layer activation function are not so crucial. In particular, sigmoid activation functions are not necessary for universal approximation.<<ETX>>"
