Tentative correspondences are established by matching photometrically normalised colour measurements represented in a local affine frame. The affine frames are obtained by a number of affine invariant constructions on robustly detected, maximally stable extremal regions of data-dependent shape. Several processes for local affine frame construction are proposed and proved affine covariant. The potential of the proposed approach is demonstrated on demanding wide-baseline matching problems. Correspondence between two views taken from different viewpoints and camera orientations as well as at very different scales is reliably established. For the scale change present (a factor more than 3), the zoomed-in image covers less than 10% of the wider view."

We propose an algorithm which is capable of handling larger changes in viewpoint than classical correlation based techniques. Optimal performance for the algorithm is achieved for textured objects which are locally planar in at least one direction. The algorithm works by computing affinely invariant fourier features from intensity profiles in each image. The intensity profiles are extracted from the image data between randomly selected pairs of image interest points. Using a voting scheme, pairs of interest points are matched across images by comparing vectors of fourier features. Outliers among the matches are rejected in two stages, a fast stage using novel view consistency constraints, and a second, slower stage using RANSAC and fundamental matrix computation. In order to demonstrate the quality of the results, the algorithm is tested on several different image pairs."

This facilitates matching between quite disparate views-wide baseline stereo. Two extensions are made to the current small baseline algorithms: first, and most importantly, a viewpoint invariant measure is developed for assessing the affinity of corner neighbourhoods over image pairs; second, algorithms are given for generating putative corner matches between image pairs using local homographies. Two novel infrastructure developments are also described: the automatic generation of local homographies, and the combination of possibly conflicting sets of matches prior to RANSAC estimation. The wide baseline matching algorithm is demonstrated on a number of image pairs with varying relative motion, and for different scene types. All processing is automatic."

It is applicable to texture patches which are locally planar and have stationary statistics. The novelty of the descriptor is that it is based on statistics aggregated over the region, resulting in richer and more stable descriptors than those computed at a point. Two texture matching applications of this descriptor are demonstrated: (1) it is used to automatically identify, regions of the same type of texture, but with varying surface pose, within a single image; (2) it is used to support wide baseline stereo, i.e. to enable the automatic computation of the epipolar geometry between two images acquired from quite separated viewpoints. Results are presented on several sets of real images."

Unlike conventional stereo matching approaches we assume no prior knowledge about the relative camera positions and orientations. In fact in our application this is the information we wish to determine from the image feature matches. Features are detected in two or more images and characterised using affine texture invariants. The problem of window effects is explicitly addressed by our method-our feature characterisation is invariant to linear transformations of the image data including rotation, stretch and skew. The feature matching process is optimised for a structure-from-motion application where we wish to ignore unreliable matches at the expense of reducing the number of feature matches."

Our method can deal with significant affine transformations including large scale changes. Such transformations introduce significant changes in the point location as well as in the scale and the shape of the neighbourhood of an interest point. Our approach allows to solve for these problems simultaneously. It is based on three key ideas : 1) The second moment matrix computed in a point can be used to normalize a region in an affine invariant way (skew and stretch). 2) The scale of the local structure is indicated by local extrema of normalized derivatives over scale. 3) An affine-adapted Harris detector determines the location of interest points. A multi-scale version of this detector is used for initialization. An iterative algorithm then modifies location, scale and neighbourhood of each point and converges to affine invariant points. For matching and recognition, the image is characterized by a set of affine invariant points; the affine transformation associated with each point allows the computation of an affine invariant descriptor which is also invariant to affine illumination changes. A quantitative comparison of our detector with existing ones shows a significant improvement in the presence of large affine deformations. Experimental results for wide baseline matching show an excellent performance in the presence of large perspective transformations including significant scale changes. Results for recognition are very good for a database with more than 5000 images."

The features are invariant to image scaling, translation, and rotation, and partially invariant to illumination changes and affine or 3D projection. These features share similar properties with neurons in inferior temporal cortex that are used for object recognition in primate vision. Features are efficiently detected through a staged filtering approach that identifies stable points in scale space. Image keys are created that allow for local geometric deformations by representing blurred image gradients in multiple orientation planes and at multiple scales. The keys are used as input to a nearest neighbor indexing method that identifies candidate object matches. Final verification of each match is achieved by finding a low residual least squares solution for the unknown model parameters. Experimental results show that robust object recognition can be achieved in cluttered partially occluded images with a computation time of under 2 seconds."

(2) Local extrema over scale of normalized derivatives indicate the presence of characteristic local structures. Our method first computes a multi-scale representation for the Harris interest point detector. We then select points at which a local measure (the Laplacian) is maximal over scales. This allows a selection of distinctive points for which the characteristic scale is known. These points are invariant to scale, rotation and translation as well as robust to illumination changes and limited changes of viewpoint. For indexing, the image is characterized by a set of scale invariant points; the scale associated with each point allows the computation of a scale invariant descriptor. Our descriptors are, in addition, invariant to image rotation, of affine illumination changes and robust to small perspective deformations. Experimental results for indexing show an excellent performance up to a scale factor of 4 for a database with more than 5000 images."

This oriented epipolar constraint requires knowing the orientations (signs of overall scales) of epipoles and fundamental matrix. The current belief is that these orientations cannot be obtained from the fundamental matrix only and that additional information is needed, typically, a single correct pointcorrespondence. In contrary to this, we show that fundamental matrix alone encodes orientation of epipoles up to their common scale sign. We present two formulations of this fact. The algebraic formulation gives a closed formula to compute the second epipole from fundamental matrix and the first epipole. The geometric formulation is in terms of the conic formed by intersections of corresponding epipolar lines in the commonimage plane; we showthat the epipolesalways lie on different antipodal components of the spherical interpretation of this conic. Further, we show that, under mild assumptions, fundamental matrix can discriminate between two classes of mutual position of a pair of directional cameras."

On the premise that changes in resolution act as a smoothing equivalent to changes in scale, a scale-space representation of the high-resolution image is produced. Hence the one-to-one classical image matching paradigm becomes one-to-many because the low-resolution image is compared with all the scale-space representations of the high-resolution one. Key to the success of such a process is the proper representation of the features to be matched in scale-space. We show how to extract interest points at variable scales and we devise a method allowing the comparison of two images at two different resolutions. The method comprises the use of photometric- and rotation-invariant descriptors, a geometric model mapping the high-resolution image onto a low-resolution image region, and an image matching strategy based on the robust estimation of this geometric model. Extensive experiments show that our matching method can be used for scale changes up to a factor 6."

In contrast in the case of widely separated views, methods have generally been restricted to two or three views.In this paper we investigate the problem of establishing relative viewpoints given a large number of images where no ordering information is provided. A typical application would be where images are obtained from different sources or at different times: both the viewpoint (position, orientation, scale) and lighting conditions may vary significantly over the data set.Such a problem is not fundamentally amenable to exhaustive pair wise and triplet wide baseline matching because this would be prohibitively expensive as the number of views increases. Instead, we investiate how a combination of image invariants, covariants, and multiple view relations can be used in concord to enable efficient multiple view matching. The result is a matching algorithm which is linear in the number of views.The methods are illustrated on several real image data sets. The output enables an image based technique for navigating in a 3D scene, moving from one image to whichever image is the next most appropriate."

The new features are based on moments of powers of the intensities in the individual color bands and combinations thereof. These moments implicitly characterize the shape, the intensity and the color distribution of the pattern in a uniform manner. The paper gives a classification of all functions of such moments which are invariant under both affine deformations of the pattern (thus achieving viewpoint invariance) as well as linear changes of the intensity values of the color bands (hence, coping with changes in the irradiance pattern due to different lighting conditions and/or viewpoints). The discriminant power and classification performance of the new invariants for color pattern recognition is tested on a data set of images of outdoors advertising panels. A comparison to moment invariants presented in literature is included as well."

Given a scene consisting of one or more objects, can we identify and localize those objects that are sufficiently visible to the sensory system? It is generally assumed that a description of each object to be recognized is available to the computer and can be used to facilitate the task of identification and localization. These descriptions can either be model-based or appearance-based, or a combination of both. Model-based object representation is based on geometric features, whereas appearance-based representation uses a large set of images for training but does not require any insight on the geometric structure of the objects. Object recognition is a key component of many intelligent vision systems, such as those used in hand-eye coordination for bin picking, inspection, and mobile robotics."

A review of watersheds and related motion is first presented, and the major methods to determine watersheds are discussed. The algorithm is based on an immersion process analogy, in which the flooding of the water in the picture is efficiently simulated using of queue of pixel. It is described in detail provided in a pseudo C language. The accuracy of this algorithm is proven to be superior to that of the existing implementations, and it is shown that its adaptation to any kind of digital grid and its generalization to n-dimensional images (and even to graphs) are straightforward. The algorithm is reported to be faster than any other watershed algorithm. Applications of this algorithm with regard to picture segmentation are presented for magnetic resonance (MR) imagery and for digital elevation models. An example of 3-D watershed is also provided. >"
