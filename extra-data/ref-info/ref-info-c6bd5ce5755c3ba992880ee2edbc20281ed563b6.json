                "text": "D'Arcy Thompson's method of Cartesian transformations can be adapted to the biometric study of group differences and trends in shape. The key to this extension is the symmetric tensor, a mathematical representation of the linear deformation taking one triangle onto another. These tensors may easily be computed from data that come in the form of Cartesian coordinates of homologous landmarks, such as are customary in roentgenographic cephalometrics. This article shows how the tensors make possible the rigorous statistical analysis of populations of shapes without requiring the specification of particular shape measures in advance. Instead, the findings of a study include the extraction of particular shape measures most clearly manifesting the group difference or treatment effect under study. Only conventional multivariate statistical techniques, such as Hotelling's T2, are involved. Configurations of many landmarks can be analysed via the display of their mean difference as a biorthogonal grid pair, perusal of which leads to the selection of triangles of landmarks for more rigorous analysis. The techniques are exemplified in two cephalometric studies: the description and prediction of normal craniofacial growth, and a comparison of the craniofacial deformities associated with Apert's and Crouzon's syndromes."

Isometry, or independence of shape and size, is defined as the independence of some (all) shape vector(s) from a particular size variable. With mild restrictions it is shown that isometry is possible with respect to at most one size variable, or in other words that shape will always be related to a variety of size variables. The choice of a size variable is a hitherto neglected, but important, part of an allometric study. The use of functional relationships in allometry is contrasted with the approach developed here. Also, size and shape variables are used in characterizations of the lognormal, gamma and generalized gamma distributions. The results, given in a biological context, are of interest in size and shape studies generally."

The bivariate case has been studied intensively for nearly fifty years, with attention devoted almost exclusively to the so-called simple allometry equation which implies a linear relationship between logarithms of the two size measurements. Multivariate generalizations of the bivariate concepts present difficulties that have not been fully resolved. These concern questions about appropriate generalizations from 2 to p dimensions. This paper reviews some of the more important work on allometry and related problems. Comments on the various approaches are made and some suggestions are given for future research. Alternative approaches to studies of size and shape are briefly mentioned, and it is suggested that at least one of these is likely to be more useful biologically in a certain type of study than the conventional approach through allometry."

Considerations of similarity must include the scalar effects of size and material, the conversion of proportions as descriptive geometric dimensions to those useful numerical values that will be represented as ratios of measured distance (relative or compared against a standard), and, by no means insignificant, the judgment about the design or functional geometry implicit in the static as well as dynamic systems being measured.

In this paper we present new statistical methods for the study of size and shape, and use these methods to study the morphology of red-winged blackbirds, Agelaius phoeniceus, breeding in Florida. We use definitions of size and shape variables that permit the study of the entire statistical distribution of a given variable. We offer these methods as an alternative to classical methods based on the allometric equation in which relations are summarized in single coefficients reflecting at best the mean trend of shape with some size variables. Our alternative goal is to determine visually and geometrically meaningful size and shape variables which permit the direct study of the association of size and shape. This paper is in two parts. In the first part we discuss definitions of size and shape variables and summarize statistical results which include exact tests for sizeshape associations (Mosimann, 1970, 1975a, 1975b). In the second part we use these methods to study geographic variation in red-winged blackbirds in Florida. Throughout we consider the following situation: N individuals are independently sampled from some population. For each individual there are k positive measurements, all in the same units, say millimeters. For the i-th individual we then"

In most fields, the advent of quantification is followed a few years later by a systematization of the exploratory quantitative styles. At that time one encounters studies of the nature of information captured and discarded by the various conventions, general families of mathematical or statistical models mimicking relevant behaviors of the natural phenomena under study, and so forth: in short, the contemplation of foundations. In morphometrics this passage to introspection has not occurred. There is one classic in the field, D'Arcy Thompson's On Growth and Form (80), which argues that form should be modelled as the expression of physical laws. This stance, now badly dated, has not been replaced by any other consistent point of view. The only more recent paper I have encountered that speaks of a discipline for information captured in the course of morphometric investigation is Green's critique of methods for studying axial growth in plants (36). Otherwise, the morphometric literature is entirely application-oriented rather than methodological. In this essay I attempt a preliminary remedy: a framework into which specific morphometric methods can be fitted (with more or less difficulty, as will become clear from my section headings). The rationale for that framework lies in a duality underlying comparisons among biologic forms."

Shih 2009-03-23 In the development of digital multimedia, the importance and impact of image processing and mathematical morphology are well documented in areas ranging from automated vision detection and inspection to object recognition, image analysis and pattern recognition. Those working in these ever-evolving fields require a solid grasp of basic fundamentals, theory, and related applications\u2014and few books can provide the unique tools for learning contained in this text. Image Processing and Mathematical Morphology: Fundamentals and Applications is a comprehensive, wide-ranging overview of morphological mechanisms and techniques and their relation to image processing. More than merely a tutorial on vital technical information, the book places this knowledge into a theoretical framework. This helps readers analyze key principles and architectures and then use the author\u2019s novel ideas on implementation of advanced algorithms to formulate a practical and detailed plan to develop and foster their own ideas. The book: Presents the history and state-of-the-art techniques related to image morphological processing, with numerous practical examples Gives readers a clear tutorial on complex technology and other tools that rely on their intuition for a clear understanding of the subject Includes an updated bibliography and useful graphs and illustrations Examines several new algorithms in great detail so that readers can adapt them to derive their own solution approaches This invaluable reference helps readers assess and simplify problems and their essential requirements and complexities, giving them all the necessary data and methodology to master current theoretical developments and applications, as well as create new ones."

It is like one of Darwin's books, well-considered, patiently wrought-out, learned, and cautious-a disclosure of the scientific spirit. It is an application of some of the concepts of physical science and sundry mathematical methods to the study of organic form. \u201cMy sole purpose is to correlate with mathematical statement and physical law certain of the simpler outward phenomena of organic growth and structure or form: while all the while regarding, ex hypothesi, for the purposes of this correlation, the fabric of the organism as a material and mechanical configuration.\u201d \u201cOf how it is that the soul informs the body, physical science teaches me nothing. \u2026 But of the construction and growth and working of the body, as of all that is of the earth earthy, physical science is, in my humble opinion, our only teacher and guide.\u201d We think that it will be difficult to justify the word \u201conly,\u201d for in the working of the body the soul (to use the author's dualistic terminology) takes part, as when a strong emotion influences our suprarenals, and, willy-nilly, we are back in psycho-biology: On Growth and Form.

Subsets of offspring were examined to assess the relationship of self-reported maternal alcohol use to infant health and development. Multiple regression statistical tests were utilized to permit adjustment for other possibly confounding factors. The following are among those outcomes significantly related to increase maternal alcohol use after adjusting for smoking and other variables: smaller infant size (birth weight, length and head circumference); lower Apgar scores; poorer neonatal habituation; decreased sucking pressure; increased tremulousness and head-turns-to-left; decreased vigorous activity; and a higher frequency of minor dysmorphic characteristics combined with low birth weight and microcephaly. A drinking by smoking interaction was related to poorer newborn conditioning in two separate studies. Significantly lower mental and motor development and lower length and weight were found on follow-up of 468 infants at age 8 months. Follow-up studies continue."
