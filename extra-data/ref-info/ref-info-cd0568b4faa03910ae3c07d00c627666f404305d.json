                "text": "Speech recognition must contend with the statistical and sequential nature of the human speech production system. Hidden Markov Models (HMM) provide a powerful method to cope with both of these, and their use made a breakthrough in speech recognition. However, the a priori choice of a model topology and weak discriminative power limit HMM capabilities. Recently, connectionist models have been recognized as an alternative tool. Their main useful properties lie in their discriminative power while capturing input-output relations. They have also proved useful in dealing with statistical data. However, the sequential aspect remains difficult to handle in connectionist models. The statistical use of a particular classic form of a connectionist system, the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), is described in the context of the recognition of continuous speech. Relations with Hidden Markov Models are explained and preliminary results are reported."

By the use of two hidden layers in addition to an input and output layer it is capable of representing complex nonlinear decision surfaces. Three important properties of the TDNNs have been observed. First, it was able to invent without human interference meaningful linguistic abstractions in time and frequency such as formant tracking and segmentation. Second, it has learned to form alternate representations linking different acoustic events with the same higher level concept. In this fashion it can implement trading relations between lower level acoustic events leading to robust recognition performance despite considerable variability in the input speech. Third, the network is translation-invariant and does not rely on precise alignment or segmentation of the input. The TDNNs performance is compared with the best of hidden Markov models (HMMs) on a speaker-dependent phoneme-recognition task. The TDNN achieved a recognition of 98.5% compared to 93.7% for the HMM, i.e., a fourfold reduction in error.<<ETX>>"

The concept of continuous mixture densities is applied to the emission probability density functions of hidden Markov models for phonemes in order to take into account phonetic-context dependencies. It is shown that the advantage of continuous mixture densities is the ability to lead to parameter estimates that are accurate and at the same time robust with respect to the limited amount of training data. Training and recognition algorithms for mixture densities in the framework of phoneme modelling are described. Recognition results for a 917-word task, requiring only 7 min of speech for training and an overlap of 43 words between training vocabulary and test vocabulary, are presented.<<ETX>>"

The choice of the parameters for the multi-layer perceptron is discussed and experimental results are reported. A comparison is made with established techniques such as dynamic time-warping and hidden Markov modelling applied to the same data. The results, for this particular task, show that the recognition accuracy obtained using the multi-layer perceptron is comparable with that from using hidden Markov modelling."

Classifier error rate as a function of training set size was tested for synthetic data drawn from several different probability distributions. In cases where the true distributions were poorly modeled, ANN was significantly better than BGM. In some cases, ANN was also better than KNN. Similar experiments were performed on a voiced/unvoiced speech classification task. ANN had a lower error rate than KNN or BGM for all training set sizes, although BGM approached the ANN error rate as the training set became larger. It is concluded that there are pattern classification tasks in which an ANN is able to make better use of training data to achieve a lower error rate with a particular size training set.<<ETX>>"
