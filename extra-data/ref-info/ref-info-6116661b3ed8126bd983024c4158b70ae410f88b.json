The major restriction is that the energy function's smoothness term must only involve pairs of pixels. We propose two algorithms that use graph cuts to compute a local minimum even when very large moves are allowed. The first move we consider is an /spl alpha/-/spl beta/-swap: for a pair of labels /spl alpha/,/spl beta/, this move exchanges the labels between an arbitrary set of pixels labeled a and another arbitrary set labeled /spl beta/. Our first algorithm generates a labeling such that there is no swap move that decreases the energy. The second move we consider is an /spl alpha/-expansion: for a label a, this move assigns an arbitrary set of pixels the label /spl alpha/. Our second algorithm, which requires the smoothness term to be a metric, generates a labeling such that there is no expansion move that decreases the energy. Moreover, this solution is within a known factor of the global minimum. We experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on image restoration, stereo and motion."

Once solved, the minimum-cut associated to the maximum-flow yields a disparity surface for the whole image at once. This global approach to stereo analysis provides a more accurate and coherent depth map than the traditional line-by-line stereo. Moreover, the optimality of the depth surface is guaranteed and can be shown to be a generalization of the dynamic programming approach that is widely used in standard stereo. Results show improved depth estimation as well as better handling of depth discontinuities. While the worst case running time is O(n/sup 2/d/sup 2/log(nd)), the observed average running time is O(n/sup 1.2/ d/sup 1.3/) for an image size of n pixels and depth resolution d."

Our main intuition is that any cut on a graph embedded in some continuous space can be interpreted as a contour (in 2D) or a surface (in 3D). We show how to build a grid graph and set its edge weights so that the cost of cuts is arbitrarily close to the length (area) of the corresponding contours (surfaces) for any anisotropic Riemannian metric. There are two interesting consequences of this technical result. First, graph cut algorithms can be used to find globally minimum geodesic contours (minimal surfaces in 3D) under arbitrary Riemannian metric for a given set of boundary conditions. Second, we show how to minimize metrication artifacts in existing graph-cut based methods in vision. Theoretically speaking, our work provides an interesting link between several branches of mathematics -differential geometry, integral geometry, and combinatorial optimization. The main technical problem is solved using Cauchy-Crofton formula from integral geometry."

We show that the sparse graph, or skeleton, that arises when we randomly sample a graph's edges will accurately approximate the value of all cuts in the original graph with high probability. This makes sampling effective for problems involving cuts in graphs. We present fast randomized (Monte Carlo and Las Vegas) algorithms for approximating and exactly finding minimum cuts and maximum flows in unweighted, undirected graphs. Our cut-approximation algorithms extend unchanged to weighted graphs while our weighted-graph flow algorithms are somewhat slower. Our approach gives a general paradigm with potential applications to any packing problem. It has since been used in a near-linear time algorithm for finding minimum cuts, as well as faster cut and flow algorithms. Our sampling theorems also yield faster algorithms for several other cut-based problems, including approximating the best balanced cut of a graph, finding a k-connected orientation of a 2k-connected graph, and finding integral multicommodity flows in graphs with a great deal of excess capacity. Our methods also improve the efficiency of some parallel cut and flow algorithms. Our methods also apply to the network design problem, where we wish to build a network satisfying certain connectivity requirements between vertices. We can purchase edges of various costs and wish to satisfy the requirements at minimum total cost. Since our sampling theorems apply even when the sampling probabilities are different for different edges, we can apply randomized rounding to solve network design problems. This gives approximation algorithms that guarantee much better approximations than previous algorithms whenever the minimum connectivity requirement is large. As a particular example, we improve the best approximation bound for the minimum k-connected subgraph problem from 1.85 to 1 + O(V/log n)lk)."

The data to be clustered are represented by an undirected adjacency graph G with arc capacities assigned to reflect the similarity between the linked vertices. Clustering is achieved by removing arcs of G to form mutually exclusive subgraphs such that the largest inter-subgraph maximum flow is minimized. For graphs of moderate size ( approximately 2000 vertices), the optimal solution is obtained through partitioning a flow and cut equivalent tree of G, which can be efficiently constructed using the Gomory-Hu algorithm (1961). However for larger graphs this approach is impractical. New theorems for subgraph condensation are derived and are then used to develop a fast algorithm which hierarchically constructs and partitions a partially equivalent tree of much reduced size. This algorithm results in an optimal solution equivalent to that obtained by partitioning the complete equivalent tree and is able to handle very large graphs with several hundred thousand vertices. The new clustering algorithm is applied to the image segmentation problem. The segmentation is achieved by effectively searching for closed contours of edge elements (equivalent to minimum cuts in G), which consist mostly of strong edges, while rejecting contours containing isolated strong edges. This method is able to accurately locate region boundaries and at the same time guarantees the formation of closed edge contours. >"

An alternative method based on the <italic>preflow</italic> concept of Karzanov is introduced. A preflow is like a flow, except that the total amount flowing into a vertex is allowed to exceed the total amount flowing out. The method maintains a preflow in the original network and pushes local flow excess toward the sink along what are estimated to be shortest paths. The algorithm and its analysis are simple and intuitive, yet the algorithm runs as fast as any other known method on dense graphs, achieving an <italic>O</italic>(<italic>n</italic><supscrpt>3</supscrpt>) time bound on an <italic>n</italic>-vertex graph. By incorporating the dynamic tree data structure of Sleator and Tarjan, we obtain a version of the algorithm running in <italic>O</italic>(<italic>nm</italic> log(<italic>n</italic><supscrpt>2</supscrpt>/<italic>m</italic>)) time on an <italic>n</italic>-vertex, <italic>m</italic>-edge graph. This is as fast as any known method for any graph density and faster on graphs of moderate density. The algorithm also admits efficient distributed and parallel implementations. A parallel implementation running in <italic>O</italic>(<italic>n</italic><supscrpt>2</supscrpt>log <italic>n</italic>) time using <italic>n</italic> processors and <italic>O</italic>(<italic>m</italic>) space is obtained. This time bound matches that of the Shiloach-Vishkin algorithm, which also uses <italic>n</italic> processors but requires <italic>O</italic>(<italic>n</italic><supscrpt>2</supscrpt>) space."

Multi-camera scene reconstruction is a natural generalization of the stereo matching problem. However, it is much more difficult than stereo, primarily due to the difficulty of reasoning about visibility. In this paper, we take an approach that has yielded excellent results for stereo, namely energy minimization via graph cuts. We first give an energy minimization formulation of the multi-camera scene reconstruction problem. The energy that we minimize treats the input images symmetrically, handles visibility properly, and imposes spatial smoothness while preserving discontinuities. As the energy function is NP-hard to minimize exactly, we give a graph cut algorithm that computes a local minimum in a strong sense. We handle all camera configurations where voxel coloring can be used, which is a large and natural class. Experimental data demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach."

The global optimum for this problem can be efficiently solved for using the maximum flow computation in a graph.

In this paper we propose an experimental comparison of several different stereo algorithms. We use real imagery, and explore two different methodologies, with different strengths and weaknesses. Our first methodology is based upon manual computation of dense ground truth. Here we make use of a two stereo pairs: one of these, from the University of Tsukuba, contains mostly fronto-parallel surfaces; while the other, which we built, is a simple scene with a slanted surface. Our second methodology uses the notion of prediction error, which is the ability of a disparity map to predict an (unseen) third image, taken from a known camera position with respect to the input pair. We present results for both correlation-style stereo algorithms and techniques based on global methods such as energy minimization. Our experiments suggest that the two methodologies give qualitatively consistent results. Source images and additional materials, such as the implementations of various algorithms, are available on the web from http://www.research.microsoft.com/~szeliski/stereo."

This transformation effectively removes explicit use of epipolar geometry, thus allowing direct use of multiple cameras with arbitrary geometries. The maximum-flow, solved both efficiently and globally, yields a minimum-cut that corresponds to a disparity surface for the whole image at once. This global and efficient approach to stereo analysis allows the reconstruction to proceed in an arbitrary volume of space and provides a more accurate and coherent depth map than the traditional stereo algorithms. In particular, smoothness is applied uniformly instead of only along epipolar lines, while the global optimality of the depth surface is guaranteed. Results show improved depth estimation as well as better handling of depth discontinuities. While the worst case running time is O(n1.5 d1.5 log(nd)), the observed average running time is O(n1.2 d1.3) for an image size of n pixels and depth resolution d."

By segmentation, we mean a map from the set of pixels to a small set of levels such that each connected component of the set of pixels with the same level forms a relatively large and \"meaningful\" region. The method finds a set of levels with associated gray values by first finding junctions in the image and then seeking a minimum set of threshold values that preserves the junctions. Then it finds a segmentation map that maps each pixel to the level with the closest gray value to the pixel data, within a smoothness constraint. For a convex smoothing penalty, we show the global optimal solution for an energy function that fits the data can be obtained in a polynomial time, by a novel use of the maximum-flow algorithm. Our approach is in contrast to a view in computer vision where segmentation is driven by intensity, gradient, usually not yielding closed boundaries."

The topology of our segmentation is unrestricted and both \"object\" and \"background\" segments may consist of several isolated parts.

In our approach, patch regions from a sample image or video are transformed and copied to the output and then stitched together along optimal seams to generate a new (and typically larger) output. In contrast to other techniques, the size of the patch is not chosen a-priori, but instead a graph cut technique is used to determine the optimal patch region for any given offset between the input and output texture. Unlike dynamic programming, our graph cut technique for seam optimization is applicable in any dimension. We specifically explore it in 2D and 3D to perform video texture synthesis in addition to regular image synthesis. We present approximative offset search techniques that work well in conjunction with the presented patch size optimization. We show results for synthesizing regular, random, and natural images and videos. We also demonstrate how this method can be used to interactively merge different images to generate new scenes."

Our main tool is separation of each pixel p from a special point outside the image by a cut of a minimum cost. Such a cut creates a group of pixels C/sub p/ around each pixel. We show that these groups C/sub p/ are either disjoint or nested in each other and so they give a natural segmentation of the image. In addition this property allows an efficient implementation of the algorithms because for most pixels p the computation of C/sub p/ is not performed on the whole graph. We inspect all C/sub p/ and discard those which are not interesting, for example if they are too small. This procedure automatically groups small components together or merges them into nearby large clusters. Effectively, our segmentation is performed by extracting significant non-intersecting closed contours. We present interesting segmentation results on real and artificial images."

While a large number of algorithms for stereo correspondence have been developed, relatively little work has been done on characterizing their performance. In this paper, we present a taxonomy of dense, two-frame stereo methods. Our taxonomy is designed to assess the different components and design decisions made in individual stereo algorithms. Using this taxonomy, we compare existing stereo methods and present experiments evaluating the performance of many different variants. In order to establish a common software platform and a collection of data sets for easy evaluation, we have designed a stand-alone, flexible C++ implementation that enables the evaluation of individual components and that can easily be extended to include new algorithms. We have also produced several new multi-frame stereo data sets with ground truth and are making both the code and data sets available on the Web. Finally, we include a comparative evaluation of a large set of today's best-performing stereo algorithms."

In this paper we focus on MRFs with two-valued clique potentials, which form a generalized Potts model. We show that the maximum a posteriori estimate of such an MRF can be obtained by solving a multiway minimum cut problem on a graph. We develop efficient algorithms for computing good approximations to the minimum multiway, cut. The visual correspondence problem can be formulated as an MRF in our framework; this yields quite promising results on real data with ground truth. We also apply our techniques to MRFs with linear clique potentials."

In voxel occupancy, the task is to produce a binary labeling of a set of voxels, that determines which voxels are filled and which are empty. In this paper, we give an energy minimization formulation of the voxel occupancy problem. The global minimum of this energy can be rapidly computed with a single graph cut, using a result due to D. Greig et al. (1989). The energy function we minimize contains a data term and a smoothness term. The data term is a sum over the individual voxels, where the penalty for a voxel is based on the observed intensities of the pixels that intersect it. The smoothness term is the number of empty voxels adjacent to filled ones. Our formulation can be viewed as a generalization of silhouette intersection, with two advantages: we do not compute silhouettes, which are a major source of errors; and we can naturally incorporate spatial smoothness. We give experimental results showing reconstructions from both real and synthetic imagery. Reconstruction using this smoothed energy function is not much more time consuming than simple silhouette intersection; it takes about 10 seconds to reconstruct a one million voxel volume."

While these methods give very strong results in practice, they do not handle occlusions properly. Specifically, they treat the two input images asymmetrically, and they do not ensure that a pixel corresponds to at most one pixel in the other image. In this paper, we present a new method which properly addresses occlusions, while preserving the advantages of graph cut algorithms. We give experimental results for stereo as well as motion, which demonstrate that our method performs well both at detecting occlusions and computing disparities."

                "text": "This book is an introduction to level set methods and dynamic implicit surfaces. These are powerful techniques for analyzing and computing moving fronts in a variety of different settings. While it gives many examples of the utility of the methods to a diverse set of applications, it also gives complete numerical analysis and recipes, which will enable users to quickly apply the techniques to real problems. The book begins with a description of implicit surfaces and their basic properties, then devises the level set geometry and calculus toolbox, including the construction of signed distance functions. Part II adds dynamics to this static calculus. Topics include the level set equation itself, Hamilton-Jacobi equations, motion of a surface normal to itself, re-initialization to a signed distance function, extrapolation in the normal direction, the particle level set method and the motion of co-dimension two (and higher) objects. Part III is concerned with topics taken from the fields of Image Processing and Computer Vision. These include the restoration of images degraded by noise and blur, image segmentation with active contours (snakes), and reconstruction of surfaces from unorganized data points. Part IV is dedicated to Computational Physics. It begins with one phase compressible fluid dynamics, then two-phase compressible flow involving possibly different equations of state, detonation and deflagration waves, and solid/fluid structure interaction. Next it discusses incompressible fluid dynamics, including a computer graphics simulation of smoke, free surface flows, including a computer graphics simulation of water, and fully two-phase incompressible flow. Additional related topics include incompressible flames with applications to computer graphics and coupling a compressible and incompressible fluid. Finally, heat flow and Stefan problems are discussed. A student or researcher working in mathematics, computer graphics, science, or engineering interested in any dynamic moving front, which might change its topology or develop singularities, will find this book interesting and useful."

The speedup is due to the combination of heuristics used in our implementations: we show that the highest-level selection strategy gives better results when combined with both global and gap relabeling heuristics. We also exhibit a family of problems for which the running time of all implementations we consider is quadratic."

Once formulated, the minimization problems are then solved with a variety of algorithmic approaches. These approaches include techniques such as dynamic programming min-cut and alpha-expansion. In this paper we show how an algorithmic technique that constructs a discrete spatial minimal cost surface can be brought to bear on stereo global minimization problems. This problem can then be reduced to a single min-cut problem. We use this approach to solve a new global minimization problem that naturally arises when solving for three-camera (trinocular) stereo. Our formulation treats the three cameras symmetrically, while imposing a natural occlusion cost and uniqueness constraint."

However, in complex and uncontrolled environments, such bottom-up strategies have drawbacks that lead to large misclassification rates. Remedies to this situation include taking into account (1) contextual and application constraints, (2) user input and feedback to incrementally improve the performance of the system. We attempt to incorporate these in the context of pipeline segmentation in industrial images. This problem is of practical importance for the 3D reconstruction of factory environments. However it poses several fundamental challenges mainly due to shading. Highlights and textural variations, etc. Our system performs pipe segmentation by fusing methods from physics-based vision, edge and texture analysis, probabilistic learning and the use of the graph-cut formalism."

A data structure\u2014the disparity space image\u2014is defined to facilitate the description of the effects of occlusion on the stereo matching process and in particular on dynamic programming (DP) solutions that find matches and occlusions simultaneously. We significantly improve upon existing DP stereo matching methods by showing that while some cost must be assigned to unmatched pixels, sensitivity to occlusion-cost and algorithmic complexity can be significantly reduced when highly-reliable matches, or ground control points, are incorporated into the matching process. The use of ground control points eliminates both the need for biasing the process towards a smooth solution and the task of selecting critical prior probabilities describing image formation. Finally, we describe how the detection of intensity edges can be used to bias the recovered solution such that occlusion boundaries will tend to be proposed along such edges, reflecting the observation that occlusion boundaries usually cause intensity discontinuities."

This approach provides an efficienct solution for a wide class of priors that explicitly model dependencies between individual features of an object. These priors capture phenomena such as the fact that unmatched features due to partial occlusion are generally spatially correlated rather than independent. The main focus of this paper is a special case of the framework that yields a particularly efficient approximation method. We call this special case spatially coherent matching (SCM), as it reflects the spatial correlation among neighboring features of an object. The SCM method operates directly on the image feature map, rather than relying on the graph-based methods used in the general framework. We present some Monte Carlo experiments showing that SCM yields substantial improvements over Hausdorff matching for cluttered scenes and partially occluded objects."

The models and algorithms introduced in Flows in Networks are used widely today in the fields of transportation systems, manufacturing, inventory planning, image processing, and Internet traffic. The techniques presented by Ford and Fulkerson spurred the development of powerful computational tools for solving and analyzing network flow models, and also furthered the understanding of linear programming. In addition, the book helped illuminate and unify results in combinatorial mathematics while emphasizing proofs based on computationally efficient construction. Flows in Networks is rich with insights that remain relevant to current research in engineering, management, and other sciences. This landmark work belongs on the bookshelf of every researcher working with networks."

                "text": "In previous work a novel information-theoretic approach was introduced for calculating the activation map for fMRI analysis [Tsai et al, 1999]. In that work the use of mutual information as a measure of activation resulted in a nonparametric calculation of the activation map. Nonparametric approaches are attractive as the implicit assumptions are milder than the strong assumptions of popular approaches based on the general linear model popularized by Friston et al [1994]. Here we show that, in addition to the intuitive information-theoretic appeal, such an application of mutual information is equivalent to a hypothesis test when the underlying densities are unknown. Furthermore we incorporate local spatial priors using the well-known Ising model thereby dropping the implicit assumption that neighboring voxel time-series are independent. As a consequence of the hypothesis testing equivalence, calculation of the activation map with local spatial priors can be formulated as mincut/maxflow graph-cutting problem. Such problems can be solved in polynomial time by the Ford and Fulkerson method. Empirical results are presented on three fMRI datasets measuring motor, auditory, and visual cortex activation. Comparisons are made illustrating the differences between the proposed technique and one based on the general linear model."

Each of these techniques constructs a graph such that the minimum cut on the graph also minimizes the energy. Yet, because these graph constructions are complex and highly specific to a particular energy function, graph cuts have seen limited application to date. In this paper, we give a characterization of the energy functions that can be minimized by graph cuts. Our results are restricted to functions of binary variables. However, our work generalizes many previous constructions and is easily applicable to vision problems that involve large numbers of labels, such as stereo, motion, image restoration, and scene reconstruction. We give a precise characterization of what energy functions can be minimized using graph cuts, among the energy functions that can be written as a sum of terms containing three or fewer binary variables. We also provide a general-purpose construction to minimize such an energy function. Finally, we give a necessary condition for any energy function of binary variables to be minimized by graph cuts. Researchers who are considering the use of graph cuts to optimize a particular energy function can use our results to determine if this is possible and then follow our construction to create the appropriate graph. A software implementation is freely available."
