With the size of these collections growing to thousands of hours, technology is needed to effectively browse segments in a short time without losing the content of the video. We propose a method to extract the significant audio and video information and create a \u201cskim\u201d video which represents a short synopsis of the original. The extraction of significant information, such as specific objects, audio keywords and relevant video structure, is made possible through the integration of techniques in image and language understanding. The resulting skim is much smaller, and retains the essential content of the original segment. This research is sponsored by the National Science Foundation under grant no.

In addition, the digital domain consists not only of text but increasingly of other media representations, from graphics images to audio to motion video. As the amount of information and number of users exponentially escalate, more attention focuses on the basic problems of information management: How do you digitize information? How can you then visualize it and find what you need? How do you use and manipulate it effectively? How is it stored and managed? The proliferation of technical articles and special issues addressing these questions underscore their importance; see for example the special issue on Content-based retrieval [Nar95] or digital libraries [F+95]. This chapter will survey some of that work, especially that which relates to the treatment of video and the use of digital video libraries For education."

Because of the opacity of these media they must be represented in order to be manipulable according to their contents. Knowledge representation techniques have been implicitly designed for representing the physical world and its textual representations. Temporal media pose unique problems and opportunities for knowledge representation which challenge many of its assumptions about the structure and function of what is represented. The semantics and syntax of temporal media require representational designs which employ fundamentally different conceptions of space, time, identity, and action. In particular, the effect of the syntax of video sequences on the semantics of video shots demands a representational design which can clearly articulate the differences between the context-dependent and context-independent semantics of video data. This paper outlines the theoretical foundations for designing representations of video, discusses Media Streams, an implemented system for video representation and retrieval, and critiques related efforts in this area."

                "text": "Most information retrieval systems today use only the presence or absence of keywords to classify and retrieve texts. But simple word searches and frequency distributions do not provide these systems with any understanding of those texts. We call this limit the keyword barrier. To go beyond this barrier, information retrieval systems must at least partially understand the texts they retrieve. Although full natural language parsers are capable today of deep understanding within limited domains, they are still too restrictive and slow for general information retrieval. Text skimming parsers, such as DeJong's F scRUMP, are capable of coarse-level understanding, but they require large amounts of domain-specific knowledge in each application domain. \nThis dissertation describes F scERRET: a full text, conceptual information retrieval system that uses a partial understanding of its texts to provide greater precision and recall performance than keyword search techniques. F scERRET parses its input documents by text skimming and then stores their representations as canonical case frames (called abstracts). User queries are similarly converted to case frames, and are matched to the abstracts using a case frame matcher. F scERRET uses the M sc CF scRUMP parser, a derivative of F scRUMP with two important additions. First, it is able to access an on-line English dictionary (Webster's Seventh) to handle unknown words, using script-based expectations to resolve multiple-meaning ambiguities. Second, a script learning component based on Holland's genetic algorithms updates the script database, augmenting M sc CF scRUMP's episodic world knowledge. \nComparison studies of F scERRET's retrieval performance on 1065 astronomy texts show significant improvement in both recall and precision versus the standard boolean keyword search. Precision increased from 35 to 48 percent, and recall more than doubled, from 19 to 52 percent. The script learning component generated new scripts that significantly improved the recall performance of the basic F scERRET system without significant effects on precision. \nThe robust parsing abilities demonstrated, with the depth and flexibility provided by on-line dictionary access and script learning, make text skimming a useful foundation for many applications. The partial understanding provided by a canonical case frame representation is useful for tasks as diverse as information filtering, routing, categorization and summarization."

                "text": "Sound is the predominant communication modality in the natural world, yet most current computers have no sense of sound whatsoever. They only occasionally \"bleep,\" and are, in effect, stone-deaf. This is a serious deficiency. General audio capability must be developed if machines are to function in more natural contexts. \nThe thesis presented here is that machines must be able to extract meaningful structure in order to operate intelligently on sound. They must \"hear\" events, and recognize voices, effects, melodies, moods, room-acoustics, and many other features. This work demonstrates how such sound recognizers may be built and unified in a fruitful framework. \nIn particular, several implementations of sound sensors are presented, including a polyphonic pitch extractor, a music detector, and a talker recognizer for indexing conversations. These programs filter sound to produce event-list scripts that describe the contents in some sense. In this way, many sorts of sound streams may be abstracted and rendered amenable to processing by a wide variety of applications. New applications in music and speech synthesis as well as content-oriented filtering of video are shown. (Copies available exclusively from MIT Libraries, Rm. 14-0551, Cambridge, MA 02139-4307.

Although generally not regarded as such, the most prevalent computer is the simple mechanical analog computer, in which gears, levers, ratchets, and pawls perform mathematical operations\u2014for example, the speedometer and the watt-hour meter (used to measure accumulated electrical usage). The general public has become much more aware of the digital computer with the rapid proliferation of the hand-held calculator and a large variety of intelligent devices, ranging from typewriters to washing machines, and especially with exposure to the Internet and the World Wide Web.

A retinally connected neural network examines small windows of an image, and decides whether each window contains a face. The system arbitrates between multiple networks to improve performance over a single network. We use a bootstrap algorithm for training, which adds false detections into the training set as training progresses. This eliminates the difficult task of manually selecting non-face training examples, which must be chosen to span the entire space of non-face images. Comparisons with another state-of-the-art face detection system are presented; our system has better performance in terms of detection and false-positive rates."
