This work is part of a larger empirical survey, evaluating different word representations on different NLP tasks. We evaluate Brown clusters, Collobert and Weston (2008) embeddings, and HLBL (Mnih & Hinton, 2009) embeddings of words. All three representations improve accuracy on NER, with the Brown clusters providing a larger improvement than the two embeddings, and the HLBL embeddings more than the Collobert and Weston (2008) embeddings. We also discuss some of the practical issues in using embeddings as features. Brown clusters are simpler than embeddings because they require less hyperparameter tuning."

We first propose a simple yet powerful semi-supervised discriminative model appropriate for handling large scale unlabeled data. Then, we describe experiments performed on widely used test collections, namely, PTB III data, CoNLL\u201900 and \u201903 shared task data for the above three NLP tasks, respectively. We incorporate up to 1G-words (one billion tokens) of unlabeled data, which is the largest amount of unlabeled data ever used for these tasks, to investigate the performance improvement. In addition, our results are superior to the best reported results for all of the above test collections."

Consequently, they have difficulty estimating parameters for types which appear in the test set, but seldom (or never) appear in the training set. We demonstrate that distributional representations of word types, trained on unannotated text, can be used to improve performance on rare words. We incorporate aspects of these representations into the feature space of our sequence-labeling systems. In an experiment on a standard chunking dataset, our best technique improves a chunker from 0.76 F1 to 0.86 F1 on chunks beginning with rare words. On the same dataset, it improves our part-of-speech tagger from 74% to 80% accuracy on rare words. Furthermore, our system improves significantly over a baseline system when applied to text from a different domain, and it reduces the sample complexity of sequence labeling."

Currently however, most systems rely on a large training set, which is manually annotated, an effort that needs to be repeated whenever different languages or a different set of semantic roles is used in a certain application. A possible solution for this problem is semi-supervised learning, where a small set of training examples is automatically expanded using unlabeled texts. We present the Latent Words Language Model, which is a language model that learns word similarities from unlabeled texts. We use these similarities for different semi-supervised SRL methods as additional features or to automatically expand a small training set. We evaluate the methods on the PropBank dataset and find that for small training sizes our best performing system achieves an error reduction of 33.27% F1-measure compared to a state-of-the-art supervised baseline."

We focus on the problem of lexical representation, introducing features that incorporate word clusters derived from a large unannotated corpus. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in a series of dependency parsing experiments on the Penn Treebank and Prague Dependency Treebank, and we show that the cluster-based features yield substantial gains in performance across a wide range of conditions. For example, in the case of English unlabeled second-order parsing, we improve from a baseline accuracy of 92.02% to 93.16%, and in the case of Czech unlabeled second-order parsing, we improve from a baseline accuracy of 86.13% to 87.13%. In addition, we demonstrate that our method also improves performance when small amounts of training data are available, and can roughly halve the amount of supervised data required to reach a desired level of performance."

Although a number of semi-supervised methods have been proposed, their effectiveness on NLP tasks is not always clear. This paper presents a novel semi-supervised method that employs a learning paradigm which we call structural learning. The idea is to find \"what good classifiers are like\" by learning from thousands of automatically generated auxiliary classification problems on unlabeled data. By doing so, the common predictive structure shared by the multiple classification problems can be discovered, which can then be used to improve performance on the target problem. The method produces performance higher than the previous best results on CoNLL'00 syntactic chunking and CoNLL'03 named entity chunking (English and German)."

This paper presents an approach that leverages recent work in manifold-learning on sequences to discover word clusters from language data, including both syntactic classes and semantic topics. From unlabeled data we form a smooth. low-dimensional feature space, where each word token is projected based on its underlying role as a function or content word. We then use this projection as additional input features to a linear-chain conditional random field trained on limited labeled training data. On standard part-of-speech tagging and Chinese word segmentation data sets we show as much as 14% error reduction due to the unlabeled data, and also statistically-significant improvements over a related semi-supervised sequence tagging method due to Miller et al."

On the other hand, unlabeled data (raw text) is often available \"for free\" in large quantities. Unlabeled data has shown promise in improving the performance of a number of tasks, e.g. word sense disambiguation, information extraction, and natural language parsing. In this thesis, we focus on two segmentation tasks, named-entity recognition and Chinese word segmentation. The goal of named-entity recognition is to detect and classify names of people, organizations, and locations in a sentence. The goal of Chinese word segmentation is to find the word boundaries in a sentence that has been written as a string of characters without spaces. Our approach is as follows: In a preprocessing step, we use raw text to cluster words and calculate mutual information statistics. The output of this step is then used as features in a supervised model, specifically a global linear model trained using the Perceptron algorithm. We also compare Markov and semi-Markov models on the two segmentation tasks. Our results show that features derived from unlabeled data substantially improves performance, both in terms of reducing the amount of labeled data needed to achieve a certain performance level and in terms of reducing the error using a fixed amount of labeled data. We find that sometimes semi-Markov models can also improve performance over Markov models. Thesis Supervisor: Michael Collins Title: Assistant Professor, CSAIL"

We focus on the well-known problem of lexical data sparseness and present experiments of word clustering prior to parsing. We use a combination of lexicon-aided morphological clustering that preserves tagging ambiguity, and unsupervised word clustering, trained on a large unannotated corpus. We apply these clusterings to the French Treebank, and we train a parser with the PCFG-LA unlexicalized algorithm of (Petrov et al., 2006). We find a gain in French parsing performance: from a baseline of F1=86.76% to F1=87.37% using morphological clustering, and up to F1=88.29% using further unsupervised clustering. This is the best known score for French probabilistic parsing. These preliminary results are encouraging for statistically parsing morphologically rich languages, and languages with small amount of annotated data."

Cluster membership is encoded in features that are incorporated in a discriminatively trained tagging model. Active learning is used to select training examples. We evaluate the technique for named-entity tagging. Compared with a state-of-the-art HMM-based name finder, the presented technique requires only 13% as much annotated data to achieve the same level of performance. Given a large annotated training set of 1,000,000 words, the technique achieves a 25% reduction in error over the state-of-the-art HMM trained on the same material."

In the process of comparing several solutions to these challenges we reach some surprising conclusions, as well as develop an NER system that achieves 90.8 F1 score on the CoNLL-2003 NER shared task, the best reported result for this dataset."

NER systems typically use sequence models for tractable inference, but this makes them unable to capture the long distance structure present in text. We use a Conditional Random Field (CRF) based NER system using local features to make predictions and then train another CRF which uses both local information and features extracted from the output of the first CRF. Using features capturing non-local dependencies from the same document, our approach yields a 12.6% relative error reduction on the F1 score, over state-of-the-art NER systems using local-information alone, when compared to the 9.3% relative error reduction offered by the best systems that exploit non-local information. Our approach also makes it easy to incorporate non-local information from other documents in the test corpus, and this gives us a 13.3% error reduction over NER systems using local-information alone. Additionally, our running time for inference is just the inference time of two sequential CRFs, which is much less than that directly model the dependencies and do approximate inference."

This is intrinsically difficult because of the curse of dimensionality: a word sequence on which the model will be tested is likely to be different from all the word sequences seen during training. Traditional but very successful approaches based on n-grams obtain generalization by concatenating very short overlapping sequences seen in the training set. We propose to fight the curse of dimensionality by learning a distributed representation for words which allows each training sentence to inform the model about an exponential number of semantically neighboring sentences. The model learns simultaneously (1) a distributed representation for each word along with (2) the probability function for word sequences, expressed in terms of these representations. Generalization is obtained because a sequence of words that has never been seen before gets high probability if it is made of words that are similar (in the sense of having a nearby representation) to words forming an already seen sentence. Training such large models (with millions of parameters) within a reasonable time is itself a significant challenge. We report on experiments using neural networks for the probability function, showing on two text corpora that the proposed approach significantly improves on state-of-the-art n-gram models, and that the proposed approach allows to take advantage of longer contexts."

The main drawback of NPLMs is their extremely long training and testing times. Morin and Bengio have proposed a hierarchical language model built around a binary tree of words, which was two orders of magnitude faster than the non-hierarchical model it was based on. However, it performed considerably worse than its non-hierarchical counterpart in spite of using a word tree created using expert knowledge. We introduce a fast hierarchical language model along with a simple feature-based algorithm for automatic construction of word trees from the data. We then show that the resulting models can outperform non-hierarchical neural models as well as the best n-gram models."

The main advantage of these architectures is that they learn an embedding for words (or other symbols) in a continuous space that helps to smooth the language model and provide good generalization even when the number of training examples is insufficient. However, these models are extremely slow in comparison to the more commonly used n-gram models, both for training and recognition. As an alternative to an importance sampling method proposed to speed-up training, we introduce a hierarchical decomposition of the conditional probabilities that yields a speed-up of about 200 both during training and recognition. The hierarchical decomposition is a binary hierarchical clustering constrained by the prior knowledge extracted from the WordNet semantic hierarchy."

Words are represented by the relative frequency distributions of contexts in which they appear, and relative entropy between those distributions is used as the similarity measure for clustering. Clusters are represented by average context distributions derived from the given words according to their probabilities of cluster membership. In many cases, the clusters can be thought of as encoding coarse sense distinctions. Deterministic annealing is used to find lowest distortion sets of clusters: as the annealing parameter increases, existing clusters become unstable and subdivide, yielding a hierarchical \"soft\" clustering of the data. Clusters are used as the basis for class models of word coocurrence, and the models evaluated with respect to held-out test data."

The first, Baby Steps, bootstraps itself via iterated learning of increasingly longer sentences and requires no initialization. This method substantially exceeds Klein and Manning's published scores and achieves 39.4% accuracy on Section 23 (all sentences) of the Wall Street Journal corpus. The second, Less is More, uses a low-complexity subset of the available data: sentences up to length 15. Focusing on fewer but simpler examples trades off quantity against ambiguity; it attains 44.1% accuracy, using the standard linguistically-informed prior and batch training, beating state-of-the-art. Leapfrog, our third heuristic, combines Less is More with Baby Steps by mixing their models of shorter sentences, then rapidly ramping up exposure to the full training set, driving up accuracy to 45.0%. These trends generalize to the Brown corpus; awareness of data complexity may improve other parsing models and unsupervised algorithms."

Almost all state.. o. f-the-art systems use statistical n-gram language models estimated on text corpora. One principle problem with such language models is the fact that many of the n-grams are never observed even in very large training corpora, and therefore it is common to back-off to a lower-order model. In this paper we propose to address this problem by carrying out the estimation task in a continuous space, enabling a smooth interpolation of the probabilities. A neural network is used to learn the projection of the words onto a continuous space and to estimate the n-gram probabilities. The connectionist language model is being evaluated on the DARPA HUB5 conversational telephone speech recognition task and preliminary results show consistent improvements in both perplexity and word error rate."

This is achieved by defining a stochastic mapping layer between the two resources. Lexical probabilities for rare events are estimated in a semi-supervised manner from a lexicon and large unannotated corpora. We show that this solution greatly enhances the performance of an unlexicalized Hebrew PCFG parser, resulting in state-of-the-art Hebrew parsing results both when a segmentation oracle is assumed, and in a real-word parsing scenario of parsing unsegmented tokens."

The emergent syntactic and semantic features are based on an analysis of the words in their contexts in a large corpus. We have also shown that there is a reasonably strong correlation between traditional features and categories defined by linguists and the emergent features. In this article, we introduce a new measure for comparing the emergent and the traditionally defined features. We apply this measure to compare the emergent features produced by Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and Independent Component Analysis (ICA). The conclusion is that the ICA-based features correspond to the human intuitions much more closely than the SVD-based features not only in a visual inspection but also in a systematic and principled comparison."

We describe an extension of semi-supervised structured conditional models (SS-SCMs) to the dependency parsing problem, whose framework is originally proposed in (Suzuki and Isozaki, 2008). Moreover, we introduce two extensions related to dependency parsing: The first extension is to combine SS-SCMs with another semi-supervised approach, described in (Koo et al., 2008). The second extension is to apply the approach to second-order parsing models, such as those described in (Carreras, 2007), using a two-stage semi-supervised learning approach. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods on dependency parsing experiments using two widely used test collections: the Penn Treebank for English, and the Prague Dependency Tree-bank for Czech. Our best results on test data in the above datasets achieve 93.79% parent-prediction accuracy for English, and 88.05% for Czech."

                "text": "Word space models enjoy considerable attention in current research on semantic indexing. Most notably, Latent Semantic Analysis/Indexing (LSA/LSI; Deerwester et al., 1990, Landauer & Dumais, 1997) has become a household name in information access research, and deservedly so; LSA has proven its mettle in numerous applications, and has more or less spawned an entire research field since its introduction around 1990. Today, there is a rich flora of word space models available, and there are numerous publications that report exceptional results in many different applications, including information retrieval (Dumais et al., 1988), word sense disambiguation (Schutze, 1993), various semantic knowledge tests (Lund et al., 1995, Karlgren & Sahlgren, 2001), and text categorization (Sahlgren & Karlgren, 2004). This paper introduces the Random Indexing word space approach, which presents an efficient, scalable and incremental alternative to standard word space methods. The paper is organized as follows: in the next section, we review the basic word space methodology. We then look at some of the problems that are inherent in the basic methodology, and also review some of the solutions that have been proposed in the literature. In the final section, we introduce the Random Indexing word space approach, and briefly review some of the experimental results that have been achieved with Random Indexing."

A similar system has been applied to the CoNLL text chunking shared task with state of the art performance. By using different linguistic features, we can easily adapt this system to other token-based linguistic tagging problems. The main focus of the current paper is to investigate the impact of various local linguistic features for named entity recognition on the CoNLL-2003 (Tjong Kim Sang and De Meulder, 2003) shared task data. We show that the system performance can be enhanced significantly with some relative simple token-based features that are available for many languages. Although more sophisticated linguistic features will also be helpful, they provide much less improvement than might be expected."

We propose three new probabilistic language models that define the distribution of the next word in a sequence given several preceding words by using distributed representations of those words. We show how real-valued distributed representations for words can be learned at the same time as learning a large set of stochastic binary hidden features that are used to predict the distributed representation of the next word from previous distributed representations. Adding connections from the previous states of the binary hidden features improves performance as does adding direct connections between the real-valued distributed representations. One of our models significantly outperforms the very best n-gram models."

This profoundly limits our ability to give instructions to computers, the ability of computers to explain their actions to us, and the ability of computers to analyse and process text. Vector space models (VSMs) of semantics are beginning to address these limits. This paper surveys the use of VSMs for semantic processing of text. We organize the literature on VSMs according to the structure of the matrix in a VSM. There are currently three broad classes of VSMs, based on term-document, word-context, and pair-pattern matrices, yielding three classes of applications. We survey a broad range of applications in these three categories and we take a detailed look at a specific open source project in each category. Our goal in this survey is to show the breadth of applications of VSMs for semantics, to provide a new perspective on VSMs for those who are already familiar with the area, and to provide pointers into the literature for those who are less familiar with the field."

Most approaches to retrieving textual materials depend on a lexical match between words in users' requests and those in or assigned to database objects. Because of the tremendous diversity in the words people use to describe the same object, lexical matching methods are necessarily incomplete and imprecise [5]. The latent semantic indexing approach tries to overcome these problems by automatically organizing text objects into a semantic structure more appropriate for matching user requests. This is done by taking advantage of implicit higher-order structure in the association of terms with text objects. The particular technique used is singular-value decomposition, in which a large term by text-object matrix is decomposed into a set of about 50 to 150 orthogonal factors from which the original matrix can be approximated by linear combination. Terms and objects are represented by 50 to 150 dimensional vectors and matched against user queries in this \u201csemantic\u201d space. Initial tests find this completely automatic method widely applicable and a promising way to improve users' access to many kinds of textual materials, or to objects and services for which textual descriptions are available."

In the experiments reported in this work the source data consisted of the raw text of Grimm fairy tales without any prior syntactic or semantic categorization of the words. The algorithm was able to create diagrams that seem to comply reasonably well with the traditional syntactical categorizations and human intuition about the semantics of the words. It has earlier been shown that the Self-Organizing Map (SOM) can be applied to the visual-ization of contextual roles of words, i.e., similarities in their usage in short contexts formed of adjacent words 4]. This paper demonstrates that such relations or roles are also statistically reeected in unrestricted, even quaint natural expressions. The source material chosen for this experiment consisted of 200 Grimm tales (English translation). In most practical applications of the SOM, the input to the map algorithm is derived from some measurements, usually after their preprocessing. In such cases, the input vectors are supposed to have metric relations. Interpretation of languages, on the contrary, must be based on the processing of sequences of discrete symbols. If the words were encoded numerically, the ordered sets formed of them could also be compared mutually as well as with reference expressions. However, as no numerical value of the code should imply any order to the words themselves, it will be necessary to use uncorrelated vectors for encoding. The simplest method to introduce uncorrelated codes is to assign a unit vector for each word. When all diierent words in the input material are listed, a code vector can be deened to have as many components as there are words in the list. This method, however, is only practicable in very small experiments. If the vocabulary is large as in the present experiments, we may then encode the words by quasi-orthogonal random vectors of a much smaller dimensionality 4]. To create a map of discrete symbols that occur within the sentences, each symbol must be presented in the due context. The context may consist of the immediate surroundings of the word in the text. Application of the self-organizing maps to natural language processing has been described earlier in, e.g., 2], 3], 4], 5], and 6]."

The SOM can also be used to f ind statistical similarities between symbols if suitabl e contextual information is available as there indeed is for words in natural language texts. Using the shor t contexts of each word occurring in a text the SOM algorithm is able to organize the words into grammatical and semantic categories represented on a two-dimensional array. The similarity of the catego ries is reflected in their distance relationships on the array. This kind of a word category map may then be utiliz ed in applications such as the analysis of large docum ent collections.

Here, we formalize such training strategies in the context of machine learning, and call them \"curriculum learning\". In the context of recent research studying the difficulty of training in the presence of non-convex training criteria (for deep deterministic and stochastic neural networks), we explore curriculum learning in various set-ups. The experiments show that significant improvements in generalization can be achieved. We hypothesize that curriculum learning has both an effect on the speed of convergence of the training process to a minimum and, in the case of non-convex criteria, on the quality of the local minima obtained: curriculum learning can be seen as a particular form of continuation method (a general strategy for global optimization of non-convex functions)."

The semantic relationships in the data are reflected by their relative distances in the map. Two different simulations, both based on a neural network model that implements the algorithm of the selforganizing feature maps, are given. For both, an essential, new ingredient is the inclusion of the contexts, in which each symbol appears, into the input data. This enables the network to detect the \u201clogical similarity\u201d between words from the statistics of their contexts. In the first demonstration, the context simply consists of a set of attribute values that occur in conjunction with the words. In the second demonstration, the context is defined by the sequences in which the words occur, without consideration of any associated attributes. Simple verbal statements consisting of nouns, verbs, and adverbs have been analyzed in this way. Such phrases or clauses involve some of the abstractions that appear in thinking, namely, the most common categories, into which the words are then automatically grouped in both of our simulations. We also argue that a similar process may be at work in the brain."

It is therefore necessary to reduce the dimensionality before, for example, clustering the data. If the dimensionality is very high, like in the WEBSOM method which organizes textual document collections on a self-organizing map, then even the commonly used dimensionality reduction methods like the principal component analysis may be too costly. It is demonstrated that the document classification accuracy obtained after the dimensionality has been reduced using a random mapping method will be almost as good as the original accuracy if the final dimensionality is sufficiently large (about 100 out of 6000). In fact, it can be shown that the inner product (similarity) between the mapped vectors follows closely the inner product of the original vectors."
