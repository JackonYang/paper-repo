For example, the SUN dataset [24] contains 899 scene categories and ImageNet [6] has 15,589 synsets. Designing a multiclass classifier that is both accurate and fast at test time is an extremely important problem in both machine learning and computer vision communities. To achieve a good trade-off between accuracy and speed, we adopt the relaxed hierarchy structure from [15], where a set of binary classifiers are organized in a tree or DAG (directed acyclic graph) structure. At each node, classes are colored into positive and negative groups which are separated by a binary classifier while a subset of confusing classes is ignored. We color the classes and learn the induced binary classifier simultaneously using a unified and principled max-margin optimization. We provide an analysis on generalization error to justify our design. Our method has been tested on both Caltech-256 (object recognition) [9] and the SUN dataset (scene classification) [24], and shows significant improvement over existing methods."

In this work, we evaluate class hierarchies currently constructed for visual recognition. We show that top-down as well as bottom-up approaches, which are commonly used to automatically construct hierarchies, incorporate assumptions about the separability of classes. Those assumptions do not hold for visual recognition of a large number of object categories. We therefore propose a modification which is appropriate for most top-down approaches. It allows to construct class hierarchies that postpone decisions in the presence of uncertainty and thus provide higher recognition accuracy. We also compare our method to a one-against-all approach and show how to control the speed-for-accuracy trade-off with our method. For the experimental evaluation, we use the Caltech-256 visual object classes dataset and compare to state-of-the-art methods."

In particular, humans can recognize tens of thousands of object classes and scenes. No computer vision algorithm today has been tested at this scale. This paper presents a study of large scale categorization including a series of challenging experiments on classification with more than 10, 000 image classes. We find that a) computational issues become crucial in algorithm design; b) conventional wisdom from a couple of hundred image categories on relative performance of different classifiers does not necessarily hold when the number of categories increases; c) there is a surprisingly strong relationship between the structure of WordNet (developed for studying language) and the difficulty of visual categorization; d) classification can be improved by exploiting the semantic hierarchy. Toward the future goal of developing automatic vision algorithms to recognize tens of thousands or even millions of image categories, we make a series of observations and arguments about dataset scale, category density, and image hierarchy."

In the context of image classification the FK was shown to extend the popular bag-of-visual-words (BOV) by going beyond count statistics. However, in practice, this enriched representation has not yet shown its superiority over the BOV. In the first part we show that with several well-motivated modifications over the original framework we can boost the accuracy of the FK. On PASCAL VOC 2007 we increase the Average Precision (AP) from 47.9% to 58.3%. Similarly, we demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy on CalTech 256. A major advantage is that these results are obtained using only SIFT descriptors and costless linear classifiers. Equipped with this representation, we can now explore image classification on a larger scale. In the second part, as an application, we compare two abundant resources of labeled images to learn classifiers: ImageNet and Flickr groups. In an evaluation involving hundreds of thousands of training images we show that classifiers learned on Flickr groups perform surprisingly well (although they were not intended for this purpose) and that they can complement classifiers learned on more carefully annotated datasets."

We find that a greedy algorithm that recursively splits the set of categories into the two minimally confused subsets achieves 5-20 fold speedups at a small cost in classification performance. Our approach is independent of the specific classification algorithm used. A welcome by-product of our algorithm is a very reasonable taxonomy of the Caltech-256 dataset."

Following the large margin principle, we associate a prototype with each label in the tree and formulate the learning task as an optimization problem with varying margin constraints. In the spirit of Bayesian methods, we impose similarity requirements between the prototypes corresponding to adjacent labels in the hierarchy. We describe new online and batch algorithms for solving the constrained optimization problem. We derive a worst case loss-bound for the online algorithm and provide generalization analysis for its batch counterpart. We demonstrate the merits of our approach with a series of experiments on synthetic, text and speech data."

With the emergence of structured large-scale dataset such as the ImageNet, rich information about the conceptual relationships between images, such as a tree hierarchy among various image categories, become available. As human cognition of complex visual world benefits from underlying semantic relationships between object classes, we believe a machine learning system can and should leverage such information as well for better performance. In this paper, we employ such semantic relatedness among image categories for large-scale image categorization. Specifically, a category hierarchy is utilized to properly define loss function and select common set of features for related categories. An efficient optimization method based on proximal approximation and accelerated parallel gradient method is introduced. Experimental results on a subset of ImageNet containing 1.2 million images from 1000 categories demonstrate the effectiveness and promise of our proposed approach."

Given that the true class should be included in predictions and the number of classes predicted should be as small as possible, these kind of classifiers can be considered as Information Retrieval (IR) procedures. In this paper, we propose a family of IR loss functions to measure the performance of nondeterministic learners. After discussing such measures, we derive an algorithm for learning optimal nondeterministic hypotheses. Given an entry from the input space, the algorithm requires the posterior probabilities to compute the subset of classes with the lowest expected loss. From a general point of view, nondeterministic classifiers provide an improvement in the proportion of predictions that include the true class compared to their deterministic counterparts; the price to be paid for this increase is usually a tiny proportion of predictions with more than one class. The paper includes an extensive experimental study using three deterministic learners to estimate posterior probabilities: a multiclass Support Vector Machine (SVM), a Logistic Regression, and a Naive Bayes. The data sets considered comprise both UCI multi-class learning tasks and microarray expressions of different kinds of cancer. We successfully compare nondeterministic classifiers with other alternative approaches. Additionally, we shall see how the quality of posterior probabilities (measured by the Brier score) determines the goodness of nondeterministic predictions."

That is, when an input pattern cannot be reliably assigned to one of the N classes in an N-class problem, it is assigned to a subset of classes that are most likely to issue the pattern, instead of simply being rejected. By selecting more classes, the risk of making an error can be reduced, at the price of subsequently having a larger remaining number of classes. The optimality of class-selective rejection is therefore defined as the best trade-off between error rate and average number of selected classes. Formally, the trade-off study is embedded in the framework of decision theory. The average expected loss is expressed as a linear combination of error rate and average number of classes. The minimization of the average expected loss, therefore, provides the best trade-off. The complexity of the resulting optimum rule is reduced, via a discrete convex minimization, to be linear in the number of classes. Upper-bounds on error rate and average number of classes are derived. An example is provided to illustrate various aspects of the optimum decision rule. Finally, the implications of the new decision rule are discussed."

We introduce a new hierarchical loss function, the H-loss, implementing the simple intuition that additional mistakes in the subtree of a mistaken class should not be charged for. Based on a probabilistic data model introduced in earlier work, we derive the Bayes-optimal classifier for the H-loss. We then empirically compare two incremental approximations of the Bayes-optimal classifier with a flat SVM classifier and with classifiers obtained by using hierarchical versions of the Perceptron and SVM algorithms. The experiments show that our simplest incremental approximation of the Bayes-optimal classifier performs, after just one training epoch, nearly as well as the hierarchical SVM classifier (which performs best). For the same incremental algorithm we also derive an H-loss bound showing, when data are generated by our probabilistic data model, exponentially fast convergence to the H-loss of the hierarchical classifier based on the true model parameters."

Motivated by psychophysical results showing the remarkable tolerance of the human visual system to degradations in image resolution, the images in the dataset are stored as 32 x 32 color images. Each image is loosely labeled with one of the 75,062 non-abstract nouns in English, as listed in the Wordnet lexical database. Hence the image database gives a comprehensive coverage of all object categories and scenes. The semantic information from Wordnet can be used in conjunction with nearest-neighbor methods to perform object classification over a range of semantic levels minimizing the effects of labeling noise. For certain classes that are particularly prevalent in the dataset, such as people, we are able to demonstrate a recognition performance comparable to class-specific Viola-Jones style detectors."

This problem can be alleviated by imposing (or learning) a structure over the set of classes. We propose an algorithm for learning a tree-structure of classifiers which, by optimizing the overall tree loss, provides superior accuracy to existing tree labeling methods. We also propose a method that learns to embed labels in a low dimensional space that is faster than non-embedding approaches and has superior accuracy to existing embedding approaches. Finally we combine the two ideas resulting in the label embedding tree that outperforms alternative methods including One-vs-Rest while being orders of magnitude faster."

Given a hierarchical taxonomy that captures semantic similarity between the objects, we learn a corresponding tree of metrics (ToM). In this tree, we have one metric for each non-leaf node of the object hierarchy, and each metric is responsible for discriminating among its immediate subcategory children. Specifically, a Mahalanobis metric learned for a given node must satisfy the appropriate (dis)similarity constraints generated only among its subtree members' training instances. To further exploit the semantics, we introduce a novel regularizer coupling the metrics that prefers a sparse disjoint set of features to be selected for each metric relative to its ancestor (supercategory) nodes' metrics. Intuitively, this reflects that visual cues most useful to distinguish the generic classes (e.g., feline vs. canine) should be different than those cues most useful to distinguish their component fine-grained classes (e.g., Persian cat vs. Siamese cat). We validate our approach with multiple image datasets using the WordNet taxonomy, show its advantages over alternative metric learning approaches, and analyze the meaning of attribute features selected by our algorithm."

The key contribution of the approach is a technique to simultaneously determine the structure of the tree and learn the classifiers for each node in the tree. This approach also allows fine grained control over the efficiency vs accuracy trade-off in designing a label tree, leading to more balanced trees. Experiments are performed on large scale image classification with 10184 classes and 9 million images. We demonstrate significant improvements in test accuracy and efficiency with less training time and more balanced trees compared to the previous state of the art by Bengio et al."

Since the natural loss function is non-convex so that empirical risk minimization easily becomes infeasible, the paper proposes minimizing convex risks based on surrogate convex loss functions. A necessary and sufficient condition for infinite sample consistency (both risks share the same minimizer) is provided. Moreover, we show that the excess risk can be bounded through the excess surrogate risk under appropriate conditions. These bounds can be tightened by a generalized margin condition. The impact of the results is illustrated on several commonly used surrogate loss functions."

We first observed an interesting computational property of the object hierarchy: comparing the recognition rate when using models of objects at different levels, the higher more inclusive levels (e.g., closed-frame vehicles or vehicles) exhibit higher recall but lower precision when compared with the class specific level (e.g., bus). These inherent differences suggest that combining object classifiers from different hierarchical levels into a single classifier may improve classification, as it appears like these models capture different aspects of the object. We describe a method to combine these classifiers, and analyze the conditions under which improvement can be guaranteed. When given a small sample of a new object class, we describe a method to transfer knowledge across the tree hierarchy, between related objects. Finally, we describe extensive experiments using object hierarchies obtained from publicly available datasets, and show that the combined classifiers significantly improve recognition results."

There are two main reasons for the limited effort on large-scale image classification. First, until the emergence of ImageNet dataset, there was almost no publicly available large-scale benchmark data for image classification. This is mostly because class labels are expensive to obtain. Second, large-scale classification is hard because it poses more challenges than its medium-scale counterparts. A key challenge is how to achieve efficiency in both feature extraction and classifier training without compromising performance. This paper is to show how we address this challenge using ImageNet dataset as an example. For feature extraction, we develop a Hadoop scheme that performs feature extraction in parallel using hundreds of mappers. This allows us to extract fairly sophisticated features (with dimensions being hundreds of thousands) on 1.2 million images within one day. For SVM training, we develop a parallel averaging stochastic gradient descent (ASGD) algorithm for training one-against-all 1000-class SVM classifiers. The ASGD algorithm is capable of dealing with terabytes of training data and converges very fast\u2013typically 5 epochs are sufficient. As a result, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on the ImageNet 1000-class classification, i.e., 52.9% in classification accuracy and 71.8% in top 5 hit rate."

These images come with varying degrees of label information. \"Clean labels\" can be manually obtained on a small fraction, \"noisy labels\" may be extracted automatically from surrounding text, while for most images there are no labels at all. Semi-supervised learning is a principled framework for combining these different label sources. However, it scales polynomially with the number of images, making it impractical for use on gigantic collections with hundreds of millions of images and thousands of classes. In this paper we show how to utilize recent results in machine learning to obtain highly efficient approximations for semi-supervised learning that are linear in the number of images. Specifically, we use the convergence of the eigenvectors of the normalized graph Laplacian to eigenfunctions of weighted Laplace-Beltrami operators. Our algorithm enables us to apply semi-supervised learning to a database of 80 million images gathered from the Internet."

First, we study classification accuracy as a function of the image signature dimensionality and the training set size. We show experimentally that the larger the training set, the higher the impact of the dimensionality on the accuracy. In other words, high-dimensional signatures are important to obtain state-of-the-art results on large datasets. Second, we tackle the problem of data compression on very large signatures (on the order of 105 dimensions) using two lossy compression strategies: a dimensionality reduction technique known as the hash kernel and an encoding technique based on product quantizers. We explain how the gain in storage can be traded against a loss in accuracy and/or an increase in CPU cost. We report results on two large databases \u2014 ImageNet and a dataset of lM Flickr images \u2014 showing that we can reduce the storage of our signatures by a factor 64 to 128 with little loss in accuracy. Integrating the decompression in the classifier learning yields an efficient and scalable training algorithm. On ILSVRC2010 we report a 74.3% accuracy at top-5, which corresponds to a 2.5% absolute improvement with respect to the state-of-the-art. On a subset of 10K classes of ImageNet we report a top-1 accuracy of 16.7%, a relative improvement of 160% with respect to the state-of-the-art."

The SVM hinge loss is extended to the cost sensitive setting, and the cost-sensitive SVM is derived as the minimizer of the associated risk. The extension of the hinge loss draws on recent connections between risk minimization and probability elicitation. These connections are generalized to cost-sensitive classification, in a manner that guarantees consistency with the cost-sensitive Bayes risk, and associated Bayes decision rule. This ensures that optimal decision rules, under the new hinge loss, implement the Bayes-optimal cost-sensitive classification boundary. Minimization of the new hinge loss is shown to be a generalization of the classic SVM optimization problem, and can be solved by identical procedures. The resulting algorithm avoids the shortcomings of previous approaches to cost-sensitive SVM design, and has superior experimental performance."

However, scene understanding research has been constrained by the limited scope of currently-used databases which do not capture the full variety of scene categories. Whereas standard databases for object categorization contain hundreds of different classes of objects, the largest available dataset of scene categories contains only 15 classes. In this paper we propose the extensive Scene UNderstanding (SUN) database that contains 899 categories and 130,519 images. We use 397 well-sampled categories to evaluate numerous state-of-the-art algorithms for scene recognition and establish new bounds of performance. We measure human scene classification performance on the SUN database and compare this with computational methods. Additionally, we study a finer-grained scene representation to detect scenes embedded inside of larger scenes."

The fundamental assumption of the proposed theory, recognition-by-components (RBC), is that a modest set of generalized-cone components, called geons (N \u00a3 36), can be derived from contrasts of five readily detectable properties of edges in a two-dimensiona l image: curvature, collinearity, symmetry, parallelism, and cotermination. The detection of these properties is generally invariant over viewing position an$ image quality and consequently allows robust object perception when the image is projected from a novel viewpoint or is degraded. RBC thus provides a principled account of the heretofore undecided relation between the classic principles of perceptual organization and pattern recognition: The constraints toward regularization (Pragnanz) characterize not the complete object but the object's components. Representational power derives from an allowance of free combinations of the geons. A Principle of Componential Recovery can account for the major phenomena of object recognition: If an arrangement of two or three geons can be recovered from the input, objects can be quickly recognized even when they are occluded, novel, rotated in depth, or extensively degraded. The results from experiments on the perception of briefly presented pictures by human observers provide empirical support for the theory. Any single object can project an infinity of image configurations to the retina. The orientation of the object to the viewer can vary continuously, each giving rise to a different two-dimensional projection. The object can be occluded by other objects or texture fields, as when viewed behind foliage. The object need not be presented as a full-colored textured image but instead can be a simplified line drawing. Moreover, the object can even be missing some of its parts or be a novel exemplar of its particular category. But it is only with rare exceptions that an image fails to be rapidly and readily classified, either as an instance of a familiar object category or as an instance that cannot be so classified (itself a form of classification)."

The efficiency and quality is exhibited in a live demonstration that recognizes CD-covers from a database of 40000 images of popular music CD\u2019s. The scheme builds upon popular techniques of indexing descriptors extracted from local regions, and is robust to background clutter and occlusion. The local region descriptors are hierarchically quantized in a vocabulary tree. The vocabulary tree allows a larger and more discriminatory vocabulary to be used efficiently, which we show experimentally leads to a dramatic improvement in retrieval quality. The most significant property of the scheme is that the tree directly defines the quantization. The quantization and the indexing are therefore fully integrated, essentially being one and the same. The recognition quality is evaluated through retrieval on a database with ground truth, showing the power of the vocabulary tree approach, going as high as 1 million images."

This paper presents a simple but effective coding scheme called Locality-constrained Linear Coding (LLC) in place of the VQ coding in traditional SPM. LLC utilizes the locality constraints to project each descriptor into its local-coordinate system, and the projected coordinates are integrated by max pooling to generate the final representation. With linear classifier, the proposed approach performs remarkably better than the traditional nonlinear SPM, achieving state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks. Compared with the sparse coding strategy [22], the objective function used by LLC has an analytical solution. In addition, the paper proposes a fast approximated LLC method by first performing a K-nearest-neighbor search and then solving a constrained least square fitting problem, bearing computational complexity of O(M + K2). Hence even with very large codebooks, our system can still process multiple frames per second. This efficiency significantly adds to the practical values of LLC for real applications."

Using binary Bayesian classifiers, we attempt to capture high level concepts from low level image features under the constraint that the test image does belong to one of the classes of interest. Specifically, we consider the hierarchical classification of vacation images; at the highest level, images are classified into indoor/outdoor classes, outdoor images are further classified into city/landscape classes, and finally, a subset of landscape images is classified into sunset, forest, and mountain classes. We demonstrate that a small codebook (the optimal size of codebook is selected using a modified MDL criterion) extracted from a vector quantizer can be used to estimate the class-conditional densities of the observed features needed for the Bayesian methodology. On a database of 6931 vacation photographs, our system achieved an accuracy of 90.5% for indoor vs. outdoor classification, 95.3% for city vs. landscape classification, 96.6% for sunset vs. forest and mountain classification, and 95.5% for forest vs. mountain classification. We further develop a learning paradigm to incrementally train the classifiers as additional training samples become available and also show preliminary results for feature size reduction using clustering techniques."

They can be applied to problems of maximizing an arbitrary real valued objective function over any set whatever, subject to bounds on the values of any other finite collection of real valued functions denned on the same set. While the use of the Lagrange multipliers does not guarantee that a solution will necessarily be found for all problems, it is \u201cfail-safe\u201d in the sense that any solution found by their use is a true solution. Since the method is so simple compared to other available methods it is often worth trying first, and succeeds in a surprising fraction of cases. They are particularly well suited to the solution of problems of allocating limited resources among a set of independent activities."
