Several critical functions have been investigated and the technical approaches are discussed. The first is the segmentation and classification of digitized printed documents into regions of text and images. A nonlinear, run-length smoothing algorithm has been used for this purpose. By using the regular features of text lines, a linear adaptive classification scheme discriminates text regions from others. The second technique studied is an adaptive approach to the recognition of the hundreds of font styles and sizes that can occur on printed documents. A preclassifier is constructed during the input process and used to speed up a well-known pattern-matching method for clustering characters from an arbitrary print source into a small sample of prototypes. Experimental results are included."

In the facsimile mode, a symbol blocking operator isolates document symbols such as alphanumeric characters and other recurring binary patterns. The first symbol encountered is placed in a library, and as each new symbol is detected, it is compared with each entry of the library. If the comparison is within a tolerance, the library identification code is transmitted along with the symbol location coordinates. Otherwise, the new symbol is placed in the library and its binary pattern is transmitted. Nonisolated symbols are left behind as a residue, and are coded by a two-dimensional run-length coding method. In the symbol recognition mode, the library is prerecorded and each entry is labeled with its ASCII code. As each character is recognized, only the ASCII code in transmitted. Computer simulation results are presented for the CCITT standard documents. With text-predominate documents, the compression ratio obtained with the CSM algorithm in the facsimile mode exceeds that obtained with the best run-length coding techniques by a factor of two or more and is comparable for graphics-predominate documents. In the symbol recognition mode, compression ratios of 250:1 have been achieved on business letter documents."

This paper presents some of our new results in AUTORED research. The design of AUTORED consists of two major components: automatic interpretation of electronic diagrams, and organization of interpretation results into a knowledge base for CAD applications. An electronic circuit diagram may be segmented into three parts which are the graphical functional symbols, the connection line segments, and the denotations. New techniques for extracting symbols and denotations from the circuit diagram are presented in this paper. These techniques are designed for junction and corner extraction, line segment tracing and linking, line segment classification, connection-line segment removal and blocking, symbol locating and denotation character grouping. A knowledge base is developed to facilitate the tracing, template-matching, and categorization processes."
