Numerous approaches have been attempted, but they all suuer from the obvious diiculty that search and retrieval is quintessentially a cognitive task; the degree of automatic language understanding required for a completely automatic solution is clearly beyond the bounds of current technology. Instead, heuristic search techniques attempt to match an admittedly incomplete query description with an admittedly incomplete set of features extracted from the texts of interest. The challenge therefore lies in the development of procedures that more eeectively bridge the gap between an individual's partially stated desires and a universe of text, which typically appears, computationally, as a sequence of uninterpreted words. Many of these procedures are statistical in nature; they take advantage of repeated occurrences of the same word to infer relations between documents, and between queries and documents. 1 For example, similarity search induces a \\relevance\" ordering on the text collection by scoring each document with a normalized sum of importance weights assigned to each word in common between it and the query, where the importance weights depend upon document and collection, or corpus, frequencies 28]. A more formal approach scores documents with their estimated probability of relevance to the query by adopting a text model which assumes word occurrences are sequentially uncorrelated and training on a set of known relevant documents 3, 30]. In contrast, polysemy (one word having multiple senses) and word correlation is directly addressed by Latent Semantic Indexing, which attempts to exact characteristic linear combinations through a singular value decomposition of a word co-occurrence matrix 12]. The availability of interdocument similarity measures suggests clustering, which has been pursued both as an accelerator for conventional search and as a query broadening tool 31]. Finally, linear discriminant analysis has been deployed to 1 Here \\document\" need not correspond to any particular organization. It might be a chapter within a book, a section within a chapter, or an individual paragraph. In the following we will assume that the set of documents forming a corpus is an exhaustive and disjoint partition of that corpus."

This improves upon the naive O(n 3) implementation of single linkage clustering. A single linkage dendrogram is a tree, where each level of the tree corresponds to a different threshold dissimilarity measure h. The nodes of a dataset are grouped into \" equivalence classes \" c(h) at each level of the dendrogram, where two classes C i and C j are merged if there is a pair of \" OTU's \" (vertices) v i \u2208 C i and v j \u2208 C j such that the dissimilarity measure between v i and v j is less than h, or D(v i , v j) < h. For example, consider a set of 10 vertices v 1 ,. .. , v 10 for which the dissimilarity matrix D is given below, with D ij equal to the dissimilarity between v i and v j. Suppose we take four cutoff dissimilarity measures h 1 , h 2 , h 3 , h 4 and produce the dendrogram according to these thresholds. An example illustrating how the 10 vertices are grouped into equivalence classes at each level is shown in Figure 1. Since no dissimilarity is at or below 1, each vertex or \" OTU \" is its own equivalence class at the level corresponding to h 1 = 1. At the next level, however, we see that some classes have been merged together because several dissimilarity measures are below h 2 = 2. We can see that c(h 2) consists of 6 equivalence classes, c(h 3) has 3 equivalence classes, and c(h 4 = 4) aggregates all the vertices into one equivalence class. In single linkage clustering, the number of levels in the tree is determined by the nearest-neighbor criterion \u2013 at each level, at least one new merge is made between two clusters, and the merge is made for clusters C i and C j if the minimal distance between vertices v i \u2208 C i and v j \u2208 C j is the smallest such distance across all the clusters. In other words, the nearest neighbors between clusters C j and C i are found, and if these neighbors are closer than all the other nearest-neighbor pairs, then C i and C \u2026"
