An important area of research involves designing a machine that can adequately improve its own performance as well as solve other problems normally requiring human intelligence. Work in heuristic programming that seems most relevant to this goal will be discussed at length. Important subproblems are devising techniques for self-improvement, the general problem of deciding what task to best work on next in a network of tasks, and the general problem of how to mechanize learning or inductive inference. Some work in linguistics and pattern recognition is directly concerned with the induction problem. Another area of research that will be treated is simulation of organic evolution."

The focus in time is the period 1963-1968. Brief tours are made over a variety of topics: generality, integrated robots, game playing, theorem proving, semantic information processing, etc. One program, which employs the heuristic search paradigm to generate explanatory hypotheses in the analysis of mass spectra of organic molecules, is described in some detail. The problem of representation for problem solving systems is discussed. Various centers of excellence in the artificial intelligence research area is mentioned. A bibliography of 76 references is given."

As computer applications become more sophisticated, however, and thus more influential in human affairs, it becomes increasingly important to understand both the capabilities and limitations of machine Intelligence and its potential impact on society. To this end, the artificial intelligence field was examined in a systematic manner. The study was divided into two parts: (1) Delineation of areas of artificial intelli gence, and postulatio\" of hypothetical products resulting from progress in the field, and (2) A judgmental portion, which involved applications and implications of the products to society. \n \nFor the latter purpose, a Delphi study was conducted among experts in the artificial intelligence field to solicit their opinion concerning prototype and commercial dates for the products, and the possibility and desirability of their applications and implications."

A computer can do, in a sense, only what it is told to do. But even when we do not know how to solve a certain problem, we may program a machine (computer) to Search through some large space of solution attempts. Unfortunately, this usually leads to an enormously inefficient process. With Pattern-Recognition techniques, efficiency can often be improved, by restricting the application of the machine's methods to appropriate problems. Pattern-Recognition, together with Learning, can be used to exploit generalizations based on accumulated experience, further reducing search. By analyzing the situation, using Planning methods, we may obtain a fundamental improvement by replacing the given search with a much smaller, more appropriate exploration. To manage broad classes of problems, machines will need to construct models of their environments, using some scheme for Induction. Wherever appropriate, the discussion is supported by extensive citation of the literature and by descriptions of a few of the most successful heuristic (problem-solving) programs constructed to date."

                "text": "A model of human information processing during concept formation has been constructed, using a list processing, digital computer program. The program's input consists of descriptions of objects in terms of dimensions and values. The universe of objects is divided into two or more sets. The program attempts to form a decision rule, based upon the descriptions of the objects, which can be used to assign any previously presented or new object to its correct set.\n The program is a model for human information processing, rather than an artificial intelligence system. It contains features which limit the number of objects in internal memory and the number of dimensions which may be involved in an answer. Using this program, simulations have been performed of a number of psychological experiments in concept learning. Comparison of these simulations with the data <u>obtained from human subjects will be discussed</u>.\n What is a concept? Ordinary usage is not precise. The English \"the concept of force\", \"the concept of massive retaliation,\" and the \"concept of dogs\" are all permissible. Church has offered a definition which has been accepted, implicitly, by psychologists who perform \"concept learning\" experiments. Church's argument is that any given symbol (or <u>name</u>) can be attached to the members of a set of objects. For any arbitrary object there exists a rule concerning the description of the object, a rule which can be used to decide whether or not the object is a member of the set of objects to which the name applies. The decision rule is the concept of the name, the set of objects is the denotation of the name.\n In a typical concept learning experiment the subject is confronted with a series of stimuli which are given a particular name and another series of stimuli which are either given another particular name, or a series of different names. Thus the first set might be called \"dogs\" and the second either \"not-dogs\" or \"cats, wolves, sheep, etc.\" Thus some routines are necessary to classify the instances to correspond to the names assigned by the experimenter. These are our ordering routines. Sometimes the various stimuli given one name have certain common characteristics, e.g. all the positive instances may have three triangles. At other times there are no common stimulus elements, but there are common relationships, e.g. all the positive instances may have the same size of upper figure as lower figure, although the figures may be large, medium or small sized in each row. A machine routine may be required to describe relations between basic stimulus elements. So we must have description routines in a simulation. Finally, different types of stimulus sets may be organized differently in terms of different types of logical connectives. Sometimes the concept involves the joint presence of two or more characteristics. Such concepts are referred to as conjunctive concepts (e.g. large red figure). Other concepts involve the presence of different subsets of characteristics. These are disjunctive concepts, e.g. red <u>or</u> large figures. Different ways of defining the form of an answer are provided by a set of solution routines.\n The program must be capable of simulating a variety of conditions under which experiments have been performed. As illustrations of some of the variations, or manipulations, which must be simulated the following may be mentioned.\n The number and complexity of the stimuli may vary from study to study. The speed of presentation of new stimuli can be altered. The instances may be left in view or the subject may be forced to rely on his memory. Different concept learning problems can be compared along such dimensions as: logical complexity of the correct answer, number of relevant vs. number of irrelevant dimensions, order of presentation of problems of different types, and presentation of information by positive or negative instances.\n The subject may make a variety of responses during the experiment. Subjects may describe, verbally, their intermediate and final hypotheses concerning the characteristics of the concept. These responses may give us clues as to the nature of the individual's information processing procedures. As such, they constitute accessory measures used in our simulation studies. The time taken to develop an answer under various experimental conditions is also a useful response measure. The errors that subjects make in subsequent identifications of stimulus names can be analyzed. The more objective records are to be preferred, and our major goal is to predict these by computer simulation.\n In order to develop a theoretical explanation of concept learning we have accepted the \"black box\" analogy. We have attempted to write a computer program which, when given as input coded representations of the stimuli, will give as output coded responses that can be used to predict the responses of a human subject. Accurate prediction of the responses, not the development of a good hypothesis developer, nor, solely, the reproduction of previously obtained protocols, is our goal. We are not concerned with the processes specific to the task of categorizing geometric patterns. These are used as stimuli because they are convenient and because they represent stimuli which can be described in terms of previously discriminated stimuli. Hopefully we shall be able to make conclusions about concept learning processes irrespective of the particular form of the stimuli.\n Reports of our psychological experimental work have been, and are being, made in separate publications. This paper will be concerned with the programming details of our concept learning model. This model has been completed, debugged, and used to simulate several experiments. After describing the model we shall indicate the result of some simulations and discuss the modifications of the model which have been indicated.\n The concept learning program is a list processing language program written for the IBM 709-7090 data processing systems. The original programs were written in Information Processing Language V (IPL-V), the interpreter list processing language developed by Newell, Simon, and Shaw (cf. Green). Partly for local administrative reasons, we are in the process of converting our programs to LISP, a list processing language developed by McCarthy. We do not have sufficient experience with LISP to compare the two languages for our type of problem. As the basic logic of the LISP and IPL-V programs are the same no distinction will be made between them."

                "text": "Introduction Few of those who have seen a modern high-speed digital computer digest and transform a mass of data in less time than it takes to follow the process in the mind can suppress a certain amount of speculation concerning the future of such machines. Under the assumption that the computer is operating at the mere threshhold of its capacity in performing the tasks we have thus far delegated to it, a long-range program directed at the problem of \"intelligent\" behavior and learning in machines has been established at the IBM Research Center in New York (Gelernter and Rochester, 1958). In particular the technique of heuristic programming is under detailed investigation as a means to the end of applying large-scale digital computers to the solution of a difficult class of problems currently considered to be beyond their capabilities; namely those problems that seem to require the agent of human intelligence and ingenuity for their solution. It is difficult to characterize such problems further, except, perhaps, to remark rather vaguely that they generally involve complex decision processes in a potentially infinite and uncontrollable environment. If, however, we should restrict the universe of problems to those that amount to the discovery of a proof for a theorem in some well-defined formal system, then the distinguishing characteristics of those problems of special interest to us are brought clearly into focus. We should like our machine to be able to prove many of the theorems presented to it in a formal system that is manifestly undecidable. Further, as the machine 134 gains \"experience\" in proving theorems, we should expect it to be able to solve problems that were earlier beyond its capabilities. The requirement that a machine should deal with undecidable systems places a fundamental restriction on its modus operandi. Finding a suitable algorithm, the obvious technique for the solution of problems on a digital computer, is no longer acceptable for the simple reason that no such algorithm exists. An exhaustive search for the initial axioms and theorems of the proof, combined with exhaustive development of the proof sequence by systematically applying the rules of transformation until the required proof has been produced, has been shown to be much too time-consuming for so simple a logic as propositional calculus (Newell, Shaw and Simon, 1957 a). It is a fortiori out of the question for any of the more interesting logics. A remaining alternative is \u2026"

                "text": "This paper proposes a modular ACTOR architecture and definitional method for artificial intelligence that is conceptually based on a single kind of object: actors [or, if you will, virtual processors, activation frames, or streams]. The formalism makes no presuppositions about the representation of primitive data structures and control structures. Such structures can be programmed, micro-coded, or hard wired in a uniform modular fashion. In fact it is impossible to determine whether a given object is \"really\" represented as a list, a vector, a hash table, a function, or a process. The architecture will efficiently run the coming generation of PLANNER-like artificial intelligence languages including those requiring a high degree of parallelism. The efficiency is gained without loss of programming generality because it only makes certain actors more efficient; it does not change their behavioral characteristics. The architecture is general with respect to control structure and does not have or need goto, interrupt, or semaphore primitives. The formalism achieves the goals that the disallowed constructs are intended to achieve by other more structured methods. PLANNER Progress \"Programs should not only work, but they should appear to work as well.\" PDP-1X Dogma The PLANNER project is continuing research in natural and effective means for embedding knowledge in procedures. In the course of this work we have succeeded in unifying the formalism around one_ fundamental concept: the ACTOR. Intuitively, an ACTOR is an active agent which plays a role on cue according to a script. We use the ACTOR metaphor to emphasize the inseparability of control and data flow in our model. Data structures, functions, semaphores, monitors, ports, descriptions, Quillian nets, logical formulae, numbers, identifiers, demons, processes, contexts, and data bases can all be shown to be special cases of actors. All of the above are objects with certain useful modes of behavior. Our formalism shows how all of the modes of behavior can be defined in terms of one kind of behavior: sending messages to actors. An actor is always invoked uniformly in exactly the same way regardless of whether it behaves as a recursive function, data structure, or process. \"It is vain to multiply Entities beyond need.\" William of Occam \"Monotheism is the Answer.\" The unification and simplification of the formalisms for the procedural embedding of knowledge has a great many benefits for us: FOUNDATIONS: The concept puts procedural semantics [the theory of how things operate] on a firmer basis. It will now be possible to do cleaner theoretical studies of the relation between procedural semantics and set-theoretic semantics such as model theories of the quantificational calculus and the lambda calculus. LOGICAL CALCULAE: A procedural semantics is developed for the quantificational calculus. The logical constants FOR-ALL, THERE-EXISTS, AND, OR, NOT, and IMPLIES are defined as actors. KNOWLEDGE BASED PROGRAMMING is programming in an environment which has a substantial knowledge base in the application area for which the programs are intended. The actor formalism aids knowledge based programming in the following ways: PROCEDURAL EMBEDDING of KNOWLEDGE, TRACING BEHAVIORAL DEPENDENCIES, and SUBSTANTIATING that ACTORS SATISFY their INTENTIONS. INTENTIONS: Furthermore the confirmation of properties of procedures is made easier and more uniform. Every actor has an INTENTION which checks that the prerequisites and the context of the actor being sent the message are satisfied. The intention is the CONTRACT that the actor has with the outside world. How an actor fullfills its contract is its own business. By a SIMPLE BUG we mean an actor which does not satisfy its intention. We would like to eliminate simple debugging of actors by the META-EVALUATION of actors to show that they satisfy their intentions. Suppose that there is an external audience of actors E which satisfy the intentions.of the actors to which they send messages. Intuitively, the principle of ACTOR INDUCTION states that the intentions of all actions caused by E are in turn satisfied provided that the following condition holds: If for each actor A the' intention of A is satisfied => that the intentions of all actors sent messages by A are satisfied. Computational induction [Manna], structural induction [Burstall], and Peano induction are all special cases of ACTOR induction. Actor based intentions have the following advantages: The intention is decoupled from the actors it describes. Intentions of concurrent actions are more easily disentangled. We can more elegantly write intentions The intentions are written in the same formalism as the Because for dialogues between actors. procedures they describe. Thus for example intentions can have intentions, protection is an intrinsic property of actors, we hope to be able to deal with protection issues in the same straight forward manner as more conventional intentions. Intentions of data structures are handled by the same machinery as for all other actors. COMPARATIVE SCHEMATOLOGY: The theory of comparative power of control structures is I"

The experiments were aimed at the dual objectives of throwing light on some of the problems of constructing more powerful programming languages and compilers, and of testing whether the task of writing a computer program can be regarded as a \"problem\" in the sense in which that term is used in GPS. The present paper is concerned primarily with the second objective--with analyzing some of the problem-solving processes that are involved in writing computer programs. At the present stage of their development, no claims will be made for the heuristic programming procedures described here as practical approaches to the construction of compilers. Their interest lies in what they teach us about the nature of the programming task."

Besides providing a library of useful subroutines with a uniform calling sequence, the author of a higher level language imposes his theory of problem solving on the user. By choosing what primitive data structures, control structures, and operators he presents, he makes the implementation of some algorithms more difficult than others, thus discouraging some techniques and encouraging others. So, to be good, a higher level language must not only simplify the job of programming, by providing features which package programming structures commonly found in the domain for which the language was designed, it must also do its best to discourage the use of structures which lead to bad algorithms."

A format-matching procedure extracts semantic content from English sentences. If an input sentence is declarative, the system adds appropriate information to the model. If an input sentence is a question, the system searches the model until it either finds the answer or determines why it cannot find the answer. In all cases SIR reports its conclusions. The system has some capacity to recognize exceptions to general rules, resolve certain semantic ambiguities, and modify its model structure in order to save computer memory space. Judging from its conversational ability, SIR is more \"intelligent\" than any existing question-answering system. The author describes how this ability was developed and how the basic features of SIR compare with those of other systems. The working system, SIR , is a first step toward intelligent machine communication. The author proposes a next step by describing how to construct a more general system which is less complex and yet more powerful than SIR . This proposed system contains a generalized version of the SIR model, a formal logical system called SIR1 , and a computer program for testing the truth of SIR1 statements with respect to the generalized model by using partial proof procedures in the predicate calculus. The thesis also describes the formal properties of SIR1 and how they relate to the logical structure of SIR ."

Theorem-proving on the computer, using procedures based on the fund~mental theorem of Herbrand concerning the first-order predicate etdeulus, is examined with ~ view towards improving the efticieney and widening the range of practical applicability of these procedures. A elose analysis of the process of substitution (of terms for variables), and the process of t ruth-funct ional analysis of the results of such substitutions, reveals that both processes can be combined into a single new process (called resolution), i terating which is vastty more ef[ieient than the older cyclic procedures consisting of substitution stages alternating with truth-functional analysis stages. The theory of the resolution process is presented in the form of a system of first<~rder logic with .just one inference principle (the resolution principle). The completeness of the system is proved; the simplest proof-procedure based oil the system is then the direct implementation of the proof of completeness. Howew~r, this procedure is quite inefficient, ~nd the paper concludes with a discussion of several principles (called search principles) which are applicable to the design of efficient proof-procedures employing resolution as the basle logical process."

The advent of the modern high-speed digital computer has opened the way for us to solve many of these problems. Although virtually all of these problems are finite, it is well-known that their size grows extremely rapidly and we can usually expect the computer to do by exhaustive search just a few cases larger than what can be done by hand. Intelligent search procedures such as banach and bound (Little, Murty, Sweeney and Karel (1963), Lawles and Wood (1964)), back-track programming (Golomb and Baument (1965), Walker (1960)), linear or dynamic programming (Gomery (1963), Bellman (1962), Held and Karp (1962)), together with isomorphic rejection (Swift, 1960) help to reduce the total number of cases to be considered but more often than not, we are interested in the solution to problems which are still too large for these techniques. Here some sort of heuristics have to be employed, whereby we hope that the solution (in the instance where a solution when found may be readily verified), or a probably solution, or a useful partial or approximate solution may be obtained in reasonable computation time."

The program is called SAINT, an acronym for \"Symbolic Automatic INTegrator.\" This paper discusses the SAINT program and its performance. SAINT performs indefinite integration. I t also performs definite and multiple integration when these are trivial extensions of indefinite integration. I t uses many of the methods and heuristics of students attacking the same problems. SAINT took an average of two minutes each to solve 52 of the 54 attempted problems taken from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology freshman calculus final examinations. Based on this and other experiments with SAINT, some conclusions concerning computer solution of such problems are: (1) Pattern recognition is of fundamental importance. (2) Great benefit would have been derived from a larger memory and more convenient symbol manipulating facilities. (3) The solution of a symbolic integration problem by a commercially available computer is far cheaper and faster than by man."

Some conclusions drawn in the article are: (1) DEDUCOM can answer a wide variety of questions. (2) A human can increase the deductive power of DEDUCOM by telling it more facts. (3) DEDUCOM can write very simple programs (it is hoped that this ability is the forerunner of an ability to self-program, which is a way to learn). (4) DEDUCOM is very slow in answering questions. (5) DEDUCOM's search procedure at present has two bad defects: some questions answerable from the given facts cannot be answered and some other answerable questions can be answered only if the relevant facts are given in the \"right\" order. (6) At present, DEDUCOM's method of making logical deductions in predicate calculus has two bad defects: some facts have to be changed to logically equivalent ones before being given to DEDUCOM, and some redundant facts have to be given to DEDUCOM."

The formalism is built out of a number of problem-solving primitives together with a hierarchical multiprocess backtrack control structure. Statements can be asserted and perhaps later withdrawn as the state of the world changes. Under BACKTRACK control structure, the hierarchy of activations of functions previously executed is maintained so that it is possible to revert to any previous state. Thus programs can easily manipulate elaborate hypothetical tentative states. In addition PLANNER uses multiprocessing so that there can be multiple loci of control over the problem-solving."

Another author considered GO to be somewhat mysterious, making it a challenge to those interested in automating it. Apparently the game was described as being mysterious to indicate that people were able to play it without knowing how they were able to play so well. More study of this complex game may reward us with new insight into human perceptual and problem solving abilities as well as foster the development of new techniques for artificial intelligence. This report describes a program which plays GO. The program uses an information processing model to produce perceptual features which are seen by human GO players, and is capable of several responses to the recognition of significant configurations of these perceptual features."

                "text": "An information processing model of elementary human symbolic learning is given a precise statement as a computer program, called Elementary Perceiver and Memorizer (EPAM). The program simulates the behavior of subjects in experiments involving the rote learning of nonsense syllables. A discrimination net which grows is the basis of EPAM's associative memory. Fundamental information processes include processes for discrimination, discrimination learning, memorization, association using cues, and response retrieval with cues. Many well-known phenomena of rote learning are to be found in EPAM's experimental behavior, including some rather complex forgetting phenomena. EPAM is programmed in Information Processing Language V.\n H. A. Simon has described some current research in the simulation of human higher mental processes and has discussed some of the techniques and problems which have emerged from this research. The purpose of this paper is to place these general issues in the context of a particular problem by describing in detail a simulation of elementary human symbolic learning processes.\n The information processing model of mental functions employed is realized by a computer program called Elementary Perceiver and Memorizer (EPAM). The EPAM program is the precise statement of an information processing theory of verbal learning that provides an alternative to other verbal learning theories which have been proposed. It is the result of an attempt to state quite precisely a parsimonious and plausible mechanism sufficient to account for the rote learning of nonsense syllables. The critical evaluation of EPAM must ultimately depend not upon the interest which it may have as a learning machine, but upon its ability to explain and predict the phenomena of verbal learning.\n I should like to preface my discussion of the simulation of verbal learning with some brief remarks about the class of information processing models of which EPAM is a member.\n a. These are models of mental processes, not brain hardware. They are <u>psychological</u> models of mental function. No physiological or neurological assumptions are made, nor is any attempt made to explain information processes in terms of more elementary neural processes.\n b. These models conceive of the brain as an <u>information processor</u> with sense organs as input channels, effector organs as output devices, and with internal programs for testing, comparing, analyzing, rearranging, and storing information.\n c. The central processing mechanism is assumed to be serial; i.e., capable of doing only one (or a very few) things at a time.\n d. These models use as a basic unit the <u>information symbol</u>; i.e., a pattern of bits which is assumed to be the brain's internal representation of environmental data.\n e. These models are essentially <u>deterministic</u>, not probabilistic. Random variables play no fundamental role in them."

PILOT operates as an interface between the user and his programs, monitoring both the requests of the user and operation of his programs. For example, if PILOT detects an error during the execution of a program, it takes appropriate correactive action based on previous Instructions from the user. Similarly, the user can give directions to PILOT about the operation of his programs, even while they are runing, and PILOT by instructing it about its own operation, anf thus develop his own language and conventions for interacting with PILOT. \n \nSeveral examples are presented."

The first phase is designed to catalyze the potential resources of industrial concerns by developing two demonstrable systems that include general-purpose programmed manipulation and automated inspection. The second phase, with longer term objectives, would aim at devising techniques to broaden the utilization of programmed manipulators and sensors, to provide supervisory control of these systems by human speech, and to develop a capability for automatic manipulation of two or more sensor-controlled \u201chands\u201d working cooperatively."

Current approaches to semantic analysis and logical inference are seen to be effective beginnings but of questionable generality with respect either to subtle aspects of meaning or to applications over large subsets of English. Generalizing from current small-scale experiments to language-processing systems based on dictionaries with thousands of entries\u2014with correspondingly large grammars and semantic systems\u2014may entail a new order of complexity and require the invention and development of entirely different approaches to semantic analysis and question answering."

First we describe various techniques akin to substitution. These techniques can be used to decrease the size of an expression and make it more intelligible to a user. Then we delineate the spectrum of approaches to the design of automatic simplification capabilities in an algebraic manipulation system. Systems are divided into five types. Each type provides different facilities for the manipulation and simplification of expressions. Finally we discuss some of the theoretical results related to algebraic simplification. We describe several positive results about the existence of powerful simplification algorithms and the number-theoretic conjectures on which they rely. Results about the nonexistence of algorithms for certain classes of expressions are included."

This theory retains the fruitful concept of the Innate Releasing Mechanism introduced by Lorenz and unifies the description of instinctive behavior in terms of hierarchies of feedback loops organized as Behavior Units. The latter are activated by a complex organization of IRM's and Selection Units operating continuously among a host of competing pressures, internal and external, to select the most appropriate action. Various assumptions about the role of learning in instinct-dominated animals are exposed and examples are given of the connection between our assumptions about learning and the modified theory of instinct. \n \n \n \nTo validate the theory and permit its development in greater detail, a computer simulation of the theory has been undertaken, using an artificial animal, ADROIT, as the \u201cguinea pig.\u201d Progress to date with this simulation is discussed."

Running computer programs implement the methods and many examples illustrate their behavior. The input is a two-dimensional line-drawing of the scene, assumed to contain three-dimensional bodies possessing flat faces (polyhedra); some of them may be partially occluded. Suggestions are made for extending the work to curved objects. Some comparisons are made with human visual perception. The main conclusion is that it is possible to separate a picture or scene into the constituent objects exclusively on the basis of monocular geometric properties (on the basis of pure form); in fact, successful methods are shown."

QA4 integrates an omega-order logic language with canonical composition, associative retrieval, and pattern matching of expressions; process structure programming; goal-directed searching; and demons. Thus it provides many useful programming aids. More importantly, however, it provides a semantic framework for common sense reasoning about these problem domains. The interpreter for the language is extraordinarily general, and is therefore an adaptable tool for developing the specialized techniques of intuitive, symbolic reasoning used by the intelligent systems."

A complete index of all content words in text is first searched to find information-rich statements which may be answers to the question. Each of these statements is then dependency analyzed to determine if the words (or synonyms) which correspond to question words maintain the dependency relations holding in the question. A simple semantic evaluation of structurally acceptable answers follows. A human editor working with the computer system helps to resolve syntactic ambiguities which are otherwise a major stumbling block in question-answering systems."

The analysis proceeds by building up, step by step, a partial line drawing representation of a digitized television picture. An interesting feature of the system is an executive program that uses detailed knowledge of the environment to control other programs that extract the partial line drawing. Examples are given to illustrate the operation of this experimental program."

For example: P(b, x) -P(b, x) Q(y) R(a, b, x, z, c) S are all literals if P, Q, R, and S are two-, one-, five-, and zero-place predicate letters, respectively. The predicate letter is usually thought of as standing for some n-place relation. Then the literal P(a, b), for example, is thought of as saying that the ordered pair (a, b) has the property P.

A semantic network purports to represent concepts expressed by natural-language words and phrases as nodes connected to other such concepts by a particular set of arcs called semantic relations. Primitive concepts in this system of semantic networks are word-sense meanings. Primitive semantic relations are those that the verb of a sentence has with its subject, object, and prepositional phrase arguments in addition to those that underlie common lexical, classificational and modificational relations. A complete statement of semantic relations would include all those relations that would be required in the total classification of a natural language vocabulary. We consider the theory and model of semantic nets to be a computational theory of superficial verbal understanding in humans. W e conceive semantic nodes as representing human verbal concept structures and semantic relations connecting two such structures as representing the linguistic processes of thought that are used to combine them into natural-language descriptions of events. Some psycholin-guistic evidence supports this theory"

We find that no finite-state Markov process that produces symbols with transition from state to state can serve as an English grammar. Furthermore, the particular subclass of such processes that produce n -order statistical approximations to English do not come closer, with increasing n , to matching the output of an English grammar. We formalize-the notions of \"phrase structure\" and show that this gives us a method for describing language which is essentially more powerful, though still representable as a rather elementary type of finite-state process. Nevertheless, it is successful only when limited to a small subset of simple sentences. We study the formal properties of a set of grammatical transformations that carry sentences with phrase structure into new sentences with derived phrase structure, showing that transformational grammars are processes of the same elementary type as phrase-structure grammars; that the grammar of English is materially simplified if phrase structure description is limited to a kernel of simple sentences from which all other sentences are constructed by repeated transformations; and that this view of linguistic structure gives a certain insight into the use and understanding of language."

Rather, it is an example of the \u201cdogwork\u201d involved in realizing initial design conceptions. A major portion of an architectural firm's time and effort is currently expended on the production aspects of design, of translating schematic design into construction documents1.\n General Space Planner* (GSP) is an automated design, drafting, and problem solving system recently implemented on Carnegie-Mellon University's IBM 360/67 time-shared computer that begins to explore how arrangement problems and other production aspects of design can be either automated or augmented by the computer.

More specifically, one is dealing with scenes composed of planar faced, convex objects. Extensions to the general planar faced case are discussed. The visual input is provided by a TV-camera, and the problem is to interpret that input by computer, as a projection of a three-dimensional scene. The system proposed and demonstrated in this paper uses perspectively consistent two-dimensional models (prototypes) of views of three-dimensional objects, and interpretations of scene-representations are based on the establishment of mapping relationships from conglomerates of scene-elements (line-constellations) to prototypes templates. The prototypes are learned by the program through analysis of - and generalization on - ideal instances."

Computer studies and a mathematical model established limits of performance of a person attempting to isolate a face from a population using feature descriptions. The model predicts that under certain conditions approximately 6 of an individual's features are required to isolate him from a population of 255. Human experiments under similar conditions showed unique identification occurred with an average of about 7 features. The model predicts that for a population of 4\u00d7106, only 14 feature-descriptions are required. These studies form a foundation for continuing research on real-time man-machine interaction for computer classification and identification of multidimensional vectors specified by noisy components."

Unlike automated programming, which focuses on developing systems that write programs, automated programmering involves developing systems which automate (or at least greatly facilitate) those tasks that a programmer performs other than writing programs: e.g., repairing syntactical errors to get programs to run in the first place, generating test cases, making tentative changes, retesting, undoing changes, reconfiguring, massive edits, et al., plus repairing and recovering from mistakes made during the above. When the system in which the programmer is operating is cooperative and helpful with respect to these activities, the programmer can devote more time and energy to the task of programming itself, i.e., to conceptualizing, designing and implementing. Consequently, he can be more ambitious, and more productive."

Use of the alpha-beta pruning algorithm instead of the simple minimax search reduces by a large factor the number of bottom positions which must be examined in the search. An analytical expression for the expected number of bottom positions examined in a game tree using alpha-beta pruning is derived, subject to the assumptions that the branching factor N and the depth D of the tree are arbitrary but fixed, and the bottom positions are a random permutation of (N sub D) unique values. A simple approximation to the growth rate of the expected number of bottom positions examined is suggested, based on a Monte Carlo simulation for large values of N and D. The behavior of the model is compared with the behavior of the alpha-beta algorithm in a chess playing program and the effects of correlation and non-unique bottom position values in real game trees are examined.

Such problems may range from the evaluation of analytical solutions to complicated differential or integral equations on the one hand, to the calculation of coefficients in a power series expansion or the computation of the derivative of a complicated function on the other. The difference between these two classes of problems is obvious; in the former case, no straightforward algorithm exists which will guarantee a solution, and indeed, an analytic form for the solution may not even exist. On the other hand, algorithms do exist for the solution of problems such as series expansion and differentiation, and therefore a correct answer may always be found provided that the researcher possesses sufficient time, perseverance, and accuracy to carry the more complicated problems through free of error. Many examples of this type of problem may be found in physics and engineering. Calculations of general relativistic effects in planetary motion, structural design calculations, and many of the calculations associated with elementary particle physics experiments at high energy accelerators, to name a few, may demand many man-months or even years of work before a useful and error free answer can be found, even though the operations involved are quite straightforward."

Since the construction of the algorithm is obtained by formal theorem-proving techniques, the programs that PROW writes are free from logical errors and do not have to be debugged The user of PROW can make PROW write programs in languages other than LISP by modifying the part of PROW that translates an algorithm to a LISP program. Thus PROW can be modified to write programs in any language In the end of this paper, it is shown that PROW can also be used as a question-answering program"

As most project schedulers are aware, however, activities may be constrained in their start dates by availability of resources as well as by technological orderings. Analytic solutions to the limited-resource, project scheduling problem are infeasible at present for all but small projects; heuristic approaches seem most promising of useful results. One such approach, described here, is a computer model capable of scheduling single or multiple projects within resource limits and other constraints commonly encountered by the project scheduler. The basic formulation of the model is discussed along with its scheduling heuristics which determine the period-by-period allocation of resources to activities in a project. By changing certain parameters and heuristics in the model, one can simulate project scheduling under varying constraints and scheduling rules. Applications of the model to a number of fictitious and real projects are described."

This method is complementary to the use of stereoscopy which relies on matching up sharp detail and will fail on smooth objects. Until now the image processing of single views has been restricted to objects which can meaningfully be considered two-dimensional or bounded by plane surfaces. It is possible to derive a first-order non-linear partial differential equation in two unknowns relating the intensity at the image points to the shape of the object. This equation can be solved by means of an equivalent set of five ordinary differential equations. A curve traced out by solving this set of equations for one set of starting values is called a characteristic strip. Starting one of these strips from each point on some initial curve will produce the whole solution surface. The initial curves can usually be constructed around so-called singular points. A number of applications of this method will be discussed including one to lunar topography and one to the scanning electron microscope. In both of these cases great simplifications occur in the equations. A note on polyhedra follows and a quantitative theory of facial make-up is touched upon. An implementation of some of these ideas on the PDP-6 computer with its attached image-dissector camera at the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory will be described, and also a nose-recognition program."

                "text": "This paper introduces a new programming technique which has met with considerable success in solving no-trump double-dummy bridge problems and checking solutions which have been generated by humans. Heuristic programs first attempt to locate some branch of the solution. When they succeed, a proof-checking program examines the heuristic line a~id dete~Tnines whether or not the proposed solution is correct. The proof-checking program is able to generalize the conditions under which the heuristic strategy works and to construct rigorous proofs by non-exhaustive met, hods. This paper describes a new approach to mechanical game playing. Excellent heuristic programs have previously been written to play checkers [10], qubic [3], chess [4], ka lah [6], and regular contract bridge [2]. Some of these programs can even beat their authors, but only the kalah and checkers programs can beat human experts and even they do not play a perfect game. Because of the extreme complexities of these games, exhaustive solution by machine is prohibitively t imeconsuming, and rigorous solution by human experts is prohibitively difficult. Thus, it has been necessary to settle for \"good\" moves instead of guaranteed ~vhming moves. Until now, rigorous solutions have been a t t empted only for a .few simple games, such as tic-tac-toe. Double -dummy bridge is intermediate in complexity. Like tic-tac-toe, all known positions can apparent ly be analyzed accurately by humans. However, for most deals, the size of the complete tree of legal moves is about 102\u00b0. Like the chess tree, the bridge tree is too large for an exhaustive search. We show here how new programming techniques enable rigorous solution of double-dummy problems by non-exhaustive methods. The vast major i ty of the different branches in the complete tree of legal moves is unimportant . Mos t of them occur only when each side blunders several times. Many of the others are equivalent, such as playing ace-king or king-ace. H u m a n problem solvers do not distinguish between these trivial branches, but concentrate on the essential branches. These are branches in North-South s t ra tegy caused by impor tan t ~ variat ions in the defense.

                "text": "A heuristic procedure for scheduling production rolls of paper through a finishing operation to cut them down to finished roll sizes is described. The ratio of service time to interarrival time of production rolls at the initial cutting station is large so that insufficient time is available to set it up unless a minimum number of production rolls are to be processed in the same manner. Otherwise, some portion of each production roll must go through a reprocessing operation to complete the cutting of finished sizes. The objective is to minimize the cost of trim loss and reprocessing. The procedure generates cutting patterns and usage levels sequentially until all the requirements are satisfied. At each step the search is dependent upon the characteristics of the unsatisfied requirements. A maximum of three solutions is generated for each problem. If none satisfies a predetermined aspiration level, the best of the three is chosen. The procedure was evaluated by scheduling a specific paper production facility and observing the results for a set of 15 problems. For each problem, the best solution was recorded. The overall results from this set of problems were then compared to previously recorded results on problems solved manually. There was a 16% improvement in solution quality for the heuristic procedure relative to the manual method."

Building resolution-based provers quickly became a second theme in automatic theorem proving, while other approaches languished. Resolution had a great influence on other application areas as well (Charts 1 and 8). Performance of the resolution systems reached impressive, if not superhuman, levels. Programs were written that could prove reasonably complex, sometimes novel, theorems in certain domains of mathematics. The best performance, however, was achieved by man-machine systems in which a skilled human provided strategic guidance leaving the system to verify lemmas and to fill in short chains of deduction. [See especially Guard et ale (1969) and Allen and Luckham (1970). The latter system has been used to obtain proofs of new mathematical results announced without proof in the Notices of the' American Mathematical Society."
