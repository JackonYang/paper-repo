It enables content- based browsing. We present our methods for automatic segmentation and recognition of text in digital videos. The algorithms we propose make use of typical characteristics of text in videos in order to enable and enhance segmentation and recognition performance. Especially the inter-frame dependencies of the characters provide new possibilities for their refinement. Then, a straightforward indexing and retrieval scheme is introduced. It is used in the experiments to demonstrate that the proposed text segmentation and text recognition algorithms are suitable for indexing and retrieval of relevant video scenes in and from a video data base. Our experimental results are very encouraging and suggest that these algorithms can be used in video retrieval applications as well as to recognize higher semantics in video."

                "text": "There are many applications in which the automatic detection and recognition of text embedded in images is useful. These applications include digad libraries, multimedia systems, and Geographical Information Systems. When machine generated text is prdnted against clean backgrounds, it can be converted to a computer readable form (ASCII) using current Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology. However, text is often printed against shaded or textured backgrounds or is embedded in images. Examples include maps, advertisements, photographs, videos and stock certificates. Current document segmentation and recognition technologies cannot handle these situafons well. In this paper, a four-step system which automaticnlly detects and extracts text in images i& proposed. First, a texture segmentation scheme is used to focus attention on regions where text may occur. Second, strokes are extracted from the segmented text regions. Using reasonable heuristics on text strings such as height similarity, spacing and alignment, the extracted strokes are then processed to form rectangular boxes surrounding the corresponding ttzt strings. To detect text over a wide range of font sizes, the above steps are first applied to a pyramid of images generated from the input image, and then the boxes formed at each resolution level of the pyramid are fused at the image in the original resolution level. Third, text is extracted by cleaning up the background and binarizing the detected ted strings. Finally, better text bounding boxes are generated by srsiny the binarized text as strokes. Text is then cleaned and binarized from these new boxes, and can then be passed through a commercial OCR engine for recognition if the text is of an OCR-recognizable font. The system is stable, robust, and works well on imayes (with or without structured layouts) from a wide van\u2019ety of sources, including digitized video frames, photographs, *This material is based on work supported in part by the National Science Foundation, Library of Congress and Department of Commerce under cooperative agreement number EEC9209623, in part by the United States Patent and mademark Office and Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency/IT0 under ARPA order number D468, issued by ESC/AXS contract number F19628-96-C-0235, in part by the National Science Foundation under grant number IF&9619117 and in part by NSF Multimedia CDA-9502639.

To achieve this goal, we present a technique, called Video OCR (Optical Character Reader), which detects, extracts, and reads text areas in digital video data. In this paper, we address problems, describe the method by which Video OCR operates, and suggest applications for its use in digital news archives. To solve two problems of character recognition for videos, low-resolution characters and extremely complex backgrounds, we apply an interpolation filter, multi-frame integration and character extraction filters. Character segmentation is performed by a recognition-based segmentation method, and intermediate character recognition results are used to improve the segmentation. We also include a method for locating text areas using text-like properties and the use of a language-based postprocessing technique to increase word recognition rates. The overall recognition results are satisfactory for use in news indexing. Performing Video OCR on news video and combining its results with other video understanding techniques will improve the overall understanding of the news video content."

Scene images are segmented into regions by an image segmentation method based on adaptive thresholding. Character candidate regions are detected by observing gray-level differences between adjacent regions. To ensure extraction of multisegment characters as well as single-segment characters, character pattern candidates are obtained by associating the detected regions according to their positions and gray levels. A character recognition process selects patterns with high similarities by calculating the similarities between character pattern candidates and the standard patterns in a dictionary and then comparing the similarities to the thresholds. A relaxational approach to determine character patterns updates the similarities by evaluating the interactions between categories of patterns, and finally character patterns and their recognition results are obtained. Highly promising experimental results have been obtained using the method on 100 images involving characters of different sizes and formats under uncontrolled lighting. >"

                "text": "Detecting and recognizing human faces automatically in digital images strongly enhance content-based video indexing systems. In this paper, a novel scheme for human faces detection in color images under nonconstrained scene conditions, such as the presence of a complex background and uncontrolled illumination, is presented. Color clustering and filtering using approximations of the YCbCr and HSV skin color subspaces are applied on the original image, providing quantized skin color regions. A merging stage is then iteratively performed on the set of homogeneous skin color regions in the color quantized image, in order to provide a set of potential face areas. Constraints related to shape and size of faces are applied, and face intensity texture is analyzed by performing a wavelet packet decomposition on each face area candidate in order to detect human faces. The wavelet coefficients of the band filtered images characterize the face texture and a set of simple statistical deviations is extracted in order to form compact and meaningful feature vectors. Then, an efficient and reliable probabilistic metric derived from the Bhattacharrya distance is used in order to classify the extracted feature vectors into face or nonface areas, using some prototype face area vectors, acquired in a previous training stage."

As an actual example, we developed a system that associates faces and names in videos, called Name-It, which is given news videos as a knowledge source, then automatically extracts face and name association as content information. The system can infer the name of a given unknown face image, or guess faces which are likely to have the name given to the system. This paper explains the method with several successful matching results which reveal effectiveness in integrating heterogeneous techniques as well as the importance of real content information extraction from video, especially face-name association."
