They tell us how much the picture signal can be perturbed without the perturbations being visible to human observers. We describe psychovisual experiments to determine the amplitude thresholds at a single edge having a given slope and then present methods to incorporate the visual threshold data directly into the design of quantizers for use in Differential Pulse Code Modulation (DPCM) systems. In the first class of methods, quantizer characteristics are obtained such that the quantization error is kept below the visual threshold as determined by the slope at a picture element and either (a) the number of quantizer levels, or (b) the entropy of the quantized output is minimized. In the second class of methods, different measures of the suprathreshold quantization error are minimized for a fixed number of levels, or for a given constraint on the entropy of the quantized signal. We present empirical relationships between the various distortion measures and the subjective quality of the pictures rated on a five point impairment scale. We then discuss the structure of the quantizers obtained by the above mentioned optimization methods, evaluate their performance on real pictures, and compare them with the ones described in the literature."

In this paper we present a systematic investigation of these changes in visual sensitivity and apply it to adapt the quantizer of a predictive coder. The paper consists of three parts. In the first part, earlier psychophysical work in related areas relevant to picture coding is briefly reviewed. Certain simple measures of luminance activity (called the masking functions) are constructed. Subjective experiments which obtain fidelity measures related to the masking functions, using complex scenes (real-life pictures, head and shoulders view), are described. These relationships, called the visibility functions, express relationship between the relative amplitude accuracy required by the viewer and the masking functions. Perceptual, statistical, and contextual properties are inherent in them. Relationship between the visibility functions and some earlier measurements of psychovisual weighting functions are pointed out. In the second part, several adaptation strategies for the quantizer of a predictive DPCM coder are discussed. These include uniform as well as nonuniform quantizers with or without entropy constraints. These strategies are simulated on a computer, and the results are presented in the third part. The simulations indicate that, for the same picture quality, by using adaptive strategies, entropy reductions of about 30-50 percent are possible over nonadaptive techniques."

                "text": "The digital representation of an image requires a very large number of bits. The goal of image coding is to reduce this number, as much as possible, and reconstruct a faithful duplicate of the original picture. Early efforts in image coding, solely guided by information theory, led to a plethora of methods. The compression ratio, starting at 1 with the first digital picture in the early 1960s, reached a saturation level around 10:1 a couple of years ago. This certainly does not mean that the upper bound given by the entropy of the source has also been reached. First, this entropy is not known and depends heavily on the model used for the source, i.e., the digital image. Second, the information theory does not take into account what the human eye sees and how it sees. Recent progress in the study of the brain mechanism of vision has opened new vistas in picture coding. Directional sensitivity of the neurones in the visual pathway combined with the separate processing of contours and textures has led to a new class of coding methods capable of achieving compression ratios as high as 70:1. Image quality, of course, remains as an important problem to be investigated. This class of methods, that we call second generation, is the subject of this paper. Two groups can be formed in this class: methods using local operators and combining their output in a suitable way and methods using contour-texture descriptions. Four methods, two in each class, are described in detail. They are applied to the same set of original pictures to allow a fair comparison of the quality in the decoded pictures. If more effort is devoted to this subject, a compression ratio of 100:1 is within reach."

The representation differs from established techniques in that the code elements are localized in spatial frequency as well as in space. Pixel-to-pixel correlations are first removed by subtracting a lowpass filtered copy of the image from the image itself. The result is a net data compression since the difference, or error, image has low variance and entropy, and the low-pass filtered image may represented at reduced sample density. Further data compression is achieved by quantizing the difference image. These steps are then repeated to compress the low-pass image. Iteration of the process at appropriately expanded scales generates a pyramid data structure. The encoding process is equivalent to sampling the image with Laplacian operators of many scales. Thus, the code tends to enhance salient image features. A further advantage of the present code is that it is well suited for many image analysis tasks as well as for image compression. Fast algorithms are described for coding and decoding."

The model exploits constraints provided by human psychophysics, notably that motion-sensing elements appear tuned for two-dimensional spatial frequency, and by the frequency spectrum of a moving image, namely, that its support lies in the plane in which the temporal frequency equals the dot product of the spatial frequency and the image velocity. The first stage of the model is a set of spatial-frequency-tuned, direction-selective linear sensors. The temporal frequency of the response of each sensor is shown to encode the component of the image velocity in the sensor direction. At the second stage, these components are resolved in order to measure the velocity of image motion at each of a number of spatial locations and spatial frequencies. The model has been applied to several illustrative examples, including apparent motion, coherent gratings, and natural image sequences. The model agrees qualitatively with human perception."

Out of this work have emerged new concepts of how the brain analyzes and recognizes visual images. The aim of this paper is to explain why \"spatial frequency analysis\" is useful, and to review the insights into visual function that have resulted from its application. It is important to note at the outset that while spatial frequency analysis can provide a comprehensive description of the behavior of neurons in which signals are summed linearly (see below), it has much more limited application to the behavior of neurons that combine signals nonlinearly. Because of this, the greatest insights into visual information processing have come and probably will continue to come from a combined use of space, time, spatial frequency, and temporal frequency measurements. The earliest applications of spatial frequency analysis were motivated by the idea that visual physiology and psychophysics could be more closely related by a uniform approach to the problems of spatial vision. This approach has continued to bind together the psychophysics and physiology of spatial vision, and the interested reader will find relevant psychophysical work discussed in reviews by Braddick et al (1978), De Valois & De Valois (1980), Robson (1980), Westheimer (1984), and Kelly & Burbeck (1984)."

This paper presents a simple yet efficient extension of this concept to the source coding of images. We specify the constraints for a set of two-dimensional quadrature mirror filters (QMF's) for a particular frequency-domain partition, and show that these constraints are satisfied by a separable combination of one-dimensional QMF's. Bits are then optimally allocated among the subbands to minimize the mean-squared error for DPCM coding of the subbands. Also, an adaptive technique is developed to allocate the bits within each subband by means of a local variance mask. Optimum quantization is employed with quantizers matched to the Laplacian distribution. Subband coded images are presented along with their signal-to-noise ratios (SNR's). The SNR performance of the subband coder is compared to that of the adaptive discrete cosine transform (DCT), vector quantization, and differential vector quantization for bit rates of 0.67, 1.0, and 2.0 bits per pixel for 256 \u00d7 256 monochrome images. The adaptive subband coder has the best SNR performance."

                "text": "Of the many possible functions of the macaque monkey primary visual cortex (striate cortex, area 17) two are now fairly well understood. First, the incoming information from the lateral geniculate bodies is rearranged so that most cells in the striate cortex respond to specifically oriented line segments, and, second, information originating from the two eyes converges upon single cells. The rearrangement and convergence do not take place immediately, however: in layer IVc, where the bulk of the afferents terminate, virtually all cells have fields with circular symmetry and are strictly monocular, driven from the left eye or from the right, but not both; at subsequent stages, in layers above and below IVc, most cells show orientation specificity, and about half are binocular. In a binocular cell the receptive fields in the two eyes are on corresponding regions in the two retinas and are identical in structure, but one eye is usually more effective than the other in influencing the cell; all shades of ocular dominance are seen. These two functions are strongly reflected in the architecture of the cortex, in that cells with common physiological properties are grouped together in vertically organized systems of columns. In an ocular dominance column all cells respond preferentially to the same eye. By four independent anatomical methods it has been shown that these columns have the form of vertically disposed alternating left-eye and right-eye slabs, which in horizontal section form alternating stripes about 400 \u03bcm thick, with occasional bifurcations and blind endings. Cells of like orientation specificity are known from physiological recordings to be similarly grouped in much narrower vertical sheeet-like aggregations, stacked in orderly sequences so that on traversing the cortex tangentially one normally encounters a succession of small shifts in orientation, clockwise or counterclockwise; a 1 mm traverse is usually accompanied by one or several full rotations through 180\u00b0, broken at times by reversals in direction of rotation and occasionally by large abrupt shifts. A full complement of columns, of either type, left-plus-right eye or a complete 180\u00b0 sequence, is termed a hypercolumn. Columns (and hence hypercolumns) have roughly the same width throughout the binocular part of the cortex. The two independent systems of hypercolumns are engrafted upon the well known topographic representation of the visual field. The receptive fields mapped in a vertical penetration through cortex show a scatter in position roughly equal to the average size of the fields themselves, and the area thus covered, the aggregate receptive field, increases with distance from the fovea. A parallel increase is seen in reciprocal magnification (the number of degrees of visual field corresponding to 1 mm of cortex). Over most or all of the striate cortex a movement of 1-2 mm, traversing several hypercolumns, is accompanied by a movement through the visual field about equal in size to the local aggregate receptive field. Thus any 1-2 mm block of cortex contains roughly the machinery needed to subserve an aggregate receptive field. In the cortex the fall-off in detail with which the visual field is analysed, as one moves out from the foveal area, is accompanied not by a reduction in thickness of layers, as is found in the retina, but by a reduction in the area of cortex (and hence the number of columnar units) devoted to a given amount of visual field: unlike the retina, the striate cortex is virtually uniform morphologically but varies in magnification. In most respects the above description fits the newborn monkey just as well as the adult, suggesting that area 17 is largely genetically programmed. The ocular dominance columns, however, are not fully developed at birth, since the geniculate terminals belonging to one eye occupy layer IVc throughout its length, segregating out into separate columns only after about the first 6 weeks, whether or not the animal has visual experience. If one eye is sutured closed during this early period the columns belonging to that eye become shrunken and their companions correspondingly expanded. This would seem to be at least in part the result of interference with normal maturation, though sprouting and retraction of axon terminals are not excluded."

For separations of less than 1.5 min, the addition of flanking lines facilitates bisection so that thresholds of less than 1 sec for discriminating the direction of offset could be reliably obtained. For larger separations an interval could be bisected to an accuracy of 1 part in 60. Experiments varying the length, luminance, and overlap of the lines suggest that different cues are used in these two regimes. A dual space-size analysis is presented that can account for these bisection thresholds over a wide range of experimental conditions. This quantitative analysis produces viewprints of the stimuli (analogous to the voiceprint of audition). Each viewprint shows the output of many spatial filters of different positions and sizes. A new filter shape is introduced that has advantages for modeling the visual system. The sensitivity of each filter is fixed by the contrast-response function. The analysis further shows that the limiting factors in spatial hyperacuity are both the contrast-response function and the spatial grain."

While convincing arguments can be provided in support of this approach, empirical evidence is presented demonstrating that, except possibly for the dc term, wide departures from Gaussian behavior can be expected for real-world imagery at typical block sizes. In this paper we describe the performance of a block cosine image coding system with an adaptive quantizer matched to the statistics of the transform coefficients. The adaptive quantizer is based upon a recently developed algorithm which employs a training sequence in the design procedure. At encoding rates of approximately 1 bit/pixel and above, this approach results in significant improvement in reconstructed image quality compared to fixed quantization schemes designed under the Gaussian assumption. For rates much below 1 bit/pixel the relative improvement is negligible."

It is postulated that perceptually significant features of the human face and hands, at which cartoon lines should be drawn in the image, occur wherever surfaces in object space are approximately tangential to the line of sight of the camera or viewer. The implications of this postulate are analyzed for smooth lambertian reflectors seen against a background of the same luminance factor; it is shown that the combined effects of surface gradient and illumination lead to the formation of luminance valleys at the significant features. An experimental comparison of several detectors is described which confirmed the advantage of valley-based detection for deriving economical but recognizable cartoons."

Teil B 12, 447 (1957)], is an opponent system of two mirror-image subunits. Each subunit receives inputs from two spatiotemporal filters (receptive fields), multiplies the filter outputs, and temporally integrates the product. Subunit outputs are algebraically subtracted to yield ERD output. ERD's can correctly indicate direction of motion of drifting sine waves of any spatial and temporal frequency. Here we prove that with a careful choice of either temporal or spatial filters, the subunits can themselves become quite similar or equivalent to the whole ERD; with suitably chosen filters, the ERD is equivalent to an elaborated version of a motion detector proposed by Watson and Ahumada [NASA Tech. Memo. 84352 (1983)]; and for every choice of filters, the ERD is fully equivalent to the detector proposed by Adelson and Bergen [J. Opt. Soc. Am. A 2, 284-299 (1985)]. Some equivalences between the motion detection (in x, t) by ERD's and spatial pattern detection (in x, y) are demonstrated. The responses of the ERD and its variants to drifting sinusoidal gratings, to other sinusoidally modulated stimuli (on-off gratings, counterphase flicker), and to combinations of sinusoids are derived and compared with data. ERD responses to two-frame motion displays are derived, and several new experimental predictions are tested experimentally.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

The functions are obtained from a series of subjective experiments and vary with the content of the picture. Visibility functions have been used to design quantizing characteristics for DPCM coding of monochrome and color signals and for three-dimensional transform coding. We consider an alternative approach to determining the visibility function that obviates the need for repeated picture-dependent subjective tests. The visibility function is assumed to consist of two parts, a picture-dependent component and viewer-dependent component (referred to as the masking function). The visibility function may be approximated by the quotient of a probability density function raised to a power and the masking function. The role of probability is found to be weaker where the viewer has more opportunity to scrutinize the picture."

                "text": "Staining for the mitochondrial enzyme cytochrome oxidase reveals an array of dense regions (blobs) in the primate primary visual cortex. They are most obvious in the upper layers, 2 and 3, but can also be seen in layers 4B, 5, and 6, in register with the blobs in layers 2 and 3. We compared cells inside and outside blobs in macaque and squirrel monkeys, looking at their physiological responses and anatomical connections. Cells within blobs did not show orientation selectivity, whereas cells between blobs were highly orientation selective. Receptive fields of blob cells had circular symmetry and were of three main types, Broad-Band Center-Surround, Red-Green Double-Opponent, and Yellow-Blue Double-Opponent. Double-Opponent cells responded poorly or not at all to white light in any form, or to diffuse light at any wavelength. In contrast to blob cells, none of the cells recorded in layer 4C beta were Double-Opponent: like the majority of cells in the parvocellular geniculate layers, they were either Broad-Band or Color- Opponent Center-Surround, e.g., red-on-center green-off-surround. To our surprise cells in layer 4C alpha were orientation selective. In tangential penetrations throughout layers 2 and 3, optium orientation, when plotted against electrode position, formed long, regular, usually linear sequences, which were interrupted but not perturbed by the blobs. Staining area 18 for cytochrome oxidase reveals a series of alternating wide and narrow dense stripes, separated by paler interstripes. After small injections of horseradish peroxidase into area 18, we saw a precise set of connections from the blobs in area 17 to thin stripes in area 18, and from the interblob regions in area 17 to interstripes in area 18. Specific reciprocal connections also ran from thin stripes to blobs and from interstripes to interblobs. We have not yet determined the area 17 connections to thick stripes in area 18. In addition, within area 18 there are stripe-to-stripe and interstripe- to-interstripe intrinsic connections. These results suggest that a system involved in the processing of color information, especially color-spatial interactions, runs parallel to and separate from the orientation-specific system. Color, encoded in three coordinates by the major blob cell types, red-green, yellow-blue, and black-white, can be transformed into the three coordinates, red, green, and blue, of the Retinex algorithm of Land."

The stimuli were spatially localized test patterns of 1.0 octave bandwidth superimposed upon cosine grating masks. By using a model that corrects for the nonlinearity inherent in the masking process, we obtain the half-amplitude half-bandwidths (theta 1/2) of Cartesian-separable receptive fields that may underlie orientation selectivity. Additional experiments show that the data are not compatible with separability in polar coordinates (spatial frequency and orientation). The orientation half-bandwidths have been found to decrease somewhat with increasing spatial frequency, going from about 30 degrees at 0.5 cpd to 15 degrees at 11.3 cpd, for both sustained and transient forms of temporal modulation. Similar bandwidths are obtained from data where the test is oriented along 45 degrees. These bandwidth estimates are shown to be consistent with subthreshold summation data as well as physiological data from monkey striate cortex."

A two-alternative forced-choice procedure was used to measure contrast thresholds for 2.0 cpd sine-wave gratings in the presence of masking sine-wave gratings. Thresholds were measured for 11 masker contrasts spanning three log units, and seven masker frequencies ranging +/- one octave from the signal frequency. Corresponding measurements were made for gratings with horizontal widths of 0.75 degrees (narrow fields) and 6.0 degrees (wide fields). For high contrast maskers at all frequencies, signal thresholds were related to masking contrast by power functions with exponents near 0.6. For a range of low masking contrasts, signal thresholds were reduced by the masker. For the wide fields, high contrast masking tuning functions peaked at the signal frequency, were slightly asymmetric, and had approximately invariant half-maximum frequencies that lie 3/4 octave below and 1 octave above the signal frequency. The corresponding low contrast tuning functions exhibited peak threshold reduction at the signal frequency, with half-minimum frequencies at roughly +/- 0.25 octaves. For the narrow fields, the masking tuning functions were much broader at both low and high masking contrasts. A masking model is presented that encompasses contrast detection, discrimination, and masking phenomena. Central constructs of the model include a linear spatial frequency filter, a nonlinear transducer, and a process of spatial pooling that acts at low contrasts only."

Motion sinformation can be extracted by a system that responds to the oriented spatiotemporal energy. We discuss a class of models for human motion mechanisms in which the first stage consists of linear filters that are oriented in space-time and tuned in spatial frequency. The outputs of quadrature pairs of such filters are squared and summed to give a measure of motion energy. These responses are then fed into an opponent stage. Energy models can be built from elements that are consistent with known physiology and psychophysics, and they permit a qualitative understanding of a variety of motion phenomena."

The DOLP is a reversible transform which converts an image into a set of bandpass images. A DOLP transform is shown to require O(N2) multiplies and produce O(N log(N)) samples from an N sample image. When Gaussian low-pass filters are used, the result is a set of images which have been convolved with difference of Gaussian (DOG) filters from an exponential set of sizes. A fast computation technique based on ``resampling'' is described and shown to reduce the DOLP transform complexity to O(N log(N)) multiplies and O(N) storage locations. A second technique, ``cascaded convolution with expansion,'' is then defined and also shown to reduce the computational cost to O(N log(N)) multiplies. Combining these two techniques yields an algorithm for a DOLP transform that requires O(N) storage cells and requires O(N) multiplies."

Other models of RF shape would predict a greater independence between orientation and spatial-frequency tuning. We have examined this by recording the responses of cat striate-cortex cells to a wide range of different spatial-frequency and orientation combinations. In almost all cells studied, peak orientation did not consistently vary with spatial frequency, but the majority of cells showed some change in peak spatial-frequency tuning with orientation. The amount of change in peak spatial frequency tended to be greater for cells that were narrowly tuned for orientation. However, cells narrowly (and also very broadly) tuned for spatial frequency tended to show considerable independence of spatial-frequency and orientation tuning, and in all but a few cells the degree of change was less than predicted by the classic RF model. Such cells were found to fire only to patterns whose local spatial spectra fell within a compact, restricted, roughly circular two-dimensional spatial-frequency region. We conclude that the two-dimensional RF shape of striate cells more closely approximates that predicted by a two-dimensional Gabor model or by a Gaussian-derivative model than it does the classic shape based on the output of geniculate cells with aligned RF's."

The arrangement of the columns is highly ordered; in the great majority of oblique or tangential microelectrode penetrations the preferred orientations of cells changed systematically with electrode position, in a clockwise or counterclockwise direction. Graphs of orientation vs. electrode track distance were virtually straight lines over distances of up to several millimeters; such orderly sequences were often terminated by sudden changes in the direction of orientation shifts, from clockwise to counterclockwise or back. The orientations at which these reversals occurred were quite unpredictable. Total rotations of 180\u2013360\u00b0 were frequently seen between reversals. In tangential or almost tangential penetrations orientation shifts occurred almost every time the electrode was moved forward, indicating that the columns were either not discrete or had a thickness of less than 25\u201350 \u03bc, the smallest order of distance that our methods could resolve. In penetrations that were almost perpendicular to the surface, the graphs of orientation vs. track distance were relatively flatter, as expected if the surfaces of constant orientation are perpendicular to the cortical surface. Stepwise changes in orientation of about 10\u00b0 could sometimes be seen in perpendicular penetrations, each orientation persisting through several clear advances of the electrode, suggesting a set of discrete columnar subdivisions. The possibility of some kind of continuous variation in orientation with horizontal distance along the cortex was not, however, completely ruled out. Occasionally a highly ordered sequence was broken by an abrupt large shift in orientation of up to 90\u00b0. Shifts in ocular dominance occurred roughly every 0.25\u20130.5 mm and were independent of orientation shifts. In multiple parallel penetrations spaced closer than about 250 \u03bc the slopes of the orientation vs. track distance curves were almost the same; reconstruction of these penetrations indicated that the regions of constant orientation are parallel sheets. On crossing perpendicular to these sheets, a total orientation shift of 180\u00b0 took place over a distance of 0.5\u20131.0 mm. Column thickness, size of shifts in orientation, and the rate of change of orientation with distance along the cortex seemed to be independent of eccentricity, at least between 2\u00b0 and 15\u00b0 from the fovea. A few penetrations made in area 17 of the cat and in area 18 of the monkey showed similar orderly sequences of receptive\u2010field orientation shifts."

The distortion is defined as the expected value of some function of the error between the input and the output of the quantizer. Equations are derived for the parameters of a quantizer with minimum distortion. The equations are not soluble without recourse to numerical methods, so an algorithm is developed to simplify their numerical solution. The case of an input signal with normally distributed amplitude and an expected squared error distortion measure is explicitly computed and values of the optimum quantizer parameters are tabulated. The optimization of a quantizer subject to the restriction that both input and output levels be equally spaced is also treated, and appropriate parameters are tabulated for the same case as above."

Noise added to a picture tends to be least noticeable in regions where the brightness changes rapidly, but the relationship between visibility-of-noise and slope-of-the signal is dependent on the scene being displayed. Measurements are presented for four different scenes, and these data are used to design companding laws that minimize the visibility of noise from Differential Quantizers. The designs agree with those that have been satisfactory in practical applications."
